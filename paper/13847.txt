                                              ABSTRACT

The question of whether giving birth as a teenager has negative economic consequences for the mother
remains controversial despite substantial research. In this paper, we build upon existing literature,
especially the literature that uses the experience of teenagers who had a miscarriage as the appropriate
comparison group. We show that miscarriages are not random events, but rather are likely correlated
with (unobserved) community-level factors, casting some doubt on previous findings. Including community-level
fixed effects in our specifications lead to important changes in our estimates. By making use of information
on the timing of miscarriages as well as birth control choices preceding the teenage pregnancies we
construct more relevant control groups for teenage mothers. We find evidence that teenage childbearing
likely reduces the probability of receiving a high school diploma by 5 to 10 percentage points, reduces
annual income as a young adult by $1,000 to $2,400, and may increase the probability of receiving
cash assistance and decrease years of schooling.

Introduction

       The issue of the economic consequences of teenage childbearing for young

women has been the subject of a great deal of debate. Early estimates suggested large

consequences in terms of reduced schooling, increased take-up of cash assistance, and

lower earnings (see below). Subsequent studies, however, provide evidence that these

consequences, if they exist at all, are small. The “explanation” offered is that the

adolescents who give birth as teens would have a life trajectory of limited education and

earnings even if they had not given birth as a teen. To correctly answer the question of

the consequences of teenage childbearing, one requires an accurate measure of the

counterfactual—what would have happened to the young woman had she not given birth

as a teen. This is difficult, as we observe each individual in only one situation, either as a

person who gave birth as a teen or one who did not. Recent studies employ an

instrumental variable approach making use of a group of adolescents who, though

pregnant as teens, did not give birth. These studies focus especially on teens who

miscarried in an attempt to obtain improved estimates (see for example Hotz, McElroy,

Sanders 2005). Still others use propensity score matching in an attempt to create an

appropriate comparison group (for example, Lee 2007).

       In this paper we make use of a rich data set on a group of young women and

estimate both OLS and instrumental variables models employing alternative comparison

groups, in an attempt to more accurately measure the counterfactual. Our contribution is

to add measures of the social environment of the teen and the use of timing of

miscarriages/stillbirths to address the determinants of outcomes of teen pregnancy and to

obtain more accurate estimates of the effect of giving birth as a teen on subsequent




                                                                                             1
outcomes. We find evidence that having a child as a teenager likely reduces the

probability of receiving a high school diploma by 5 to 10 percentage points and reduces

income as a young adult by $1,000 to $3,000 in the year of the survey. We find some

suggestive evidence that teenage childbearing increases the probability of receiving cash

assistance and slightly decreases years of schooling. Our results also suggest the

difficulty of estimating the causal effects of teenage childbearing due to the challenge of

constructing a relevant control group as well as the need to control for community-level

factors that likely are associated with having a pregnancy, the birth outcome of the

pregnancy, and early adult labor market and human capital outcomes.



Background

         The initial or simple approach to estimating the consequences of teenage

childbearing on the mother uses a straightforward OLS regression specification with

some controls for background information to estimate the impact. Studies that use this

approach typically find the consequences of teenage childbearing to be large and

significant. For example, Moore and Waite (1977) find that teenage mothers complete 1

to 4 fewer years of school than other women by age 24. A second generation of studies

attempts to account for the choice of timing of births and find considerably less tie

between giving birth as a teen and subsequent schooling.1 A third generation of studies

uses an instrumental variable approach to compare outcomes and generally find no

negative effect of giving birth as a teen on level of schooling or a counterintuitive

positive influence (Hotz et al. 2005) (henceforth HMS). The unique or clever insight of

1
 See Ribar 1994 for a review of this literature. A related literature on the determinants of teen births also
provides evidence that those who give birth are a self-selected group. See, for example, Wolfe, Haveman,
Pence, & Schwabish 2007.


                                                                                                                2
HMS is to compare those who gave birth as teens to those who miscarry, a group who

presumably would have carried to term if able to do so. Those who miscarry thus are

used as the counterfactual.2

         Ashcraft and Lang (2006) (henceforth AL) go a step further than previous third-

generation papers in that they recognize that some of those who miscarry would have had

an abortion had they not miscarried. As such, they should not serve as appropriate

models for the “counterfactual.” AL present evidence that many miscarriages are earlier

than abortions, which suggests that assuming that individuals who miscarry are a valid

counterfactual group for those who give birth is problematic. They then use an

instrumental variable approach to narrow the possible range of effects--first assuming all

miscarriages occur before abortion decisions and then assuming all abortions occur

before miscarriages. Finally, AL use standard OLS and IV specifications but alternate

between several comparison groups to further narrow the bounds of the estimates.3 They

find a small but negative effect of giving birth as a teen on subsequent schooling,

especially on obtaining a GED. Their results that assume all abortions occur before

miscarriages are similar to those of HMS for years of schooling.

         We build on the work of AL and all the others who came before us using

miscarriage as an instrument. However, we test for the sensitivity of whether some
2
  The small number of teenagers (69 individuals) who report a miscarriage and the accuracy of reports of
abortions, miscarriages, and pregnancies in the NLSY data are two critiques of this approach. See Hoffman
2003 for others.

  AL’s first use all individuals who became pregnant but did not give birth as the comparison group
(including miscarriages and abortions). This estimate for childbearing should provide the upper bound on
the negative effects of teen childbearing since those who had an abortion self-select out of bearing a child
as a teen. AL next present results where only individuals who miscarried serve as the comparison group.
Since the miscarriage group comprises individuals who would have carried the birth to term and those who
would have received an abortion, the results are still expected to be biased toward finding negative effects
of teenage childbearing but less so than the first comparison. Finally, AL estimate IV specifications that
are expected to be biased toward finding positive effects. The range of estimates across specifications AL
present (OLS for the upper bound on negative effects and IV specifications for the lower bound) should
bound the true effect.


                                                                                                           3
teenagers who have a miscarriage would have had an abortion. We do so making use of

our data on the timing of the termination of a pregnancy (by abortion or miscarriage).

We also add information on the environment in which these pregnancy outcomes occur to

this analysis. Specifically, we use several measures of the teenager’s environment,

including the pregnancy outcomes of other teenagers in her community, measures of

community disadvantage, and state laws affecting access to abortion. In order to clarify

the influence of giving birth as a teen on her subsequent well-being we include a broad

set of human capital outcome measures including three indicators of schooling, earnings,

receipt of welfare and income. Finally, we make use of our information on whether the

adolescent was practicing birth control at the time of the fertilization as a measure of

whether or not she actively sought to prevent the pregnancy.



Data

       The data we use in our analysis are from the restricted version of the National

Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). We use only young women who

were pregnant as an adolescent in our analysis. There are 4,943 pregnancies reported by

women in our sample by Wave III of data collection (when the respondents were on

average 22 years old). We limit our analysis sample by focusing on first pregnancies

(leaving 3,633 pregnancies) and on pregnancies that ended before age 18 years and 9

months (leaving 1,089 observations). We then exclude 18 women who report still being

in high school, 15 women who gave birth to only one twin and 2 women whose

pregnancy had not ended at the time of the interview, leaving 1,054 observations. We

combine reported miscarriages and still-births into one category—“miscarriages.”




                                                                                           4
Omitting those with missing community-level data leave us a sample of approximately

1,000 though this varies slightly by outcome. We impute data for parental education and

family income for nearly 300 individuals and include a dummy variable for individuals

with missing data. For community-level variables, we include state-level information on

abortion laws and funding levels (merged from data reported in the 1995 version of the

National Abortion Rights Action League (NARAL) publication “Who Decides? A State-

by-State Review of Abortion Rights.”) and Census information on the proportion of

individuals in poverty as well as other measures, including the education level of census

tract ‘neighbors’, that was merged from the Summary Tape File of the 1990 Census of

Population and Housing. In addition, we construct measures of the proportion of all

pregnancies in the each community that are resolved as live births, miscarriages, and

abortions (excluding the individual from the calculation). These proportions attempt to

measure unobserved community-level factors that increase the likelihood of each

pregnancy outcome.

       The adolescents who serve as our controls or counterfactuals are those who report

a miscarriage while a teen. Our primary analysis focuses on this group. However, a

number of these adolescents might have chosen to have an abortion had they not had a

miscarriage. Hence, we also conduct an analysis in which only those who had a “late”

miscarriage serve as the control group. This reduces the possible bias on comparing

those who gave birth to those who would have terminated their pregnancy in the absence

of a miscarriage. As noted by AL and confirmed in our own analysis, teens who

terminate their pregnancy through an abortion tend to come from higher SES families.

Hence, including them as controls in the miscarriage group would likely bias the results




                                                                                            5
on the consequences of giving birth as a teen toward an underestimate of the “true”

effect. By using both of these two comparison or control groups, we believe we narrow

the range of estimates of the effect of giving birth while a teen on SES outcomes as

young adults.

       Table 1 provides basic summary statistics for our sample. Conforming with other

national data sets, pregnancies end in live births, abortions, and miscarriages (or

stillbirths) for 59%, 25%, and 16% of our sample, respectively. Since potential biases in

self-reports of pregnancy outcomes have been raised in previous work (for example, Hotz

et al. 2005), two differences in the Add Health data are worth noting. First, respondents

in the Add Health survey used computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI) technology,

where sensitive questions were answered using a laptop rather than verbally indicated to

the interviewer. This feature of the survey design is in contrast with other surveys for

which biases in self-reported pregnancy outcomes have been shown (for example, the

National Survey of Family Growth, National Longitudinal Study of Youth). Second, the

self-reported pregnancy outcomes in Add Health match more closely with official Vital

Statistics than other datasets. For example, 25% of first pregnancies are reported to end

in abortion and 16% end in miscarriage, compared with (only) 18% and 7%, respectively,

in Hotz et al. (2005).

       Of the women in our sample (who have all experienced a teen pregnancy), 68%

receive a high school diploma and 13% receive a GED. Thirteen percent receive cash

assistance as a young adult and 40% report using birth control before their pregnancy.

       Table 2 stratifies the summary statistics by each of the pregnancy outcomes and

also by the timing of miscarriages into “early” and “late,” which is categorized based on




                                                                                            6
eight weeks, the modal timing of a miscarriage in our data (full summary statistics can be

found in appendix tables 1A-5A). The raw means suggest that even conditional on this

sample of women who experienced a teen pregnancy; those who elected to have an

abortion were more advantaged than those who had a miscarriage or live birth. Women

who had an abortion scored higher on an achievement test (Peabody Picture Vocabulary

Test), were from families with higher incomes, had more educated parents, and lived in

communities with lower poverty rates than women who miscarried or had a live birth.

       When we divide the sample of miscarriages between early and late miscarriages,

there is evidence that some individuals who had an early miscarriage may have had an

abortion rather than a live birth. While these two groups have very similar demographics,

the individuals who experienced an early miscarriage were more likely to have used birth

control prior to getting pregnant. On the other hand, individuals who experienced a late

miscarriage are slightly more advantaged, as measured by several family background

variables.



Methodology

       Our interest is in identifying the true effect of giving birth as a teen on outcomes

as a young adult. That is, we wish to estimate

       Y=α+βB+µ                                                                (1)

where Y is the outcome of interest such as years of schooling or earnings as a young

adult, B is an indicator of giving birth as a teen, and β is the coefficient of interest. The

“core problem” is that those who give birth may differ in systematic ways from those




                                                                                                7
who do not and these systematic differences are also likely to determine the outcome.

The β estimated this way would overestimate the true influence of giving birth on Y.

       The simplest way to handle this is to add other control variables to the equation.

These might include background factors such as the SES of the family in which the teen

was raised, race/ethnicity, and perhaps some community variables. Equation 1 then

becomes:

       Y=α+βB+θX+µ                                                           (2)

where X is the vector of additional control variables.

       However, this still leaves unobserved factors that may influence those who

become pregnant, those who choose to give birth, and the outcome. That is, this

estimation strategy may still not accurately allow the researcher to identify β.

       Our approach is to limit the sample only to those who became pregnant as a teen,

thus identifying the influence of the birth only over those who are “similar” in that they

shared the experience of being pregnant by age 18. This eliminates a good deal of the

unobserved differences between treatment and control groups. Furthermore, we limit the

comparison to those who “chose” not to voluntarily terminate the pregnancy, that is, we

compare those who gave birth to those who had a miscarriage. Since some of those who

had a miscarriage might have chosen to have an abortion and thus would systematically

differ from those who gave birth, we make two alternative assumptions and thus provide

a narrow range for our estimate of β: (1) all those who had a miscarriage or stillbirth

would not have chosen an abortion and (2) all those who had a late miscarriage would not

have chosen to have an abortion. In the latter case, we avoid making an assumption of

those who had a miscarriage early by omitting them from the comparison group.




                                                                                             8
       Finally we make use of the school-based design of our dataset by adding

community fixed effects to the analyses. This is based on from 60 to 75 communities

with an average of 5 to 10 observations per community. We first provide evidence that

community-level factors are associated with the probability of having a miscarriage.

Thus, previous results found in the literature that use miscarriage as an instrument are

likely biased. We then show that controlling for community fixed effects changes the

results in both the OLS and IV specifications of outcomes of teen childbearing in

important ways.



Estimation Results

Determinants of Pregnancy Outcomes

       Since previous researchers have argued that miscarriages can be considered

(conditionally) random, we examine this assumption using our data. In Table 3, we first

estimate the determinants of the outcome of each teen pregnancy using the full sample of

teens who were pregnant employing multinomial logistic regression. The three possible

outcomes are give birth, abortion, or miscarriage (omitted category). The results indicate

that the choice of abortion is not random but indeed is made by those from more

advantaged backgrounds. For example, those who have an abortion tend to have higher

Peabody Picture Vocabulary test scores, reside in communities with lower poverty levels,

and have parents with more education compared to those who give birth, findings that are

consistent with those of An, Haveman, and Wolfe (1993). If they live in a state with

public funding for abortions, they are also more likely to have an abortion. Consistent

with the literature (see, for example, Coleman 2006), blacks are less likely to have a




                                                                                           9
miscarriage (though this estimate is not statistically significant) than are adolescents who

are white or Hispanic. Like AL, we find evidence that smoking during pregnancy

increases the risk of miscarriage in our data, and find that drinking and drug use also

appear to predict birth outcomes. Comparing the probability of miscarriages to live

births, we find that the proportion of miscarriages in the community is negatively

associated with an individual’s probability of giving birth or of having an abortion.

These results suggest that there could be unmeasured community-level factors that

influence the probability of miscarriage, so that the assumption that miscarriages are

conditionally random is likely not valid without controlling for community-level factors.

In our analysis of the effects of teenage childbearing on life outcomes, we present results

that use community-level fixed effects.



The Effects of Teenage Childbearing on Adult Outcomes

       We now estimate the effects of teenage childbearing on education and labor

market outcomes using several alternative specifications and samples. In Table 4, we

present results using OLS and 2SLS techniques. As noted in AL, controlling for

characteristics (for example, race, parental education) that are correlated with both the

outcomes of interest as well as birth outcomes could easily worsen or change the sign of

the bias in our estimating equations; therefore we follow AL and only control for factors

that have been cited in the medical or economics literature as being risk factors for

miscarriage, including whether the pregnancy occurred before age 15 and whether the




                                                                                            10
teenager smoke, drank alcohol, or used drugs during the pregnancy (for example , Garcia-

Enguidanos et al. 2002; Ashcraft and Lang 2006; Hotz et al. 2005).4

         First, in columns 1 and 2, we follow the “second-generation” papers outlined

above and compare the outcomes of young women who gave birth with young women

who did not give birth (but had teenage pregnancies). Column 2 adds community-level

fixed effects to the specifications of column 1. Comparing across these two columns,

community-level fixed effects estimates show a decrease in the estimated effects of

teenage childbearing by 10 to 20% (with the exceptions of GED and total income).

Column 2 shows that teenage childbearing is negatively associated with receipt of a high

school diploma (16 percentage points), years of education (0.8 years), household income

($2,700), and labor income ($2,500) at Wave 3. Teenage childbearing appears to

increase the likelihood of welfare receipt by 8.5 percentage points and has no discernable

relationship with GED receipt. However, as other researchers have suggested,

specifications like those in columns 1 and 2 are biased toward finding negative effects of

teenage childbearing because we are comparing disadvantaged mothers with more

advantaged women, although here only with those who were also pregnant as teenagers

and lived in the same communities. Finally, in column 2 below the coefficient, standard

errors and number of observations we present p-values from F-tests of the joint

hypothesis that the coefficients on our community fixed effects are equal to zero and a

Hausman test that compares our coefficients across specifications with and without

 Tobacco (in particular, nicotine) is thought to produce vascular spasms, resulting in placental pathology
(Brent & Beckmann 1994). For alcohol, while there is some mixed evidence relating moderate alcohol
consumption to miscarriage, Abel (1997) showed that high blood alcohol levels could directly provoke
miscarriage. Finally, while marijuana use has not been conclusively tied to miscarriage, cocaine use and
heroin use are less controversial determinants of miscarriage (for example, Chasnoff, Burns, Schnoll, &
Burns 1985).


                                                                                                         11
community fixed effects. For all three education outcomes and welfare receipt our

community level fixed effects are jointly statistically significant at the 5% level; for

wages at the 7% level. Our Hausman tests show evidence of statistically different

coefficient estimates for high school diploma and years of schooling, but in other cases,

the coefficients are similar. Since these results suggest strong but not overwhelming

support for the value of our community fixed effects strategy we present our estimates

including and excluding community fixed effects in our following tables.

       Columns 3 and 4 in Table 4 show results for two-stage least square specifications,

where we follow HMS and AL and use miscarriage as an instrument for live births. AL

shows that these specifications should be biased toward finding beneficial effects of

teenage childbearing. Indeed, our results suggest that there is no statistically significant

relationship between teenage childbearing and any of the education and labor outcomes

we examine. Importantly, though, several results suggest that our bounds of the true

effect (where columns 1 and 2 provide the upper bound and columns 3 and 4 provide the

lower bound) are relatively tight.

       Columns 5 and 6 show results that use OLS to estimate the relationship between

teenage childbearing and our set of outcomes, but constrain the control group to comprise

only individuals who experienced a miscarriage (rather than combining miscarriage and

abortion). This is one of our preferred specifications. As expected, the magnitudes of the

coefficients change considerably (most by more than 20%) when constraining the control

group to miscarriages (column 1 versus column 5). Further, the results in column 6

suggest that including community fixed effects also considerably changes the basic

results. In particular, we estimate much lower effects of teen childbearing on welfare




                                                                                           12
receipt (11 versus 3 percentage points) and years of schooling (0.5 years versus 0.12

years) after adjusting the birth/miscarriage estimates for community fixed effects. In

contrast, the relationships between teenage childbearing and wages, income, and high

school completion are relatively stable after controlling for community fixed effects,

suggesting a small decrease in the probability of high school completion (-0.09) and

lower income and earnings of $2,700 and $2,400 annually, respectively (the latter are not

statistically significant at standard levels). Finally, in columns 7 and 8, we use “late”

miscarriages as our comparison group, which we define as a miscarriage after 8 weeks—

the modal length of pregnancies ending in miscarriage in our data. We perform this

analysis in a further attempt to compare pregnant women who would have given birth

(had they not experienced a miscarriage) with women who completed their pregnancies.

As noted above, using all women who miscarry as the comparison may include some

women who would have had an abortion had they not experienced an ‘early’ miscarriage.

Once again the results for the relationship between teen childbearing and wages and

income are quite consistent with the earlier ones and suggest a substantial reduction in

both tied to teen childbearing. In this case, the estimates controlling for community

characteristics (FE) exceed those that do not and suggest a reduction of $2,800 in wages

and nearly $3,000 in family income. None of the other results are statistically significant

although the point estimates suggest a very modest reduction in the probability of

obtaining a high school degree.



Robustness Checks




                                                                                            13
        To further examine the robustness of our results, we examine specifications that

stratify our results based on birth control choices predating the pregnancy. In Table 5, we

re-estimate our previous table using first the entire miscarriage group (columns 1 and 2)

and then those with only a late miscarriage (columns 3 and 4) as our control group.

        Here our focus is on whether those who used birth control, and thus would appear

to wish to prevent a pregnancy, are different in terms of future consequences.5 Thus we

stratify our results by use of birth control prior to pregnancy to compare results for

women who were actively attempting to prevent pregnancy and those who were not (see

Table 6 and Table 6A for full results and a comparison based on birth control use).6 Like

Table 4, our results seem to be most robust for the outcomes of income and wages for

those who used birth control but are much weaker for those who did not. Thus these

results suggest a larger negative influence on wages and family income for those teens

who had been using birth control prior to becoming pregnant compared to all teens that

gave birth. This is the case even though the number of observations is considerably

smaller than for the entire group of teens. Furthermore the estimated influence is

somewhat reduced when we use community controls via FE but still suggest a reduction

in excess of $3,000 for total income and nearly $3,500 for wages. We find small and

imprecisely measured effects on years of schooling and negligible effects on welfare

receipt. This estimation then suggests that those who use birth control have an idea that

they will face substantial negative consequences should they become pregnant and carry

5
  Teenage girls who use birth control might be thought of as having a joint preference for being sexually
active but wishing to avoid becoming pregnant. This fits with the idea of rational choice. For other
evidence on rational choice of teens, see, for example, Wolfe, Haveman, Pence, & Schwabish (2007) and
Haveman, Wolfe, & Wilson (2001).

  While we report these results using whether or not the individual reports using birth control, we do not
emphasize them as some of the samples are quite small. We are also hesitant as those who do not use birth
control may be quite heterogeneous including teens who wished to become pregnant with those who did
not plan to be sexually active.


                                                                                                       14
the pregnancy to term. These consequences appear most significant for wages and

income.

        We also ran a similar set of regressions on those teens who gave birth as a teen

and did not marry within a year of giving birth. In this we exclude those who married

and thus might be expected to have more positive outcomes or to have been more likely

to adjust to the birth of the child. For these results we include 848 of the 936 who are in

the larger set. These results (shown in appendix Table 7A) suggest a similar pattern to

those of the overall group, although the coefficients are somewhat smaller than for the

larger group of women. For example, the coefficient using FE is -2,282 for total income

and -1,740 for wages for those who did not marry within a year compared to -2,710 and -

2,375, respectively, for the larger sample. We also ran results that control only for age

and whether the pregnancy began before age 15 so that several endogenous health

behaviors (smoking, drinking, and drug use during pregnancy) are excluded. We found

that the main results do not substantially differ with our preferred set of results in Table

7. (See appendix Table 8A for full results).

        Finally, we attempted to explore the community determinants of our labor and

education outcomes that might underlie the important differences we find when using our

FE approach. Here we include variables such as the poverty rate, crime rates, education

level of the community, community income, ratio of young adult females to males in the

community, and other variables shown in our tables. Results are presented in Table 9A

in the appendix. While as a set these community variables are generally statistically

significant (the exception is for welfare receipt) they do little to truly explain what it is

about a particular community that seems to influence the education, labor force, and




                                                                                                15
income outcomes of teen mothers. Our community fixed effects results generally show

that there are important community factors at work in influencing such outcomes and that

excluding them from the analysis may well lead to biased results. Unfortunately, we

have not been able to identify what it is about these communities that seems to matter.



Conclusion

       In this paper, we build on previous research to examine the short-term human

capital and labor force consequences of teenage childbearing. We advance the literature

in several ways. First, we show that previous 2SLS estimates using miscarriages as the

instrument are likely biased. In particular, we present evidence that unobserved

community-level characteristics are correlated with the probability of experiencing a

miscarriage, which suggests the importance of including community fixed effects when

estimating the consequences of teenage childbearing. In fact, we show that controlling

for community fixed effects in several cases substantially changes our estimates. Second,

we use the information on the timing of miscarriage as well as reports of birth control use

prior to pregnancy to create relevant control groups for the women who have children

while teenagers. Our most reliable estimates (see column 6 in Tables 4 and 5) provide

some evidence that giving birth as a teen is associated with a decline in the probability of

graduating from high school (-0.08) and a reduction in income and total wages of $2,200

to $2,400.

       Our results indicate the difficulty of estimating the causal effects of teenage

childbearing in many datasets that do not allow the use of community fixed effects and/or

have sufficient information from which to construct the relevant control groups. Using




                                                                                          16
our rich dataset, we are able to provide relatively tight estimates of bounds of the causal

effect of teenage childbearing on human capital and labor force outcomes. We find

consistent evidence that teenage childbearing likely lowers the probability of receiving a

high school diploma by a small amount but more significantly decreases household

income and labor income of women in their early twenties. Our final table, Table 7,

brings together our results. In Table 7, we provide a clear comparison of second-

generation estimates, third-generation estimates, and our preferred estimates that use

community fixed effects as well as information on the timing of miscarriage. We show

that in many cases, our preferred specifications substantially narrow the bounds on the

estimates of the effects of teenage childbearing. For example, in the case of receiving a

high school diploma, second-generation methods produce an estimate of -0.18 ( a lower

bound) compared with third-generation methods of 0.048, which have been shown to be

an upper bound estimate (AL). In contrast, our preferred lower-bound estimate that

assumes that all miscarriages would have not have been abortions produces an estimate

of -0.09, and our preferred upper-bound estimate that assumes that only late miscarriages

would have not been abortions produces an estimate of -0.08—a very tight bound. Our

results for years of completed education and welfare receipt show similar tightening of

the bounds of the estimated effect of teenage childbearing, while our results for total

income and labor income are quite similar to results produced from second- and third-

generation methods. In the case of wages, our preferred results have a narrow range of -

$2,700 to -$2,950, which are actually greater than those of the birth / no birth comparison

shown in column 1. In the case of total income, our preferred results suggest a reduction




                                                                                          17
of approximately $2,400 to $2,800, which are somewhat below the first column estimate

of $3,500.

       Overall, our results using this uniquely rich data set on teens and their

communities suggest large reductions in wages and income and a modest reduction in the

probability of graduating high school. Perhaps surprisingly, our results suggest no real

influence of teen childbearing on years of schooling, welfare receipt, or obtaining a GED.

Our results, which use community-level fixed effects and a comparison either to all those

who had a miscarriage or only to those who suffered a late miscarriage, provide a

relatively narrow range of predictions of the influence of teen childbearing on outcomes

as a young adult. They also highlight the importance of comparing those who gave birth

to those who are otherwise similar and of including community or neighborhood factors

in order to more accurately estimate the young-adult consequences of teen childbearing.
