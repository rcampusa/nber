                                                ABSTRACT

Public-place smoking restrictions are the most important non-price tobacco control measures worldwide,
yet surprisingly little is known about their effects on exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS).
We study these laws in Canada using data with questions about respondents’ ETS exposure in public
and private places. In fixed-effects models we find these laws had no effects on smoking but induced
large and statistically significant reductions in public-place ETS exposure, especially in bars and restaurants.
We do not find significant evidence of ETS displacement to private homes. Our results indicate wide
latitude for health improvements from banning smoking in public places.

        Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) is estimated to kill 600,000 people worldwide each

year through increased heart disease, respiratory ailments, asthma, and lung cancer (Mattias

Oberg et al. 2011).1 Reducing population exposure to ETS is a key public health priority of

many governments, and increasingly cites and countries have been adopting clean indoor air

policies that restrict or completely prohibit smoking in a variety of public places such as

restaurants and bars (EPHA 2010). Indeed, research based on a recent World Bank report

informed by a panel of tobacco control experts in World Health Organization member countries

ranks public-place smoking restrictions as the most important non-price policy to reduce death

and disease caused by tobacco use, ahead of advertising bans, information campaigns, warning

labels, and quit-assistance for current smokers (Luk Joossens and Martin Raw 2006).

        Several peer-reviewed public health and medical studies link public-place smoking bans

to reductions in acute myocardial infarctions (AMI) (i.e., heart attacks), and a 2009 report by the

Institute of Medicine (IOM) finds the evidence is sufficient to conclude that smoking bans—

including those that apply to public places such as bars and restaurants—have causal effects at

reducing AMI.2 According to the IOM report, even brief exposure to environmental tobacco

smoke (ETS) can physiologically trigger AMI, making it plausible that public-place smoking

bans could reduce AMI through reducing exposure to ETS.3 If true, the conclusions of the IOM




1
  As a point of comparison, active tobacco use is estimated to be responsible for 5.1 million deaths per year
worldwide (Oberg et al. 2011). Throughout, we refer to environmental tobacco smoke or ETS. Depending on the
setting and context, this is also sometimes referred to as second-hand smoke or SHS.
2
  Not all research has reached the same conclusion, however. Kanaka D. Shetty et al. (2011), for example, find that
evidence for a relationship between smoking bans and AMI in the US is sensitive to choice of cities and
specification.
3
  The scientific basis for this relationship is summarized in the most recent Surgeon General’s report on smoking, in
which it is stated that “[f]or cardiovascular disease, the immediate effects of even short exposures to secondhand
smoke on some functions of the circulatory system appear to be as large as those seen in association with active
smoking of one pack of cigarettes per day” (USDHHS 2010).

report suggest wide latitude for public health improvements for many jurisdictions in the US and

elsewhere that have not yet banned smoking in public places.4

        Notably, however, we know very little about whether, how, and to what extent public-

place smoking laws actually affect exposure to ETS, and we know even less about whether these

effects differ by smoking status. The IOM explicitly notes this fact as a key limitation to

research in this area, writing in their report that a key gap in our understanding of the health

effects of these policies is a “lack of information on changes in secondhand-smoke exposure”

(IOM 2009).        Most previous studies focus on own-smoking behavior (Mariane P. Bitler,

Christopher S. Carpenter, and Madeline Zavodny 2010a, John A. Tauras 2006), with a few

notable exceptions. Carpenter (2009) examines the effects of laws restricting smoking in private

workplaces on exposure to ETS at work, but he does not study exposure in other places. Jerome

Adda and Francesca Cornaglia (2010) study the effects of public-place smoking laws on

population exposure to ETS using saliva cotinine levels (a biological marker for nicotine

metabolite), but their data do not permit them to observe where individuals were exposed.

Several other public health studies use ambient nicotine measurements or other biological

markers to study ETS exposure before and after smoking bans (usually in bars and restaurants).

These studies generally find large reductions in exposure but are limited to a very small number

of sites and suffer from the usual concerns about other unobserved characteristics about those

sites that caused them to implement a smoking ban and that may be independently correlated

with smoking-related outcomes.5 Consistent with the IOM report, we are aware of no large-scale



4
  The Americans for Non-Smokers’ Rights Foundation (ANRF), a group that tracks clean indoor air coverage across
the United States, notes that only 22 states have laws that completely prohibit smoking in all workplaces, bars, and
restaurants (the three main venues they track) without provisions for designated smoking rooms or firm size
exemptions (ANRF 2010).

quasi-experimental evaluations of the effects of public-place smoking laws that use direct

information on the location of ETS exposure.

         We fill this gap in the literature by studying the rapid diffusion of public-place smoking

laws across Canada on smoking outcomes and exposure to ETS. Our main contribution is that

we leverage unique confidential data from the 2002-2008 Canadian Tobacco Use Monitoring

Surveys which contain detailed questions on the precise location of exposure to ETS, such as

bars, restaurants, and homes.6 We also draw on an independent source of confidential data from

the Canadian Community Health Surveys (CCHS) from 2000 to 2008 which contains alternate

measures of ETS exposure. The venue-specific ETS exposure information in the CTUMS

affords us the literature’s first direct tests of how public place smoking laws affect exposure to

ETS in the venues explicitly covered by the laws (public places). We also use both datasets to

test the possibility that these laws may have induced displacement of smoking from public places

to private places such as cars and homes (as suggested by Adda and Cornaglia 2010). All of our

models include city and year fixed effects (i.e., a difference-in-differences framework), thus

identifying the effects of the public-place smoking laws on outcomes using within-city changes

over time in outcomes for individuals residing in places that adopted a law, controlling for the

associated within-city changes in outcomes for individuals residing in places that did not adopt a

law at that same time.




Daniel Menzies et al. (2006), Pasquale Valente et al. (2007), Jill P. Pell et al. (2008), and others. William N. Evans,
Matthew C. Farrelly, and Edward Montgomery (1999) discuss these issues in detail.
6
  The validity of self-reports of ETS exposure is supported by previous research which demonstrates that these
outcomes are strongly correlated with other biological markers of ETS such as ambient nicotine measurements
(Jacalyn Coghlin, S. Katharine Hammond, and Peter H. Gann 1999, Chizimuzo T.C. Okoli, Thomas Kelly, and
Ellen J. Hahn 2007). Self-reports also have the advantage that we can make consistent comparisons of ETS
exposure outcomes across space and time using very large samples of outcome data.



                                                          4
           To preview, we find that public-place smoking laws in Canada had no economically or

statistically significant effects at reducing population smoking participation or intensity.7 This

suggests that public-place smoking laws are unlikely to improve cardiovascular health by

inducing existing smokers to quit or reduce the number of cigarettes smoked. We do, however,

find that public-place smoking laws significantly reduced ETS exposure in a variety of public

places, especially inside bars/taverns, inside restaurants, and on outdoor patios of bars and

restaurants. These estimated reductions in public-place ETS exposure are: 1) observed for both

non-smokers and smokers; 2) very large in magnitude (on the order of 65 percent for bars and 75

percent for restaurants); 3) highly robust to a variety of specification checks (e.g., trends, leads,

etc.); and 4) confirmed in independent analyses of the CCHS. The ETS exposure reductions also

exhibit a plausible monotonicity associated with the strength of the law in place (i.e., stronger

laws induced larger reductions in ETS exposure). We find important effects of public-place

smoking laws using both variation from individuals living in cities that adopted restrictions prior

to provincial laws and variation from individuals living in cities that did not adopt such laws

prior to a provincial law (i.e., the ‘reverse’ experiment), and we also show that the timing of the

estimated reductions in public-place ETS exposure is consistent with our causal interpretation.

Finally, we do not find consistent evidence of significant displacement of ETS to cars, other

people’s homes, or the respondent’s own home. We do, however, find that public-place smoking

laws significantly increased the probability non-smokers report being exposed to ETS at building

entrances, presumably reflecting displacement.

           Over our sample period, total exposure to ETS in public places was cut by more than

half, and exposure to ETS in bars and restaurants in Canada was essentially eliminated. We

estimate that public-place smoking laws are responsible for most of these improvements. Our
7
    Throughout, we use smoking ‘intensity’ to refer to the number of cigarettes smoked among smokers.



                                                          5
results are the first to show that public-place smoking laws significantly reduce ETS exposure in

a range of public places for both smokers and non-smokers. Thus, we document multiple

plausible mechanisms through which such laws may improve cardiovascular health. Given that a

large fraction of the US and other countries still do not ban smoking in public places, our results

suggest the potential for significant public health improvements if smoking were universally

banned in public places.

       The paper proceeds as follows. We provide a literature review in Section I and present

the data, institutional background, and methods in Section II. Section III presents the main

results on smoking and exposure to ETS, Section IV offers evidence on displacement of smoking

from public places, and Section V offers a discussion and concludes.



                                 I. PREVIOUS RESEARCH

Several recent studies in economics have used quasi-experimental methods to study the effects of

clean indoor air policies, with most focusing on smoking behavior. Ayda A. Yurekli and Ping

Zhang (2000) used aggregate data on cigarette consumption in the US from 1970-1995 and

found that smoke-free legislation significantly reduced cigarette consumption in models with

state and year fixed effects.    Taurus (2006) used data from the 1992-1999 Tobacco Use

Supplements to the Current Population Survey (CPS-TUS) and estimated models with state and

year fixed effects. He found that a summary index of clean indoor air laws was estimated to

reduce smoking intensity but not smoking participation. Bitler et al. (2010a, 2010b forthcoming)

used data from 1992-2007 CPS-TUS and examined the effects of venue-specific state clean

indoor air laws on smoking outcomes. Their quasi-experimental results returned no evidence

that clean indoor air laws reduced smoking either in the full population or for workers who




                                                6
should have been directly affected because they worked in the venues targeted by the clean

indoor air laws, with the exception that laws restricting smoking in bars were estimated to

significantly reduce the share of bartenders who smoked. Silke Anger, Michael Kvasnicka, and

Thomas Siedler (2010) study the effects of public-place smoking laws on smoking behavior in

Germany from 2002-2008 using difference-in-differences models and find no effects of the

policies on smoking overall but some evidence of smoking reductions for young, unmarried,

urban dwellers and for stricter bans.

       Although most studies of the effects of these types of laws focus on smoking outcomes,

two quasi-experimental studies have tested for effects on ETS exposure. Carpenter (2009)

studied local smoking laws in Ontario, Canada from 1997-2004 (before implementation of the

province’s strong provincial law) using data from the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health

(CAMH) Monitor. He estimated models with year and county fixed effects and found that local

workplace smoking laws significantly reduced ETS exposure at work among blue collar workers.

Carpenter (2009) did not examine ETS exposure in other public or private places.

       Adda and Cornaglia (2010) also studied the effects of workplace and bar/restaurant

smoking laws on exposure to ETS using novel data on cotinine—a metabolite of nicotine—from

saliva measurements in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III).

Their quasi-experimental models with state and year fixed effects showed: 1) no effects of the

laws on smoking cessation; 2) significant effects of the laws on reducing the amount of time that

smokers spent in bars and restaurants; and 3) significant increases in ETS exposure for children

living with smokers. They suggest that these patterns can best be explained by displacement of

ETS from public places to private places.      They do not, however, directly observe where

individuals were exposed to ETS.




                                               7
       We build on the work of Carpenter (2009) and Adda and Cornaglia (2010) in several

important ways. First and most importantly, we observe direct measures of exposure to ETS in a

variety of public and private places. Carpenter (2009) only observes ETS exposure at work, and

Adda and Cornaglia (2010) infer changes in ETS exposure indirectly from relationships between

public-place smoking laws and cotinine measures. Second, we provide several useful robustness

tests of the effects of public-place smoking laws, for example by directly testing for endogenous

policy adoption (by controlling for leads of the public-place laws and by comparing the effects of

public-place smoking laws for individuals living in cities that did or did not adopt a local

smoking restriction prior to a stronger province-wide law). We are also able to explicitly test for

differential effects of laws based on the strength of the law adopted. Adda and Cornaglia’s

policy data from the Americans for Non-smokers’ Rights Foundation (ANRF) only includes

variation from strong 100% smoke-free laws, and Carpenter (2009) similarly restricts attention to

strong 100% smoke-free laws in Ontario. Since many strong laws were preceded by weaker

laws (which may have had incremental effects at reducing ETS exposure), our empirical

specifications are more comprehensive than have been estimated in previous work. Third, our

outcome data from the CTUMS and CCHS includes detailed information on the respondent’s full

six-digit postal code of residence. This allows us to very precisely match the policies in place to

each individual observation. In contrast, Adda and Cornaglia (2010) use as their dependent

variable of interest the fraction of a state’s residents covered by 100% smoke-free policies but do

not directly match the local or state policy in effect to each respondent. In these ways our

research complements and extends the previous quasi-experimental studies of ETS exposure in

Adda and Cornaglia (2010) and Carpenter (2009).




                                                8
    II. DATA, INSTITUTIONAL BACKGROUND, AND EMPIRICAL APPROACH

                                                    A. Data

        In order to analyze the effects of public-place smoking laws on smoking and ETS

outcomes in Canada, we use confidential data from the Canadian Tobacco Use Monitoring

Survey (CTUMS) from 2002-2008 and the Canadian Community Health Surveys (CCHS) from

2000-2008.8 The CTUMS and the CCHS are both large repeated cross-sectional surveys used to

gather health-related information on Canadians living in private households, excluding people on

Indian reserves and on Canadian Forces bases. The main difference between the two datasets is

that the CTUMS focuses entirely on smoking-related outcomes while the CCHS covers a broad

range of health topics. As a result, the CTUMS contains a larger number of more detailed

questions about smoking behavior and ETS exposure, while the CCHS contains only a handful

of ETS exposure questions. The ETS exposure questions in the CCHS, however, cover a longer

time period, and the CCHS has four times the sample size as compared to the CTUMS. Our

main specifications restrict attention to respondents between the ages of 18 and 64 who have no

missing data on the outcome variables or individual demographic covariates.

        We construct several outcomes on own-smoking behavior using information that is

available over the entire sample period in both datasets. First, we study the probability the

respondent is a current smoker. All respondents are asked “At the present time, do you smoke

cigarettes daily, occasionally, or not at all?” We create an outcome variable called “current

smoker” that is equal to one if the individual reports smoking cigarettes daily or occasionally.



8
  For the CTUMS we use the annual file that combines Cycles 1 and 2 within each year. The CTUMS was also
carried out in 1999, 2000, and 2001, but in these years there is no geographic information below province. Since a
key contribution of our work is to test for the effects of numerous city-level laws prior to adoption of provincial
laws, we focus on data from 2002-2008. For the CCHS, we use data from Cycle 1.1 (conducted in 2000/2001),
Cycle 2.1 (conducted in 2003), Cycle 3.1 (conducted in 2005) and 4.1 (conducted in 2007/2008).



                                                        9
Individuals who report being daily or occasional smokers are then asked about their smoking

intensity; we create a variable equal to the number of cigarettes smoked in the previous month.9

        Our primary information on ETS exposure comes from the CTUMS, which from 2005-

2008 asked about each respondent’s exposure to ETS in a variety of venues. Individual self-

reports have been shown to be highly correlated with other biological markers of ETS exposure,

such as saliva cotinine levels (Coghlin et al. 1999) and ambient nicotine measures (Okoli et al.

2007).10 Specifically, individuals in the CTUMS are asked: “The next questions are about

exposure to second-hand smoke in places other than your own home. Second-hand smoke is

what smokers exhale and the smoke from a burning cigarette. In the past month, (excluding your

own smoking), were you exposed to second-hand smoke: … inside a car or other vehicle?”

Subsequent questions ask about exposure to ETS: 1) “inside someone else’s home”; 2) “on an

outdoor patio of a restaurant or bar”; 3) “inside a restaurant”; 4) “inside a bar or tavern”; 5) “at a

bus-stop or shelter”; 6) “at an entrance to a building”; 7) “at your workplace”; 8) “at your

school”; 9) “at any other public place such as a shopping mall, arena, bingo hall, concert, or

sporting event”; and 10) “outdoors such as on a sidewalk or in a park”. We code separate

indicator variables equal to one if the respondent reports she was exposed in each specific

location and zero otherwise.




9
  In the CTUMS, individuals are administered the ‘smoking wheel’ which asks them about the number of cigarettes
smoked on each of the previous seven days, beginning with the day just before the interview and working
backwards. We define smoking intensity as the number of cigarettes a smoker reports smoking in the past week
multiplied by four. In the CTUMS, the smoking information is available from 2002 to 2008. In the CCHS (which
does not administer the smoking wheel) we define this as the usual number of cigarettes smoked each day by daily
smokers multiplied by thirty. For occasional smokers we compute past month consumption by multiplying the
respondent’s reported usual number of cigarettes smoked on the days she smoked multiplied by the number of days
in the previous month she reported smoking at least one cigarette. This two-part model of smoking behavior is
standard in the literature. See, for example, John G. Cragg (1971), Willard G.Manning et al. (1981), Naihua Duan et
al. (1983), John Mullahy (1998), and others. In the CCHS, the smoking information is available from 2000 to 2008.
10
   We are not aware of any data in Canada that cover the period in which the smoking laws were adopted and that
include biological markers of ETS exposure (e.g., saliva cotinine).



                                                        10
         Several features of the core CTUMS ETS exposure outcomes are worth noting. First, the

question is concrete. It explicitly defines ETS and asks respondents to think about locations

other than their own home. Importantly, it also directs individuals to respond about other

people’s smoke; thus, the question is informative for both smokers and non-smokers. Finally,

note that these questions are unlikely to suffer from desirability bias or related false reporting

since there is no penalty to the respondent from reporting ETS exposure in these venues (unlike,

say, surveys of bar or restaurant owners following adoption of smoking laws covering those

venues). We rely on these CTUMS outcomes as our main measures of ETS exposure.

         The information on public-place ETS exposure in the CCHS is more limited, so we use

those data mainly to corroborate the findings in the CTUMS. For example, the CCHS only asks

questions about ETS exposure to non-smokers. More importantly, these data do not ask about

ETS exposure in each location/venue separately, so we instead create an outcome variable equal

to one if the respondent reports being exposed to ETS in public places (defined in the CCHS as

bars, restaurants, shopping malls, arenas, bingo halls, and bowling alleys) on all or most days in

the previous month.11

                                              B. Institutional Background

         We study the effects of public-place smoking laws using variation in the timing of policy

adoption across cities and provinces in Canada over the past decade. The policies we study

generally prohibit smoking in a variety of public places, including restaurants, bars, bingo halls,

11
   The wording of the ETS exposure questions in the CCHS changed slightly over the sample period. Specifically,
Cycle 1.1 of the CCHS asked all current respondents who did not report being a current smoker whether they were
exposed to second-hand smoke (i.e., ETS) on most days in the previous month. Respondents who reported that they
were exposed on most days then were asked a series of questions about where they were exposed, including “in a car
or other private vehicle” and “in public places (bars, restaurants, shopping malls, arenas, bingo halls, bowling
alleys)”. Beginning with Cycle 2.1 and onward, the screener question about any exposure was eliminated, and non-
smokers were explicitly asked about exposure “every day or almost every day” for the two venues (i.e., “in a car or
other private vehicle” and “in public places” (with the identical venues listed in the question as in Cycle 1.1)). Our
main CCHS results are unchanged if we restrict attention to data from Cycle 2.1 onward only. Also, note that all of
our models include cycle-specific dummy variables.



                                                         11
bowling alleys, shopping malls, and sporting arenas. Enforcement of these laws varies across

cities and provinces, but generally the penalty for violating a public-place smoking ordinance is a

modest to severe fine (e.g., $200 in Toronto, $2000 in Nova Scotia, and up to $10,000 in

Saskatchewan) (CBC News 2009). The laws we study typically do not restrict smoking in

private places such as cars, homes, or apartment buildings. Some of the laws we study do

include language that prohibits smoking in private workplaces, though previous research has

shown that these provisions were not binding for the vast majority of workers because most

industries in North America voluntarily went smoke-free without the push of government

intervention many years before the first public-place smoking restrictions were adopted

(Carpenter 2009, Bitler et al. 2010a).

         The public-place smoking restrictions we study were tracked by Health Canada,12 which

reports the specific public places covered by each city or province law, any relevant exemptions

or provisions for Designated Smoking Areas (DSAs), and the date the law took effect.13 In

addition, Health Canada assigns to each policy a ‘strength’ rating, and below we describe how

we use this additional variation to test whether stronger, more restrictive policies induced larger

changes in outcomes than weaker, less restrictive policies. Gold laws are 100% smoke-free

policies with no venue-specific exemptions. Silver laws allow for one venue-specific exemption

(most commonly this exemption pertained to bars).14 Bronze laws allow for two or more venue-

13
   In the US, smoking laws vary substantially with respect to the venues covered (e.g., private workplaces, bars,
restaurants, schools, government buildings, child care centers, transit facilities, shopping malls, and others) (Bitler et
al. 2010a). In practice, most US-based research focuses on laws covering private workplaces, bars, and restaurants.
14
   According to Health Canada, Gold, Silver, and Bronze laws all prohibit smoking in restaurants. We understand
the exempted venues in Silver and Bronze laws to include venues such as bars, casinos, bowling alleys, billiard
halls, and bingo halls.

specific exemptions. Designated Smoking Areas are allowed under both Silver and Bronze laws

but are prohibited under Gold laws.15

         There is a great deal of variation in the presence and timing of public-place smoking

restrictions across Canada. A handful of cities adopted public-place smoking restrictions at the

very beginning of our sample period, including Victoria and Vancouver, British Columbia, in

1999 and 2000, respectively, as well as the capital city of Ottawa and the most populated city,

Toronto, both in 2001. By July 2005, seven of the top ten most populous cities had adopted a

law, including: Toronto, Vancouver, Edmonton, Ottawa, Hamilton, Winnipeg, and London.16

Ontario had the largest number of city-wide public-place smoking restrictions, particularly in

towns and cities around Toronto, London, and Windsor. Every province adopted a public-place

smoking law at some point from 2000 to 2008. British Columbia was the first province to do so

in 2002, and Ontario and Quebec (the two other most highly populated provinces) followed suit

in 2006.

         Figures 1 and 2 show trends in the proportion of the CTUMS and CCHS samples,

respectively, that we identify as living in an area covered by a public-place smoking law, as well

as the proportion of people living in areas covered by the strongest 100% smoke-free gold laws.

Both figures confirm that our samples cover the period of widespread adoption of public-place

smoking restrictions. Figure 1 using the CTUMS data, for example, shows that only 35% (10%)

of the country’s population was covered by any (a gold) public-place smoking law in 2002

compared with 100% of Canadians covered by such a law in 2008. Figure 2 (which uses an


15
   Clean indoor air laws in the United States also vary with respect to the strength of the laws adopted, and some
previous research has used this variation (Tauras 2006, Bitler et al. 2010a, and others). One of the more commonly
used policy tracking systems in the US, Robert Wood Johnson’s ImpacTeen Database, for example, gives each
covered venue in each state a rating from, say, 0 to 3, where 0 indicates no restrictions in smoking and 3 indicates a
complete ban on smoking. We allow the gold/silver/bronze ratings to have independent relationships with our
outcomes of interest, thus using the variation in the strength of the restrictions in a more flexible way.
16
   Montreal, Calgary and Quebec City did not adopt a city law prior to their respective provincial laws.



                                                         13
independently drawn sample from the CCHS) confirms these trends and extends the time series

back to 2000 when just over 10% of Canadians lived in an area covered by any public-place

smoking law. Notably, both figures show that while the increase in the probability of being

covered by any law was gradual over this period, there was a sharp break in the probability

individuals were covered by stronger 100% smoke-free gold public-place smoking laws

beginning in 2006 when many of the large provincial laws began taking effect.17 Coincident

with this sharp upturn in gold law coverage in Figure 1, we also observe corresponding

reductions in ETS exposure inside bars and restaurants. Over this same period Figure 2 shows a

very large proportional reduction in the fraction of non-smoking Canadians who reported being

exposed to ETS in public places on all or most days of the previous month (from 23 to 11

percent) between 2000 and 2008. Both figures show declines in smoking participation.

         This general pattern of adoption whereby cities and towns adopted public-place smoking

laws prior to more expansive province-wide laws in Canada generally mirrors the pattern of

policy adoption in the United States as well, though the adoption across Canada has occurred

much faster. European countries began adopting public-place smoking restrictions around the

same time as Canada, with Ireland going completely smoke-free (including in bars and

restaurants) in 2004. Norway soon followed suit with its own bar and restaurant smoking ban

later that year, and Italy adopted a similar law in 2005. Since then, laws completely restricting

smoking in public places (including bars and restaurants) have been adopted in a variety of

European countries, including: Scotland (in 2006), England (in 2007), Finland (in 2007), and

France (in 2008) (EPHA 2010).18 A proposal to ban smoking in all public places throughout the


17
   The fact that the "any law" trend does not increase sharply at the same time illustrates that these strong province-
wide laws were in many cases replacing weaker city-specific silver or bronze-level restrictions.
18
   Several European countries have exceptions for ventilated smoking rooms and/or bar/restaurant exemptions, while
other countries have minimal enforcement of public-place smoking restrictions.

European Union is to be put forth by the European Commission in 2011. Many factors are

thought to influence policy adoption, including an increase in worldwide anti-smoking sentiment

and associated reductions in smoking prevalence (IOM 2010). We are not aware of good

evidence on the prevalence of or trends in antismoking sentiment across countries, though

smoking rates in Canada (about 20-25% over our sample period) are similar to those the US and

are similar to or slightly lower than those in much of western Europe.19

         c. Approach

         To assess the impact of the public-place smoking laws, we use a standard difference-in-

differences (DD) approach that controls for unobserved time invariant area-specific

heterogeneity through the inclusion of city (i.e., Canada’s statistical area classification20) fixed

effects and time fixed effects. Specifically, we estimate the following:

         (1) Yiat = α + β1 Xiat + β2 Zat + β3 (Public-Place Smoking Law)at + Areaa + Yeart + εiat

where Yiat refers to the various smoking and ETS exposure outcomes for individual i in

statistical area a in survey year t.21 Xiat is a vector of individual demographic controls for age

and its square, a male dummy, two marital status dummies (single never married and

widowed/divorced/separated, with married/common-law as the reference group), and seven

dummies for educational attainment (secondary school, some postsecondary school, some

college, bachelors degree, graduate degree, and education missing, with less than high school as

the reference group).        Zat is a vector of time-varying province-specific characteristics and

19
   A 2008 report by the Centers for Disease Control indicates the adult smoking rate in the United States is about
20%. The 2002 Tobacco Atlas by the World Health Organization reports the following adult smoking rates: Canada
25%; USA 23.6%; Ireland 31.5%; Norway 31.5%; Italy 24.9%; United Kingdom 26.5%; Finland 23.5%; and France
34.5% (Judith Mackay and Michael P. Eriksen 2002).
20
   Statistical area classifications are the combination of census metropolitan areas (population greater than 100,000
people) and census agglomerations (population between 10,000 and 100,000 people).
21
   We use linear probability models for ease of interpretation, but probit models returned very similar results. We
use OLS for the smoking intensity models where the dependent variable of the natural log of the number of
cigarettes smoked in the previous month.



                                                         15
policies that may be correlated with adoption of public-place smoking by-laws, including: the

provincial unemployment rate and the real tax-inclusive provincial cigarette price. Areaa is a

vector of statistical area dummies, and Yeart is a vector of survey year dummies. We also

include month-of-interview dummies in all specifications to account for seasonality.

         Public-Place Smoking Lawat is an indicator variable which equals one if the respondent

lives in an area which is covered by a law restricting or prohibiting smoking in public places and

zero otherwise. We construct the law variables by matching the local smoking policy in effect at

the time of the CTUMS and CCHS interviews in the respondent’s postal code of residence,

similar to Carpenter’s (2009) study of Ontario.22 The coefficient of interest in equation (1) is β3,

which identifies the effect of public-place smoking laws as measured by the change in outcomes

for individuals living in an affected area relative to the associated change in outcomes for

individuals living in a non-affected area coincident with policy adoption. The key identifying

assumption of the model is that there are no shocks other than the public-place smoking laws that

affected relative outcomes of individuals in adopting places versus non-adopting places.

Throughout, εiat is assumed to be a well-behaved error term. All models use sampling weights

provided by the CTUMS and CCHS, and standard errors are clustered at the statistical area level

(Marianne Bertrand, Esther Duflo, and Sendhil Mullainathan 2004).23



22
   Information on these local smoking restrictions comes from Health Canada. For most individuals we match on
Statistical Areas (SAs) or province, but if the bylaw is below the SA level of geography (e.g., the subdivision level)
we code according to the lower level of geography since we observe the respondent’s full six-digit postal code.
Results are robust to dropping individuals in locations that are covered by more than one level of bylaws. We drop a
very small number of individuals whose postal code spans multiple SAs irrespective of the presence of a policy. We
use the current policy in effect at the time of interview for all outcomes except the questions about exposure to ETS
which ask about exposure over the past month. For these outcomes, we drop the small number of individuals who
were interviewed within 30 days immediately following adoption of a public-place smoking policy.
23
   Note that all provinces adopted laws over our sample period. We code the strongest relevant policy in effect for
each respondent. For example, many localities adopted a silver law prior to adoption of a province-wide gold law.
Individuals in these cities are first coded as being subject to a silver law and subsequently as being subject to a gold
law when the provincial law takes effect. In contrast, if a city first adopted a gold law and then the province later



                                                          16
                                                 III. RESULTS

Table 1 presents the basic results for smoking participation (columns 1 and 2) and smoking

intensity (columns 3 and 4) for both the CTUMS and CCHS.24 Each column represents a

separate model, and in each case we present the coefficient on the “public-place smoking law”

indicator from the preferred city and year fixed effects specification as in equation (1). All

models include the individual level demographic controls, provincial level real cigarette prices,

and provincial unemployment rates. The results in Table 1 provide no evidence that public-

place smoking laws significantly reduced smoking participation or intensity. Our preferred

estimate using the larger samples of the CCHS data, for example, indicates that there was

virtually no relationship between adoption of public-place smoking laws and the probability an

individual reports being a smoker (column 2), and the estimate is sufficiently precise that the

95% confidence interval rules out smoking reductions larger than 0.6 percentage points.25 These

null findings on smoking participation are consistent with recent research on similar policies in

the US (Bitler et al. 2010a, Adda and Cornaglia 2010).26 We find qualitatively identical patterns

in columns 3 and 4 for smoking intensity. Overall, we conclude that public-place smoking laws




adopted a silver law, an individual residing in that city is coded as being subject to a gold law for the entire period
beginning when the local law takes effect.
24
   We provide basic weighted descriptive statistics for adult respondents in the CTUMS and CCHS in Appendix
Tables 1 and 2, respectively.
25
   Relative to a mean smoking rate of 30.7 percent in the CCHS (using the average from individuals in 2000 living
in places without a law), this estimate rules out effect sizes of larger than about 2 percent [0.6/30.7=0.02] for public-
place smoking laws on smoking participation. These null findings on smoking behavior are also inconsistent with
endogenous policy adoption imparting serious bias to our estimates. It is also possible that it may take some time
before the public-place smoking laws reduce smoking participation or intensity. Examining this issue by including a
dummy for time greater than one year after the initial law, we still do not find much evidence of any effects of the
law on either smoking participation or intensity.
26
   These null findings on smoking also suggest that our CCHS models of ETS exposure that restrict attention to non-
smokers are not seriously contaminated by composition bias (since smoking status is not correlated with adoption of
public-place smoking laws). Recall that the ETS questions in the CCHS were only asked of non-smokers.



                                                           17
in Canada had no meaningful effects on population smoking prevalence.27 These null findings

on smoking prevalence suggest that any improvements in cardiovascular health associated with

smoking bans are unlikely to be attributed to reductions in smoking by existing smokers.28

         We turn to our main ETS exposure outcomes from the CTUMS in Table 2. Each entry is

the coefficient on the “public-place smoking law” indicator in the preferred city and year fixed

effects specification (i.e., equation (1)). We present the relevant coefficient of interest for eight

of the public-place venues. The results in Table 2 return strong evidence that public-place

smoking laws significantly reduced exposure to ETS on outdoor patios of restaurants or bars

(column 1), inside restaurants (column 2), and inside bars or taverns (column 3). Each of the

estimated effects is statistically significant at the one percent level, and the estimated reductions

are also very large in magnitude. The estimate in column 2, for example, indicates that adoption

of a public-place smoking law reduced the probability a respondent reports being exposed to

ETS inside a restaurant in the previous month by almost 40 percentage points, or by about 75

percent relative to a mean ETS exposure rate of 54 percent for individuals not covered by a

public-place smoking law in 2005. Similarly, the estimate in column 3 of Table 2 indicates that

a public-place smoking law reduced exposure to ETS inside a bar or tavern by 23.9 percentage

points, or by about 64 percent relative to the associated 2005 exposure rate for individuals not

covered by a public-place smoking law (23.9/37.6=0.64). For the other venues in Table 2 we


27
   In results not reported but available upon request, these null findings were robust to including linear city trends.
We also did not find evidence that real tax-inclusive provincial cigarette prices had significant effects on smoking
participation or intensity. We similarly found no economically or statistically significant relationship between
provincial unemployment rates and smoking prevalence. With respect to demographic characteristics, we found the
usual patterns: men are more likely to smoke than women, smoking increases with age, married individuals are less
likely to smoke than unmarried individuals, and highly educated individuals are less likely to smoke than individuals
with less education. The full set of coefficient estimates is available upon request.
28
   We do not know, however, how much of each cigarette is smoked by smokers, so it could be that public-place
smoking restrictions reduce the amount of smoke inhaled and exhaled without reducing the total number of
cigarettes reported. This would be the case, for example, if smokers smoke part of a cigarette on their way from a
parking lot to the entrance of a bar or restaurant instead of finishing the cigarette indoors.



                                                          18
find much smaller and statistically insignificant effects of public-place smoking laws.

Interestingly, we find no substantive or statistically significant relationship between exposure at

one’s workplace (column 5) or school (column 6) and the presence of a public-place smoking

law. This is not surprising, given that the laws we study pertain to public places and not

workplaces per se (though clearly bars, restaurants, and other public places are workplaces for

some small share of workers)29 and given other research that has documented that the vast

majority of private workplaces went smoke-free without the push of government intervention far

before the start of our sample period (Carpenter 2009, Bitler et al. 2010a, and others). We do,

however, find that public-place smoking laws significantly reduced ETS exposure in a summary

measure of other public venues that includes shopping malls, arenas, bingo halls, concerts, or

sporting events (column 7). For these venues, we estimate that the laws reduce exposure by 5.1

percentage points, or about 15 percent relative to the proportion of individuals living in places

without these laws who reported such exposure in 2005 (5.1/33.8=0.15). Finally, in column 8

we find that the laws significantly reduced ETS exposure in other places not explicitly asked

about in the CTUMS.           Specifically, we estimate that a public-place smoking law reduced

exposure to someone else’s ETS “anywhere else” (i.e., other than in the locations explicitly

asked previously) by 3 percentage points.30

        In Table 3 we examine whether the reductions in ETS exposure observed in bars and

restaurants in Table 2 are driven by exposure reductions experienced by non-smokers, smokers,

or both.    Reduced smoking in public places could convey important cardiovascular health


29
    We do not have sufficient occupation data in the CTUMS to test whether these ETS exposure effects differ by
occupation. We also considered estimating models that dropped individuals for whom the relevant venues are
irrelevant (e.g., drop non-students for the question about exposure at school; drop non-workers for the question
about exposure at the workplace) and making use of responses other than "Yes" or "No" in the CTUMS (e.g., "don't
know"). However, 98% of the responses to the exposure questions in the CTUMS are "Yes" or "No", leaving us
little power to do anything meaningful in this respect.
30
   The results in Table 2 are very similar when we add controls for linear city-specific time trends.



                                                      19
benefits to both non-smokers and smokers, but previous research has not addressed this question.

Recall from Table 1 that current smoking status was unaffected by adoption of public-place

smoking laws, so this exercise is not likely to be contaminated by systematic composition biases.

The results in Table 3 reveal strong evidence that the improvements in cardiovascular health

from lower ETS exposure associated with public-place smoking laws accrue to both smokers and

non-smokers. For example, we estimate reductions in ETS exposure inside a restaurant in

columns 1 and 2 that are very similar in magnitude (and both statistically significant at the one

percent level) for smokers and non-smokers, respectively. We find larger estimated absolute

reductions in reported ETS exposure inside a bar or tavern for smokers compared with the

associated reductions at those same types of venues reported by non-smokers, though the implied

proportional reductions relative to the 2005 mean for individuals living in places without a law

are very similar in magnitude (65% reduction for smokers and 63% reduction for non-smokers)

and both are statistically significant.31

        In Table 4 we examine the robustness of the main findings that public-place smoking

laws significantly reduced exposure to other people’s ETS in public places, particularly inside

restaurants (top panel) and inside bars or taverns (bottom panel). In each column we present the

results from an alternative specification check.              First, we reprint the basic difference-in-

differences estimates (corresponding to those printed in Table 2) for each venue in column 1. In

column 2 we add controls for linear city-specific time trends. In these models, we identify the

effects of public-place smoking laws from sharp deviations off of smooth trends in outcomes

coincident with adoption of the public-place smoking law. In column 3 we directly address

concerns about possible policy endogeneity by controlling for a one-year lead of the public-place

31
  Results for other venues are available upon request. We do not present them here to conserve space. The patterns
were qualitatively identical (i.e., significant reductions for both smokers and non-smokers) for ETS exposure: on
outdoor patios of bars and restaurants; at public places such as malls, arenas, etc.; and ‘anywhere else’.



                                                       20
smoking law variable. If large shocks to outcomes systematically precede rather than follow

public-place smoking laws, this could suggest that the laws were endogenously adopted or that

there is some other specification error. Finally, in column 4 we report coefficient estimates from

an alternative specification in which we replace the single public-place smoking law variable

with separate indicators for laws of varying strength or restrictiveness (i.e., gold, silver, and

bronze-level laws). In the presence of a true causal effect of the laws at reducing ETS in these

venues, we might expect a plausible monotonicity in the strength of the law adopted.

        The results in Table 4 confirm that the reductions in ETS exposure estimated in the

previous tables are highly robust. For example, examining the top panel for exposure to ETS

inside restaurants, we find that the coefficient estimate on the public-place smoking law variable

remains large, negative, and highly significant once we include city-specific trends (column 2) or

control for the one-year lead of the policy variable (column 3). Notably, the coefficient on the

policy lead for the restaurant exposure variable is negative and statistically significant, but it is

much smaller than the associated public-place smoking law coefficient estimate.32 Finally, we

observe a plausible monotonicity in the strength of the law specification in column 4 (though the

estimates for the gold and silver laws are very similar in magnitude).

        For exposure to ETS inside bars and taverns in the bottom panel, we find that the effects

of public-place smoking laws are also robust. The inclusion of city-specific time trends does

little to the relevant coefficient estimate in the bottom panel (as for restaurant exposure), and we

do not find evidence of a statistically significant lead effect in the bottom panel of column 3.

Moreover, even with the control for the one-year lead, we continue to estimate that public-place


32
  A small negative and significant lead effect could arise, for example, if restaurant owners anticipated the law
coming into effect and decided to comply in advance of the actual implementation date. Announcement effects
would also produce the observed small lead coefficient for restaurant ETS exposure, particularly if there were
uncertainty by smokers about when such laws took effect.



                                                       21
smoking laws significantly reduced ETS exposure inside bars and taverns. In column 4 we

observe stronger evidence of monotonicity in the effects according to the strength of the law

adopted.33 Overall, these results confirm that the estimated reductions in ETS exposure are

highly robust, especially for exposure inside bars and taverns.34

        In Table 5 we examine the robustness of the ETS exposure reductions in a different way.

Specifically, we turn to the independently drawn CCHS data that contains an alternative measure

of such exposure: the probability an individual reports being exposed to ETS in public places

(not separately by venue) on all or most days of the previous month. The format of Table 5

follows Table 4: we present the baseline difference-in-differences results in column 1, and in the

remaining columns we assess robustness by: adding city-specific trends (column 2), controlling


33
   As noted above, Health Canada's coding indicates that smoking in restaurants is prohibited in Gold, Silver, and
Bronze Laws; the venue-specific exemptions for Silver (one exemption) and Bronze (two or more exemptions) can
include bars, casinos, bowling alleys, billiard halls, and bingo halls. This suggests we should observe a weaker
Gold/Silver/Bronze gradient in the effects of public-place smoking laws on ETS exposure in restaurants as
compared to bars. Indeed, this is what the patterns in Table 4 indicate. In results not reported but available upon
request we found qualitatively similar results of the robustness exercises for the other venues. Exposure to ETS on
outdoor patios of bars and restaurants exhibited patterns that were qualitatively identical to those for exposure to
ETS in bars in the bottom panel of Table 4, for example.
34
   An important consideration for welfare analyses is whether and to what extent people change where they spend
their time in response to public-place smoking laws. We are not aware of data that span adoption of the policies to
test for this in quasi-experimental models. We can, however, provide descriptive evidence indicating that a
substantial share of the population spends time in bars and restaurants and that individuals who patronize these
establishments spend a meaningful amount of time there. Specifically, we examined confidential data from cycle 19
of the Canadian General Social Survey (GSS) on Time Use. These data provide information on individual time use
over a 24-hour period. Interviews for cycle 19 of the GSS were conducted between January and December 2005,
which corresponds to the beginning of our CTUMS sample with questions on ETS exposure. The GSS data indicate
that approximately 20 and 5 percent of the sample whose reference day was either Friday or Saturday went to a
restaurant for a meal or to a bar to socialize on the reference day, respectively. An even higher proportion of young
adults age 19-35 whose reference day was a Friday or a Saturday attended a bar on that day: 8 percent of this group
did so. These age-specific differences in time spent in a bar correspond with the mean exposure in bars from the
CTUMS sample, were we found that in 2005 34 percent of the respondents age 19 to 35 said they were exposed to
ETS in a bar, while only 16 percent of respondents age 36 to 64 said they were exposed to ETS in a bar (recall these
CTUMS exposure outcomes are measured over the previous month). Moreover, the GSS data indicate that among
individuals patronizing these establishments, large amounts of time are spent at bars and restaurants. Among
respondents who reported going to a bar and whose reference day was Friday or Saturday, the average time spent
socializing was approximately 165 minutes; the associated figure for eating a meal at a restaurant was approximately
93 minutes. Overall, then, the GSS data indicate that in 2005 (before the widespread adoption of strong provincial
public-place smoking laws) a substantial share of individuals attended bars and restaurants—especially on the
weekends—and spent multiple hours there on each occasion. These descriptive patterns show that the reductions in
ETS exposure attributable to public-place smoking laws are consistent with meaningful health improvements
documented in other studies.



                                                         22
for a one-year policy lead (column 3), and controlling for the strength of the law adopted

(column 4). The results in the first four columns of Table 5 confirm that the estimated reductions

in public-place ETS exposure associated with adoption of a public-place smoking law are also

found in the CCHS data. Specifically, we estimate that a public-place smoking law reduces

exposure to ETS in public places by about 6 to 10 percentage points. These effect sizes are large

as a proportion of the sample mean for individuals in 2000 living in places without a law, and all

of the estimates are statistically significant at the one percent level. Thus, while the CCHS lacks

detailed information on the precise location of exposure, the main finding that public-place

smoking laws significantly reduced exposure to ETS in public places is confirmed.35

         Having confirmed that the independently drawn CCHS data replicate our basic findings

on public-place smoking laws and ETS exposure in public places, we take advantage of the

longer CCHS time series to implement two additional analyses that speak to the validity of our

identification strategy.36 First, in column 5 of Table 5 we test whether the effects of public-place

smoking laws are different for individuals living in cities that adopted such policies prior to a

more expansive provincial law as compared to individuals living in cities that did not adopt a law


35
   In results not reported but available upon request, we performed several other robustness checks to the main
findings on public-place ETS exposure. First, our main results on reductions in ETS exposure in public places are
robust to using a probit model for the dichotomous nature of the outcome instead of OLS; estimated marginal effects
were virtually identical. Second, our main ETS results are also robust to excluding each of the highly populated
provinces individually (Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia, and Alberta). Third, our main ETS results are robust to
excluding Toronto and Vancouver. Fourth, our main ETS results are robust to excluding the small proportion of
individuals living in cities that straddle province boundaries (e.g., Ottawa).
36
   There are a couple of practical issues that complicate the additional robustness tests in the CCHS that pertain to
individuals living in cities with multiple policy adoptions (e.g., people in places that first adopted a bronze and then
a silver local law). One issue is that the timing effects for individuals in those cities are confounded by differences
in the strengths of laws adopted since cities almost always went from weaker to stronger laws. For simplicity, we
have excluded individuals in cities with multiple adoption dates for the additional tests in column 5 of Table 5 and
Figure 3. When we re-estimated the baseline CCHS model from column 1 of Table 5 removing individuals who
lived in cities with multiple adoption dates, the Public-place smoking law coefficient is slightly larger in magnitude
relative to our full sample results (-0.094** versus -0.074**) due to the fact that a larger proportion of cities that
adapted only one law adopted a gold law and only multiple adoption cities ever adopted a weaker bronze law. When
we re-estimated the model in column 4 of Table 5 on the sample of individuals living in cities with at most one
adoption date, we find that the magnitude of the Gold law and Silver law coefficients are very similar for the

prior to the province-wide law. This latter ‘reverse experiment’ variation for cities that were

compelled by the stronger province-wide laws to go smoke-free in public places provides useful

information on whether and to what extent the ‘early adopters’ were positively selected: if this

were the case, the effects of ‘city-level policies’ would be larger than the effects of ‘province-

induced policies’ (see Elizabeth O. Ananat et al. 2009 and Jonathan Gruber, Philip B. Levine,

and Douglas Staiger 1999 for a related discussion in the abortion literature). A finding that the

effects of public-place smoking laws are largely similar using these two different sources of

variation would indicate that the variation driving our identification is not substantially tainted

from these selection concerns. In column 5 we find that the estimated effects of public-place

smoking laws on ETS exposure in public places is generally similar when we use variation from

the city adoptions as compared to estimates using variation from the wider province laws. Both

point estimates indicate large and statistically significant reductions in public-place ETS

exposure, and the effects of the city-level policies are not larger than the effects of the province-

level policies. Thus, we conclude that the estimated effects of public-place smoking laws

described above are not substantially biased from selection concerns associated with endogenous

policy adoption.37

         Finally, we address the validity of the research design using an event study framework

that traces out the dynamic effects of the policies relative to the year prior to adoption. Doing so

allows us to assess the extent to which the observed effects are simple continuation of pre-

existing trends, as well as whether there were systematic shocks to ETS exposure outcomes prior

to policy adoption that would call into question the exogeneity of the timing of policy adoption.

Figure 3 presents these results visually (using point estimates and 95% confidence intervals from


37
  Using an F-Test, we reject the equality of the City-level adoptions and the Province-level adoptions coefficients at
the one percent level (p-value=0.002).

models shown in Appendix Table 3) and further supports our interpretation that the laws are

responsible for the dramatic improvements in public-place ETS exposure. There is no evidence

of systematic spikes in public-place ETS exposure just prior to policy adoption, and our

estimated policy effects do not simply reflect continuation of long-run pre-existing trends.

Instead, there is a discrete, sustained reduction in ETS exposure coincident with policy adoption.



                          IV. EVIDENCE ON DISPLACEMENT

Thus far our results show that public-place smoking laws in Canada were responsible for very

large reductions in ETS exposure in public places, particularly in bars and restaurants. An

important issue for welfare analysis is: how did these restrictions affect exposure to smoke in

other venues not directly targeted by the laws. In particular, is there evidence of systematic

displacement of smoking from public buildings to either just outside those buildings or to private

places (such as cars and homes), as suggested by Adda and Cornaglia (2010)?

       Notably, the list of venues in the CTUMS ETS exposure questionnaire does include at

least four specific places that could reflect displacement. Two are clearly private places: inside a

car and inside someone else’s home, and two are other types of places that could also reflect

displacement: outside (such as on a sidewalk or in a park) and at the entrance to a building. We

present difference-in-difference estimates for these outcomes in Table 6, the format of which

follows Table 2. If the smoking restrictions induced displacement, we would expect positive and

significant coefficients on the public-place smoking law indicators for ETS exposure in these

places. The results in columns 1 through 3 for ETS exposure inside cars, inside other people’s

homes, and outside such as on a sidewalk or in a park, respectively, show no evidence that

public-place smoking laws displace smoking to these places. The point estimates for these three




                                                25
venues are negative and statistically insignificant. Interestingly, in column 4 of Table 6 we

estimate that public-place smoking laws significantly increased the probability an individual

reports she was exposed to someone else’s smoke at the entrance to a building, suggesting that

smoking is displaced from inside public places to just outside the entrance of those places. We

investigate this result further in columns 5 and 6 of Table 6 in which we disaggregate the sample

in column 4 by smoking status. This analysis reveals clearer evidence for displacement: while

public-place smoking laws are not significantly related to the probability smokers report being

exposed to ETS at building entrances in the past month (column 5), the laws significantly

increase the probability non-smokers report being exposed to ETS at building entrances by 4.7

percentage points.       We interpret this finding as suggesting that public-place smoking laws

displace some smokers from inside public venues to just outside those venues.38

        Of course, because people spend most of their time at their own home, it is also important

to examine possible displacement of ETS from public places to the respondent’s own homes.

Fortunately, the CTUMS data contain this information. Specifically, from 2002-2008 in the

household screener portion of the survey, respondents living with others were asked “Does

anyone in your household smoke cigarettes, cigars, or pipes?”39 All respondents are then asked

“Including both family members and regular visitors, how many people smoke inside your home

every day or almost every day?” Finally, respondents reporting that someone smokes inside the

home every day or almost every day are asked: “On a typical day, about how many cigarettes are




38
   One possibility for why we only observe the evidence of displacement for non-smokers is that smokers might be
displaced to building entrances by themselves (recall the ETS exposure question explicitly asks about other people's
smoke).
39
   Smoking information for individuals living alone is ascertained later in the individual portion of the survey.



                                                        26
smoked inside your home?” Responses are recoded into categories, including: None, 1-10, 11-

20, 21-30, 31-40, and 41 or more.40

        Using this information, we can create two meaningful outcomes: an indicator for whether

any positive number of cigarettes is smoked inside the home, as well as the number of cigarettes

smoked inside the home on a typical day.41 We can also use information on whether there is a

smoker in the respondent’s household to examine whether the effects differ between individuals

in households without any smokers and individuals in households with at least one smoker. If

the public-place smoking laws induce displacement from public places to private homes, we

would expect to see increases in reported smoking inside homes after the laws are adopted, and

these effects should be particularly pronounced for individuals in households with smokers (note

this includes smokers living alone).             We estimated equation (1) on these home smoking

outcomes and present the results in Tables 7 for the dichotomous “someone smokes inside the

home every day or almost every day” (columns 1-3) and the continuous “number of cigarettes

smoked inside the home on a typical day” outcomes (columns 4-6). For each outcome we report

the full sample estimate followed by estimates for individuals in households with no smokers and

estimates for individuals in households with at least one smoker.42


40
   One might be concerned about the ability of non-smokers who live with smokers to meaningfully estimate the
number of cigarettes smoked inside the home. Despite this, only about 3.5 percent of these individuals said they did
not know how many cigarettes were smoked inside the home on a typical day.
41
   By construction, the information on number of cigarettes smoked inside the home is restricted to people who
report a positive number of people smoking inside the home on every or almost every day. We could also examine
as an outcome the number of people the respondent reports who smoke inside the home on every or almost every
day, though we choose to use information on the number of cigarettes smoked inside the home because it is the
ultimate construct of interest. Note that if the laws induce displacement to home smoking on “some” or “a few”
days (e.g., if the law induces displacement for ‘weekend’ smokers), the CTUMS question will not detect this. This
is a limitation of the self-reported data relative to objective information on cotinine.
42
   In the 2002 survey, the CTUMS editing procedures coded everyone in a single-person household who reported
being a smoker as having someone in the household who smokes. Starting in 2003, the question wording was
changed slightly to read “Do you/does anyone in your household smoke cigarettes, cigars, or pipes?” From 2003
onward, the CTUMS did not recode the “presence of a household smoker” variable to be consistent with the
respondent’s own smoking status for single-person households. Thus, from 2003 onward (and in 2002 for people in
households with multiple persons) a small number of people who report being current smokers also report that there



                                                        27
        The results in Table 7 regarding potential ETS exposure in private homes are inconsistent

with substantial displacement. Specifically, for the outcome reflecting the presence of an every-

day-or-almost-every day smoker inside the home, we find no evidence that public-place smoking

laws increase smoking inside homes. In fact, the sign of the point estimate on the “any law”

variable is negative (and significant), suggesting a protective association. Moreover, when we

cut the data by whether there is a smoker in the respondent’s household (including, potentially,

the respondent), we find no systematic evidence favoring displacement in the group where it

should be especially salient: households with smokers. Of course, the displacement tests in

columns 1-3 of Table 7 may not be very powerful given that smokers may have smoked

cigarettes inside the home even prior to public-place smoking restrictions being adopted. Indeed,

we report in the top row of Table 7 that 58.9% of people living in households with at least one

smoker in cities without a law in 2002 reported that a positive number of cigarettes are smoked

inside the home, while the associated figure for people living in household without smokers was

just 1.3%.

        In columns 4-6 of Table 7 we therefore test for displacement measured by the number of

cigarettes that the respondent reports are smoked inside the home on a typical day.43 This table

replicates these same basic patterns and on the whole is inconsistent with systematic, significant


is nobody in the household who smokes. This could either be due to desirability bias or to mis-interpretation of the
household screener question. In any event, it is unlikely that such biases are correlated with adoption of public-
place smoking restrictions. Note also that all of our specifications include year dummies to account for survey
differences common to any single year. In robustness analyses in Table 7, however, these internally-inconsistent
respondents are eliminated from the sample when we restrict attention to respondents reporting that there are no
smokers in the household (since for these individuals it is not at all clear if their reports about the number of
cigarettes smoked inside the house are valid). This explains the small difference in sample size when we split the
sample by the presence of a household smoker (i.e., in theory the sample size in columns 2 and 3 of Table 7 should
add up to the sample size in column 1; they do not because we have eliminated a small number of smoking
respondents who report that there are no smokers in their household.
43
   We estimate the models in columns 4-6 of Table 7 using OLS on the midpoints of the ranges in the question (see
Wooldridge 2002), using a value of 45.5 cigarettes for the small proportion of respondents reporting more 40 or
more cigarettes smoked inside the home on a typical day. More sophisticated methods, including interval
regression, returned qualitatively identical results.



                                                        28
displacement of smoking from public places to private homes in response to public-place

smoking laws. Again, we find statistically insignificant estimates that are wrong-signed for the

full sample and for the sample that should be most likely to exhibit displacement: individuals in

households with smokers. In column 6 of Table 7 we estimate that a public-place smoking law is

associated with a reduction in the number of cigarettes smoked by 0.175 cigarettes.44 The 95%

confidence interval around this estimate means that we can rule out displacement effects of

larger than about 0.617 cigarettes. Relative to the associated average for people living in places

without a law in 2002 of 9.473, this means that we can rule out displacement effect sizes larger

than about 0.617/9.473=0.065, or about 6.5 percent.45 Overall, these patterns in the CTUMS

data do not return strong evidence of systematic displacement of smoking from public places to

private homes.46



                               V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

We examined the effects of numerous local and provincial public-place smoking laws adopted

across Canada over the past decade on a variety of smoking-related outcomes, including a direct

44
   We found qualitatively identical results in the CCHS (available upon request). In the CCHS, the question about
smoking inside homes is only asked of individuals who live with others or of non-smokers who live by themselves.
(In Cycle 1.1, the question is asked of all respondents. We restricted the Cycle 1.1 sample to match that of the other
cycles.) Also, there is no way in the CCHS to determine whether the respondent’s household contains a regular
smoker (only the smoking status of the respondent is directly ascertained). Finally, the home smoking question in
the CCHS (which refers to the presence of someone who “regularly” smokes inside the home) is less concrete than
in the CTUMS (which refers to smoking inside the home “every day or almost every day”). Despite these
challenges, fixed-effects estimates of the effect of public-place smoking restrictions on the probability of having a
regular smoker inside the home were extremely small in magnitude, statistically indistinguishable from zero, and as
likely to suggest protective associations as they were to suggest displacement effects.
45
   Table 7 also shows, not surprisingly, that individuals in households without smokers living in places without these
laws in 2002 report far fewer cigarettes smoked inside their homes on a typical day relative to individuals in
households with at least one smoker (0.17 vs. 9.47 cigarettes, respectively).
46
   We also further explored the possibility of displacement of smoke from public places to private vehicles by
estimating models of ETS exposure inside cars separately by whether the respondent lives in a household with a
smoker (as in Table 7). Among non-smokers in the 2005-2008 CTUMS who live in households with at least one
smoker, we found substantial evidence of law-induced displacement to private vehicles in the CTUMS (effect sizes
on the order of 25-50%) These same patterns did not replicate in the 2000-2008 CCHS, however. These results are
available upon request.



                                                         29
measure of exposure to ETS in the venues explicitly targeted by the laws. We also directly test

for displacement of smoking from public places to private and other places. Most previous work

has focused mainly on smoking prevalence, despite that the explicit goal of public-place smoking

laws was to reduce population ETS exposure in public places. Moreover, previous research has

lacked direct information on where individuals were exposed to ETS.

       Our results indicate that public-place smoking laws in Canada did not have meaningful

effects on smoking participation or intensity. We do find, however that the laws significantly

reduced exposure to ETS in a variety of public places—especially bars, restaurants, and outdoor

patios of bars and restaurants. These reductions in public-place ETS exposure are observed for

both smokers and non-smokers, are highly robust to a variety of important specification checks,

and are replicated in an independently drawn sample (CCHS). Interestingly, we also estimate

that public-place smoking laws significantly increased non-smokers' exposure to ETS at building

entrances, suggesting that the laws displace some smokers from inside public venues to just

outside those places. We did not, however, find that the laws had significant effects on ETS

exposure in several other venues, however, including in the respondent’s home.

       How large are these effects? Recall that the summary measure of public-place ETS

exposure among non-smokers in Canada in the CCHS fell about 12 percentage points from 2000

to 2008 in the CCHS (from 23 percent of the sample to 11 percent being exposed on all or most

days in public places). Our fixed-effects estimate in Table 5 suggests that public-place smoking

laws can account for 7.4 percentage points (i.e., the majority) of this improvement. Measured

differently using the venue-specific exposure outcomes in the CTUMS, we estimate that public-

place smoking laws can account for the vast majority of the near elimination of ETS in bars and

restaurants observed from 2005-2008.      Importantly, our results uncover multiple plausible




                                              30
mechanisms through which public-place smoking laws may be expected to improve

cardiovascular health for both smokers and non-smokers, as reported in a recent IOM report on

smoking bans and heart attacks. Finally, our null findings on smoking prevalence suggest that

any improvements in cardiovascular health associated with adoption of smoking bans are not

likely attributable to reductions in own-smoking.

       Our study is subject to several limitations. First, our outcome data are self-reported

exposure outcomes and are not biological markers of exposure to ETS.             Given our direct

knowledge about location of exposure and the increase in external validity and generalizability,

this seems a reasonable trade-off, particularly since the epidemiological literature using

biomarker data is now full of single-site evaluations of public-place ETS exposure that focus on

select samples (e.g., bar workers). Our results demonstrate that the effects of public-place

smoking laws are economically and statistically significant across the population. A second

limitation is that although we can identify the venues from which smoking is being displaced

(e.g., bars, restaurants, outdoor patios, other public-places), we are unable to identify all of the

venues towards which smoking is being reallocated. One possibility is that there is displacement

to venues that do not fit nicely into the list of places in the CTUMS question (e.g., walking from

one’s car to a building). Another possibility is that smoke could be displaced to front porches or

backyards of homes instead of inside homes. Third, we do not observe information on where

respondents spend their time. Since one rational response by smokers and non-smokers alike is

to change the amount of time spent in various places in response to public-place smoking

restrictions, we cannot rule out that these behavioral changes are important responses to the laws.

       Despite these limitations, our results offer the strongest evidence to date that public-place

smoking laws are effective tools at reducing non-smokers’ and smokers’ exposure to ETS in a




                                                31
variety of public places on a broad, population-wide scale. In so doing, these findings—coupled

with the lack of evidence of large displacement effects to private homes—suggest wide latitude

for significant public health improvements if the United States and other countries were to

universally ban smoking in public places.

Notes: Sample in columns 1 and 3 includes adults age 18-64 in the CTUMS 2002-2008. Sample in columns 2 and 4
includes adults age 18-64 in the CCHS Cycles 1.1-4.1. The dependent variable in columns 1 and 2 is an indicator
variable equal to 1 if the person reports being a current smoker. The dependent variable in columns 3 and 4 is the
natural log of the number of cigarettes smoked last month. In the CTUMS we use information on number of
cigarettes smoked over the last seven days to construct a monthly variable. Since a large number of occasional
smokers in the CTUMS did not smoke in the last week, the sample in column 3 is restricted to daily smokers. In the
CCHS, the information on smoking was on the past month, and so we are able to use all current smokers. Individual
demographic controls include: age and its square, a male dummy, two marital status dummies, and six education
dummies (see text). All models also control for the provincial cigarette excise tax and the provincial unemployment
rate. Robust standard errors in brackets are clustered on statistical areas (SAs). Implied percent impact as a
proportion of base year average value of dependent variable for people living in places without a law in curly braces.

Notes: Sample includes adults age 18-64 in the CTUMS 2005-2008. The dependent variable in each model is an
indicator equal to one if the individual reports being exposed to someone else’s smoke in each of the specific areas
(inside a restaurant in the top panel; inside a bar/tavern in the bottom panel). See notes to Table 1 for control
variables. Robust standard errors in brackets are clustered on statistical areas (SAs). Implied percent impact as a
proportion of base year average value of dependent variable for people living in places without a law in curly braces.
* significant at 5%; ** significant at 1%.

Notes: Sample includes adults age 18-64 who are non-smokers in the CCHS Cycles 1.1-4.1. The sample in column 5 is restricted to individuals living in cities that
adopted at most one law. The dependent variable is an indicator equal to 1 if the person reports being exposed to ETS in public places on most or all days of the
previous month. Individual demographic controls include: age and its square, a male dummy, two marital status dummies, and six education dummies (see text).
All models also control for the provincial cigarette excise tax and the provincial unemployment rate. Robust standard errors in brackets are clustered on statistical
areas (SAs). Implied percent impact as a proportion of base year average value of dependent variable for people living in places without a law in curly braces. *
