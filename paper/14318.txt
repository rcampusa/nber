                                               ABSTRACT

National Time Accounting is a way of measuring society's well-being, based on time use. Its explicit
form is the U-index, for "unpleasant" or "undesirable", which measures the proportion of time an individual
spends in an unpleasant state. In this paper I review cross-country evidence on happiness and life satisfaction
and consider whether these data will likely be replaced by the U-index. I find that first, that there are
many similarities. According to both measures happiness is higher for the more educated, for married
people, for those with higher income and for whites and lower for the unemployed; is U-shaped in
age and un-trended over time in the USA although they are trended up in a number of EU countries
and especially so in developing countries. Equivalent results are found using self-reported unhappiness
data. Second, there is a large body of data on happiness that is unavailable on the U-index. For example,
according to happiness research well-being across nations is lower the higher is the unemployment
rate, the current inflation rate and the highest inflation rate in a person's adult life. Higher inequality
also lowers happiness. Third, we know little about the predictive power of the U-index. Happiness
and life satisfaction data seem able to forecast migration flows. Fourth, happy people are particularly
optimistic about the future. Fifth, according to the happiness data the US ranks above France but the
U-index suggests the reverse.

     National Time Accounting (NTA) as propounded by Krueger, Kahneman, Schkade,

Schwarz and Stone (2007) - henceforth K2S3 – is a way of measuring society's well-being, based

on time use. It is a set of methods for measuring, comparing and analyzing the way people spend

their time, across countries, over historical time, or between groups of people within a country at

a given time. The arguments for NTA build on earlier work in Kahneman et al (2004a, b) and

Kahneman and Krueger (2006). K2S3 argue that NTA should be seen as a compliment to the

National Income Accounts, not a substitute. Like the National Income Accounts, K2S3 accept

that NTA "is also incomplete, providing a partial measure of society’s well-being". However,

national time accounting, as K2S3 note, "misses people’s general sense of satisfaction or

fulfillment with their lives as a whole, apart from moment to moment feelings" (p.4, 2007).

     K2S3 propose an index, called the U-index (for “unpleasant” or “undesirable”) which is

designed to measure the proportion of time an individual spends in an unpleasant state. The first

step in computing the U-index is to determine whether an episode is unpleasant or pleasant. An

episode is classified as unpleasant by K2S3 if the most intense feeling reported for that episode is

a negative one -- that is, if the maximum rating on any of the negative affect dimensions is

strictly greater than the maximum of rating of the positive affect dimensions. Once they have

categorized episodes as unpleasant or pleasant, the U-index is defined by K2S3 as the fraction of

an individual’s waking time that is spent in an unpleasant state. The U-index can be computed

for each individual (what proportion of the time is this person in an unpleasant emotional state?),

and averaged over a sample of individuals. There does seem to be some differences in the paper

on how the U-index is actually calculated. For example, in K2S3's Table 5.2 the U-index is

defined as where 'stressed, sad or pain exceeded happy whereas in their Table 8.2 it is defined as

the 'maximum of tense, blue and angry being strictly greater than the rating of happy'.




                                                 1
       It is apparent that K2S3 believe their index is an improvement on the use of data on life

satisfaction and happiness, which they suggest has a number of weaknesses. In Kahneman et al

(2004) these same authors have criticized the use of such data because they argue that, there are

(i) surprisingly small effects of circumstances on well-being (e.g., income, marital status, etc.);

(ii) large differences in the level of life satisfaction in various countries which they regard as

'implausibly large'. They go on to argue that,

       "..reports of life satisfaction are influenced by manipulations of current mood and
       of the immediate context, including earlier questions on a survey that cause
       particular domains of life to be temporarily salient. Satisfaction with life and with
       particular domains (e.g., income, work) is also affected by comparisons with other
       people and with past experiences. The same experience of pleasure or displeasure
       can be reported differently, depending on the standard to which it is compared and
       the context." (Kahneman et al 2004, p. 430)

Indeed, Kahneman and Krueger (2006) argued that well-being measures are best described as
“… a global retrospective judgment, which in most cases is constructed only when asked and is
determined in part by the respondent’s current mood and memory, and by the immediate
context.” Frey and Stutzer (2005) have a rather different view.

       "As subjective survey data are based on individuals’ judgments, they are, of
       course, prone to a multitude of systematic and non-systematic biases. The
       relevance of reporting errors, however, depends on the intended usage of the data.
       Often, the main use of happiness measures is not to compare levels in an absolute
       sense, but rather to seek to identify the determinants of happiness. For that
       purpose, it is neither necessary to assume that reported subjective well-being is
       cardinally measurable, nor that it is interpersonally comparable. Higher reports of
       subjective well-being for one and the same individual has solely to reflect that she
       or he experiences more true inner positive feelings" (2005, pp. 208-209).

In the same vein Di Tella and MacCulloch (2007) note, "one would expect that such small

shocks can be treated as noise in regression analyses". Consistent with this, however, Krueger

and Schkade (2007) have reported that

       "..overall life satisfaction measures…exhibited test-retest correlations in the range
       of .50-.70. While these figures are lower than the reliability ratios typically found
       for education, income and many other common micro economic variables, they
       are probably sufficiently high to support much of the research that is currently
       being undertaken on subjective well-being, particularly in cases where group



                                                 2
       means are being compared (e.g. rich vs. poor, employed vs. unemployed) and the
       benefits of statistical aggregation apply" (2007, p.23).

     In their earliest empirical analysis, Kahneman and Kruger (2006) calculated a U-index

using data from a sample of 909 working women in Texas and showed that those who report less

satisfaction with their lives spend a greater fraction of their time in an unpleasant state. Of the

respondents who reported they were 'not at all satisfied', 49% of their time was spent in an

unpleasant state, compared with 11% who said they were 'very satisfied'. The authors also found

that those who score in the top third on a depression scale spent 31% of their time in an

unpleasant state whereas those who score in the bottom third on the depression scale spent 13%

of their time in an unpleasant state. K2S3 extend this work and report a comparison of the U-

index based on data they collected in the US and France – and I understand that results from

Denmark are coming shortly. K2S3 sampled 810 women in Columbus, Ohio and 820 women in

Rennes, France, in the spring of 2005 and obtained information on both life satisfaction and their

U-index. The American women were twice as likely to say they were very satisfied with their

lives as are the French women (26 percent versus 13 percent). Furthermore, assigning a number

from 1 to 4 indicating life satisfaction also indicated that the Americans are significantly more

satisfied, on average. In contrast to reported life satisfaction, the U-index is 2.8 percentage

points lower in the French sample (16%) than in the American sample (18.8%). Thus, the

French, according to K2S3, appear to spend less of their time engaged in unpleasant activities

(i.e., activities in which the dominant feeling is a negative one) than do the Americans in their

samples. Moreover, national time-use data examined by K2S3 indicated that the French spend

relatively more of their time engaged in activities that tend to yield more pleasure than do

Americans.




                                                3
       The U-index relates to a relatively short period of time. Hence, there are a number of

things the U-index does not measure - it appears to miss more general factors likely to impact a

citizen's overall well-being. Examples, by country, include the fact that young people have been

rioting on the streets of Paris (the UK Daily Telegraph headline read 'Test for Sarkozy as Paris

riots continue', November 27th, 2007), the French soccer team has won the World Cup or the

English team has been knocked out of Euro 2008, or that the country is at war in Iraq and

Afghanistan, or there has been a terrorist attack or a hurricane or even forest fires in Malibu or

floods in New Orleans? These may well be missed by the U-index while likely being picked up

in happiness or life satisfaction measures which relate to a more general feeling of happiness. It

remains unclear whether an increase in unemployment, inflation or inequality or a decline in

growth, or a drop in the stock market or a rise in the possibility of recession the following year

would raise the U-index? Does the U-index predict the outcomes of elections or migration flows

or anything at all for that matter? As I will outline in more detail below, it certainly seems that

these factors impact our measures of well-being.

     In what follows I provide a somewhat selective review of evidence on well-being using

cross-country data and try to provide a framework for reconciling the findings from this work

with those from the U-index. I present the main findings from responses on both happiness and

life satisfaction as well as on unhappiness, hypertension, stress, depression, anxiety and pain

from a considerable number of cross-country data sources. I also explore the results when

happiness questions are based on what happens over the preceding week and find slightly weaker

results. I then move on to look at how macro variables such as the national unemployment rate,

inflation and output impact life satisfaction. I find evidence that a one percentage point increase

in unemployment lowers happiness more than an equivalent increase in inflation and that the




                                                4
highest level of inflation experienced as an adult lowers happiness further. Further, I show that

life satisfaction levels in East European countries predict flows of workers to the UK and Ireland.

Finally, I examine individual's expectations and show that happy people are particularly

optimistic about the future, both for themselves and the economy. Subjective well-being data are

clearly correlated with observable phenomena (Oswald, 1997).

1. Happiness and Life satisfaction

         Data on happiness and life satisfaction in particular are now available for many countries

and for a large number of time periods. As with the U-index it is possible to average these

already existing data across individuals and countries to form a National Happiness Index (NHI)

to generate a measure national well-being, which would be a simple and cheap alternative to

K2S3's proposed NTA. A crucial question is whether or not K2S3's proposed U-index an

improvement over an NHI? As I lay out in detail below, there are many similarities between the

two indices in terms of their determinants. The main differences relate to country rankings.

     Before presenting data on happiness and life satisfaction in seminars to the many skeptical

economists who don't believe you can, or even should, measure well-being – although there are

less of that ilk these days - I explain that the data have been validated by researchers in other

disciplines. I tell them that the answers to happiness and life satisfaction questions are well

correlated with a number of important factors (for references see Di Tella and MacCulloch,

2007).

1. Objective characteristics such as unemployment.

2. Assessments of the person’s happiness by friends and family members.

3. Assessments of the person’s happiness by his or her spouse.

4. Heart rate and blood-pressure measures of response to stress.




                                                 5
5. The risk of coronary heart disease

6. Duration of authentic or so-called Duchenne smiles. A Duchenne smile occurs when both the
zygomatic major and obicularus orus facial muscles fire, and human beings identify these as
‘genuine’ smiles (see Ekman, Friesen and O’Sullivan (1988) and Ekman, Davidson and Friesen,
(1990)).

7. Skin-resistance measures of response to stress.

8. Electroencephelogram measures of prefrontal brain activity.

     Happiness and life satisfaction data are easy to obtain at the macro level as the data are

downloadable from the World Database of Happiness for over 100 countries. Most surveys now

use a common format for the questions. In general economists have focused on modelling two

fairly simple questions, one on life satisfaction and one on happiness. These are typically asked

as follows.

Q1. 3-step happiness – e.g. from the US General Social Survey (GSS)

"Taken all together, how would you say things are these days – would you say that you are very
happy, pretty happy or not too happy?"

Q2. 4-step life satisfaction – e.g. from the European Eurobarometer Surveys

"On the whole, are you very satisfied, fairly satisfied, not very satisfied, or not at all satisfied
with the life you lead?"

The micro data on happiness are easily obtainable from most data archives including ICPSR for

the GSS, the Data Archive at the University of Essex and ZACAT in Germany for the

Eurobarometers, ISSP, European Social Survey, BHPS, GSOEP, European Quality of Life

Survey, European Social Surveys etc.. Life satisfaction data are also now available annually

from the Latinobarometers while happiness data is available annually in the Asianbarometers

(Blanchflower and Oswald, 2007). Several of the data series extend back at least to the early

1970s. Many of the data sets cover several countries.




                                                 6
     Economists like to run regressions, so by now the standard econometric approach taken by

economists is to use micro data on happiness and/or life satisfaction to estimate an ordered logit

or an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression with the coding such that the higher the number

the more satisfied an individual is (e.g. Blanchflower and Oswald, 2004). Generally, it makes

little or no difference if you use an OLS or an ordered logit. The results are similar – but not

identical – for happiness and life satisfaction.     The main, ceteris paribus, findings from

happiness and life satisfaction equations across countries and time are as follows.

Well-being is higher among:
Women
Married people
The highly educated
Active involvement in religion
The healthy
Those with high income
The young and the old – U-shaped in age
The self-employed
People with low blood pressure
The sexually active and especially those who have sex at least once a week
Those with one sex partner
Those without children

Well-being is lower among:
Newly divorced and separated people
Adults in their mid to late 40s
The unemployed
Immigrants and minorities
Those in poor health
Commuters
People with high blood pressure
The less educated
The poor
The sexually inactive
Those with children

     There have been a number of recent surveys of the happiness literature including Clark et al

(2007); Frey and Stutzer (2002a, b) and Di Tella and MacCulloch (2006) which provide




                                                 7
discussions of the relevant issues. Recent findings from the statistical happiness research include

the following:

(i) For a person, money does buy a reasonable amount of happiness. But it is useful to keep this

in perspective. Very loosely, for the typical individual, a doubling of salary makes a lot less

difference than life events like marriage or unemployment.

(ii) For a nation, things are different. Whole countries, at least in the West where almost all the

research has been done, do not seem to get much happier as they get richer.

(iii) Happiness is U-shaped in age. Women report higher well-being than men. Two of the

biggest negatives in life are unemployment and divorce. Education is associated with high

reported levels of happiness even after controlling for income.

(iv) Happy people are less likely to commit suicide (Koivuma et al, 2001).

(v) The structure of a happiness equation has the same general form in each industrialized

country (and possibly in developing nations, though only a small amount of evidence has so far

been collected). In other words, the broad statistical patterns look the same in France, Britain

and the United States.     As Di Tella and MacCulloch note "well-being equations, (where

happiness and life satisfaction scores are correlated with the demographic characteristics of the

respondents) are broadly “similar” across countries, (is) an unlikely outcome if the data

contained just noise" (2007, p.9).

(vi) There is some evidence that the same is true in panels of people (that is, in longitudinal

data). Particularly useful evidence comes from looking at windfalls, like lottery wins.

(vii) There is adaptation. Good and bad life events wear off, at least partially, as people get used

to them.




                                                 8
(vii) Relative things matter a great deal. First, in experiments, people care about how they are

treated compared to those who are like them, and in the laboratory will even pay to hurt others to

restore what they see as fairness. Second, in large statistical studies, reported well-being depends

on a person’s wage relative to an average or ‘comparison’ wage including Blanchflower and

Oswald (2004); Ferrer-i-Carbonell (2005); Di Tella et al (2005) and Luttmer (2005). Third, wage

inequality depresses reported happiness in a region or nation (controlling for many variables),

but the effect is not large (Alesina et al, 2004). Some of these patterns are visible in raw data

alone. Strong correlations with income, marriage and unemployment are noticeable.

      For the United States there seems to be relatively little evidence that despite rising

affluence, happiness or life satisfaction have trended up much over time (Blanchflower and

Oswald (2004). For example, in the 2006 GSS, 13.1% of respondents said they were not too

happy, 56.1% pretty happy and 30.8% very happy. In 1972, the first year happiness data are

available the numbers were 16.5%, 53.2% and 30.3% respectively. As can be seen from Figure

1, average happiness levels for the US are flat, while real GDP per capita has risen. It is also

apparent from Table 7.3 of K2S3 that their U-index based on time in various activities each year

is also flat over time.

           1965-66        1975-76         1985          1992-94           2003           2005
All          20.1%          19.5%          19.5%          20.0%           19.3%          19.6%
Men          20.9           20.4           20.1           20.2            19.6           19.9
Women        19.4           18.7           19.0           19.8            19.2           19.4

The picture is rather more mixed among European countries. For example, in Figure 2a and 2b

there is some sign of a strong long-run upward trend in Italy and to a lesser extent in Denmark,

and France while the data are relatively flat in the Netherlands, Germany, the UK and Ireland. In

contrast, Belgium and Portugal have significant downward trends (results not reported). Note

that happiness levels are generally high in Denmark and low in Italy and France. In addition,


                                                 9
Frey and Stutzer (2002b) have shown that the time trend in life satisfaction in Japan was flat

between 1958 and 1991 over the period when GDP per capita rose by a factor of six.

         There is evidence however of upward trends in Eastern European countries, Turkey and

South American countries over the recent past.                      Table 1 reports the distribution of life

satisfaction scores for countries from Western and Eastern Europe and from Latin America over

the recent past. Among the seventeen Western European countries since the turn of the century,

five have seen satisfaction broadly flat (Denmark; Greece: Ireland; Spain and the UK); five have

seen increases (Belgium; Finland; France; Luxembourg and Sweden) while seven have seen

declines (Austria; Germany; Italy; Japan; Netherlands; Portugal and the USA). In contrast, with

the exception of Hungary, all of the Eastern European countries plus Turkey have all seen

increases as is the case for all the Latin American countries from 1997.1                             There is some

consistent evidence also that the wellbeing of the young (<30) has risen over time in both the

USA and Europe (Blanchflower and Oswald, 2000). The rise is mostly among the unmarried.

We found that this upward trend is not explained by changing education or work, falling

discrimination or rise of youth-oriented consumer goods.

         There is some evidence of convergence over time in the happiness of men and women in

the US as women have become less happy (Blanchflower and Oswald, 2004a). Stevenson and

Wolfers (2007) find that the relative decline in women’s well-being holds for both working and

stay-at-home moms, for those married and divorced, for the old and the young, and across the

education distribution. The relative decline in well-being holds across various datasets, and for

whether one asks about happiness or life satisfaction.                    Stevenson and Wolfers find that the

1
  Easterlin and Zimmermann (2008) suggest that the observed increases in happiness in East Germany have arisen
following a noticeable drop in life satisfaction at the time of unification (Blanchflower, 2001), so the rise is largely a
recovery to pre-transition levels. In private communication Dick Easterlin has further suggested, based on his recent
work, that the collapse and recovery of life satisfaction is typically the case for the European transition countries.



                                                           10
exception is that this African-American women have become happier over this period as have

African-American men and there has been little consistent change in the gender happiness gap

among African Americans over this period. As with U.S. women, Stevenson and Wolfers find

that the well-being of European women has declined relative to men. However, while U.S.

women also experienced an absolute decline in well-being, the subjective well-being of

European men and women has risen over time.

        There is also intriguing new evidence that high frequency happiness data yields

information about preferences. Kimball et al (2006), for example, showed that happiness dipped

significantly the first week of September 2005, after the seriousness of the damage done by

Hurricane Katrina started to become apparent. The dip in happiness lasted two or three weeks

and was especially apparent in the South Central region, closest to the devastated area.

2. The U-index

      The first column of Table 2 is taken from K2S3 and reports their U-index, which should be

thought of as the inverse of a subjective wellbeing or happiness index. The higher the U-index

the more unhappy the person is. There is little difference by gender; blacks are especially

unhappy; the poor are unhappy as are the least educated. Unhappiness declines with age and is

particularly low for the married and high for the widowed. How do these findings compare with

those found using happiness and life satisfaction data? Column two presents the proportion of

people in the USA from the General Social Surveys of 2000-2006 who say they are very happy

(from a 1-3 scale) while in column 3 the proportion of Europeans from the 2000-2006

Eurobarometers saying they were very satisfied and in the final column for the 2005/2006

Latinobarometers who say they are very satisfied, both on a 1-4 scale, are reported.2 Here a


2
 The countries covered in these Eurobarometers are Austria; Belgium; Bulgaria; Croatia; Cyprus; Czech Republic;
Denmark; Estonia; Finland; France; Germany; Greece; Hungary; Ireland; Italy; Latvia; Lithuania; Luxembourg;


                                                      11
larger proportion means happier and is the inverse of the U-index. Interestingly the results are

very similar in all four columns. Happiness is higher for the more educated, for married people,

for those with higher income and for whites.

        Happiness does rise with age in the USA but once controls are included happiness is U-

shaped in age (Blanchflower and Oswald, 2007b). It is U-shaped in age in both the European

and Latin American countries even in the raw data and when controls are included (Blanchflower

and Oswald, 2007b).3 This result is confirmed by K2S3 in their Table 7.4 where unhappiness

seems to follow an inverted U-shape.4 We explore this U-shape in age in more detail below.

The patterns across individuals are essentially the same then from SWB and NTA in the USA,

Latin America and Europe. It turns out that the happiness derived from sex in both SWB studies

and in U-index studies is especially high. (Blanchflower and Oswald, 2004b) found that sexual

activity enters strongly positively in happiness equations.5 Indeed, in Kahneman and Krueger,



Malta; Netherlands; Norway; Poland; Portugal; Romania; Slovakia; Slovenia; Spain; Sweden; Turkey and the UK.
The Latinobarometer covers Argentina; Bolivia; Brazil; Colombia; Costa Rica; Chile; Dominican Republic;
Ecuador; El Salvador; Guatemala; Honduras; Mexico; Nicaragua; Panama; Paraguay; Peru; Uruguay and Venezuela.

  As Clark (2007) notes, this finding is repeated in happiness equations in Blanchflower and Oswald (2004); Clark

  Blanchflower and Oswald (2007b) find that a robust U-shape in age in happiness/life satisfaction is found in
seventy-two countries - Albania; Argentina; Australia; Azerbaijan; Belarus; Belgium; Bosnia; Brazil; Brunei;
Bulgaria; Cambodia; Canada; Chile; China; Colombia; Costa Rica; Croatia; Czech Republic; Denmark; Dominican
Republic; Ecuador; El Salvador; Estonia; Finland; France; Germany; Greece; Honduras; Hungary; Iceland; Iraq;

  Blanchflower and Oswald (2004b) found that higher income does not buy more sex or more sexual partners.
Married people have more sex than those who are single, divorced, widowed or separated. The happiness-
maximizing number of sexual partners in the previous year is calculated to be 1. Highly educated females tend to
have fewer sexual partners. Homosexuality has no statistically significant effect on happiness.

(2006) and Kahneman et al (2004b), 'intimate relations' has the lowest rating (i.e. gives the most

happiness) while commuting has the highest. Somewhat surprisingly, though in K2S3 'walking'

gave more happiness than 'making love' among US women, although the reverse was the case

among French women (Table 8.3)!

     In section 8 of their paper K2S3 do some international comparisons of SWB in two

“representative” cities, one in France and the other in the United States, and ask whether the

standard measure of life satisfaction and the NTA yield the same conclusion concerning relative

well-being. Specifically, they designed a survey to compare overall life satisfaction, time use,

and recalled affective experience during episodes of the day for random samples of women in

Rennes in France and Columbus, Ohio in the United States. These cities were selected because

they argued that they represented “middle America” and “middle France”. K2S3 also presented

results using time allocation derived from national samples in the United States and France to

extend their analysis beyond these two cities. The city sample consisted of 810 women in

Columbus, Ohio and 820 women in Rennes, France. Respondents were invited to participate

based on random-digit dialing in the Spring of 2005 and were paid approximately $75 for their

participation in both countries. The age range spanned 18 to 68, and all participants spoke the

country’s dominant language at home. The Columbus sample was older (median age of 44

versus 39), more likely to be employed (75 percent versus 67 percent) and better educated

(average of 15.2 years of schooling years versus 14.0) than the Rennes sample. In addition, the

Rennes sample was more likely to be currently enrolled in school (16 percent versus 10 percent).

The life satisfaction question was taken from the World Values Survey.

     The distribution of reported life satisfaction in Columbus, OH and Rennes, France for

women found by K2S3 is presented in the first two columns of part A of Table 3a using the 4-




                                               13
step life satisfaction scale. Life satisfaction is based on the question, ”Taking all things together,

how satisfied are you with your life as a whole these days - not at all satisfied, not very, fairly

and very satisfied?” K2S3 found that American women reported higher levels of life satisfaction

than the French did, whether the proportion who said they were very satisfied or the overall score

is used. Yet they also found that, on average, the French spent their days in a more positive

mood. Moreover, the national time-use data they used also indicated that the French spend

relatively more of their time engaged in activities that tend to yield more pleasure than do

Americans.     Their results, they argue, "suggest that considerable caution is required in

comparing standard life satisfaction data across populations with different cultures".             In

particular, the Americans seem to be more emphatic when reporting their well-being. The U-

index K2S3 suggests, "apparently overcomes this inclination".

       Kahneman et al (2004 p. 430) have argued that differences in the SWB ratings of

Denmark and France, for example, in the Eurobarometers are implausibly large, and they "raise

additional doubts about the validity of global reports of subjective well-being, which may be

susceptible to cultural differences in the norms that govern self descriptions". For example, in

the Eurobarometers 2000-2006, the average distributions for life satisfaction for these two

countries are as follows.

                 not at all        not very            fairly         very           N
                  satisfied         satisfied         satisfied     satisfied
France                4%             15%               65%           16%         13,554
Denmark               1%              3%               33%           63%         13,718

Such differences are consistently repeated in multiple data sets, whether happiness or life

satisfaction is used. It is clearly problematic to compare one country’s happiness answers to

those of another country. Nations have different languages and cultures, and in principle that

may cause biases, perhaps large ones, in happiness surveys.           At this point in research on



                                                 14
subjective well-being, the size of any bias is not known, and there is no accepted way to correct

the data, although the literature has made some progress in exploring this issue (for instance, by

looking inside a nation like Switzerland at sub-groups with different languages). In the long run,

research into ways to difference out country fixed-effects will no doubt be done and the work of

K2S3 in this regard is obviously important.          The strong well-being performance in some

happiness surveys of countries such as Mexico and Brazil in the 2002 ISSP, for example,

(Blanchflower and Oswald, 2005), may or may not ultimately be viewed as completely accurate.

In Blanchflower and Oswald (2005), one check was done by comparing happiness in the English

speaking nations of Great Britain, Ireland, New Zealand, Northern Ireland and the United States.

The main attraction is that this automatically avoids translation problems.         Moreover, this

smaller group of nations has the advantage that they are likely to be more similar in culture and

philosophical outlook, and that in turn may reduce other forms of bias in people’s answers.

However, it does appear that there is considerable stability in cross-country rankings of life

satisfaction in English speaking countries (Blanchflower and Oswald, (2005, 2006); Leigh and

Wolfers, (2006)).

3. Econometric evidence on life satisfaction and happiness

       As I will show in more detail below there is also a great deal of stability in the rankings

of European countries across a number of surveys including the Eurobarometers (1973-2006),

European Quality of Life Survey (2003) and the European Social Survey (2002). Further, it

seems that there is evidence from the World Values Survey and the International Social Survey

Programme (2002) supporting a happiness ranking where the US is ranked above France as

implied in K2S3's life satisfaction data rather than below it as implied by their U-index. In fact I

am unable to find any data file where the ranking reverses as occurs with the U-index. The




                                                15
evidence is essentially the same whether we look at happiness, life satisfaction or health, family

life or conversely, a variety of measures of unhappiness including measures of high blood

pressure, stress, lack of sleep, pain and being 'down and depressed'.

        Where feasible I present data comparing the US and France but there are only a few data

files that include both countries so we make use of data from a number of European data files

that allow a direct comparison with Denmark that will be included in K2S3's analysis shortly

plus the UK, which is of particular interest to this author! In almost all of what follows the UK

ranks above France: Denmark is mostly top of the happiness rankings in Europe, especially when

life satisfaction is used. If we refer to Figures 2a and 2b which are based on Eurobarometer

data, Denmark ranks above the UK which itself ranks above France, in every year of data we

have available. Indeed, based simply on life satisfaction averages France usually ranks below

the large majority of the EU15. For example, in the raw data from the latest Eurobarometer

available, #65.2 for March-May 2006, France ranked fourteenth out of thirty countries.6

Controlling for a variety of characteristics over a long run of thirty years, France ranked

seventeenth out of thirty.7

      Columns 3-5 of part A of Table 3a report results using the most recent subset of the data

from the Eurobarometers for 2000-2006 which shows that France ranks third behind Denmark

  Average life satisfaction scores were Denmark (3.61); Sweden (3.39); Luxembourg (3.39); Netherlands (3.36);
Ireland (3.28); Finland (3.23); UK (3.19); Belgium (3.19); Cyprus (3.12); Slovenia (3.10); Spain (3.08); Austria

(2.66); Lithuania (2.58); Latvia (2.56); Hungary (2.47); Portugal (2.44); Romania (2.31) and Bulgaria (1.97).

  When an ordered logit is run using these Eurobarometer data from 1973-2006 pooled across all member countries
plus Candidate Countries Croatia, Norway and Turkey with a standard set of controls as in Table 8 column 5, the
rankings are as follows with rank in parentheses Denmark (1); Netherlands (2); Norway (3); Sweden (4);
Luxembourg (5); Ireland (6); UK (7); Finland (8); Belgium (9); Austria (10); Cyprus (11); Slovenia (12); Malta
(13); Spain (14); Germany (15); Turkey (16); France (17); Czech Republic (18); Italy (19); Croatia (20); Poland
(21); Portugal (22); Estonia (23); Greece (24); Slovakia (25); Latvia (26); Lithuania (27); Hungary (28); Romania
(29); Bulgaria (30);

and the UK. Part B of Table 3a presents data on women using the World Values Survey on a 10

point life satisfaction scale and replicates that ranking. Part C of the table uses data for men and

women combined from the World Database of Happiness and which includes all four countries.

Once again France ranks bottom, with Denmark second and the UK third with the USA at the

top.

        In the final part of Table 3a I present some macro-economic data on GDP per capita, the

Gini coefficient and the most recent unemployment rate (Source; Labour Market Statistics First

Release, ONS, November, 2007).          In comparison with France the USA has a) a lower

unemployment rate, b) higher GDP per capita c) higher Gini coefficient. France has especially

high rates of long-term unemployment and youth unemployment. Denmark has an especially

low unemployment rate and low Gini coefficient. Despite the well known difficulty of making

suicide rates comparable across countries, it appears that the rates in France for both men and

women are well above those for the USA. This is illustrated in Table 3b. This ranking is more

consistent with SWB data rankings than it is with rankings based on NTA.

        Happiness from a further source, the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP),

which also contains data from the two countries, is also supportive of the fact that happiness in

the USA is higher than it is in France. Data on the two countries are available in the 1998, 2001

and 2002 sweeps. In the first two sweeps happiness data is available on a four point scale in

response to the question 'how happy are you with your life in general – not at all happy; not very

happy, fairly happy and very happy'. Responses are as follows

                 not at all      not very         fairly         very         score        N
2001   USA           1%             7%             51%            41%          3.3%       1129
1998   USA           2%             9%             52%            37%          3.2%       1272
2001   France        1%             9%             62%            27%          3.2%       1330
1998   France        3%            20%             64%            13%          2.9%       1082




                                                17
The overall score for the French increased between 1998 and 2001. In the 2002 ISSP responses

were provided on a seven point scale and the US score is once again considerably higher than for

the French for both men and women. As can be seen below the average score across respondents

in the USA was higher for both men and women, however, the proportion very unhappy –

completely, very or fairly – was higher. For men in the USA 4.3% in this category compared

with 3.1% in France while for women the numbers were 4.2% and 3.6% respectively.

We now turn to the econometric evidence where we are able to hold constant a number of factors

including labor market and marital status, age, gender and schooling. The rankings remain

essentially unchanged.

Econometric evidence on the micro-determinants of happiness




                                              18
      Rank orderings of the United States and France are consistent whether we examine

happiness, life satisfaction or other variables relating to the family, no matter what the data file

or year we examine. Table 4a and 4b explores differences in happiness between the United

States and France using the ISSP 1998, 2001 and 2002 data described above.8 In all three years

of data the USA ranks above France, although there is some variation in the rankings across

other countries. For example, the UK is above the USA in 1998 and 2001 but below it in 2002

and above Denmark in all three years while Denmark is below France in 2001. In most other

data files we examine below Denmark ranks top in Europe, especially on life satisfaction.

Columns 3 and 4 provide estimates of ordered logits estimating how satisfied the individual is

with their family life. The idea here is to ensure the rankings are not driven by different

interpretations of the word 'happy', although still potentially impacted by the reticence of the

French to be emphatic when reporting their well-being. Rankings are similar to those based on

happiness, with Americans more satisfied than the French. It does seem, however, that people in

the USA value time with their families very highly. Interestingly, when individuals in the ISSP

are asked whether they wished they could spend more time with their families, more than half of

respondents reported they would like to spend 'much more time', compared with a third in France

and the UK and a fifth in Denmark (Table 5).

      It is appropriate to explore further the ranking by country using the SWB measures from

other data files to see if the rankings are consistent and this is what is done in Tables 6-8 and it

turns out they are. Table 6 uses data from eighty two countries from the four sweeps of the

World Values Surveys of 1981-2004 on both life satisfaction and happiness. Ordered logits are


8
  The exact question asked is Q.17. 'If you were to consider your life in general, how happy or unhappy would you
say you are, on the whole?' – 1=completely happy, 2=very happy, 3=fairly happy, 4=neither happy nor unhappy,
5=fairly unhappy, 6=very unhappy and 7=completely unhappy.



                                                       19
estimated in columns 1 and 2 with the dependent variable life satisfaction with responses scored

on a scale of 1-10 where 1 is least satisfied and 10 most satisfied. The sample size is just over a

quarter of a million observations - only three country dummies are included with the remaining

country dummies all excluded for simplicity. The first column only includes 19 year dummies

and country dummies for France, Denmark, the UK and the USA with all other countries set as

the omitted category for simplicity. Column 2 adds controls for age, gender, marital status and

labor market status. Happiness is higher among the married (Zimmermann and Easterlin, 2006),

the educated and especially low among unemployed (Blanchflower and Oswald, 2004a, b). In

both columns the country ranking remains as follows - France, UK, USA and Denmark. In

columns 3 and 4 the dependent variable is a 4-step happiness variable and the rankings are a little

different - France, USA, UK and again Denmark at the top. These results are consistent with the

findings of Veenhoven (2000) who examined the first three waves of the WVS and found that

among the three possible ways of ranking countries based on responses of individuals on how

happy they are, how satisfied they are and how they would rate their lives on a scale from the

worst to the best possible life, the ranking stays roughly the same.

       Table 7 uses data from another source, the European Quality of Life Study of 2003

(n=26,000), which obviously excludes the US, and follows a similar form but this time separate

results are reported on a 10-step scale for life satisfaction and happiness. Data are also available

on the individual's assessment of their overall health – on a five point scale: poor, fair, good,

very good and excellent. Four separate controls for health status are included in column 2 for

life satisfaction and column 5 for happiness along with a standard set of controls. Household

income in Euros is also available in the data file which is the added, in natural logarithms, in

columns 3 and 6. This is the first time in a cross-country data file on happiness that income has




                                                 20
been available in one currency (Euros). In all cases the rankings for the three main countries of

interest are France, then the UK and finally Denmark highest ranked. East European countries

have low levels of happiness (Blanchflower (2001), Sanfey and Teksoz (2007)); life satisfaction

and happiness is U-shaped in age, minimizing in the mid-40s for life satisfaction and in the 50s

for happiness. Adding controls for income lowers the age minimum. Happiness rises with

education and income whether health is controlled for or not. Married people and those living

together as well as those in good health are particularly happy. The unemployed are especially

unhappy (Blanchflower and Oswald, 2004; Carroll, 2007 for Australia and Hinks and Gruen,

2007 and Powdthavee, 2007 for South Africa).

       Money buys happiness. Interestingly, and perhaps surprisingly from an economist’s

point of view, the coefficients on the other variables in Table 7’s well-being equations hardly

alter when income is controlled for. The amount of happiness bought by extra income is not as

large as some would expect. To put this differently, the non-economic variables in happiness

equations enter with large coefficients, relative to that on income. Following Blanchflower and

Oswald (2004), Table 7, or its ordinary least squares equivalent (see Appendix Table A), can be

used to do a form of happiness calculus. The relative size of any two coefficients provides

information about how one variable would have to change to maintain constant well-being in the

face of an alteration in the other variable. To ‘compensate’ for a major life event such as being

widowed or a marital separation, it would be necessary to provide an individual with additional

income. Viewing widowhood as an exogenous event, and so a kind of natural experiment, this

number may be thought of as the ‘value’ of marriage. A different interpretation of this type of

correlation is that happy people are more likely to stay married. It is clear that this hypothesis

cannot easily be dismissed if only cross-section data are available. However, panel data on well-




                                               21
being suggest that similarly large effects are found when looking longitudinally at changes (thus

differencing out person specific fixed effects). If high income goes with more happiness, and

characteristics such as unemployment and being black go with less happiness, it is reasonable to

wonder whether a monetary value could be put on some of the other things that are associated

with disutility. Further calculation using the life satisfaction data in Appendix Table A suggests

that to ‘compensate’ for unemployment compared with being a manual worker would take a rise

in net income of approximately €3,900 per month, which is very large given the mean in the data

of €1,392 and to ‘compensate’ for being married or living together would take €1,770 Euros

compared to being single.9 Blanchflower and Oswald (2004) also found large effects for the US

using the GSS data. These effects seem large and inconsistent with the claims of Kahneman et al

(2004) that the size of the effects of circumstances on well-being are, 'surprisingly small'.

        Table 8 examines data from the 2002 European Social Survey (ESS) across 20 EU

countries plus Israel and Switzerland. Data are provided in columns 1-3 on happiness and life

satisfaction. The rankings are very similar to those reported in Table 7 – France then the UK

then Denmark at the top. The patterns in the data are similar to those identified above -

happiness and life satisfaction is higher for the most educated, for married people, the employed

and the healthy. Happiness and life satisfaction are U-shaped in age. Table 9 uses data from a

single Eurobarometer #57.2 on life-satisfaction (5-step) also with and without health status

dummies. There is a U-shape in age in every case. Once again in all six cases the rankings are

France then the UK and Denmark highest.

  This is done simply by dividing the coefficient on unemployment by the coefficient on household income i.e.

unemployment .

       Identical rankings to this are found in Table 10 which uses over three quarters of a

million observations from a long time series of Eurobarometers on life satisfaction (4-step). The

rank ordering is France, UK and Denmark for the period 1975-2006 as well as for all sub-

periods. The rankings were also the same as this when thirty separate equations were run with

the same controls in every year individually (results not reported). It is also apparent from

Appendix Table B that the structure of (OLS) life satisfaction equations is similar across the

main European countries. Interestingly, the patterns of the life satisfaction appear to be very

similar to those in the happiness data in the United States.

       Blanchflower and Oswald (2008b) found that psychological well-being is U-shaped

through life. A difficulty with research on this issue is that there are likely to be omitted cohort

effects (earlier generations may have been born in, say, particularly good or bad times). First,

using data on 500,000 randomly sampled Americans and West Europeans, the paper designs a

test that can control for cohort effects. Holding other factors constant, we showed that a typical

individual’s happiness reaches its minimum -- on both sides of the Atlantic and for both males

and females -- in middle age. Second, evidence was provided for the existence of a similar U-

shape through the life-course in East European, Latin American and Asian nations. Third, a U-

shape in age is found in separate well-being regression equations in 72 developed and developing

nations. Fourth, using measures that are closer to psychiatric scores, Blanchflower and Oswald

(2008b) document a comparable well-being curve across the life cycle in two other data sets: (i)

in GHQ-N6 mental health levels among a sample of 16,000 Europeans, and (ii) in reported

depression and anxiety levels among 1 million U.K. citizens.10 Evidence of a U-shape in age is

found in all life satisfaction and happiness equations reported in this paper.11

           Easterlin (2006) argues that happiness in the US, as well as family satisfaction and job

satisfaction in the US follow an inverse U-shape in age.12                  13
                                                                                 His evidence was based on data

from the General Social Surveys from 1973-1994. It is true in the raw data, or in specifications

that do not include income or marital status as controls, that there is an inverse U-shape in the

data in these three variables but only in the USA.14 However, once marital status alone is

included the U-shape flips and the sign of the time trend reverses, as can be seen below in the

two ordered logits with t-statistics in parentheses estimated on the GSS data from 1972-2006.15

Easterlin (2007) only includes controls for gender, education and year of birth and its square, and

I replicate his results with these variables using the longer time run of data from 1973-2006. I

include controls for gender, schooling, race, region, birth decade, plus marital status and labor

     Clark (2007) finds a similar result in the UK using data from the BHPS even after controlling for cohort effects.

     However, Easterlin (2006) did find a U-shape in health and satisfaction with their financial situation .
13
  Analogously Mroczek and Spiro (2005) found that subjective well-being follows an inverted U-shape peaking at
around retirement age.
14
   If an ordered logit is run with each of these five variables along with only age and its square there is an inverse U-
shape for happiness, family satisfaction and job satisfaction (workers only). There is a U-shape for the family's
financial situation while for the health variable only the age square term is significant and negative.

     Note in the data that the proportion married falls from 71.9% in 1972 to 48.1% in 2006.

controls.17

        I estimated fourteen separate OLS equations for the largest European countries using the

1972-2006 Eurobarometers; in each case the dependent variable was life satisfaction scored from

1-4 with only age and its square as controls. Below we report signs of the variables if significant

at 1% on a two tailed test. If insignificant a zero is entered. In every country except Austria

there is a significant U-shape in age. The coefficients, all of which were highly significant, were

When controls are included – for education, gender, marital status, labor market status and time –

in Appendix Table 1 all of these countries had significant U-shapes in age. Table 12a uses 5-step

happiness data for thirteen Asian countries for 2003 and 2004 drawn from the

   Health satisfaction declines with age in the raw data which is consistent with the findings of Deaton (2007) who
also found that health satisfaction declined with age.

Asianbarometers.18 The variables work in the same way as for other countries; and there are U-

shapes in age with minima of 46 from column 3 for the two years pooled. However, there is no

U-shape in the raw data as was found in the USA. Analogously, simply adding marital status

variables generates a significant U-shape. Well-being is U-shaped in age whether measured by

life satisfaction, happiness or the U-index once controls are included and in many countries even

in the raw data. Cambodians and South Koreans are the least satisfied while those from Brunei

and Singapore the most satisfied.

        Table 12b uses data on 5-step life satisfaction for nine Asian and 9 European countries

from the Asia/Europe Survey (ASES) of 2001. Happiness is U-shaped in age and rises with

education. The unemployed are especially unhappy in Europe but are also unhappy in Asia. In

both Asia and Europe native English speakers are especially happy – those with no

understanding of English at all are less happy. Swedes are especially happy and Portugueses

unhappy. There is a similar pattern to the Asian country dummies to those reported in Table 12a:

Koreans are especially unhappy and Malaysians and Singaporeans notably happy.

4. Econometric evidence on hypertension, unhappiness and pain

      The question then is whether the pattern of results we have seen using happiness and life

satisfaction are repeated when we make use of self-reported data on unhappiness including high

blood pressure, being under strain, being unable to sleep, being tired, under stress and in pain. It

turns out that the results mostly go through. A modern literature has claimed that countries like

Denmark, Ireland and the Netherlands are particularly happy while nations such as Germany,

Italy and Portugal are less happy. Yet it is arguably implausible that words such as ‘happiness’ or


18
   The 5-step happiness scale is very unhappy; not too unhappy; neither; pretty happy and very happy. The raw
means by country were; Brunei 4.45; Cambodia 3.34; China 3.73; Indonesia 3.71; Japan 3.70; Korea 3.37; Laos
3.66; Malaysia 3.93; Myanmar 3.71; Philippines 3.82; Singapore 3.99; Thailand 3.88 and Vietnam 3.87.



                                                     26
‘satisfaction’ can be communicated unambiguously and in exactly the same way across

countries, so it is not easy to know whether such cross-national well-being patterns are

believable. Evidence on blood pressure across nations suggests that such happiness findings are

credible. This is illustrated in Table 13 which uses data from two individual Eurobarometers -

#56.1 for 2001 in columns 1-5 and a more recent one, #64.4 for December 2005-January 2006.

Column 1 of Table 13 reports an ordered logit estimating whether an individual has high blood

pressure from Blanchflower and Oswald (2008a) who showed that self-reported high blood

pressure across individuals and countries is negatively correlated with self-reported happiness.

Denmark ranks lowest on blood pressure and France highest. More recently Mojon-Azzi and

Sousa-Poza (2007) show that even with more objective measures of hypertension a negative

relationship between high blood pressure problems and life satisfaction can be observed. They

examined life satisfaction (scored in the normal way from 1-4, and self-reported blood pressure,

including whether the respondent took blood pressure medication, for a sample aged 50+ from

the Survey on Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe. Their main results were as follows;

note that the correlation with life satisfaction was higher with taking medication (correlation=-

.79) than with self-reported high blood pressure (correlation =-.66).

Happy countries seem to have fewer blood-pressure problems. This has two implications. First,

it suggests that there may be a case to take seriously the subjective ‘happiness’ measurements

made across the world: they follow a pattern like the (inverse of) high-blood-pressure estimates.

Second, in constructing new kinds of economic and social policies in the future, where well-

being rather than real income is likely to be a prime concern, there are grounds for economists to

study people’s blood pressure. The results on blood pressure validate the differences in happiness

across nations in part because people can report high blood-pressure in a more objective way

than they report levels of happiness;

     The second column of Table 13, which is taken from Blanchflower and Oswald (2008a,

column 4, Table 5), estimates an OLS where the dependent variable is a measure of

psychological distress constructed (in the spirit of the well-known General Health Questionnaire

score) by amalgamating answers to the questions:

Have you recently:
      1. Lost much sleep over worry?
      2. Felt constantly under strain?
      3. Felt you could not overcome your difficulties?
      4. Been feeling unhappy and depressed?
      5. Been losing confidence in yourself?
      6. Been thinking of yourself as a worthless person?

To the answers to each of these six, we assigned the integers 0, 1, 2, 3 -- depending whether each

was answered not at all, no more than usual, rather more than usual, much more than usual.

The numerical answers were summed, and we term the result a ‘GHQ-N6’ measure, where N

stands for ‘negative’. The mental distress score denoted GHQ-N6, must for a person therefore

lie between 0 and 18. Across Europe, the mean of the variable is 3.6 (standard deviation 3.7).

These six are the 6 negative questions from the fuller General Health Questionnaire GHQ-12

measure of psychological distress. The data set does not provide data on the other six ‘positive’



                                               28
questions. Thus our focus is upon negative affect. The rank ordering is the same once again -

France the most depressed, then the UK, and then Denmark the least depressed. Column 3 then

estimates an ordered logit with the dependent variable whether an individual reports whether

they feel 'unhappy or depressed'; column 4 models whether they 'had been feeling constantly

under strain' and column 5 refers to whether they had 'lost much sleep over worry'. The rankings

were once again in all cases France the most depressed and Denmark least depressed. Column 6

of Table 13 uses a different question from another Eurobarometer #64.4 for 2005/6 - the

respondent was asked whether during the preceding four weeks they had felt 'downhearted and

depressed'. Rankings were the same - France then the UK and then Denmark.

       Atlas and Skinner (2007) examined the prevalence of pain in the US population using the

2004 Health and Retirement Study (HRS) for approximately 18,000 people aged 50+. Among

50-59 year olds, rates of pain ranged from 19 percent for male college graduates to 55 percent

among female respondents who did not finish high school. A variety of covariates in the HRS

such as occupation, industry, and marital status attenuated but did not erase these gradients.

Atlas and Skinner found differences across educational groups, with rates of people aged 50-59

troubled by pain ranging from 20 percent for men with a college education to 55 percent of

women who did not finish high school. Data from Eurobarometer #64.4 for 2006 allows us to

examine this issue across 31 European countries (n=28,000). Respondents were asked: 'During

the past four weeks how much if at all, has pain interfered with your activities? Extremely, quite

a lot, moderately, a little and not at all?'. The weighted percentage for the EU29 average

reporting 'quite a bit' or 'extremely' was as follows, by gender

                             Men          Women
ALS<=15 years                 17            24

                                                 29
The data here are consistent with those reported by Atlas and Skinner for the US - pain declines

with education. I find that pain rises with age in Europe for all levels of education, whereas

Skinner and Atlas found some evidence of that for the more educated but the reverse,

surprisingly, that pain fell with age from age 50 up for the least educated. Column 7 of Table 13

estimates an ordered logit and confirms that, ceteris paribus, pain declines with level of

education and rises with age and is lower for men. Countries with the highest amount of pain

were all from Eastern Europe (Poland; Slovakia; Latvia; Romania; Czech Republic; Lithuania;

Slovenia; Croatia; Bulgaria and Estonia).who all have low rankings on happiness and life

satisfaction equations (Tables 7 and 10).19 Countries with the least pain, in order, are Ireland and

the UK. The French report higher levels of pain than either the British or the Danes. Alongside

the evidence on hypertension the evidence from the incidence of pain does seem a further

validation of the findings from the SWB data rather than the U-index. It is difficult to believe

that data on pain and blood pressure are as susceptible to the K2S3 criticisms that the French are

less emphatic when reporting their well-being.20

      There seems very clear evidence then that the patterns in both happiness and unhappiness

equations are remarkably stable across datasets, countries and however the question is asked.

They also appear to be broadly consistent in other attitudinal questions relating to the state of the

economy, government and even law and order. The evidence does seem to suggest dramatic

stability in the cross country rankings. Table 14 examines happiness and life satisfaction data as

19
  I ran a happiness equation (how much of the time have you felt happy over the past four weeks - never, rarely,
sometimes, most of the time, all the time?) with the same dataset and the rankings of these countries out of 31 was
Poland (17); Slovakia (20); Latvia (30); Romania (24); Czech Republic (14); Lithuania (27); Slovenia (13); Croatia
(23); Bulgaria (31) and Estonia (29). The overall correlation between the country coefficients from the pain and
happiness equations was -.61.
20
   In ongoing work Andrew Oswald and I have also found that pulse rates are also highly correlated with
(un)happiness scores. Indeed, the structure of a pulse equation is very similar to that of a GHQ score in terms of its
determinants. This work is being conducted using data from the English National Health Surveys of 1998-2007.

well as data on unhappiness from a recently available sweep of the European Social Survey of

2006/7. The broad structure of both the happiness and life satisfaction equations are as before –

U-shaped in age, higher for women, the more educated, the married, the healthy and the

employed. We also estimate an equation relating to the respondent's standard of living. The

structure of the unhappiness equations – here relating to depression, loneliness and anxiety –

have the inverse structure. The country rankings were as below – in all cases Denmark highest

(lowest) and France lowest (highest) for happiness and unhappiness respectively.

I explored responses to a number of other attitudinal variables relating to the respondent's well-

being over the preceding week whereas the other questions, as Krueger and Schkade (2007)

suggest, "elicit a global evaluation of one’s life".21 Ordered logits were again estimated with the

same controls as in Table 14: once again they had a similar structure as above. For example, in

all cases happiness was U-shaped in age and unhappiness followed an inverted U-shape. In four

of the five 'happiness' questions, Denmark ranked higher than France while in four of the six

'unhappiness' questions Denmark also ranked lower than France. Countries below are ranked by

coefficient size positive to negative.

The rankings of countries when the questions relate to relatively short time periods such as a

week are somewhat different from those obtained when questions covering the respondent's life

more globally are examined. This seems more consistent with findings with the U-index that

relate to even shorter time periods.

5. The Macro-economics of Well-being

     I have increasingly become interested in the well-being data in the role as a macro policy

maker. In the raw data happiness (and life satisfaction) is negatively correlated with

unemployment (Figure 3) and inflation (Figure 4). It also appears that happiness is positively

correlated with GDP growth (Figure 5 – taken from Leigh and Wolfers (2006)). When a nation

is poor it appears that extra riches raise happiness. However, income growth in richer countries

is not correlated with growth in happiness. This is the Easterlin hypothesis (Easterlin, 1974) and

is illustrated in Figure 6, which uses data from the 1995/2000 World Values Survey; the slope of

the function for western countries is approximately horizontal.

     There is a small body of literature which uses SWB data across countries and through time

to estimate a 'misery index'. Di Tella, McCulloch and Oswald (2001, 2003) and Di Tella, and

MacCulloch (2007) use life satisfaction data to show that people are happier when both inflation

and unemployment are low. They all find that unemployment depresses well-being more than

does inflation. Di Tella and MacCulloch (2007) suggest that left-wing individuals care more



                                                  32
about unemployment relative to inflation than right-wingers. Wolfers (2003) has also shown that

greater macro volatility undermines wellbeing.

      Table 15 uses aggregate life satisfaction data by country*year cell from the World

Database of Happiness, with the dependent variable the score on a 4-step scale. Results are

reported without a lagged dependent variable in columns 1 and 3 and with one added in columns

2 and 4, but this has little effect on the results. In columns 3 and 4, GDP per capita is added in

US dollars but is always insignificant once controls for unemployment and inflation are included.

The rank ordering of countries, once again is France, the UK, the USA with Denmark highest.

Both unemployment and inflation lower happiness.                  A one percentage point increase in

unemployment has a larger impact than a one percentage point increase in inflation in all four

columns. If GDP per capita is included without controls for inflation or unemployment but with

country and year dummies it enters positively and significantly. If an additional term is included

where GDP is interacted with a poor country dummy the results were as follows with T-statistics

in parentheses.22

                          Without a lagged                  With a lagged
                         dependent variable               dependent variable
GDPt                     .000016 (11.84)                  .00000247 (2.12)
GDP poor countryt        .0000287 (6.46)                  .00000746 (2.14)

Both terms are significant and positive but the slope for the richer countries is less steep than

found for the poorer countries – there is diminishing marginal utility of income. This is the

Easterlin effect. This does suggest that rising GDP per capita raises happiness less for the

developed than for the developing countries which is consistent with the findings of Deaton

(2008) who argues that "it is not true that there is some critical level of GDP per capita above

22
  'Poor' is defined here as having 2004 GDP per capita of <$20,000 which includes the Czech Republic ($6,263);
Hungary ($5,626); Italy ($19,506); Mexico ($6,006); Poland ($5,032); Portugal ($11090); Slovakia ($4,483) and
Spain ($15,403) with GDP per capita in $US in parentheses.



                                                     33
which income has no further effect on happiness" (2007, pp. 16-17). It is also consistent with

the findings of Helliwell (2003, p. 345) who uses data from the first three sweeps of the WVS

and finds that in a life satisfaction equation across countries "national average income also has

diminishing returns, since the logarithm of average per capita income takes a positive coefficient,

while the square takes a negative coefficient". This result is different from the findings of

Easterlin (1974, 1995) that happiness does not increase for long time spans despite large

increases in income. Consistent with this result is the fact that happiness levels for a number of

EU countries have increased over time. Indeed, in the pooled Eurobarometers 1973-2006 micro-

data files if we simply regress life satisfaction in an OLS on a time trend only there is a

significant upward trend in life satisfaction for ten countries - Denmark, the UK, France, Finland,

Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Italy. There is a negative trend for

Portugal, Germany and Belgium and no significant trend for Austria and Greece.23

      Table 16 uses micro data on over 700,000 individuals from fifteen countries for which I

have long time series of inflation data back to the 1950s (Austria; Belgium; Denmark; Finland;

France; Germany; Greece; Ireland; Italy; Netherlands; Norway; Portugal; Spain; Sweden and the

UK) drawn from the Eurobarometers from 1973-2006 and reported in Blanchflower (2007). As

in Table 15 which uses macro data, controls are included for the unemployment rates and the

inflation rate, but here standard errors are clustered at the country*year cell. Once again both

macro variables enter negatively and the ranking is Denmark, UK and finally France the lowest.

Column 2 adds the variable reflecting the average annual inflation experience of each individual

in our sample given their age, country, and year the life satisfaction survey was conducted; this


23
  Data are available from 1973-2006 for Belgium, France, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg,
Netherlands and the UK. For 1981-2006 for Greece, 1985-2006 for Portugal and Spain and from 1995-2006 for
Austria, Finland and Sweden.



                                                   34
term is insignificant. Column 3 substitutes the average annual experience term, for the highest

annual inflation rate experienced by each individual over their adult life. This term is negatively

signed and significant, and its inclusion has essentially no effect on either the coefficients on

inflation or unemployment. An individual who has experienced high inflation in the past has

lower happiness today, even holding constant today’s inflation and unemployment rates.

Unemployment appears to be more costly than inflation in terms of its impact on wellbeing. In

Blanchflower (2007) I used these data to estimate a misery-index which measures the relative

effect of a one percentage point increase in unemployment compared with a one percentage point

increase in inflation. The estimates imply individuals weight the loss from unemployment 1.6

times more than the loss in well-being from inflation.24 Columns 4 and 5 of the table provide

separate estimates for those under forty and those ages 40 and older. Interestingly, for the

younger group the misery index is close to 1.4, whereas for the older group it is approximately

2.1, while the size of the loss of happiness for the unemployed is similar.25 Interestingly, the

highest inflation term, which is negative and significant in both cases, is much larger in size in

the former case although its mean is much lower (20.2 and 116.2 respectively).

           In Table 17 I explore the impact of the macro-economy on individual happiness and life

satisfaction using self-reported views on unemployment, inflation and inequality using data from

three recent Eurobarometers from 2006 and 2007. The results are very similar to those based on

24
   The misery-index is calculated in Blanchflower (2007) as the coefficient on the unemployment rate plus the loss
for the unemployed themselves, divided by the coefficient on the inflation rate. The loss to the individual from being
unemployed can be calculated from the coefficient on being ‘unemployed’ in a life-satisfaction micro regression,
like the one reported in column 1 of Table 11, estimated with OLS to keep the units consistent – we get -.3657. The
entire well-being cost of a 1 percentage-point increase in the unemployment rate is therefore given by the sum of
two components. Combining the two, we have .0114 + .0036= .0147 as society’s overall wellbeing cost of a one
percentage point rise in the unemployment rate divided by .0094. The implication is that the wellbeing cost of a 1
percentage point increase in the unemployment rate equals the loss brought about by an extra 1.56 percentage points
of inflation.
25
     Calculated as (.0102+.0036)/.0109=1.27 and (.0128+.0039)/.0081=2.06 respectively.



                                                         35
using the macro data; we also have evidence that inequality lowers happiness. In the first column

the results from estimating a series of ordered logits are reported with four-step happiness as the

dependent variable. In addition to the standard controls of labor market and marital status,

schooling, gender, age and country dummies plus a number of additional controls not available

in other data files. First, if the respondent is a member of a minority group as well as if they are

not part of the majority but do not associate themselves with a particular group: both enter

significantly and negative with the effect three times larger for minorities. Second, controls are

included to distinguish whether they owned their house outright or with a mortgage, which both

enter significantly positive.          Third, I include a control identifying whether the respondent

belonged to a religious organization which also is significant and positive. Fourth, following Di

Tella and MacCulloch (2005) and Alesina et al (2004) I include controls for an individual's

political views on a scale from 1 (Left) to 10 (Right) and show that right wingers are happiest.

Finally, I include three variables based on an individual's response to a question asking what

topics "worry you the most"? I include responses relating to unemployment, inequality and the

cost of living (inflation); multiple responses are possible. Unemployment and inflation lowers

happiness as does inequality following Alesina et al (2004) and Blanchflower and Oswald

(2004). Column 2 uses data from Eurobarometer #66.1 which uses a four-step life satisfaction

dependent variable confirms that both unemployment and inflation lowers pay – information on

inequality is available in that survey.26

         Column 3 also uses a four-step data on life satisfaction from a 2007 Eurobarometer #67.2

with slightly different attitudinal questions. Once again the unemployed have lower life

satisfaction,\; happiess is U-shaped in age, higher for the married and for those who own their


26
     Similar results are also found using Eurobarometer #64.1 but which does not contain details of home ownership.



                                                          36
own house and especially high in Denmark and low in Bulgaria. The main difference in column

3 is that now the macro controls relate to whether the respondent believes that inflation is lower

than, equal to or higher than it was a year earlier. Once again happiness is lower when the

respondent reports that inflation or unemployment is higher. Unemployment, inflation and

inequality all appear to lower happiness and life satisfaction.

6. Predictions and expectations

         I recall John Abowd saying to me at a very early seminar given at the NBER, that the

crucial test for the happiness data is whether or not it has any predictive power. Little work has

so far been done on this question, but in some recent work I found that life satisfaction levels in

Eastern European countries is a good predictor of migration flows to the UK. On May 1st 2004

to the so called A8 accession countries (the Czech Republic; Estonia; Hungary; Latvia;

Lithuania; Poland; Slovakia; and Slovenia) joined the European Union.27 Citizens from the A8

nations obtained free movement and the right to work in the UK, Ireland and Sweden from May

1st 2004.28 Gilpin et al (2006) examined data for the UK drawn from the Worker Registration

Scheme, which registers the A8 workers, and computed the number of WRS registrations as a

percentage of the home country population and show it is correlated with GDP and

unemployment. Gilpin et al. found that countries with the lowest GDP per head, such as

Lithuania (2,500 Euros) are more likely to be registered on the UK WRS than those from

countries with higher GDP, such as Slovenia (11,400 Euros).29 The propensity to migrate is even


27
  In addition Malta and (South) Cyprus also joined the EU at that date. Bulgaria and Romania joined the EU on
January 1st 2007.
28
   Finland, Greece, Portugal and Spain opened their labour markets to these workers on May 1st 2006, while Italy
followed in late July 2006. Five other countries (Belgium, Denmark, France, the Netherlands and Luxembourg)
alleviated restrictions in 2006 (Zaiceva, 2006).
29
     Expressed as Euros per inhabitant at 1995 exchange rates and prices.



                                                           37
more highly correlated with life satisfaction than it is with GDP per capita (Blanchflower and

Shadforth, 2007).

       Of interest is whether life satisfaction or happiness is correlated with people's

expectations of the economic situation. It turns out that they are. Respondents in thirteen

separate Eurobarometers for the period 1995-2006 were asked the following questions.

         "What are your expectations for the next twelve months: will the next twelve
         months be better; worse or the same when it comes to a) your life in general
         b) the economic situation in (our country) c) the financial situation of your
         household d) the employment situation in (our country) d) your personal job
         situation?".

Data are available on 15 countries for all twelve years (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland,

France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden

and the UK). Data for the fifteen Accession and Candidate countries (Republic of Cyprus;

Czech Republic; Estonia; Hungary; Latvia; Lithuania; Malta; Poland; Slovakia; Slovenia;

Bulgaria; Romania; Turkey; Croatia and Cyprus (Turkish Cypriot Community) are present for

only 2004-2006. In eight separate surveys respondents were also asked about their expectations

for themselves ten years hence - "In the course of the next five years, do you expect your

personal situation to improve, to stay about the same or get worse?". Life satisfaction is further

reported in a subset of these surveys. We examine three of these responses here.

       Table 18 reports results of estimating ordered logits for parts b), d) and a) as well as for

life five years ahead. The dependent variable is coded as one if the response was 'worse', 2 if 'the

same ' and 3 if 'better', so positive coefficients should be interpreted once again as suggesting the

variable raises the probability of life improving. Column 1 and 2 of Table 18 relates to the

individual's views on the economic situation, columns 3 and 4 to the employment situation and

columns 5 and 6 to their life over the following twelve months and columns 7 and eight for life




                                                 38
over the following five years. In each case separate results are provided with and without three

life satisfaction controls derived from the standard 4 category life satisfaction variable.

Happiness enters significantly and positively in each of these equations. This is similar to

findings by Guven (2007) who found using data from the Netherlands and Germany that

happiness increases savings, decreases expenditures, and the marginal propensity to consume is

lower for the happy people. Happy people, Guven also found, are a) more risk averse in

financial decisions b) expect to live longer c) are more concerned about the future than the

present d) expect lower prices in the future e) are less likely to smoke and f) do not desire to

move within a country.30

        There is a common pattern in the control variables across all eight specifications.

Optimism 1) rises with educational attainment 2) is U-shaped in age 3) is lower for married and

widowed, the unemployed and is higher the greater the level of current happiness. The country

ranking in relation to people's views on the economic and employment situations is once again

France, UK and then Denmark. The British, though are especially optimistic that their life will

improve and the Danes now less optimistic than the French. Happier people, it turns out, are less

pessimistic about the state of the economy as well, unsurprisingly, about how their life will

proceed. These country rankings are consistent with the evidence from the ESS 2002 reported in

Table 8 above respectively, where the respondents report on their current views on the economy,

government and democracy.




30
   Guven (2007) examined data on prices only for the Netherlands using data from the Dutch National Bank (DNB)
Household Survey which is a panel of about 4500 individuals from 1993 to 2006. Data on price expectations are of
particular interest to macro-policy makers. Guven found that happier people expect lower prices than unhappy
people for the next year and also in five years time. Questions asked were 1) “Do you expect prices in general to
rise, to remain the same, or to go down, in the next 12 months? 1=go down 2= remain the same 3= rise” 2) “By what
percentage do you expect prices in total to have risen after 5 years?”



                                                       39
        Interestingly, respondents seem more optimistic about their own lives than they are about

the economy or the employment situation in their country. For example, in the UK respondents

are twice as likely to report that they think their own situation will improve, than think that either

the economic situation or the employment situation of the country will improve. Moreover, the

trend in the former is up, while the trend in the latter is down. The proportion of UK respondents

saying that the situation in 12 months will be 'better' for the economic and employment situations

and their life in general over the next twelve months is set out in Table 19. Annual percentage

point (pp) changes in the unemployment and inflation rates are also shown. There is some

evidence that respondents’ expectations about the wider economic and employment situation in

the Eurobarometers are well correlated with actual (t+1) macro outturns as can be seen below.

                           Correlation matrix:   Annual pp changes
                                                  at time t+1 in

Economic situation              -0.70                 -0.48
Employment situation            -0.65                 -0.45

        Figure 7a plots the proportion of respondents in the Eurobarometers who say they expect

the economic situation in the next twelve months in the UK to 'improve' (inverted) against

changes in both the unemployment rate and the inflation rate.           The responses to how the

economic situation is expected to develop is also highly correlated with other surveys of

economic confidence, such as the GfK and MORI measures of general economic confidence for

the coming twelve months which use the same questions. The correlations are .73 and .85

respectively as shown in Figure 7b. Macro-economic variables appear to impact individual’s

expectations about their own lives and what they expect to happen to the economy as a whole, as

does their current levels of happiness.

7. Conclusions




                                                   40
     There are broadly consistent patterns in the SWB micro-data no matter what data file is

used, no matter which country - perhaps excluding the poorest countries with low life

expectancy. Results using data on well-being seem very similar to the results obtained from

NTA - and potentially more stable as sample sizes are often large. Happiness appears to be a) U-

shaped in age, b) higher for the most educated c) the higher paid, d) non-minorities e) the

employed and f) for married people.           Analogous results are found using self-reported

unhappiness data. However, when such questions are asked in relation to the week prior to

interview the country rankings are quite different and seem more consistent with findings with

the U-index that relate to fifteen minute intervals.

     Responses on blood pressure and pain appear to validate the happiness and life satisfaction

data as they are likely less subject to any cultural and language differences which might arise, for

example, if the French are less emphatic when reporting their well-being. Happy people and

happy countries seem to have fewer blood-pressure and pain problems.

       There are long consistent time runs of data available for macro-economic analysis dating

back to the early 1970s. Well-being across nations is correlated with the unemployment rate, the

current inflation rate and the highest inflation rate in a person's adult life as well as GDP growth

rates especially in poorer countries.      Happiness and life satisfaction data help to forecast

including migration flows. Happy people are particularly optimistic about the prospects for the

economy.

       There are a number of SWB measures that can and already are being used in one form or

another as an NHI. These seem to correlate strongly with other macro measures including the

unemployment rate, the inflation rate, and even the suicide rate. The simplest and most widely

available SWB measure is apparently the 4-step life satisfaction index which is already available




                                                 41
in similar form in ongoing annual surveys for all EU countries collected by the EU Commission

as well as in most Latin American countries. The fact that so much harmonized cross-country

data are already available of this type is the singular attraction for this one measure. The one

country where suitable data are unavailable is the United States, although 3-step happiness data

have been available for many years in the General Social Surveys, which is quite small in size

and now only collected bi-annually.31 I recommend that a 4-step life satisfaction plus a 3-step

happiness question as soon as possible are included at regular intervals in one or more large

national surveys in the US such as the Current Population Survey. The CPS is an obvious place

to include it as it could be asked on more than one occasion to the same individual perhaps in the

first and last rotation groups which would permit panel data analysis to be done over time for the

same individuals. Such work has been possible in the UK using the BHPS and in Germany using

the GSOEP but not to my knowledge in the USA. This needs to change.

        Work on NTA appears to be an important complement to this work, but the 4-step life

satisfaction NHI in my view should be its starting point. Obviously nations have different

languages and cultures, and in principle this may cause biases in happiness surveys. K2S3 have

identified that there appears to be a bias when comparing results from France with those from the

US. They found that, on average, the French spent their days in a more positive mood and more

of their time engaged in activities that tend to yield more pleasure than do Americans. The

Americans seem to be more emphatic when reporting their well-being. Despite this, there are

considerable similarities between the findings from the U-index and those from happiness and

life satisfaction data. We are all trying to get utility proxy data for the u in the conventional

utility function u(y), and in principle this is complementary to normal economics, not a rival to

from a number of small Gallup polls for the years 1991, 1997 and 2002-2004.

it. 'Happiness data' no doubt have weaknesses but it seems unlikely they contain no useful

information. A standard equation structure has now been replicated hundreds of times in a large

number of nations, so we need to get to the bottom of it. Plus income comes in positive and

concave; inflation and unemployment hurt; etc; and all this seems to make sense to economists.

There are thus interesting regularities in wellbeing data. Whatever they mean, and whatever

criticisms one might have of such data, it seems worth economists and others attempting to

understand why these patterns exist.      It is good scientifically if rather different subjective

wellbeing measures give similar equation structures. They seem to.

       A big question going forward is how to incorporate the findings from national time use

with those from the subjective well-being literature. Of interest will be whether there are

differences, for example, between countries who speak the same language such as the UK,

Australia, Canada and New Zealand. Are there significant differences between the results

obtained from NTA and SWB in other countries besides the US and France? If happiness is U-

shaped in age, to what extent is the time use of the young different from that of the old? What is

it that makes people unhappy in middle-age? Nations have different languages and cultures, and

in principle that may cause biases, perhaps large ones, in happiness surveys. At this point in

research on subjective well-being, the size of any bias is not known, and there is no accepted

way to correct the data, but progress is being made. NTA and SWB appear to be complements

rather than substitutes. There is still much work to be done.

Notes: The dependent variable in column 1 is a measure of reported problems of high blood-pressure. The question that forms the dependent variable is,
“Would you say that you have not at all, no more than usual, rather more than usual, much more than usual...had problems of high blood pressure?” where 1=not
at all; 2=no more than usual; 3=rather more than usual; 4=much more than usual. The dependent variable in column 2 is a psychological distress score measured
on a scale from 0 to 18. A GHQ-N6 score amalgamates answers to six questions: Have you recently: Lost much sleep over worry? Felt constantly under strain?
Felt you could not overcome your difficulties? Been feeling unhappy and depressed? Been losing confidence in yourself? Been thinking of yourself as a
worthless person? Its mean in the sample is 3.6 (s.d. =3.7). The dependent variable in columns 3-5 are in order a) column 3 = 'Would you say that you have not at
all, no more than usual, rather more than usual, much more than usual...been feeling unhappy and depressed?' b) column 4 = 'Would you say that you have not at
all, no more than usual, rather more than usual, much more than usual... been feeling constantly under strain?' c) column 5 = 'Would you say that you have not at
all, no more than usual, rather more than usual, much more than usual.. 'Would you say that you have not at all, no more than usual, rather more than usual, much
more than usual... 'lost much sleep over worry?'

Personal controls are also included in columns 1-5 are 10 dummy variables relating to the individual's experiences before the age of 18; 16 labour-force status
dummies; and 8 marital-status dummies. Belgium is the excluded nation.

The dependent variable in Column 6 models the following question 'These questions are about how you feel and how things have been with you during the past 4
weeks. For each question, please give the one answer that comes closest to the way you have been feeling...How much of the time during the past 4 weeks have
you felt downhearted and depressed? All the time, most of the time, sometimes, rarely, never. In column 7 the question is 'During the past four weeks how
much if at all, has pain interfered with your activities? Extremely, quite a lot, moderately, a little and not at all? In empirical estimation we reversed the ordering.

Personal controls included in columns 6 and 7 are 16 labour-force status dummies; and 8 marital-status dummies. Belgium is the excluded nation. T-statistics
are in parentheses.
