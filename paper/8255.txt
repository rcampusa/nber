1 Introduction

Monetary policy is inevitably conducted under considerable uncertainty about the state of the
economy and the nature of recent disturbances, and analyses of optimal policy that take no ac-
count of this are therefore of doubtful practical utility. However, in the case of purely backward-
looking models of the kind exclusively used by central banks prior to the 1990s, powerful general
principles for efficient estimation of the state of the economy and for determining the optimal
use to make of such estimates have been well-understood since at least the 1970s. In the case
of a linear economic model, a quadratic loss function for the policymaker, and uncertainty only
about the state of the economy (that is, the current values of certain additive terms in the
economic model), a principle of certainty equivalence applies: the optimal policy is the same as
if the state were fully observable, except that one responds to an efficient estimate of the state
vector rather than to its actual value. Furthermore, a separation principle applies, according to
which the determination of the optimal response coefficients to be applied to one‚Äôs estimate of
the state of the economy (the optimization problem) and the estimation of the current state of
the economy (the estimation or signal-extraction problem) can be treated as separate problems.
The optimal response coefficients are independent of the specification of the central bank‚Äôs in-
complete information; and the optimal weights to place on alternative indicators in estimating
the state vector are independent of the central bank‚Äôs objective function.1
      This paper contributes to a program (initiated in Svensson and Woodford [12]) that seeks
to determine the extent to which similar methods may be applied in the context of the sort
of forward-looking models that are now widely used by central banks in policy simulations.
Forward-looking models ‚Äî that is, models in which the state of the economy is determined,
among other factors, by expectations regarding the economy‚Äôs future state ‚Äî raise non-trivial
complications not contemplated in the standard treatments of the 1970s. In [12], we consider
a general class of linear-quadratic models, in which the private sector and the central bank
are assumed to have the same partial information about the state of the economy. In this
special case, we are able to establish that both certainty equivalence and a separation principle
still obtain, when properly interpreted. We furthermore exhibit useful general formulas for
computation of the optimal policy response coefficients and efficient estimates of the state of the
economy in the context of a forward-looking (rational-expectations) model.
      In the present paper, we instead consider the additional complications that arise in the
  1
      Important early treatments include Chow [3], Kalchbrenner and Tinsley [5], and Leroy and Waud [6].


                                                      1
case of a particular type of asymmetry between the information available to the central bank
and that available to the private sector. The general problem of optimal policy in the case
of asymmetric information appears to be quite difficult, so we here restrict our analysis to a
particular, relatively simple case, that is nonetheless of considerable interest.2 This is the case
in which the private sector has complete information about the current state of the economy,
while the central bank observes only a particular set of indicators, which are also contaminated
by ‚Äúnoise‚Äù that is unrelated to the fundamental determinants of the state variables that matter
for its optimization problem.
       One may or may not believe that central banks typically possess less information about the
state of the economy than does the private sector. However, there is at least one important
argument for the appeal of this assumption. This is that it is the only case in which it is
intellectually coherent to assume a common information set for all members of the private sector,
so that the model‚Äôs equations can be expressed in terms of aggregative equations that refer to
only a single ‚Äúprivate sector information set,‚Äù while at the same time these model equations
are treated as structural, and hence invariant under the alternative policies that are considered
in the central bank‚Äôs optimization problem. It does not make sense that any state variables
should matter for the determination of economically relevant quantities (that is, relevant to
the central bank‚Äôs objectives), if they are not known to anyone in the private sector. But if all
private agents are to have a common information set, they must then have full information about
the relevant state variables.3 It does not follow from this reasoning, of course, that it is more
accurate to assume that all private agents have superior information to that of the central bank;
it follows only that this case is one in which the complications resulting from partial information
are especially tractable. The development of methods for characterizing optimal policy when
different private agents have different information sets remains an important topic for further
research.4
       In this paper, we characterize both (Markov-perfect) equilibria in which the central bank op-
timizes under discretion and the optimal policy under commitment, giving particular attention
   2
      Examples of recent applications of the kind of general analysis offered here to particular problems include
Aoki [1], [2] and Dotsey and Hornstein [4]. The appendix to [4] independently derives some of the results presented
in section 2 below for the case of discretionary policy, building upon the analysis in Svensson and Woodford [12]
as we do. Here we also treat the more difficult case of optimal policy under commitment.
    3
      The kind of optimal policy problem treated in [12] is therefore not one for which rigorous microfoundations
can be supplied. Relations such as the Lucas [7] aggregate supply equation, which appear to be of the form
considered in that paper, are actually not fully structural; for they involve coefficients that are not invariant to
changes in the policy regime, as Lucas stresses.
    4
      Important early studies that develop methods for characterizing rational expectations equilibria in which
different private agents have different information sets include Townsend [14] Pearlman [9], and Sargent [10].

to the optimal filtering problem of the central bank in each case. Our main results are parallel
in both cases. We establish a certainty-equivalence principle once again: optimal instrument
settings satisfy a feedback rule in which the coefficients (describing optimal central-bank re-
sponses to the bank‚Äôs estimates of the state of the economy) are independent of the nature of
the bank‚Äôs partial information (though the estimates that the bank responds to depend upon
this). On the other hand, we cannot obtain a separation principle of the sort obtained in the
full information case, or in the case of symmetric partial information treated in [12]. The central
bank‚Äôs optimal estimates of the unobserved state variables (used as inputs to the feedback rules
just described) are in general not independent of the objective function that it seeks to minimize.
Furthermore, the complete equilibrium evolution of the state of the economy, given the path
of the central bank‚Äôs estimates, can no longer be derived independently of the specification of
the bank‚Äôs partial information and hence of the filter that it uses to derive its estimates. In
this respect, asymmetric information results in complexities that do not arise in the case of
symmetric partial information.
   In section 2, we set out the class of linear-quadratic models with which we are concerned,
and then consider optimization under discretion. Section 3 presents corresponding results for
the case of optimal policy with commitment. Finally, section 4 illustrates how our framework
applies to the optimal policy problem considered by Aoki [1] and [2].


2 Optimization under discretion

We begin with an exposition of the general linear-quadratic framework that we assume through-
out this paper, and then characterize optimizing policy under discretion.


2.1 The framework

We consider a linear model of an economy, in which a vector of state variables are determined by
a system of structural equations intended to represent the conditions for rational-expectations
equilibrium given optimizing private-sector behavior. We do not explicitly describe the op-
timization problems of private agents that underlie these equations, but we note that such
optimization results in the presence of forward-looking terms (that is, conditional expectations)
in the structural equations, and we take care to specify the common information set of all agents
in the private sector, with respect to which these conditional expectations are defined. The op-
timization problem of the central bank (or more generally, the policymaker) is instead described

                                                3
explicitly; in this problem the structural equations resulting from private-sector optimization
appear as constraints. We also take care to specify the information set of the central bank,
which differs from that of the private sector.
    The structural equations are given by a system of the form
                             Ô£Æ               Ô£π      Ô£Æ            Ô£π              Ô£Æ       Ô£π
                             Ô£Ø    Xt+1       Ô£∫      Ô£Ø Xt Ô£∫                      Ô£Ø ut+1 Ô£∫
                             Ô£∞               Ô£ª = AÔ£∞              Ô£ª + Bit + Ô£∞            Ô£ª,                  (2.1)
                                 EÃÉEt xt+1              xt                          0

where Xt is a vector of nX predetermined variables in period t, xt is a vector of nx forward-
looking variables, it is (a vector of) the central bank‚Äôs ni policy instrument(s), ut is a vector of nX
iid shocks with mean zero and covariance matrix Œ£uu , and A, B and EÃÉ are matrices of appropriate
dimension.5 The nx √ónx matrix EÃÉ (which should not be confused with the expectations operator
E[¬∑]) may be singular (this is a slight generalization of common formulations in which EÃÉ is the
identity matrix).
    We let Et zœÑ denote the rational expectation (the best estimate) of any variable zœÑ in period
œÑ , given private-sector information in period t. We will assume that the private-sector has full
information, Itf , so Et zœÑ ‚â° E[zœÑ |Itf ]. We let zœÑ |t denote the rational expectation (the best
estimate) of zœÑ given the central-bank information in period t. We let It denote central-bank
information in period t, so zœÑ |t ‚â° E[zœÑ |It ]. The information is further specified below.
    We let Yt denote a vector of nY target variables given by
                                                    Ô£Æ             Ô£π
                                                    Ô£Ø Xt Ô£∫
                                             Yt = C Ô£∞             Ô£ª + Ci it ,                               (2.2)
                                                            xt

where C and Ci are matrices of appropriate dimension. We then let the quadratic form

                                                 Lt = Yt0 W Yt                                              (2.3)

be the central bank‚Äôs period loss function, where W is a positive-semidefinite weighting matrix.
    Let the vector of nZ observable variables, Zt , be given by
                                                        Ô£Æ            Ô£π
                                                        Ô£Ø Xt Ô£∫
                                             Zt = D Ô£∞                Ô£ª + vt ,                               (2.4)
                                                             xt
   5
     In [12], we also allow the structural equations (2.1) that determine Xt and xt to also include general linear
terms involving the estimates Xt|t and xt|t of the state of the economy based on partial information (of a kind
specified below). However, the presence of such terms makes less sense when (as here) we assume that only
the central bank has partial information. Equations (2.1) indicate how the state variables are determined by
private-sector behavior given the central bank‚Äôs instrument settings it , and the beliefs of the central bank (as
opposed to those of the private sector) are not obviously relevant. Similar methods to those expounded here can
be employed even in the presence of the additional terms, but at the cost of additional algebraic complexity.


                                                            4
where vt , the vector of noise, is iid with mean zero and covariance matrix Œ£vv . Central-bank
information It in period t is given by

                           It = {ZœÑ , œÑ ‚â§ t; A, B, C, Ci , D, EÃÉ, W, Œ¥, Œ£uu , Œ£vv },                         (2.5)

where Œ¥ (0 < Œ¥ < 1) is a discount factor (to be introduced below). This incorporates the
case when some or all of the predetermined and forward-looking variables are observable by the
central bank. The full information Itf in period t, the private-sector information set, is given by

                       Itf = {XœÑ , xœÑ , iœÑ , œÑ ‚â§ t; A, B, C, Ci , D, EÃÉ, W, Œ¥, Œ£uu , Œ£vv }.                  (2.6)

Thus, we here assume that the central bank has the same or less information than the private
sector. The special case where both the central bank and the private sector have the same
partial information is treated in Svensson and Woodford [12].6


2.2 Certainty equivalence

In the present section, we assume that there is no commitment mechanism, so the central bank
acts under discretion. Assume that central bank each period, conditional on the information It ,
minimizes the expected discounted current and future values of the intertemporal loss function,
                                                    ‚àû
                                                    X
                                               E[        Œ¥œÑ Lt+œÑ |It ].                                      (2.7)
                                                  œÑ =0

    Svensson and Woodford [12, appendix A] show that certainty-equivalence applies for the
central bank‚Äôs optimization when the central bank and the private sector has the same informa-
tion. The same proof goes through in the present case of asymmetric information. Thus, the
equilibrium under discretion will be characterized by the instrument being a linear function of
the current estimate of the predetermined variables,

                                                    it = F Xt|t .                                            (2.8)

Furthermore, the estimate of the forward-looking variables will fulfill

                                                 xt|t = GXt|t ,                                              (2.9)
   6
     Note that the predetermined and forward-looking variables can be interpreted as deviations from uncondi-
tional means and the target variables can be interpreted as deviations from constant target levels. More generally,
constants, non-zero unconditional means and non-zero target levels can be incorporated by including unity among
the predetermined variables, for instance, as the last element of Xt . The last row of the relevant matrices will
then include the corresponding constants/means/target levels.

and we assume that the matrix A22 ‚àí EÃÉGA12 is invertible. The matrices F and G depend on
A, B, C, Ci , EÃÉ, W and Œ¥, but (because of certainty equivalence) not on D1 , D 2 , Œ£uu and Œ£vv .


2.3 Failure of the separation principle

We can show that the forward-looking variables evolve according to a relation of the form

                                   xt = G1 Xt + (G ‚àí G1 )Xt|t ,                             (2.11)

where the matrix G1 remains to be determined. In the case of symmetric information, [12] shows
that the matrix G1 is given by
                                       G1 = ‚àí (A122 )‚àí1 A121                                (2.12)

and hence depends only on A1 (A122 is assumed to be invertible). We will see that in the present
case of asymmetric information, G1 is determined in a more complex way. In particular, it is no
longer generally independent of the specification of the central bank‚Äôs partial information.
   For a given G1 , it follows from (2.1), (2.4), (2.8) and (2.11) that the dynamics for Xt and Zt
follow

                                 Xt+1 = HXt + JXt|t + ut+1 ,                                (2.13)

                                   Zt = LXt + M Xt|t + vt ,                                 (2.14)

where

                                  H ‚â° A11 + A12 G1 ,                                        (2.15)

                                  J    ‚â° B1 F + A12 (G ‚àí G1 ),                              (2.16)

                                  L ‚â° D1 + D2 G1 ,                                          (2.17)

                                 M     ‚â° D2 (G ‚àí G1 ),                                      (2.18)



                                                 6
and where D ‚â° [D1 D2 ] is decomposed according to Xt and xt . (Note that the matrix L in
(2.17) should not be confused with the period loss function Lt in (2.3).)
   We note that, as in the symmetric-information case, the problem of estimating the predeter-
mined variables has been transformed to a problem without forward-looking variables, with the
transition equation (2.13) and the measurement equation (2.14); once again, the only nonstan-
dard feature of this filtering problem is the circularity implied by the appearance of Xt|t on the
right-hand side of the measurement equation. Thus, as discussed in [12], with forward-looking
variables among the observable variables, there is a simultaneity problem because the forward-
looking variables depend on the current estimate of the predetermined variables and the latter
depend on the observables.
   Temporarily ignoring the simultaneity problem, the optimal estimate of Xt+1 will be given
by a Kalman filter updating equation,

                       Xt+1|t+1 = Xt+1|t + K(Zt+1 ‚àí LXt+1|t ‚àí M Xt+1|t+1 ),                (2.19)

where the Kalman gain matrix K remains to be determined. The updating equation can, given
(2.14), be written
                          Xt+1|t+1 = Xt+1|t + K[L(Xt+1 ‚àí Xt+1|t ) + vt+1 ].                (2.20)

The Kalman gain matrix is given by

                                     K = P L0 (LP L0 + Œ£vv )‚àí1 ,                           (2.21)

where the matrix P ‚â° Cov[Xt+1 ‚àí Xt+1|t ] is the covariance matrix for the prediction errors
Xt+1 ‚àí Xt+1|t and satisfies

                           P = H[P ‚àí P L0 (LP L0 + Œ£vv )‚àí1 LP ]H 0 + Œ£uu .                 (2.22)

Thus for given G1 and hence given H and L, P can be solved from (2.22), either numerically
or analytically, depending upon the complexity of the matrices H, L and Œ£uu . Then K is given
by (2.21).
   The simultaneity in (2.19) means that the updating equation is not operational. Solving
(2.19) for Xt+1|t+1 eliminates the simultaneity and results in

                     Xt+1|t+1 = (I + KM )‚àí1 [(I ‚àí KL)Xt+1|t + KZt+1 ]

                                  (I + KM )‚àí1 [(I ‚àí KL)(H + J)Xt|t + KZt+1 ],              (2.23)


                                                 7
where we have used the fact that by (2.13) the prediction equation will be

                                       Xt+1|t = (H + J)Xt|t .                               (2.24)

Equation (2.23) is an operational recursive updating equation, which avoids the simultaneity
problem and uses the current observable variables to update the previous estimate Xt|t .
   It only remains to determine G1 . Assuming a solution of the form (2.11), we must have

                        EÃÉEt xt+1 = EÃÉG1 Et Xt+1 + EÃÉ(G ‚àí G1 )Et Xt+1|t+1 .                 (2.25)

We would like to express the right-hand side as a function of Xt , xt and Xt|t . We can then equate
this with the second block of (2.1),

                              EÃÉEt xt+1 = A21 Xt + A22 xt + B2 F Xt|t                       (2.26)

(where we have used (2.9), solve for xt as a function of Xt and Xt|t , and identify G1 .
   We note that, by (2.13) and (2.20), we have

                           Et Xt+1 = HXt + JXt|t

                        Et Xt+1|t+1 = Xt+1|t + KL(Et Xt+1 ‚àí Xt+1|t )

                                       = (H + J)Xt|t + KLH(Xt ‚àí Xt|t ).

Substituting this into (2.25), we obtain

       EÃÉEt xt+1 = EÃÉG1 (HXt + JXt|t ) + EÃÉ(G ‚àí G1 )[(H + J)Xt|t + KLH(Xt ‚àí Xt|t )]

                  = EÃÉ[G1 + (G ‚àí G1 )KL]H(Xt ‚àí Xt|t ) + EÃÉG(H + J)Xt|t .                    (2.27)

Equating this with (2.26) and solving for xt , we obtain a solution of the form (2.11), where G1
must satisfy
                           G1 = A‚àí1           1        1
                                 22 {‚àíA21 + [G + (G ‚àí G )KL]H}.                             (2.28)

   Thus, in contrast to (2.12) for the case where the private sector and central bank have the
same information, the matrix G1 now depends not only on A but on KL as well. Thus G1 , H,
L, K and P are all simultaneously determined, by the equations (2.28), (2.15), (2.17), (2.21)
and (2.22). In particular, since K and P depend on Œ£uu and Œ£vv , so do the other matrices.
   In the special case when D2 = 0, that is, when none of the observable variables depend
directly on any forward-looking variables, L is by (2.17) independent of G1 and hence of K. The


                                                 8
other matrices are then still simultaneously determined. Recall that F and G only depend on
A, B, C, Ci , W and Œ¥, and not on D, K or L, and hence not on Œ£uu and Œ£vv .
   In the case when the private sector has the same information as the central bank, the terms
that are multiplied with the factor G1 + (G ‚àí G1 )KL all vanish in (2.27) (since Et Xt ‚àí Xt|t =
Xt|t ‚àí Xt|t = 0). As a consequence, the terms multiplying that same factor in (2.28) vanish, and
(2.28) reduces to (2.12) as in [12].
   Thus, in the asymmetric-information case considered here, where the private-sector has full
information and the central bank has partial information, certainty-equivalence still applies for
the central bank‚Äôs optimization problem, in the sense that the implied reaction function and
response F to its estimate of the predetermined variables is independent of the variance of the
shocks, Œ£uu , and the information structure of the economy, D1 , D 2 and Œ£vv . However, the
separation principle does not apply in the way that it does in the symmetric-information case.
The estimation is now more complex and, in particular, it is not independent of the central
bank‚Äôs objective and its choice of F . (Note that G1 by (2.28) depends on G, which depends on
F and hence C, Ci , W and Œ¥.)


3 Optimal policy with commitment

Again we assume the model (2.1), in which the private sector has full information, but now
suppose instead that the central bank commits itself to an optimal plan for the indefinite future
at information set I0 in period 0. As in the case of symmetric partial information treated in
[12], the optimal commitment can be derived using a Lagrangian approach to what is essentially
a planning problem in which the structural equations (2.1) are constraints. In the present
informational assumptions, the Lagrangian takes the form
                     (‚àû                  ‚àû
                      X                  X
          L = E               Œ¥ t Lt ‚àí         Œ¥ t œï01,t+1 (Xt+1 ‚àí A11 Xt ‚àí A12 xt ‚àí B1 it )
                       t=0               t=0
                       ‚àû
                                                                                                        )
                       X
                   ‚àí         Œ¥ t œï02,t+1 (EÃÉEt xt+1   ‚àí A21 Xt ‚àí A22 xt ‚àí B2 it ) ‚àí   Œ¥ ‚àí1 œï010 X0   | I0 ,
                       t=0

where in each period t, œï1t and œï2t are vectors of Lagrange multipliers conformable to Xt and
xt respectively. The multipliers œï1,t+1 and œï2,t+1 indicate the value of relaxing the constraints
represented by the first and second rows of (2.1) respectively; the term ‚àíut+1 has been suppressed
inside the first set of square brackets as it is irrelevant for the first-order conditions derived below.
Because the second row of (2.1) represents a set of equilibrium conditions for the determination


                                                             9
of xt as a function of information in Itf (rather than for the determination of xt+1 as a function
of later information), the multipliers œï2,t+1 are in fact measurable with respect to (that is,
depend only on) the period t information set Itf , whereas the multipliers œï1,t+1 are measurable
                 f
with respect to It+1 . (The notation œï2,t+1 rather than œï2t is nonetheless convenient in writing
expressions such as (3.1) below.) The final term on the right-hand side corresponds to the
constraint imposed by the vector of initial conditions X0 .


3.1 Certainty equivalence

The Lagrangian can be written more compactly7 in the form
                                          (                                                                          )
                                              ‚àû

                                                        t
                                L=E                 Œ¥ Lt +      œï0t+1 (Ayt        + Bit ) ‚àí    Œ¥ ‚àí1 œï0t Iy
                                                                                                        Àút        | I0 ,                  (3.1)
                                              t=0

where                                     Ô£Æ             Ô£π                Ô£Æ          Ô£π                Ô£Æ              Ô£π

                                               xt                            œï2t                             0 EÃÉ

We have added a term ‚àíŒ¥ ‚àí1 œï020 x0 to the terms inside the square brackets, for the sake of
symmetry in notation, but now correspondingly stipulate the initial condition

                                                                        œï20 = 0.

(Note that these Lagrange multipliers do not correspond to any actual constraint upon the
planning problem.) This should be interpreted as an initial condition for each possible state in
period zero consistent with the information set I0 , rather than a single initial condition for I0 .
       Differentiation of (3.1) with respect to yt and it then yields the first-order conditions

                                              A0 Et œït+1 + Lyy yt + Lyi it ‚àí Œ¥ ‚àí1 IÀú0 œït = 0,                                             (3.2)

where the matrices Ljk represent second partial derivatives of the period loss function. Note
that equations (2.2) and (2.3) imply that Lt is a quadratic function of yt and it ,

      Here we use the fact that E[œï2,t+1 Et xt+1 | I0 ] = E[Et œï2,t+1 xt+1 | I0 ] = E[œï2,t+1 xt+1 | I0 ], by the law of
iterated expectations.



                                                                             10
so that the Ljk are matrices of constant coefficients, that depend only upon the elements of the
matrices C, Ci , and W.
       Assuming that Lii is of full rank,8 we can solve (3.3) for it , obtaining

                                       it = ‚àíL‚àí1             ‚àí1 0

Substituting (3.5) into (2.1) and (3.2) to eliminate it , and taking the conditional expectation
of both equations with respect to It , we then obtain a system of equations for the expected
evolution of yt and œït , that can be written in the form

Here it is worth noting that U and V are symmetric matrices.
       Let us assume furthermore that the square matrix on the left-hand side of (3.6) is of full
rank. Then we can invert this matrix, to obtain a system of the form
                                          Ô£Æ            Ô£π        Ô£Æ            Ô£π

                                          Ô£∞            Ô£ª = MÔ£∞                Ô£ª.                           (3.7)

We then wish to consider solutions to (3.7) that are consistent with given initial values for Xt|t
and œï2,t|t . We note that the number of variables in (3.7) is 2(nX + nx ), where nX and nx is the
dimension of Xt and xt , respectively, and that there are nX + nx initial conditions (Xt|t and
œï2,t|t ). We shall restrict our attention to bounded solutions, by which we mean solutions in which
for any t, yt+j|t and œït+j|t satisfy a uniform bound for all j. Such solutions necessarily satisfy
the transversality condition for an optimal plan, and since our equations (2.1)‚Äì(2.4) will usually
represent only a local approximation to the true structural equations and true loss function,
unbounded solutions need not correspond at all closely to solutions to the true equations.
       As usual (and ignoring non-generic cases), there is a unique bounded solution to (3.7) con-
sistent with the initial conditions if the number of eigenvalues of M inside the unit circle (that

     The case in which Ci = 0, with the consequence that Lii = 0, can be treated using similar methods, as shown
in appendix A.

is, with modulus less than one) is exactly equal to the number of initial conditions, nX + nx .
The eigenvalues Œª of M are the roots of the characteristic equation

Multiplication of the right blocks of this matrix by ‚àíŒª‚àí1 , then multiplication of the lower blocks
by ‚àíŒª‚àí1 Œ¥ ‚àí1 , and finally transposition of the matrix does not change the sign of its determinant.
Thus we may equivalently write
                                 Ô£Æ                                                        Ô£π

                            Det Ô£∞                                                         Ô£ª = 0.

Comparison of this with (3.8) shows that if Œª is a root, Œª‚àí1 Œ¥ ‚àí1 must also be. It follows that M
has as many eigenvalues with |Œª| >           ‚àö1        as with |Œª| <      ‚àö1 .      Thus, since    ‚àö1    > 1, at most half of
                                               Œ¥                            Œ¥                        Œ¥
the eigenvalues (that is, at most nX + nx ) are inside the unit circle (that is, with |Œª| < 1), so
there is no possibility of multiple stationary solutions to (3.7). If Œ¥ is close to 1 (as will often
be the case), there are likely to be exactly half inside the unit circle. We shall assume this
condition from now on.9 Then (3.7) has a unique bounded solution in which yt+j|t and œït+j|t
can be expressed as linear functions of the initial conditions Xt|t and œï2,t|t , for arbitrary j ‚â• 0.
       Substitution of this solution into (3.5) implies evolution of the instrument according to a
relation of the form
                                             it = F Xt|t + Œ¶Œût‚àí1|t ,                                                    (3.9)

where F and Œ¶ are matrices of constant coefficients, and we now introduce the notation Œût‚àí1 ‚â°
œï2t for the sub-vector of Lagrange multipliers that are predetermined state variables under our
characterization of the optimal commitment, just as in the symmetric-information case treated
in [12]. (We change the time subscript to emphasize that the elements of Œût‚àí1 are determined
at date t ‚àí 1.) Similarly, the conditional expectations of the forward-looking variables evolve
according to a relation of the form

                                             xt|t = GXt|t + ŒìŒût‚àí1|t ,                                                  (3.10)
   9
      In the case of an exact linear-quadratic model, as opposed to a mere local approximation to a nonlinear
model, this condition is not necessary in order for us to identify the unique relevant solution to (3.7), as the
unique solution that does not explode fast enough to violate the transversality condition. But in practice we are
not likely to deal with models that we can regard as exact, and instead assume that the optimal plan happens to
be stationary. In this case, the eigenvalue condition assumed in the text must hold, as there would otherwise be
no stationary solution.



                                                             12
while the conditional expectations of the Lagrange multipliers associated with the forward-
looking variables evolve according to

                                      Œût|t = SXt|t + Œ£Œût‚àí1|t ,                               (3.11)

where G, Œì, S, Œ£ are further matrices of constant coefficients. Substitution of these solutions
into (2.1) then implies that the conditional expectations of the predetermined variables evolve
according to
                                 Xt+1|t = (H + J)Xt|t + Œ®Œût‚àí1|t ,                            (3.12)

where H and J are again defined as in (2.15)‚Äì(2.16), and

                                        Œ® ‚â° A12 Œì + B1 Œ¶.                                    (3.13)

   These equations completely define the conditional expectations of both the state variables
and the central bank‚Äôs instrument settings at all future dates, as functions of the current es-
timates of the predetermined states Xt|t and Œût‚àí1|t . We note that all of the matrices F , Œ¶,
G, Œì, S, Œ£, H + J, and Œ® are exactly the same as in the case of the optimal plan with full
information (and are independent of the matrices D and Œ£vv that define the partial information
of the central bank); they are furthermore the same as in the case where there is no uncertainty
at all (and independent of the matrix Œ£uu defining the fundamental uncertainty). This is the
sense in which the optimal commitment here continues to conform to the principle of certainty
equivalence.
   The system of equations (3.9)‚Äì(3.12) are also exactly the same as those that characterize
the optimal commitment in the case of symmetric (though incomplete) information on the part
of the central bank and the private sector, as shown in [12]. The only difference is that in the
symmetric case, the Lagrange multipliers associated with the forward-looking variables satisfy
Œût‚àí1|t = Œût‚àí1|t‚àí1 = Œût‚àí1 , so that equations (3.9)‚Äì(3.12) can be written in terms of the multipliers
themselves rather than their conditional expectations, while this is not generally true when the
central bank has less information. (We show below that in general Œût‚àí1 depends on information
not possessed by the central bank at date t ‚àí 1.)


3.2 Failure of the separation principle

In the case of symmetric information, we can also take the second row of (2.1), subtract each
term from its expectation conditional upon It , and obtain a set of nx linear relations between

                                                13
xt ‚àí xt|t and Xt ‚àí Xt|t that must hold at all times. (The derivation of these relations depends
upon the fact that the Et xt+1 term in the second row of (2.1) is instead replaced by xt+1|t when
the private sector has the same incomplete information as the central bank.) These relations
can be solved for xt , yielding (when (3.10) is used as well) a solution for xt as a linear function
of Xt , Xt|t , and Œût‚àí1 . Substituting this in turn into the first row of (2.1), one is able to solve
for the complete dynamics of the state variables (and not merely their expectations conditional
upon the central bank‚Äôs information) and of the Lagrange multipliers given the evolution of the
estimates Xt|t , with coefficients that are independent of the nature of the partial information.
This is an aspect of the separation principle that can be shown to hold in the case of symmetric
incomplete information, just as in the case of full information. However, that derivation (detailed
in [13]) cannot be applied here, given that Et xt+1 must be distinguished from xt+1|t .
   However, the second row of (2.1) does imply that

                                          Àú t yt+1 ‚àí yt+1|t ) = AyÃÇt ,
                                          I(E                                                    (3.14)

where yÃÇt ‚â° yt ‚àí yt|t . (Here we use the fact that it must be measurable with respect to It .)
Similarly, (3.2) implies that

                                A0 (Et œït+1 ‚àí œït+1|t ) = Œ¥ ‚àí1 IÀú0 œïÃÇt ‚àí Lyy yÃÇt ,                (3.15)

                                                     Ô£Æ              Ô£π       Ô£Æ        Ô£π

   Again, we are interested in bounded solutions of (3.21) consistent with given initial values
for XÃÇt and ŒûÃÇt‚àí1 . We assume the appropriate configuration of eigenvalues of the system. There
is then a unique bounded solution of the form

                                               xÃÇt = GÃÑ1 (XÃÑt ‚àí XÃÑt|t ),                             (3.22)

                                               ŒûÃÇt = SÃÑ 1 (XÃÑt ‚àí XÃÑt|t ),                            (3.23)

where as usual the matrices GÃÑ1 ‚â° [G1 Œì1 ] and SÃÑ 1 ‚â° [S 1 Œ£1 ] can be derived from the eigenvectors
of the system (3.21).
   Combining (3.10) with (3.22), we find that

                                          xt = GÃÑ1 XÃÑt + (GÃÑ ‚àí GÃÑ1 )XÃÑt|t ,                          (3.24)


                                                             15
where GÃÑ ‚â° [G Œì], and the matrices G and Œì are the ones that appear in (3.10). This equation is
similar in form to the solution obtained in the case of symmetric partial information (discussed
above), except that it includes separate terms in Œût‚àí1 and Œût‚àí1|t (which now differ), and that the
matrix G1 no longer takes the simple form (2.12). In particular, the matrix G1 (and similarly
Œì1 , which matters when Œût‚àí1 6= Œût‚àí1|t ) depends in general upon the elements of the Kalman
gain matrix KÃÑ, and so is no longer independent of the nature of the central bank‚Äôs partial
information.
   A complete solution for the dynamics of the state variables also now requires that we solve for
the dynamics of the multipliers Œût , which are no longer fully characterized by (3.11). Combining
(3.11) and (3.22), we find that

                                         Œût = SÃÑ 1 XÃÑt + (SÃÑ ‚àí SÃÑ 1 )XÃÑt|t ,                     (3.25)

where SÃÑ ‚â° [S Œ£], and S and Œ£ are the matrices appearing in (3.11). It is the fact that SÃÑ 1 is
generally non-zero in this derivation that implies that Œût is no longer measurable with respect
to It . Unless all elements of Xt are part of the central bank‚Äôs information set at date t + 1, Œût
will generally not be measurable with respect to It+1 , either.
   It remains to determine the evolution of the estimates XÃÑt|t . We note that in the present
case (unlike that of symmetric partial information) it is necessary to derive a Kalman filter for
the evolution of the estimates Œût‚àí1|t as well as for the estimates Xt|t . Substitution of (3.9) and
(3.24) into the first row of (2.1), combination with (3.25), and substitution into (2.4) leads to
the transition equation for XÃÑt ,

                                      XÃÑt+1 = HÃÑ XÃÑt + J¬ØXÃÑt|t + uÃÑt+1 ,                         (3.26)

and to the measurement equation

                                          Zt = LÃÑXÃÑt + MÃÑ XÃÑt|t + vt .                           (3.27)

H, J, L, M are again defined as in (2.15)‚Äì(2.18), and

               Œ®1 = A12 Œì1 , Œ®2 ‚â° A12 (Œì ‚àí Œì1 ) + B1 Œ¶, Œõ1 ‚â° D2 Œì1 , Œõ2 ‚â° D2 (Œì ‚àí Œì1 ).

                                                        16
Note that Œ® ‚â° Œ®1 + Œ®2 is the same matrix as in (3.12), so that (3.26) is consistent with (though
not implied by) equations (3.11) and (3.12) for the evolution of the conditional expectations.
   The system of equations consisting of (3.26) then represents a system of transition equations
with a form analogous to (2.13), in which the state vector Xt is replaced by the vector XÃÑt that
includes the elements of both Xt and Œût‚àí1 . Equation (3.27) is similarly a measurement equation
with a form analogous to (2.14). It follows that the optimal estimates of Xt and Œût‚àí1 will be
given by a Kalman filter analogous to (2.20). We thus obtain updating equations for Xt and
Œût‚àí1 of the form indicated by the corresponding rows of (3.17),

                        XÃÑt+1|t+1 = XÃÑt+1|t + KÃÑ[LÃÑ(XÃÑt+1 ‚àí XÃÑt+1|t ) + vt+1 ],            (3.29)

where KÃÑ ‚â° I¬ØKÃÉ.
   Using (3.26) to form the forecast XÃÑt+1|t , (3.29) may be written

                                                  ¬Ø XÃÑt|t + KÃÑ(LÃÑXÃÑt+1 + vt+1 ).
                     XÃÑt+1|t+1 = (I ‚àí KÃÑ LÃÑ)(HÃÑ + J)                                       (3.30)

For a given Kalman gain matrix KÃÑ, a complete system of equations for the evolution of the
endogenous variables is then given by (3.24), (3.26) and (3.30), which apply in each period t ‚â• 0,
starting from given initial values for X0 and X0|0 , and from the initial values Œû‚àí1 = Œû‚àí1|0 = 0.
   It remains to determine the Kalman gain matrix in (3.29). Making use of the analogy
between equations (3.26)‚Äì(3.29) and (2.13), (2.14) and (2.20), we directly find that the Kalman
gain matrix is given by the equation

                                      KÃÑ = PÃÑ LÃÑ0 (LÃÑPÃÑ LÃÑ0 + Œ£vv )‚àí1 ,                    (3.31)

analogous to (2.21), where the matrix PÃÑ ‚â° Cov[XÃÑt ‚àí XÃÑt|t‚àí1 ] is the covariance matrix for the
prediction errors XÃÑt ‚àí XÃÑt|t‚àí1 . The matrix PÃÑ in turn satisfies the Riccati equation

                          PÃÑ = HÃÑ[PÃÑ ‚àí PÃÑ LÃÑ0 (LÃÑPÃÑ LÃÑ0 + Œ£vv )‚àí1 LÃÑPÃÑ ]HÃÑ 0 + Œ£ÃÑuu        (3.32)

analogous to (2.22), where                        Ô£Æ              Ô£π
                                                  Ô£Ø Œ£uu      0 Ô£∫
                                          Œ£ÃÑuu ‚â° Ô£∞               Ô£ª.
                                                       0     0
   These equations are considerably more complicated to solve than in the case of symmetric
partial information, treated in Svensson and Woodford [12]. First of all, the matrices KÃÑ and
PÃÑ are larger (of dimension (nX + nx ) √ó (nX + nx ) rather than simply nX √ó nX ). But more


                                                      17
importantly, the elements of the matrices HÃÑ and LÃÑ that appear in (3.28) do not depend solely
upon the elements of A and D, as in the case of symmetric information. For the matrix G1
appearing in the definitions of H and L is no longer given by (2.12), but instead depends upon
the matrices of the system (3.21) and hence on the Kalman gain matrix KÃÉ (though we show
below that it only depends on KÃÑ). The same is true of the matrices Œì1 , S 1 and Œ£1 that enter
into HÃÑ. Thus, one must solve a system of simultaneous equations for PÃÑ , KÃÑ, and the matrices
that define the solution to (3.21); a separation principle no longer holds. This simultaneity is the
same as we found in section 2, except that now the matrices involved are all of larger dimension.
   The definitions of the matrices in (3.21) refer not only to KÃÑ but also to the other elements
of the Kalman gain matrix KÃÉ. These, however, are easily expressed as functions of KÃÑ. Let us
decompose KÃÉ with obvious notation,

Then by (3.10) the Kalman gain matrix for the forward-looking variables, xt , is given by

                                              KÃÉx = GÃÑKÃÑ.

Similarly, the unique bounded solution to (3.7) allows us to write œï1t|t as a matrix times XÃÑt|t ,
where the matrix is the same as in the case of full information (or certainty). This equation
implies that the Kalman gain matrix for the prediction equation for œï1t , KÃÉœï1 , will be the same
matrix times KÃÑ. Thus the only simultaneity that must be dealt with is the dependence of the
matrices G1 , Œì1 , S 1 and Œ£1 upon KÃÑ.


4 Application: Optimal monetary policy with real-time data

As an example of an application of our results, we sketch here the analysis of Aoki [1] and [2]
of the way in which optimal monetary policy should make use of the preliminary estimates of
current macroeconomic conditions that are available in real time. As Orphanides [8] in particular
has stressed, policy must be made on the basis of preliminary estimates that are in fact revised

                                                  18
substantially in subsequent months. Aoki models this by assuming that the available measures
of current inflation and output are subject to measurement error, while the true values come to
be known with a delay. The question that he considers is how the degree of uncertainty about
the current state should affect the degree to which policy responds to the available real-time
measures. Here we indicate how Aoki‚Äôs analysis could be cast in terms of our framework.
    Aoki assumes that output yt and inflation œÄ t are determined by a model consisting of two
structural equations,
                                    yt = Et yt+1 ‚àí œÉ[it ‚àí Et œÄ t+1 ‚àí œÅt ],                                (4.1)

                                        œÄ t = Œ∫(yt ‚àí ytn ) + Œ≤Et œÄ t+1 ,                                  (4.2)

which can be interpreted as an intertemporal ‚ÄúIS equation‚Äù and ‚Äúaggregate supply equation‚Äù
respectively. Here the short-term nominal interest rate it is assumed to be the central bank‚Äôs
policy instrument. The dependence of both relations upon expectations regarding future output
and inflation introduces the forward-looking elements into the model‚Äôs structural relation that
complicates the central bank‚Äôs optimal filtering and control problems.10 Note that the expecta-
tions in these relations are conditional upon the full information set of the private sector.
    The exogenous disturbances œÅt and ytn are assumed to evolve as first-order autoregressive
processes,

                                            œÅt = Œ∑œÅt‚àí1 + eœÅt ,                                            (4.3)

                                            ytn = ŒΩyt‚àí1
                                                    n
                                                        + eyt ,                                           (4.4)

where 0 < Œ∑, ŒΩ < 1 and the disturbances eœÅt , eyt are i.i.d. mean-zero normal random variables,
with variance s2œÅ and s2y respectively. The central bank is assumed to wish to minimize a
discounted loss function (2.7), where the period loss function is of the form

                                           Lt = œÄ 2t + a(y ‚àí ytn )2 ,                                     (4.5)

for a certain weight a > 0. This is a standard specification of ‚Äúflexible inflation targeting‚Äù (see
Svensson [11]), and can also be justified as a utility-based welfare criterion given the individual
decision problems underlying relations (4.1)‚Äì(4.2) (see Woodford [18]).
    Because the ‚Äúnatural rate of output‚Äù around which one wishes to stabilize output according
to (4.5) is exactly the shift factor in the aggregate supply relation (4.2), the aggregate supply
  10
     See Woodford [17] for the derivation of these relations from the underlying decision problems of households
and firms, and for further discussion of the model.


                                                      19
relation itself implies no conflict between the goals of inflation and output-gap stabilization. It
is possible in principle to completely stabilize both target variables, since œÄ t = 0 and yt = ytn at
all times is consistent with equation (4.2), and also with equation (4.1) as long as the nominal
interest rate satisfies
                                                              1‚àíŒΩ n
                                            it = rtn ‚â° œÅt ‚àí      y .                                            (4.6)
                                                               œÉ t
That is, complete stabilization of both target variables is a possible equilibrium, as long as
the interest rate it perfectly tracks the exogenous variation in the Wicksellian ‚Äúnatural rate of
interest‚Äù rtn (discussed further in Woodford [17]). Under full information on the part of the
central bank, this would represent optimal policy, as this equilibrium achieves the theoretical
minimum value of the loss function (zero each period).11 However, the central bank‚Äôs real-time
information set may not allow it to estimate the current natural rate of interest with complete
accuracy. In this case, complete stabilization is not feasible, and the central bank faces a tradeoff
between the two goals of greater inflation or greater output-gap stabilization.
    Aoki assumes that the central bank‚Äôs information set when setting it consists of complete
information about all state variables known to the private sector at date t ‚àí 1, plus noisy
preliminary estimates of current inflation and output. These preliminary estimates are assumed
to be given by

                                                œÄ ot = œÄ t + ŒµœÄt ,                                              (4.7)

                                                yto = yt + Œµyt ,                                                (4.8)

where the measurement-error terms ŒµœÄt and Œµyt are i.i.d. mean-zero normal random variables,
with variance œÉ 2œÄ and œÉ 2y respectively. These errors in the central bank‚Äôs preliminary estimates
are assumed to be distributed independently of the ‚Äúfundamental‚Äù disturbances eœÅt and eyt .
    Aoki‚Äôs model falls within the general framework set out in the previous sections. The struc-
tural equations (4.1)‚Äì(4.2), together with laws of motion (4.3)‚Äì(4.4) for the disturbances, com-
prise a model of the form (2.1). Here the predetermined/exogenous state variables consist of a
2-vector of exogenous disturbances Xt‚àó and the non-predetermined endogenous variables consist
  11
      That is, an optimal policy would bring about an equilibrium in which the nominal interest rate would
vary in this way. This does not necessarily mean that the optimal policy is for the central bank to set its
instrument according to the function (4.6) of the exogenous disturbances; for while such a policy rule would be
consistent with the optimal equilibrium, it would also allow an extremely large class of other rational-expectations
equilibria as well, which equilibria are less desirable. Other rules, that specify feedback from inflation and output-
gap outcomes as under the ‚ÄúTaylor rule‚Äù, are equally consistent with the optimal equilibrium and can render
equilibrium determinate as well (see Woodford [17]). There is no uniquely optimal rule of this form, since rules
that differ in the way that they specify out-of-equilibrium behavior may imply the same set of equilibria.

and it is possible to write equations (4.1)‚Äì(4.2) in a form such that EÃÉ = I. While it would be
possible to write the model‚Äôs equations in the form (2.1) with Xt = Xt‚àó , this notation would
not allow us to express the central bank‚Äôs period t observables as a function of Xt , xt and
measurement error alone, as assumed in (2.4). In order to directly apply our above expressions
for the optimal filtering problem, it is necessary to augment the state vector to include lagged
values of the fundamental disturbances, so that

The system (2.1) then becomes a system of six difference equations, including two identities.
    Aoki‚Äôs loss function (4.5) also falls under our framework. This is a loss function of the form

Because Ci = 0, we must apply the approach described in appendix A rather than the one
followed in the text, but we are still able to derive a system of first-order conditions for optimal
policy of the form (3.7).
    Finally, the assumed information structure falls under the framework set out above, if we let

where Zt‚àó and Œµt are the 2-vectors of the observations, [œÄ ot yto ]0 , and measurement errors, [ŒµœÄt Œµyt ]0 ,
respectively. Under this specification, the central bank‚Äôs information set at date t includes the

date t ‚àí 1, but only the information about date t fundamentals that is contained in the noisy
measurements of current inflation and output (the two elements of Zt‚àó ). Aoki assumes, as we
do, complete information on the part of the private sector.
    Our results in sections 2 and 3 can then be directly applied. Discretionary optimization by
the central bank (treated by Aoki in [1]) results in the interest rate satisfying a relation of the

                                                                21
form (2.8). Furthermore, the matrix F in this relation is the same as under full information.
This allows us to write the relation in the simpler form

                                                   it = f 0 Xt|t

                           ‚àó
since the state variables Xt‚àí1 may be omitted from the vector Xt in the case of full information.
Furthermore, the corresponding relation in the full-information case is given by (4.6), allowing
us to identify the elements of the vector f 0 . Optimal policy under discretion is thus characterized
by the relation
                                                           n
                                                     it = rt|t .                                              (4.9)

A Kalman filter can then be used to describe the evolution of the central bank‚Äôs optimal estimate
of the current natural rate of interest.
       Under an optimal commitment (treated by Aoki in [2]), instead, the interest rate satisfies a
more complex relation of the form

                                             it = f 0 Xt|t
                                                       ‚àó
                                                           + œÜ0 Œût‚àí1 .                                      (4.10)

                                                             ‚àó
(This similarly follows from (3.9), given that the elements Xt‚àí1 of the state vector Xt are
irrelevant in the case of full information, and that Œût‚àí1|t = Œût‚àí1 under Aoki‚Äôs information
structure.) Once again, the vectors f 0 and œÜ0 are the same as in the case of full information.
Since the optimal equilibrium under full information satisfies (4.6),12 the vector f 0 is the same
as in the case of discretionary optimization, and (4.10) may equivalently be written

                                                     n
                                               it = rt|t + œÜ0 Œût‚àí1 .                                        (4.11)

       Note that it would not be correct to argue on the basis of certainty equivalence that since
it = rtn is the optimal commitment under full information, the optimal rule with incomplete
                               n . The reason that the optimal commitment (4.6) can be written
information will satisfy it = rt|t
without any feedback from a Lagrange multiplier in the case of full information is not because
œÜ0 = 0 for this model, but rather because Œût‚àí1 = 0 at all times. This is because under full
information, complete stabilization of the target variables is feasible, and so there is no gain
from relaxing the constraints imposed by the model‚Äôs structural equations. But one can show
(by computing the relevant eigenvectors of the matrix M in (3.7)) that œÜ0 6= 0, so that the
second term on the right-hand side of (4.11) cannot be omitted. Nor is it true that Œût‚àí1 is
  12
     Note that in the case of full information, (4.6) describes the result of central-bank optimization under either
discretion or commitment‚Äîthe optimal commitment happens in this case to be time-consistent.

zero most of the time, in the case of imperfect information on the part of the central bank.
This is because when information is imperfect, it will generally not be possible for the central
bank to adjust its interest-rate instrument (which must depend only upon the central bank‚Äôs
information) so as to perfectly track variations in the natural rate of interest, and so perfect
stabilization will be unattainable. In this case, there will generally be non-zero state-contingent
Lagrange multipliers associated with perturbations of the constraints implied by the structural
equations (4.1)‚Äì(4.2).
   This does not contradict our certainty-equivalence results above, because these do not imply
that the law of motion for the Lagrange multipliers must be the same as in the case of full
information. It is true that (3.11) must hold, with the same matrices S and Œ£ as in the case
of full information. In the case of full information, we know that S = 0, since Œût will be zero
regardless of the realization of the exogenous disturbances Xt . Thus (3.11) reduces in Aoki‚Äôs
model to
                                     Œût|t = Œ£Œût‚àí1|t = Œ£Œût‚àí1 ,                                (4.12)

for a certain matrix Œ£. However, Œ£ is not a zero matrix. In the case of full information, the
corresponding law of motion
                                           Œût = Œ£Œût‚àí1

implies that Œût = 0 for all t as a result of the initial condition Œû‚àí1 = 0, despite the fact that
Œ£ 6= 0. But with incomplete information, the initial condition Œû‚àí1 = 0 no longer implies that
Œût = 0 as well at all later dates. Instead, it implies only that Œût|0 = 0 for all t ‚â• 0. The actual
value of the Lagrange multiplier will be given by the law of motion

                                  Œût = S 1 [Xt ‚àí Xt|t ] + Œ£Œût‚àí1 ,

where S 1 6= 0. Thus (4.11) makes it a function not only of the central bank‚Äôs period-t estimate of
the current state, but also of what it has learned by period t about its past errors in estimation
of the economy‚Äôs state.
   Specifically, Aoki [2] shows that the optimal commitment involves making interest rates
higher than the current estimate of the natural rate if the bank now knows that it underestimated
the natural rate in the past. The reason is that the private sector is aware of the bank‚Äôs
misperception, and if it understands that the bank will later correct its error, then even when
the current short rate is below the natural rate, the private sector‚Äôs expectation of higher future
short rates will dampen the high demand (and hence inflationary pressure) that would otherwise

                                                23
result. Of course, the cost of fulfilling such a commitment later is a short-term interest rate that
deviates to a greater extent from the natural rate at that time; but some use of this mechanism
can nonetheless improve the bank‚Äôs overall stabilization objectives. Optimal policy is thus
not purely forward-looking, in the sense discussed in Woodford [16]. Indeed, the response of
the bank‚Äôs interest-rate instrument to fluctuations in the natural rate of interest will be more
inertial than is the natural rate itself, just as in the analysis of Woodford [15]. In the case of a
positive innovation in the natural rate, the average immediate increase in the nominal interest
rate will be smaller, because of the bank‚Äôs inability to identify the increase immediately given its
imperfect observation of current conditions. At the same time, the increase in interest rates will
last longer, because in later periods the central bank will respond to its initial underestimate
of the natural rate by keeping interest rates higher than the natural rate at those later times.
Interestingly, Aoki obtains these results in the case of asymmetric information without any need
for the assumption of an interest-rate stabilization objective in the central bank‚Äôs loss function,
relied upon in the full-information analysis of Woodford [15].

A Appendix: The case of a loss function independent of the instruments

Here we consider the extension of our results to the special case in which Ci = 0, so that the
policymaker‚Äôs objective function is independent of the path of the instruments it . In this case,
Lii = 0, so that the matrix is necessarily not invertible, as assumed in the text. In this case,
we cannot solve (3.3) for it . However, in this case we also must have Liy = 0; hence there is no
need to solve (3.3) in order to eliminate it from (3.2), as the equation is already in the desired
form. We can simply take the conditional expectation of (3.2) with respect to It and obtain

                                    A0 œït+1|t = ‚àíLyy yt|t + Œ¥ ‚àí1 IÀú0 œït|t ,                            (A.1)

which is of the same form as the upper half of the system of equations (3.6). The sticking point
is that we are unable to eliminate it from (2.1), as is also necessary in order to derive the system
(3.6) in the text.
       It is nonetheless possible to derive a system of difference equations of the same general form.
We note that in the present case, (3.3) reduces to

                                               B 0 œït+1|t = 0.                                         (A.2)

This is a set of restrictions of the same form as those in the system (3.6), and independent of
(3.2). Let us suppose that B is of full rank;13 then (A.2) is a system of ni linearly independent
restrictions, where ni is the number of instruments. Let g be an (nX + nx ) √ó (nX + nx ‚àí ni )
matrix, the columns of which all linearly independent of one another, and orthogonal to each of
the columns of B (so that g0 B = 0). Then premultiplying (2.1) by g0 and taking the conditional
expectation with respect to It , we obtain

                                            g0 Iy
                                               Àú t+1|t = g0 Ayt|t .                                    (A.3)

This provides an additional nX + nx ‚àí ni linearly independent restrictions, and equations (A.1),
(A.2) and (A.3) jointly comprise a system of the form (3.6). In the generic case, the matrix on
the left-hand side will be invertible as assumed in the text, and one will obtain a system of the
form (3.7).
  13
    This is purely a notational convenience, as our method here can be applied even when it is not. One simply
must eliminate redundant equations from (A.2), and augment the number of columns in the matrix g accordingly.
