                                     ABSTRACT


       It is well—known that real benefits in the major cash transfer program in

  the U.S.——the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program——have

  fallen drastically over the past twenty years.     State legislatures, which set

  AFDC benefit levels, have failed to increase nominal benefits to keep up with

  inflation, resulting in a 25 percent decline in real benefits between 1960 and

  1984.   The most popular explanation for this decline is that state

  legislatures, reflecting the changing preferences of voters, have grown more

  conservative in their tastes for redistribution.     The evidence presented in

  this paper is consistent instead with a different explanation, that

  legislatures have let federally—financed Food Stamps displace state—financed

  AFDC benefits.   A similar displacement of AFDC by Medicaid benefits appears to

  have occurred.   Aside from implying that preferences for redistribution have

  not in fact changed, the results also show that the total transfer benefit has

  increased, as should be expected from growing income levels.      The findings

  also imply that neither the Food Stamp program nor, presumably, any other

  lump—sum transfer provided by Congress is likely to have any effect on the

  incomes of the poor female-head population.    Instead,   such programs will

  merely provide budget relief to the states.

       The   decline in real   AFOC benefits    over    the    1970s     and 19805 is one of the

most   widely—noted trends     in the U.S. welfare system               in recent years.      It has
been used as     part of the explanation for the reversal in the historic decline
in   poverty rates, for poverty rates started rising around 1980.                        It is often

cited in the popular press as evidence for a             growing conservative climate, and
it   is currently playing a role in welfare reform discussions in Washington

over   arguments   for a federally-mandated minimum            state     AFDC benefit.       It has
also been used as an argument against the thesis that AFDC destabilizes
marital unions, for the rise in the divorce rate and the rate of female—
headedness in the U.S. has occurred over the same period that AFDC                        benefits

have   fallen.
         alternate explanation explored in this paper is that the decline
       The
reflects a substitution of federally—funded Food Stamp benefits for partially
state—funded     AFDC   benefits.    State legislatures, which set the level of AFDC

benefits, must     pay approximately 40 percent of the marginal costs of benefit
increases     after federal matching.       On the other hand, Food Stamp benefits are

set by the U.S.      Congress arid   are an externally provided extra benefit from the

point of view      of state legLslatures.      If it    is the         totaltransfer to its poor
that   enters the state utility function (or           the    utility     function of the median

voter), Food Stamp benefits will displace AFDC dollars on                      a   one—for—one

basis.    The decline in real AFOC benefits thus could be a result of the

increase in Food Stamp benefits that occurred over the 1970s and 1980s.
                                      —2—

     This hypothesis has been examined previously by Huiten et al. (1982),

Gramiich (1982), Orr (1979), and plotnick and Winters (1985).     Orr found that

Food Stamps substituted for AFDC benefits on a one—for-one basis while

Gramlich and Piotnick—Winters found there to be no substitution.     Hulten at

al. found evidence of substitution but stressed the extreme non—robustness of

the models that have been used,   The variance in results in these studies may

be, in part, a reflection of a key difficulty in testing the hypothesis.       The

Food Stamp benefit schedule is uniform in the nation as a whole, hence a

cross—Section regression of state—specific AFDC benefits on a standardized

Food Stamp benefit is not possible.   Moreover, the number of time periods

available over the 1970s and 1980s is too small to conduct a reliable time—

series analysis, and the evidence is strong that the states were not in

equilibrium in those years anyway.    The previous studies attempted to

circumvent this problem by using various sources of cross—sectional variation

in the Food Stamp benefit actually paid out in a state to achieve

identification of the Food Stamp substitution effect.   However, the validity

of using such variation to measure the substitution effect is subject to

question and, in any case, the amount of such variation is small.

     In this paper a more direct method of attack is taken.    Cross-sectional

regressions of PFDC benefits are estimated at a point in time (1960)      prior to

the introduction of Food Stamps, and the results are then used to forecast the

sum of AFDC and Food Stamps at a later time (viz., in 1984).     If the

substitution hypothesis is correct, the 1960 regression should correctly

forecast the later sum.   This method, while direct, is also fairly heroic.

Time—series forecasts from cross—sectional regressions are    notoriously   poor
and, in this case, there is    art   additional difficulty created by the

transforoation of the 11.5. welfare system between 1960 and 1984, making it

perhaps unlikely that there has been no structural change       n   the PFOC benefit

equation.     Sut the possibly quixotic nature of the exercise also sakes it a

much stronger test of the hypothesis than has been previously attempted.

     The results indicate surprisingly strong support for the substitution

hypothesis.     Forecasts of the AFOC—Food Stamp sum to 1984 are only artout $60

                                               to a drop in the real AFDC
per month higher than the actual sum, relative

benefit of $120 per month since 1960 (1982 dollars).        When the Medicaid

                                                 is obtained.        The AFOC
program is introduced, a stronger set of results

benefit in 1960 was $200 per month lower than the sum of AFDC, Food Stamps,

and Medicaid in 1984;    but a backcast of the 1960 AFDC benefit from a 1984

regression with the benefit sum as the dependent variable comes within $9 of

the 1960 AFDC benefit.     Finally, almost all tests conducted on 1960 and 1984

differences find that the null of no structural change cannot be rejected.

     In the next section of the paper, the background time—series trends in

the AFOC benefit, and in variables that might have caused its decline, are

discussed.     The models and econometric methods used to test the Food Stamp

                                                                    of the
hypothesis are discussed in Section III, followed by a presentation

main results in Section IV.     A supplementary analysis of the AFDCU program

(that for which males are eligible) is reported in Section V.         1 summary and a

discussion of the policy implications of the paper are provided in the last

section.

                        II.   TIME-SERIES AND INSTITUTIONAL BAQCGROUND



         A relative brief graphical exposition of the relevant trends should

provide a proper context for the econometric work.                The dramatic reduction in

real AFDC benefits since the late 1960s is illustrated in Figure               1 •   As the

figure     indicates,    the real benefit grew steadily into the early 196Ds and

accelerated slightly in the mid—1960s.             But around 1967 or 1968, the benefit

increase came to a halt and benefits took a sharp nosedive, setting off a fall

which continued all the way to 1981        .    Since   1981   the benefit has leveled off

end has remained essentially constant.

         That changes in the U.S. politicsl climate leading to more conservative

policies occurred at about the same time as the benefit decline leads to the

obvious hypothesis that the benefit reduction has resulted from changes in

preferences toward redistribution.             State legislatures, which set AFOC

benefits, are traditionally more conservative then the Congress in any case

and could be argued to be particularly susceptible to changes in the attitudes

of voters.        Nevertheless, there could be economic causes of the change as

well, and these clearly need to be explored.

         One such alternative hypothesis is suggested by the trend in the AFDC

csselosd, also shown in Figure 1.          The increase in the benefit in the early

1960s was followed shortly thereafter by en explosion in the AFDC caseload,

for the number of AFDC families per capita almost tripled over the six years

between 1966 and 1972.          Although the caseload has since leveled off, the

subsequent reduction in the benefit may simply have been a response to the

caseload increase.       As should be quite intuitive, and as will ha demonstrated

formally below, the caseload is effectively the price of the benefit;

consequently, the caseload explosion represented a 300 percent increase in the

price of AFOC benefits.1

     This caseload increase suggests that the states oey have allowed reel

benefits to decline simply in order to keep reel AFDC expenditures by the

states constant, or at least growing in line with income.        However, the

benefit decline wee more than what was necessary to do so.        AFDC expenditures

leveled off in the late lg6Os and early 197Cc and then declined in absolute

terms after about 1g73, as should be clear from the caseload end benefit

trends in Figure   1 ,   A fortiori,   MDC   expenditures declined am a fraction of

state revenues (more on this momentarily).        Whether this should be expected or

not depends upon whether the price elasticity of the benefit does or does not

exceed one.

     Another potential source of the benefit reduction ie the well—known

reduction in the growth rate of real income over the 197Cc.        As shown in

Figure 2, real income per capita in the U.S. grew during the 197Dm but at a

slower rate than in the 1960s and earlier.        Whether this income sloflown is

sufficiently large to explain the benefit decline is an empirical question, of

course, and will be examined below.      eut it is coneimtent with the growth

pattern of per capita state and local revenues, also shown in the figure,

which flattened out markedly in the 1970s.        Naturally, along with the     eloown
in revenue growth came a slowdown in expenditure growth.        Figure   3   shows the

trend in the per capita budget surplus, which indirectly reflects expenditure

trende,   Surprisingly, the budget surplus in the state and local sector

actually increased over the 1970s, implying that expenditure growth declined

by more than that of revenues     (and that there was     no long—term change in

'fiscal distress', as it is called in       the   literature, in that sector).

Nevertheless, despite this decline in growth of state and local expenditures,

expenditures on AFDC fell even more and even in absolute terms.         As a

consequence, AFDC expenditures fell as a share of total state and local

expenditures, as shown in Figure 3.      Thus the decline in the AFDC benefit

could not have been wholly a result of general revenue and expenditure

decline.

      An additional hypothesis for the decline in the AFDC benefit is a

reduction in the generosity of federal matching for AFDO benefits.         t'tchng

rates for AFDC did indeed decline over the period but the reductions were

quite small in absolute terms——from a mean of 58 percent to one of 56 percent

for the regular AFDC matching rate and from 62 percent to 59 percent for the

Niedicaid   matching rate.   It will require a large price elasticity for these

reductions to generate the drastic decline in the AFDC benefit observed.

     The alternative hypotheses to be examined in detail here are those

relating to the possible substitution of non—AFDC benefits for the AFDC

benefit.    The most prominent source of such effects is the possible

substitution of federally—financed Food stamp benefits for state—financed AFDC

benefits.    The Food Stamp program was introduced in the mid—1960s as an option

to the states and grew slowly until 1974, when congress mandated that all

states implement the program in all their counties.         As shown in Table    1   ,   the
AFDC guarantee——the amount actually    set   by state legislatures-—declined
rapidly after the introduction of    Food   Stamps; in fact, the real AFDC
guarantee   was 25 percent lower in 1984 than it had been in 1960.2 On the

other hand, real Food Stamp benefits, while fluctuating over the 1970s and

1980s, have essentially followed no trend and have been approximately

constant, no   doubt because they were indexed to inflation by Congress in

1972.     In any case, the sum   of   real AFDC and Food Stamp benefits in 1984 was

$622 per month, almost 30 percent higher than that for AFDC                alone   in 1960.

       The hypothesis that States have allowed Food Stamps to substitute for

AFDC   benefits in a   one-for-one ratio has several elements supporting it.

First, until    1979   AFDC recipients were automatically eligible for             Food Stamps,

regardless of income, and hence almost all               AFDC   recipients received them.
Since   1979, when .FDC    recipients began to       be certified for Food Stamps on the

basis of their income and assets, a high proportion have still received

them.     Second, in most states Food Stamp certification of AFDC recipients

takes place physically in the AFOC offices themselves, providing strong

motivation for integration of the programs.               Third, the cash equivalent value

of Food Stamps is essentially the same as their market value, making it

unlikely that recipients would be worse off by having food transfers

substituted for cash transfers.

       Nevertheless, the details of the the Food Stamp benefit formula imply

that   simply summing   AFDC   and            benefits together is not quite
                                     Food Stamp

correct.     The Food Stamp    program taxes AFDC benefits at approximately a            30

percent    rate, lowering the net income increment provided by the program by 30

percent of the AFDC amount.          Hence, an increase in the AFOC benefit of $1

would raise disposable income of the recipient by only 70 cents.                   .s shown in

Table 1, the net sum of AFOC and Food Stamps in 1984 is only $505 per month,

only 5 percent higher than the value of AFDC alone in 1960.                  This is a rather

small increase over the twenty—four years, given the much higher levels of

taxpayer income in 1984.
                                        —   12 —



     This   taxation also implies that a reduction in the state AFDC benefit by

one dollar would lower the net transfer to female—headed families in the state

by only 70 cents.       Thus an additional incentive for state legislatures to let

the real AFDC benefit decline is provided.

     A second source of benefit substitution that may have occurred is the

substitution of Medicaid benefits for AFDC.        The Medicaid program was

introduced by the U.S. Congress in 1965 and grew rapidly over the late 1960s

and 1970s, at the same time that AFUC benefits were declining.        AFDC

recipients are categorically eligible for Medicaid benefits so that, even

though not all receive medical care in any given time interval, all are

essentially covered by health insurance and hence should be thought of as

receiving a transfer.      As in the AFDC program, state legislatures pay for

Medicaid expenditures but they are matched by the federal government at the

Medicaid matching rate referred to earlier.        Mowever, unlike AFDC, the basic

set of medical services provided to recipients is mandated by the federal

government.     Although states can supplement the basic set, and can even in

some circumstances put restrictions on the basic set (e.g.,       by limits on

hospital days), it is nevertheless the case that the core of Medicaid

expenditures are mandated by the federal government and hence are not under

the control of the states.

     As Table    1   shows, the Medicaid benefit (i.e., its insurance value) grew

in the early 1970s and declined in the later 1970s.        The latter decline was

the result of sharp increases in medical care inflation and consequent

reductions in service delivery.      By 1984, the sum of AFDC, Food Stamps and

Medicaid was $785 per month, over 60 percent greater than the value of AFDC

alone in 1960.       Taking into acoount the taxation of AFDC by the Food Stamp
                                       —   13   —




program, the net sum   of   the three benefits was $669 per month in 1984, 39

percent higher than the value of AFDC alone in 1960.

      A further source of possible benefit substitution, also related to the

Medicaid program, is the substitution of non-       C Medicaid benefits   for AFDC—

related benefits.   AFDC    recipients account   for only 25 percent of Medicaid

expenditures, the other 75 percent consisting predominately of the aged and

the disabled.   The average Medicaid benefit for the aged is about double that

for AFDC families and that for the disabled is about triple that for AFDC

families.   The explosion in medical care prices in the 19705 led to tremendous

growth in non—AFDC Medicaid expenditures, particularly for nursing home

care.    As shown in Figure 4, non-AFUC Medicaid expenditures per capita grew

strongly all the way into the late 1970s, until medical care inflation once

more generated service reductions.      As concerns AFOC benefits, the simple


implication is that non-AFDC Medicaid expenditures may have crowded out AFDC

Medicaid expenditures and the AFDC benefit itself in the state budget; that

is,   the two may be substitutes in the state utility function.3

      Plan of Analysis.     The goal of the analysis in the next few sections is

to test these substitution hypotheses against the data, and to determine

whether the other possible causes of benefit decline (caseload growth,

matching rates, real income growth slowdown) are sufficient by themselves,

either alone or in combination, to explain it.       The central difficulty in

testing the Food Stamp portion of the hypothesis, which is the primary one, is

that the Food Stamp benefit schedule is set by Congress and therefore does not

vary across the states.     Consequently, no cross—sectional correlation between

AFDC and Food Stamp benefits can be estimated.

    As with Medel      r,    a variation can be introduced to allow for rational

perception of the taxation of AFDC by the Food Stamp program:



Model TIA



            Max   liCE      4-   (F'   +    4>M,   2)                                  (15)




     s,t,           Y = P(B +              QM)     + 2                                 (16)




                  F'    =F—            .3B                                             (17)




which leads to a demand equation under the null of the form:



     .76 + F + M = o ÷ 8(1.43)P +                   y(Y      + (1..43)P(F÷ M) — QPMJ   (16)




     Finally, the influence of non—AFDC Medicaid expenditures can be

incorporated by modifying the utility function to allow a third argument
                                                                     the aged
representing the transfer to non—AFOC Medicaid recipients, primarily

and disabled.   A separate argument is required because the marginal utility of

transfers fo the aged and disabled is likely to be quite different from that

of transfers to female heads of family.                         As noted in the previous section,

Medicaid transfers to the aged and disabled are much greater than to female

                                                                        of
heads, which could be interpreted as evidence that the marginal utility

transfers to the former are higher than to the latter.
                                        15 —




     In   past studies of the substitution hypothesis, this difficulty has been

circumvented in various ways.    Orr (1979) conducted a cross—sectional analysis

in the mid—19705 and regressed the AFDC benefit on the average Food Stamp

benefit actually paid in each state.    The Food Stamp benefit actually paid

differs across states because of differences in family size, non—welfare

income, and the amounts of various deductions in the benefit formula.4

However, legislatures are well aware of the difference between a guarantee set

in a benefit fornula——which holds family size, other income, etc. constant——

and an actual benefit paid out.    In setting the guarantee in the AFDC program,

state legislatures typically consider only the guarantee in the Food Stamp

program in their calculations.    In addition, econometrically speaking,

identifying the effect of Food Stamps by using variation in family size and

other variables requires the assumption that those variables do not affect

state AFDC actions directly, which is unlikely to be the case.     Moreover, the

variation in family size and other variables across states is not very large,

which could lead to unstable results.     A reanalysis of the Orr data by Hulten

et al. (1982) is consistent with this possibility, for Hulten et al. found the

Food Stamp coefficient in the Orr model to be quite sensitive to the inclusion

of additional state—specific variables.     Finally, regardless of the legitimacy

of family size and other such variables as instruments, the cross—sectional

variation in the Food Stamp benefit they induce is unlikely to have the same

effect on the AFDC benefit as will an upward shift in the entire Food Stamp

schedule, as has occurred over time.

     plotnick and Winters (1985) (see also Plotnick (1986)) used cross—

sectional variation in the Food Stamp program in 1971 and 1972, when the

program was not in place in all counties.      The Food Stamp benefit was
                                         —   16 —



multiplied   by the fraction of the counties in the state that had instituted

the program.     However, as discussed by Orr (1979), the states that adopted the

program first were the more liberal, high—benefit states; thus the Plotnick-

Winters variable runs the risk of some degree of endogeneity.              On the other

hand, Gramlich (1982) used time—series variation in the Food Stamp benefit

from 1974 to 1981 to estimate the substitution effect.5           Gramlich found his

results to be quite sensitive to the-specification assumed.              This is not too

surprising for, as Table    I   above shows, the AFDC benefit fell from 1974 to

1981 and the Food Stamp benefit fluctuated with little or no pattern.                In

fact, given the long—standing decline of the AFDC benefit prior to 1974 and

its leveling off after 1981,      it is unlikely that the states were in

equilibrium over the 1974—1981 period.

       To avoid these difficulties, this study takes a more direct approach to

the essentially time—series nature of the hypothesis          (i.e.,     why did AFDC

benefits decline over a specific calendar period?) by using cross—sectional

FDC    benefit                           to the introduction of Food Stamps and
                 equations estimated prior
Medicaid   to forecast benefits forward to a period in the future when states
had fully adjusted to Food Stamps and Medicaid. Pre-1965 benefit regressions
are used to forecast the effects of changes in the caseload, matching rates,
and state income on the benefit, and comparisons of the forecasted nan
benefit and the actual mean benefit are then used to test for structural
change in the AFDC benefit equation over time, and hence for the substitution
hypothesis. Some backcasts are performed as well by estimating cross—
sectional regressions in     1984 and   backcasting the   PFDC benefit      to   1960,   and

some   direct pooling across years is     conducted to    test for structural       change

directly. This approach thus avoids the requirement of artificially
                                     —   17   —




generating   cross-sectional variation in Food Stamps amounts or of having   to
use AFDC-FoOd Stamp time-series correlations in the 1970s to test for

substitution.

     As a method of testing the weak version of the   substitution   hypothesis-—

namely, that there was some substitution though not necessarily on a dollar-

for—dollar basis——the approach is rather weak, for it implies that any

significant difference between actual and forecasted AFDC benefits be taken as

a sign of substitution.   Obviously other factors could have been at work.

However, as a method of testing the strong version of the hypothesis--that the

substitution was actually one—for—one——the approach is correspondingly strong,

for it implies that the forecasted AFDC benefit should equal a precise dollar

amount.   The fact that cross—section regressions generally track time—series

variables rather poorly in most past applications strengthens the nature of

the test even more, especially when the drastic transformations of the welfare

system in the late 1960s and early 1970s are recognized.

                                              AND MEDICAID ON AFDC



        Since most of the regressions to be estimated will be based upon only 48

observations, the models must be kept as simple as possible.                          In the simplest,

the median voter of each state allocates his income between expenditure on the

AFDC benefit and on other goods, conditional upon a fixed Food Stamp benefit

provided by the federal government,                     Unfortunately, the data do not contain

informstion rn the income or the tax price faced by the median voter, so the

mean voter must be used instead as an approximation.

where    S     is the AFDC guarantee for a fixed family size (e.g., four);                     F   is

the Food Stamp guarantee for the same family size;                         S   is the per capita

amount of some other composite good;                    Y     is per capita income in the state

after federal taxes but before state taxes;6 and                       P   is the price of the AFDC

benefit.       P   is equal to          (C/N))1-s),      where    C   is the AFDC caseload,    N   is

state population, and               s   is the federal matching rste for AFDC

expenditures.            Approximating the solution to the maximization problem for                8

with a linear demand equation, we have:

where       I =   I   + pPF         is virtual income, incorporating the incume effects

arising from the federal gift of Food Stamps.                              Conventional theory predicts

that    f    C   0    and       y   >    0.       Here interest centers on tests of the null

hypothesis                  @           1,    under which the demand equation eimplifies to the
                     H0:

following;



                 B + F          a +      p    +    '(Vt +   PF)                                    (4)




Thus an increase in                     F    of $1 will lower        B   by $1   ,   controlling   for income

effects.         Hot controlling for such effects will generate a reduction of B                                of

less than $1.

       As noted in the previous section, a fully rational voter will realize

that the Food Stamp program taxes AFDC benefits, leading to a variation on

this model.

which leads to the demand equation

equation reduces to:



                .73 + F = o + 8(1 .43)P + yCY + (1 .43)PF]                                              (9)




        The introduction of the tax rate has, surprisingly, ambiguous effects un

the level of the benefit.                To illustrate, let               t     be the tax rate               Ct = .3

currently).          Substitution of          t    for .3 in (9) and differentiation of (9)

w.r.t. the tax rate can be shown to lead to:



                                1   +                                                                   (10)




                      + 5P + '(Y + PF) —           F.
where
          B=o                                               The price effect            (8 < 0)         tends to make

the tax effect negative, as is intuitive, but the income effect                                          (y > 0)

moves    it in the opposite direction.                      itreover, the benefit increases by one

percent    from a        unit increase in t because the                       utility       function     now

contains     B(1—t) + F             as its first argument, implying that the benefit must be

increased in order to leave utility at the same level as previously.

        Perhaps more important for present purposes, the introduction of this tax

rate has ambiguous effects on the substitution effect of                                     F     on    B.    While the

tax rate increases the income effects of PF in (9), the same multiplicative

effect of              (l-t)       on B    implies that the reduction in            B    will be greater

than before.

        Medicaid benefits can be introduced to this model in a similar fashion,

leading to             tdel    II.

where       M         is the insurance value of the Medicaid benefit for AFTJC recipients

and     Q        is   the relative price of medical care.7                 The resulting demand equation

for     B    can be written;



                  B=m+P+1Y—F—M                                                                     (13)


where       '1   =    (y   + P(JF + M) — QPMI.              The income effects in the virtual—income

terms are in this case                partly negative            (—QPM)   because the federal             gift   of
Medicaid         is not free——states must still pay a share.                      If,   in   fact, the

positive income effects are                     equal      but opposite in sign     ($       Q),     there   are no

income effects of Medicaid.

      Under the null of                   i =         1,     the demand equation becomes:



                  B + F ÷ M = a ÷          P+              + P(F +   M) — QPMI                     (14)

price of that benefit, equal to the product of                                       (1—s)     and the per capita

caseload       in the non-FDC portion of the Medicaid program.8                                     The demand

equation for        B        now becomes:

where    Y     is the    same        as in equation (13).                      If   Medicaid and non-Medicaid

expenditures       are gross substitutes,                                 0.    Under the null of             =      = 1,

the equation becomes:9

     Once      again, incorporating the taxation of                                 AFOC   results in   a
modification.        Without stating the maximization problem, suffice it to state

that the demand equation under the null in this case is (t.bdel lIlA);

       Testing   the Nulls.     As discussed in the last sectiun, the appruach taken

here to testing the nulls of dollar—for—dollar substitution is based upon

forecasts   from cross—section     regressions for 8 estimated prior to the
introduction of     Food Stamps and    Medicaid. The   earliest year for            which the

AFDC   guarantee for a family of four      is available is   1960 and         the       latest year
for which   it and the independent variables are available is 1984.                      Both years

can be reasonably argued to be equilibrium years, for in 1960 the AFDC system

had been stable in structure and in caseload growth for over a decade and in

1984 the AFDC benefit appears to have settled down after the transitional

years in the     lYlOs.       Thus cross—sectional regressions of         B    on P         and       I

in 1960 can be used to forecast the AFOC benefit under Models I—TI to 1984,

and significance tests can be conducted on the difference between the

forecasted and actual mean AFDC benefit (Model III cannot be estimated on 1960

data because data on             are unavailable then) •   Such teats     will indirectly

determine the extent to which changes in the level of the caseload, matching

rates, and disposable income between the years are capable of explaining the

benefit decline.

       This teat is a very atrong one because it does not utilize information in

1984, and because it therefore teats the joint null of           U1
                                                                      =             I    and of no

structural change in the equation.         It is implicitly a test of the rational

expectations forecast under the null of dollar—for—dollar substitution.                           A

statistically symmetrical alternative is to conduct a set of tests by

estimating Modela I—Ill on the 1984 croas—section and by using them to

backcast the 1960 benefit.         Such estimates obviously incorporate different

information, particularly that on Medicaid, and Model III can be estimated.
                                             —   25 —



Conditional     upon   the   outcome of this analysis, an obvious further set of tests

can be   conducted by     pooling the two years and testing directly for structural

change   in the parameters, thereby         using all the statistical information in the

data.

       The means of the variables used in         the   analysis are shown in Table 2.11

As   noted previously, the       mean   AFDC guarantee fell markedly     between 1960 and

1984, but Food Stamps and Medicaid outweighed            the   AF0C   decline.    The   caseload
more   than   tripled, leading to a large effective price increase.12               The

matching   rate appears to have increased over the period,              but this is a result

of the nonlinearity of the matching schedule in 1960,             to be discussed

momentarily.      Real disposable income about doubled from 1960 to 1984.

Although standard errors are not shown, the data reveal that the addition of

Food Stamps has lowered the cross—stat variance in transfers but Medicaid has

raised it back to the same level as that of AFDC alone.

       The nonlinearity of the matching rate schedule in 1960 requires modifying

the estimation procedure for the estimates in that year.3                 In 1960 the

federal government matched state AFOC expenditures at a 83 percent rate at low

benefit levels, at a state—specific 'federal" matching rate at medium benefit

levels (the mean of which is shown in Table 2), and at zero rates for high

benefit levels.        As is well known from the analysis of piecewise—linear budget

sets (Hausman, 1985;         Moffitt, 1986), the demand equation along each segment in

1960 can be written in this case as

where      p       and    Y   are, respectively, virtual price and income on a segnnt.

Their definitions are straightforward and are not written out for brevity.

Monte Carlo evidence indicates that OLS estimates of (24) can give extremely

biased estimates of the effects of grants—in—aid (Megdal, 1987), for

 P   and       Y         are endogenous.   Although the most efficient method of

estimation of such models is maximum likelihood (see Moffitt, 1984, for an

application to grants—in—aid), the main analysis presented below will instead

use the instrumental variable technique of evaluating the schedule at the mean

benefit for all observations.              The mean benefit in 1960 was in the middle

segment of the schedule with matching rate shown in Table 2.             The implied

virtual price and income are therefore used in all 1960 regressions.               To test

the sensitivity of the results to this procedure, maximum likelihood piecewise

linear constraint (PLc) estimates are obtained as well on a subset of the

models.

                                 IV.   MAIN R8SULTS



     Table 3 shows the results of estimating the 1960 AFDC benefit

equations.   Column (1), the simplest model, shows a significant and positive

income effect and a negative, though insignificant, price effect.     At the

means of the data the coefficients imply price and income elasticities of -.17

and .98, respectively.     The near-unity income elasticity implies that the

share of income devoted to AFDC should stay approximately constant as income

increases.

     Columns (2) and (3) show the effects of entering additional state

variables for region, urbanization, educational level of the population, and

other factors.     Region appears to be moderately important in explaining

benefits, with the South showing the lowest benefits, as expected, and the

West and Northeast showing the highest.      However, neither the urbanization

variables nor the variables added in column (3) are very significant, and an

F—test strongly rejects the significance of the incremental variables in that

column,   perhaps more important for present purposes, the inclusion of these

variables has no quantitatively important effect on the income coefficient but

it does reduce the magnitude of the price effects greatly and renders them

completely insignificant.     Thus the 1960 data provide weak evidence of price

effects at best.

     Forecasts to 1984 are shown in Table 4 for Models I and II (Model III

cannot be forecasted because no estimate of the parameter         is possible

with    the 1960 data),     All forecasts use the coefficients in column (1) in

Table 3,14     The forecasted benefit in 1984 is 5645 per month, far above the

actual AFDC benefit of $344.        But this forecast is only $60 above the sum of

AFDC and Food Stamps in 1984, a very close forecast.          The forecast is

insignificantly different from the actual value, though this is partly a

result of a fairly high standard error of the prediction ($156).          The forecast

of the model under the assumption that voters recognize the taxation of AFDC

by the Food Stamp program (Model       IA(   is quite similar, overpredicting the net

benefit sum by approximately $55, again insignificantly different from zero.

When used to predict for models including Medicaid (Models II and hA), the

1960 regressions underpredict because the Medicaid benefit is about $180.             The

forecast error ranges from $125 to $130 but is again insignificantly different

from zero.

       These 1960—based forecasts provide considerable support for the full

substitution hypothesis, for the forecasts are fairly close given the major

changes that occurred in the system between 1960 and 1984, and given the

fairly large absolute magnitude of the implied increase in the benefit sum

between the years.        Even for Model II, for example, the implied increase in

the benefit sum is $305 ($770 —      465),    and the 1960 regression predicts two—

thirds of that increase.

       The estimates of Models I—Ill on the 1984 data are presented in

Table 5,15    The results are for the most part quite similar to those in

1960.    price effects, though negative, are on the borderline of significance

at conventional levels in most of the models.          Even in those models   (hA   and

lilA) where price effects are significant, the implied elasticities are quite

low   (about 12 percent).    Income effects, on the other hand, are positive and

significant in all models.      The implied elasticities center around .94, once

again quite close to unity and therefore again implying constant shares with

respect to income.     The effect of non-AFDC expenditures,hown in the

estimates for    del   III, are completely insignificant, thus indicating no

substitutability between the expenditures of the two programs.

        Backcasts to 1960 using the coefficients for each model separately are

shown in Table 6.     The forecast errors in general are once again very small,

especially so for the models including Medicaid.           Whereas odels I and IA

underpredict the 1960 AFDC benefit by $94 to $132, Models II, hA, III, and

lilA overpredict by no more than $41.        The best models for prediction are

those which assume rational voters that take account of both Medicaid and the

taxation of AFDC by the Food Stamp program (Models          hA   and lilA), models which

predict the AFDC benefit to be only $9—sb         over its actual valuel     Moreover,

the F—statistics reject     dels   I   and IA most strongly, and they favor idels

hA    and lilA the most.    The standard errors of the estimates are quite small

for all equations.     The 1984 equations are thus even more supportive of the

full substitution hypothesis than those for 1960,          especially for the full

rationality models.

        Estimates for Models III and lilA, the most complete models, obtained

by pooling the 960 and 1984 data are shown in the last two columns of

Table   516   Price effects are negative and imply elasticities at the mean of

about —12 percent, and income effects are once again positive and significant,

implying income elasticities of about 1.06.           An F—test for similarity of the

coefficients overwhelmingly fails to reject the null of no structural change

use of all the information at hand again strongly supports the full

substitution hypothesis.

deduced,    Using the means for the variables indicates that the

price pushed down the benefit by $80 but that the increase in disposable

income pushed it up by $364, the residual ($19) accounted for by the

introduction   of the   non—AFDC   Medicaid program.   The   relatively   weak   effect of
the caseload explosion in the late       1960s and   early 1970s in pushing      down   the
benefit    is consistent with the consistently weak price elasticities estimated

in both the 1960 and 1984 data.        Thus the bulk of the evidence clearly

supports an interpretation that income increases over the past three decades

Models III and lilA, respectively, on the pooled 960—1984 data.           The

estimates in this case are very close to those in the corresponding columns of

obtainable from the unrestricted log likelihoods shown in the table-—are

the previous sections appears to have generated sufficiently good estimates as

to allow all the conclusions reached previously to be retained.

       ffects of Federal Matching.     Given the primary result of the analysis——

that lump—sum federal transfers appear to generate dollar-for—dollar

traditional federal matching for AFDC may be an alternative mechanism to

increase transfers by the states.      As is well—known, the efficacy of matching

in general depends upon the magnitude of price elasticities        and,   relatedly, on

the degree to which federal grants are substituted into other areas of

expenditure by the states.      The fraction of the AFOC grant substituted into

other areas of expenditure is calculated as one minus the ratio of the

                                                            to the federal
stimulus (i.e., the effect of matching on the AFDC benefit)

grant.

       In a prior analysis (Moffitt, 1984), it was found that almost 80 percent
                                                                         that
of federal AFDC grants in 1970 were spent on non-AFDC purposes, implying

federal matching stimulates relatively little additional AFDC expenditure by
                                      —   38   —



the   states.   A similar calculation here implies that out—substitution was 85

percent in 1960 but only 38 percent in 1984.17     The much lower out—

substitution effect in 1984 is a result of two factors,     First, the caseload

tripled between 1960 and 1984; therefore, a given federal matching rate has a

much greater stimulative effect on the AFOC benefit than it did previously.

Second, the mean federal grant has fallen because the mean benefit has fallen,

thereby again lowering the percent substituted out.    Thus it appears that,

currently; almost two—thirds of the federal AFDC grant is indeed used to

increase state AFDC expenditures, making this strategy
                                                       considerably rore

attractive than using Food Stamps to increase the total transfer.18

                                  V.   EFFECTS ON THE AFDCU PROGRAM



        The    AFDCU   program     is a   supplement to the regular     AFDC   program and
provides benefits to            low—income    families even   if an able—bodied male       is
present in the household.              Eligibility for such families is based not only

upon the usual income and asset conditions in the regular AFDC program but

also upon whether the male is unemployed and has had a history of sufficiently

strong    attachment        to the labor force.      The   AFDCU program   was   enacted   by

Congress and made optional to the    states in 1961, with matching set at the
same    rate as that for the regular AFDC program. However, while the ntmnber of
states adopting            the program rose quickly in the early 196Gm,          it leveled off at
around    50 percent in the late 1960s and has remained approximately at that

level    since.
       The Food Stamp supplementation hypothesis explored in the last section

would appear to be           of relevance    to the growth of   AFDCU   as well.    The Food

Stamp    program      is   notable in the U.S. transfer system for its provision of

benefits       to   husband—wife    families, unlike the regular RFDC program,         and hence

the Food Stamp program is closer to being a universal transfer program than

any other in the U.S.            However, the provision of federally—funded benefits to

husband-wife families, the same group covered by the AFDCU program, may, by a

similar logic to that discussed for the regular AFDC program, have discouraged

the adoption of AFDCU program in the states.                  It should be noted that AFDC

benefits to female—headed families and to husband—wife families are required

to be    the   same for equivalent family sizes and other circumstances, so no

leeway is possible to lower the benefit in the AF000 program separately from

that in the AFDC program; the only decision is to adopt or not to adopt.

        A simple model that captores the major factors influencing the AF000

adoption decision is as follows.

where    B     is the common benefit for AFDC end AFUCU families,                           0    is a chznmy

variable equal to one if the state adopts AFDCU end                                0   if not, and     P1   and


P2   are the prices for the AFOC and AFDCU programs, respectively (caseload

times own—payment share).              The parameter              0       measures the marginal utility of

transfers to husband—wife couples.                  The solution to the maximization problem

can be written as follows:



                 =          +          P+                    Y    if 0 =       1                (27)

where         — p1 ÷ p2        is the total price if AFDCIJ is adopted (total per capita

caseload times own payment share) and                     V[p,y)   is the indirect utility

function.

    Our interest here is less in the benefit equations than in the AFDCIJ

choice equation          (3O).           The interesting implication of (30) is that AFDCIJ is

chosen iff                       <
                                      ,       or


              D =    1   iff    S    >                                              (31)
                                          (p2/p1).



Since    P1    and       P2    are both per capita caseloads times one minus identical

                                                      if the marginal utility
matching rates, we can say that AFDCU is adopted only

of transferring funds to husband—wife families is greater than the ratio of

the husband—wife caseload to the regular female-head caseload.                      This result

                                                    and decreases in the
implies that increases in the regular AFDC caseload

actual or potential AFDCU caseload raise the probability of adopting EDCU,

both of which are testable implications.

        The criterion in (31) is notable for its implication that the income

                                                                AFDCU.                       This
level of the state has no effect on the probability of adopting

would seem contrary to any notion of FDCU, and transfers to husband—wife

families in general, as normal goods.                     Clearly this property of (31) is a

result of the specification of the utility function and the linear
                                                                   and
indifference curves between the benefits to female—headed families

husband—wife families, a restriction which may be violated.                      iowever, this

restriction does make the model in (25)—(26) testable by simply determining

whether income does or does not affect AFDCU adoption probabilities

independent of           P1    and       P2.20

Mere the demand equations for benefits (33) and (34) imply that the Food Stamp

program lowers the AFDC benefit in non-AFDCU states more than in AFDCU states,

at least ignoring income effects, as a result of the term —                           OF   in (34)   .   The
source of this effect is simply that non-AFDCIJ states are initially providing

nothing to husband-wife families at all, and hence the introduction of Food

Stamps has an overly strong substitution effect on the AFDC benefit.

to expectations, the AFDCU adoption decision is actually independent

insignificant, as the increase in virtual income

program is about one-tenth of

function is essentially equivalent to that in the              prior   model, as given by

(31 )——only relative prices matter.             The independence of the AFDCU decision

in the particular utility function postulated, and is once again empirically

testable.

     A modification to incorporate Medicaid benefits leaves the model

virtually unchanged.

Ignoring income effects, which will be trivial, the criterion function for

AFOCU adoption is once again the same as            that in (31).

     Econometric Tests.       To test the various hypotheses implied by the model,

a before-and—after strategy similar to that in the last section is taken.               The

"pre' year is, in this case, taken to be 1968,             The year 1960 is not

appropriate because AFDCU was not available at that date, and earlier dates

are too close to 1961 to have allowed the slower—acting states to adopt the

program if they so desired.          The "post" year is again taken as 1984,      the

latest year for which all data are available.             In 1968 44 percent of the
states had adopted AFDCU and in 1984 48 percent had; thus there was virtually

no change between the two dates.

     At each year, probit equations for AFDCU adoption are estimated using as

independent variables the regular AFOC price variable                   evaluated in

1968 on the mean segment, and proxies for the AFDCU caseload.            Since the AFDCU

caseload is observed only for states actually adopting the program, standard

selectivity bias problems would arise if caseload data were directly used.

Two proxy variables are employed instead:             (1) the male unemployment rate in

the state, assumed to be positively related to the actual or potential AFDCU

caseload, and (2) the real weekly manufacturing wage in the state (most

workers in manufacturing are male), taken to be inversely related to the
                                           —   45 —



actual   or potential AFDCU    caseload.       Other variables that may be of interest

(male wage rates, earnings, etc.) are not available.              The means of the

variables for the two years are shown in Appendix Table 0—2.

       Table B shows the results of the probit exercises.           Column (1) shows a

probit equation estimated on the 1968 data alone.            The price of the regular

AFDC   caseload has    a strong and significant positive effect on the AFDC[J

probability, as predicted by the models.           The magnitude of the coefficient

implies that a ten—percent increase in the AFDC price increases the adoption

probability by    9   percentage points at the mean.       The manufacturing wage and

the male unemployment rate both have the expected signs—-increases in male

wages and decreases in male unemployment make the cost of adoption lower——but

both effects are weak statistically, largely a result of the small sample

sizes.    The state income variable is also included and, interesting, is

positive but insignificant, implying that income may have no effect

independent of the prices of AFDC     and      AFDC1J benefits.   Thus there is tentative

support for the model in the 1968 data.

       Columns (2) and (3) show results obtained by pooling the 1968 and 1984

observations.21       Column (2) shows that the price and income variables retain

their same signs and significance levels in the pooled data, but            a   dunmy for

1984 is strongly significant and negative.            A test for a change in the

parameters other than the intercept from 1968 to 1984 was rejected, but              the
significant change in the intercept is consistent with a substitution effect

of the Food Stamp program and hence inconsistent with the restrictive

parameterization of the utility functions in iodels IV—VI.             The source of tne

downward shift in AFOCU     probabilities      is primarily the strong increase in the

                                                             from 1968 to
effects, should have generated an increase in AFDCU adoption

1984.   The failure of the fraction of states adopting the program to grow past

the late 1960s—-about   the   time Food Stamps were introduced--is thus attributed

in the regression to the intercept and hence to a structural shift downward.

     Since PFDCtJ is commonly strongly associated with the northeastern

industrial states, which also have high caseloads, column (3) reports the

results of adding a regional dummy for the Northeast.      The addition of the

                                                                         it

remains significant.    However, the caseload effect is unchanged and the

effects of manufacturing wages and sale unemployment rates increase in both

                            VI.    SUMMARY AND IMPLICATIONS




       This   study has examined the causes of the decline in real AFDC benefits

over the 1970s and 1980s and has focused on testing the hypothesis that states

have allowed Food Stamps and Medicaid to substitute for AFOC in the total

benefit package provided to female heads in the U.S.          The analysis is

conducted by forecasting benefits in the 1980a from cross—section regressions

in the 1960s, backcasting benefits in the 19605 from cross—section regressions

in the 1980s, and pooling data from both periods to test directly for

structural change.      The results support the strong version of the substitution

hypothesis, that for which substitution occurs on a dollar—for—dollar bests.

The evidence is stronger in support of the hypothesis that both Food Stamps

and Medicaid have substituted for AFDC than that Food Stamps alone has done

so,   for some tests reject the Food—Stamps—only model.       Additional results

suggest that the Food Stamp       pr   ram has also slowed the adoption of the AFDCU

program.

      There are several implications of the findings of the paper.        First, the

basic result that the transfer package has increased over time in line with

the growth of income suggests that the benefit will continue to grow in the

future, at least to the extent that income growth also maintains its past

pattern.      Thus thers is no reason in these results to expect any decline in

redistribution.

     Second, the results imply that lump—sum transfer programs enacted by

Congress have no effect on the total transfer, and therefore on the net

incomes, of low—income female heads.     Instead, they merely displace cash

transfers with in—kind transfers.   As a matter of perhaps naive political

speculation, one may wonder why Congress has enacted such a programF the

answer may be that there are stronger political lobbies (agriculture,

hospitals) behind in-kind transfers than behind cash transfers.    Be that as it

                                                                       to
may, the implication is that Congress simply does not have the ability

increase transfers, at least not in this fashion.    Instead, it can only

provide a large measure of budget relief to the states.

     There are, of course, other policies available to Congress should it

truly wish to increase the level of transfers.    As discussed in the paper,

heavier   use of matching rates would provide nontrivial price incentives, at
least   on average. Alternatively, federalization of the AFDC program would

directly   eliminate the ability of states to counter federal transfer policy,

or the establishment of a minimum benefit would constrain that ability.
                                                                for future
Optimal federal policy under these conditions should be a topic

research.

                                           NOTES




1   •   An additional question is whether the changes in the caseload are

        explainable     by the changes in the benefit.    Although an interesting

        question,     it will not be examined here.    However, some research baa

        indicated     that cross-section AFDC participation equations do nut provide

        sufficiently large benefit elasticities to explain more than a small

        fraction of the tripling of the caseloed.        Put differently,    there seers

        to have been a structural change in the AFDC participation equation over

        the period 1966—1972.

2.      The AFDC benefit per family shown in Figure       1   peaked earlier because
        there was a steady decline in the mean AFDC family size over the

        period.     The guarantee is the appropriate variable to examine.

3.      These considerations suggest quite naturally          that a state may lump all

        income—maintenance—related    expenditures    into a mingle pot which

        constitutes    e single argument in the utility function.        The state may

        thus be concerned    in setting only the share of its budget going toward

        income maintenance in general.

4.      The Food Stamp benefit is also affected by the AFDC benefit itself, but

        Orr used an instrumentel variables technique to remove this source of

        endogeneity.

5.      It appears that only time—series variation was utilized because Cramlich

        regressed the AFDC benefit (or a weighted sum of AFDC and the Food Stamp

        benefit) on the Food Stemp benefit and a set of state dummies,
                                                                               using a
                                                 —   59 —



       cross—section      of states from 1974 to 1981.             The    inclusion   of state

       dummies sweeps out any cross—sectional                 variation    in Food Stamps, leaving


       only time—series variation.

6.     It is assumed that federal taxes are exogenous to the median state voter,

       being set instead by the median U.S. voter.

7.     Equation    (12)   assumes that AFDC and Medicaid benefits are matched at the

       same rate, as will be the case for the years used in the analysis.

8.     The matching rate is the same in both portions.

9.     One   could also     test nulls   on     the substitutability of        non—AFDC Medicaid


       expenditures and       AFDC Medicaid expenditures, but this is not directly

       germane to the question of interest here.                  In addition, of course,

       perfect   substitutability        does   not correspond to a value of           1   for the
       utility   parameter      6.
10.    Although it would      be desirable        to   improve the   efficiency of the estimates
       by pooling a       set of years either before or after the transition period,

       this is not practical.        The AFOC guarantee is next available in 1964,

       then in 1968, both years uncomfortably                 close to the explosive

       transformations       of the 196Os and the years in the 1980s earlier than
       1984 are less       assuredly post—adjustmentyears.

11 .   Alaska    and Hawaii are excluded because some of the variables are not

                                           Arizona is also excluded because it               has   no
       present for them in 1960.

       Medicaid program.

12.    The caseload variable is lagged three years to avoid potential

       endogeneity. However, from             past     work   (Moffitt, 1984) it appears that

                                                                             is
       there is little difference in the estimates when the current caseload

       used.

13.   The   benefit schedule     in 1984 was linear, for the states were then

      employing       the open—ended Medicaid matching schedule instead of the

      nonlinear,       convex "federal" matching schedule.         The Medicaid schedule

      created a nonconvex kink in the overall budget set.                 Another reason for

      avoiding the late 1960s and 1970s for estimation is that those years were

      a period of gradual switching from one schedule to the other, and States

      often did not switch immediately when it was advantageous for them to do

      so.     See Orr (1976, 1978) and Moffitt (1984) for discussions.

14.   Forecasts       for the estimates in columns    (2)   and   (3)   of that table were

      also calculated.        Their point estimates were very close to those for

      column    (1)    but their standard errors of forecast were much higher, no

      doubt because of the larger number of insignificant                coefficients    in those

      regressions.

15.   Since     H     is included in virtual income, there is some endogeneity in the

      variable.       However, the Food Stamp and Medicaid terms in the virtual

      income variable are miniscule in magnitude, constituting less than one—

      tenth of one percent of income,          consequently,      the coefficients      of the

      equations are virtually identical when they are left out of virtual

      income.

16.   To test for random effects, a sample estimate of the variance of a

      permanent state effect was calculated for Model III.                 The estimated

      variance was less than zero (negative variances are possible in such

      ANOVA   calculations), from which it was concluded that              the data from the

      two years could be safely pooled and the equations                estimated with OLS.
                                         —   61   —




17.   This calculation uses the coefficients in Model III in Table 5, but the

      mean benefits, matching rates, and so on for 1960 and 1984 separately.

18.   The price elasticity in the equation is —.13 as compared to the —.08

      elasticity in Moffitt (1984).      This is responsible for part of the

      difference between the results in the earlier study and those here, but

      not the major part.

19.   partly for this reason, only the       AFDCIJ    choice equation will be estimated

      below and not the benefit equations.            But in addition, there are too few

      observations to estimate separate benefit equations on AFDCU and non—

      AFDCU states.

20.   Allowing the transfer to husband—wife families to constitute a separate

      argument in the utility function——e.g.,           tJ(B,B,Z)——makes the derivation

      of demand functions for     B   and properties of       D*   intractable,   the

      difficulty arising because the first two arguments are constrained to

      equality.

21.   Given the evidence of weak state—specific          effects obtained in the last

      section,    no error components models were estimated.
