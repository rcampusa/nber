                                            ABSTRACT

Spatial connectivity of renewable resources induces a spatial externality in extraction. We explore
the consequences of decentralized spatial property rights in the presence of spatial externalities. We
generalize the notion of unitization - developed to enhance cooperative extraction of oil and gas fields
- and apply it to renewable resources which face a similar spatial commons problem. We find that
unitizing a common pool renewable resource can yield first-best outcomes even when participation
is voluntary, provided profit sharing rules can vary by participant.

   The collapse of many of the world’s fisheries (Worm et al. 2006; Myers and Worm

2003; Jackson et al. 2001) has led to the search for policy approaches to prevent further

collapse and, perhaps, recover depleted stocks (Worm et al. 2009). The failure of traditional

regulation structures to halt this collapse has led economists to propose various property-

rights based approaches including Individual Tradeable Quotas (ITQs), which allocate units

of harvest, and Territorial User Rights Fisheries (TURFs), which allocate units of space to

private firms, cooperatives, or fishermen.1 Economists argue that appropriate assignment of

rights internalizes externalities and facilitates stewardship, leading to sustainability through

a profit motive.2 In the United States, there is growing policy interest in ocean zoning

and marine spatial planning, further motivating our inquiry. Yet for spatially connected

resources, the spatial commons problem may persist, even when spatial property rights

(TURFs) are assigned, monitored, enforced, and perpetual (Janmaat 2005). This occurs

because most harvested species of fish exhibit large geographic scales of movement in some

part of their life cycle. While enlarging TURFs can help internalize spatial externalities,

White and Costello (2010) find that the spatial scale required to internalize dispersal may

be several hundreds or thousands of square kilometers.3 Ocean allocations of that size to

a single owner are unlikely, and as such, consideration of coordination (or the lack thereof)

between multiple owners of a spatially connected stock becomes paramount.

   While compelling, the problem of spatial externalities in a common pool is not new. Mul-

tiple owners of mineral rights to an oil or gas field, where adjacent owners have an incentive

to over-invest in capital and extract at too rapid a rate, has similar (though not identical)

characteristics. A well-known solution in that context is unitization, where landowners are

contractually obligated to pool profits to minimize redundant drilling and extraction effort.4

                                               3
We generalize the concept of unitization as a possible solution to the spatial renewable re-

source problem. The idea is that by sharing profits, each owner has an interest in the profits

of other owners, and is thus less likely to over-harvest her own patch for personal gain if it

would harm her neighbor. The conditions under which this system works to solve the com-

mons problem is amenable to bioeconomic analysis, and is made possibly only by leveraging

recent advances in the theory of spatial bioeconomics.

   We stress that this is not simply a theoretical exercise, as there are several examples

of such institutions that have arisen organically from historical communal use of spatially

connected renewable resources.5 For example, the sakuraebi (a small pink shrimp) fishery of

Japan is an example of a profit-sharing system across TURFs that was introduced to alleviate

inefficiencies associated with decentralized harvest by three separate TURFs within Suruga

Bay. While the introduction of the TURF system had promoted rationalization within

each of the three TURFs, stock dispersal and heterogeneity had led to stringent competition

between TURFs; this competition went so far as to include on and off-shore violence (Uchida

and Wilen 2004). Ten years of this destructive behavior led the shrimp fishermen to form

the Sakuraebi Harvesters’ Association (SHA) to coordinate harvest between the individual

TURFs. The SHA manages fishing activity on a daily basis, and as a result, only half the

fleet will be engaged in fishing on any given day. From the landed sales, a percentage fee

is collected by the SHA, with the remaining revenue net of fixed costs divided among boat

captains and crew members (Uchida and Baba 2008).

   Another spatial fishery of note is the fishing cooperatives of Baja California, Mexico, a

collection of small community-based cooperative fisheries that primarily target spiny lob-

ster and abalone. Several of these fisheries in the Vizcaino Peninsula region have formed

                                              4
a federation (Fedecoop) to coordinate harvest across the spatial fisheries. Each of the 9

members of Fedecoop contribute a 30% profit share to the federation, which in turn provides

benefits for the individual cooperatives. While not a spatially defined fishery, the Chignik

salmon fishery of Alaska featured a short-lived cooperative whereby roughly 20% of license

holders participated in fishing, while the remaining members were idle. Revenues where

then returned to cooperative members based on a pre-determined formula, such that fishing

members received $63,000 and non-fishing members received $23,000 (Costello and Deacon

2007).6

   While sharing institutions have emerged in ad hoc examples, no comprehensive theory

exists to help guide the design of these institutions across spatial property rights owners. For

example, can first-best efficient harvest be achieved with unitization? How does the structure

of profit sharing affect the achievement of first-best outcomes? How would design depend on

the biological or economic characteristics of the fishery? Is contractual obligation required?

Or can the unitization scheme be designed to incentivize participation? We address these

questions below.

   This work incorporates a general framework of harvest decisions where a number of

owners make decentralized decisions regarding spatially explicit resource use. The general

renewable resource model we consider is both dynamic and spatial; resources grow and dis-

perse. Spatial connectivity among resource “patches” (e.g. fish/larval movement) creates a

spatial externality.7 Unsurprisingly, in the absence of coordination, patch owners will tend to

overexploit the resident stock. Thus, any discussion of efficiency will have to consider both

dynamic and spatial externalities, in addition to strategic behavior between patch owners.

The dynamic aspect of the model is in the spirit of existing dynamic optimization models

                                               5
(Clark 1990), while the spatial aspects build on existing models of “patchy” bioeconomics,

e.g. Brown and Roughgarden (1997) Sanchirico and Wilen (1999), Sanchirico and Wilen

(2001), Sanchirico and Wilen (2002) Sanchirico and Wilen (2005) and Costello and Polasky

(2008). A related literature considers the joint exploitation of a single resource stock by sev-

eral agents, building on seminal work in Levhari and Mirman (1980) and Munro (1979). This

“fish wars” literature identified a persistent externality of one country on another where the

resource stock moved across jurisdictions, a phenomenon that has recently been corrobated

empirically (McWhinnie 2009). While many of the insights of that literature also apply

here, we extend the bioeconomic model to allow for resource production and dispersal in

each jurisdiction (i.e. a “metapopulation”) and explore the ability of unitization to correct

the ensuing externality across spatial property rights owners.

   By exploiting the special structure of our dynamic and spatial game we are able to obtain

sharp analytical results of an otherwise intractable problem. Our benchmark case accords

with the results of Janmaat (2005) who finds that for spatially connected renewable resources,

spatial property rights alone do not yield efficient outcomes, except in trivial cases. We

then consider coordination between patch owners via a generalization of unitization. Under

unitization, each member contributes a share of her profit to a general pool that is ultimately

redistributed across members in a particular way. The details of the levels of contribution

and redistribution affect both efficiency and participation; this is the focus of much of our

analysis.

   If properly designed, unitization acts to mitigate the commons problem. Thus the in-

dividual patch owner’s decisions appear more like those of the sole owner. We find that

under contractually mandatory participation, unitization can yield first-best outcomes, but

                                               6
only when all profits are pooled. We show that allowing for endogenous participation in the

unitization scheme can still yield first-best outcomes, provided that shares can vary across

participants. We proceed by developing an analytical model of spatially-connected renewable

resources and deriving results regarding the ability of a well-engineered unitization scheme to

achieve efficiency in resource use when participation is mandatory, and when it is voluntary.




1     A model of spatial property rights for renewable re-

      sources

We require a spatially explicit dynamic bioeconomic model that is analytically tractable yet

allows for spatial heterogeneity in economics, biology, and the environment. We build upon

the dynamic model structure in Costello and Polasky (2008). Each of N resource patches,

indexed i = 1, 2, ..., N , is exclusively managed by a single owner who chooses harvest in

her own patch in discrete time periods, t = 0, 1, 2, .... Tenure is assumed to be guaranteed

and infinite.8 While our theory applies to any spatially connected renewable resource, it

facilitates exposition to focus on the fishery as an example.



1.1   Growth and spatial connectivity

Stock at the beginning of time t in patch i is given by xit . Harvest in each patch i is a decision

variable at each time t and is given by hit , and escapement eit is defined as eit = xit − hit .

Patches are spatially interconnected, e.g. by migrating fish or larvae dispersing via ocean

currents. The timing is thus: the present period stock (xit ) is observed and then harvested



                                                7
(hit ) resulting in escapement (eit ). This escapement produces young who disperse according

to the following equation of motion:


                                                 N
                                                 X
                                       xit+1 =            fj (ejt )Dji ,                       (1)
                                                  j

where fj (ejt ) is a patch specific growth function that reflects idiosyncracies of patch ecology

(e.g. habitat quality) and Dji is the fraction of resident stock that disperses from patch j
                                     PN
to patch i each period, Dji ≥ 0,       i   Dji = 1, where Djj ≤ 1 reflects self-retention (Mitarai

et al. 2009).9 The initial stock in patch i is xi0 . The function fi (e) is assumed to have the

standard properties for all i: fi0 (e) > 0, fi00 (e) < 0, and fi (0) = 0.



1.2    Economic returns

In addition to patch specific heterogeneity in production and dispersal, we allow for differ-

ential economic returns. The current period profit from harvesting hit from patch i at time

t is given by the harvest model:10




                                        Πit = (pi − ci )hit                                    (2)

                                              = bi (xit − eit ),                               (3)


where pi and ci are patch-specific prices and marginal harvest costs, we define as marginal

profit bi ≡ pi − ci , and make use of the identity hit ≡ xit − eit . By assuming bi > 0

∀i, we ensure that some harvest would always be (at least myopically) profitable in every

patch. Before considering the problem faced by decentralized patch owners under unitization,



                                                      8
the next section derives two key results for comparison: the sole owner solution and the

uncoordinated, decentralized solution.




2     Benchmark results

2.1   The sole owner

Consider the benchmark case where a sole owner simultaneously manages all N intercon-

nected resource patches. Even for a sole owner, this poses a formidable challenge as it

generalizes the standard renewable resource harvesting problem to account for spatial in-

terconnections (via Dji ) among an arbitrarily large collection of patches. By imposing a

modest amount of structure on this problem, we will be able to derive closed form analytical

results. We thus restrict attention to interior solutions where some harvest occurs in each

patch. While corner solutions (where some patches are optimally left unharvested or are

harvested to extinction) are a theoretical possibility (see Costello and Polasky (2008)), we

assume that conditions are such that some positive but non-extinguishing harvest is optimal:

xit > hit > 0 ∀i, t. We also adopt a benign assumption about dispersal:


Assumption 1. There is some out-of-patch dispersal: Dii < 1, ∀i.


    This assumption simply requires that patches are in fact spatially-connected, such that

some of the larvae from patch i will disperse to patch j. A violation of this assumption (so

Dii = 1) trivializes the problem by eliminating spatial connectivity, whereby the sole owner

solves a series of N unconnected standard renewable resource harvesting problems.

    The sole owner’s objective is to maximize the discounted net present value of profit


                                             9
(Equation 2) across all patches and all time. Letting xt denote the vector [x1t ...xN t ], the

sole owner’s dynamic programming equation is:


                                               I
                                               X
                             Vt (xt ) = max          bi (xit − eit ) + δVt+1 (xt+1 ),                        (4)
                                         et
                                               i=1

which is subject to the biological constraints (Equation 1), and a discount factor δ ≤ 1.

   Differentiating with respect to escapement gives the following necessary condition for an

interior solution:


                                         N
                                         X ∂Vt+1 (xt+1 ) ∂xjt+1
                               −bi + δ                                  = 0 ∀i,                              (5)
                                         j=1
                                                 ∂xjt+1          ∂eit

where the first term captures the marginal cost of increasing escapement (and thus decreasing

harvest) in the current period, and the second captures the marginal benefit in future payoffs

to all patches from that increase in escapement. Because all patches are owned by the same

harvester, spillovers from dispersal from each patch are fully internalized.

   This complicated dynamic optimization problem has a special structure, called “state in-

dependent control,” for which the first-order conditions are independent of stock, xit (Costello

and Polasky 2008). This allows us to separate the problem temporally, and implies that es-

capement is location-specific, but time-independent (Proposition 1 in Costello and Polasky

(2008)). This result accords with, but extends, existing resource models with perfectly elastic

demand for which a bang-bang solution is implemented to achieve an optimal escapement.

Because optimal escapement in patch i is constant, additional units of stock are simply
                                                                                    ∂Vt+1 (xt+1 )
harvested, so the shadow value on stock is simply its net price:                      ∂xjt+1
                                                                                                    = bj ∀j. The
              ∂xjt+1
final term,    ∂eit
                       equals fi0 (eit )Dij by rewriting Equation 1 in terms of xjt+1 and differenti-


                                                        10
ating with respect to eit . Thus, what would otherwise be an extremely complicated spatial

temporal optimization problem has a first order condition that compactly reduces to:


                                       N
                                       X
                             −bi + δ         bj fi0 (eSO
                                                      it )Dij = 0 ∀i.                     (6)
                                       j=1

The optimal level of escapement under a sole owner eSO
                                                    it will trade off the present benefit of


harvest against the sum of future growth and dispersal to all patches, yielding a spatially

modified golden rule for spatially-connected renewable resources:



                                                        bi
                                fi0 (eSO
                                      it ) =       PN            ∀i.                      (7)
                                               δ    j=1 bj Dij

By the concavity of fi (ei ), eSO
                               it is thus decreasing in own price (bi ) and increasing in the

discount factor, δ. Note that Equation 7 collapses to the familiar golden rule of resource

economics in the absence of space: f 0 (e) = 1/δ. While Equation 7 provides a useful bench-

mark, the remainder of this paper is devoted to the case of decentralized ownership of these

resource patches.



2.2   Uncoordinated Spatial Ownership

The other benchmark case we will require is uncoordinated, decentralized ownership of the

N patches. When coordination is absent, each of the N patch owners maximizes her patch-

specific returns, taking as given the behavior of connected patch owners. The dynamic

programming equation for owner i is:



                         Vit (xt ) = max bi (xit − eit ) + δVit+1 (xt+1 ).                (8)
                                     eit



                                                   11
Owner i’s choice must now account for the effect of all other patch owners’ decisions on her

value function. The necessary condition for owner i is:

        ·                                                                          ¸
        ∂Vit+1 (xt+1 ) ∂x1t+1 ∂Vit+1 (xt+1 ) ∂x2t+1         ∂Vit+1 (xt+1 ) ∂xN t+1
−bi + δ                      +                      + ... +                           = 0, or (9)
           ∂x1t+1       ∂eit     ∂x2t+1       ∂eit             ∂xN t+1      ∂eit
                                                            XN
                                                                ∂Vit+1 (xt+1 ) ∂xjt+1
                                                    −bi + δ                             = 0.(10)
                                                            j=1
                                                                    ∂x jt+1      ∂e it


   Consider a Cournot-style model where each owner simultaneously chooses her own es-
                                                                                 ∂Vit+1 (xt+1 )
capement taking all other escapements as given. Fixing ejt+1 implies                ∂xjt+1
                                                                                                  = 0 ∀j 6= i.

This follows because owner j simply harvests the additional stock down to ejt+1 , leaving no

residual profit for capture by owner i. This useful observation implies that the necessary

condition for owner i reduces to:

                                         ∂Vit+1 (xt+1 ) ∂xit+1

fi0 (eit )Dii by differentiating Equation 1.11 The best response function of owner i simply

reduces to:



                                    −bi + δbi fi0 (eit )Dii = 0.                                         (12)

Importantly, owner i’s choice is independent of other owners’ escapements. Rewriting the

necessary condition, Equation 12, gives the following uncoordinated escapement rule eUitC for

owner i:



                                                         1

Because owner i’s best response is independent of ejt (j 6= i), Equation 13 defines a unique

subgame perfect Nash equilibrium vector of escapements for each owner under decentralized

ownership. This result leads to the following first proposition regarding the efficiency of

spatial property rights in the absence of coordination.

    The magnitude of the difference between the sole owner and uncoordinated equilibria

will depend on the extent of the spatial externality, captured by the out-dispersal term in
                     PN
the denominator δ       j6=i (bj /bi )Dij .   The larger is this term, the larger is the wedge between

the sole owner’s escapement in that patch and that which is chosen by the uncoordinated

owner.12 To the extent that uncoordinated harvest is inefficiently excessive (see Proposition

1), coordination will be required to align incentives across spatial rights holders. While it is

true that uncoordinated spatial property rights may fail to completely solve the commons

problem, it is likely that the owners themselves would also recognize this fact, and take

steps to coordinate. We address this topic below, beginning with a simple, yet powerful

coordinating mechanism.




3     Unitization

We have shown that even with well defined and enforced spatial property rights, uncoor-

dinated owners will typically not achieve economically efficient resource use (Proposition


                                                       13
1). Coordination may be induced by a Coasian bargaining solution or by other mechanisms

requiring side payments between users. Real world examples of spatial property rights in

renewable resources may involve hundreds of interconnected patches, and thus the number

of side payments would quickly become large ( N (N2−1) ).13 We thus focus on unitization as a

simple budget balanced, fully internal mechanism with no required side payments.



3.1    Unitization

Consider a unitization scheme where each owner makes a contribution 0 ≤ αi ≤ 1 of her

profits to a pool.14 Dividend 0 ≤ γi ≤ 1 of this aggregate pool is then redistributed to
                     PN
patch i, such that     i   γi = 1.15 A particular unitization scheme is defined by {α, γ}, where

α = [α1 , α2 , ..., αN ] and γ = [γ1 , γ2 , ..., γN ]. For the first part of our analysis, we adopt the

following assumption regarding participation in unitization:


Assumption 2. All N owners are contractually obligated to participate in the unitization

scheme, {α, γ}.


   Under Assumption 2, patch owners are legally bound to participate in the unitization

scheme, as is typically the case for mineral rights owners in unitized oil and gas fields. If

αi = 0 ∀i, no profit sharing occurs, and thus the resource is not unitized and owners are

uncoordinated. If αi = 1 ∀i, then all profits are shared (as is the case for unitized oil and

gas fields); subsequent redistribution to each owner is governed by γ. In the general case

(0 < αi < 1) each individual owner chooses escapement conditional on αi and γi , taking

other owners’ decisions as given.16




                                                  14
    The dynamic programming equation for patch owner i is given by:
                                                                    N
                                                                    X
                 Vit (xt ) = max(1 − αi )bi (xit − eit ) + αi γi          bj (xjt − ejt ) + δVit+1 (xt+1 )             (14)

with necessary condition:
                                                           N
                                                           X ∂Vit+1 (xt+1 ) ∂xjt+1
                           −(1 − αi )bi − αi γi bi + δ                                      = 0.                       (15)
                                                            j=1
                                                                    ∂xjt+1        ∂eit

Because owner i takes all ejt (j 6= i) as given, from the perspective of owner i, owner

j immediately harvests any additional stock down to the given escapement level yielding

marginal value, bj . That value accrues to owner i based on the dividend, and we obtain:
∂Vit+1 (xt+1 )
   ∂xjt+1
                 = γi bj ∀i, j. Combining this along with differentiation of Equation 1 gives owner

i’s best response function:


                                             Ã                                   N
                                                                                                           !
                                                                                 X
            −(1 − αi )bi − αi γi bi + δ (1 − αi )bi fi0 (eit )Dii + αi γi               bj fi0 (eit )Dij       = 0,    (16)
                                                                                  j=1

which remains independent of any other owner’s escapement decision. The left hand terms

represents the current period marginal cost of increasing escapement: (1−αi ) forgone private

harvest value, and αi γi share of the foregone harvest value. The right term represents the

marginal benefit: discounted private (1 − αi ) and pooled (αi γi ) share of future value of

marginal growth and dispersal of the resource.
                                                                                                     {α,γ}
    Thus, we can immediately write the resulting optimal escapement rule eit                                   as a function

of the unitization scheme {α, γ}as follows:

                                    {α,γ}                (1 − αi )bi + αi γi bi
                              fi0 (eit      )=                            P               .                            (17)
                                                 δ((1 − αi )bi Dii + αi γi N j=1 bj Dij )


Equation 17 defines a unique subgame perfect Nash equilibrium vector of escapements for

each owner under unitization scheme {α, γ}.17 How does the profile of escapements under

                                                            15
unitization compare to the profile under a sole owner of the spatially connected renewable

resource? It turns out that the escapement under unitization is inefficiently low (i.e. harvest

is excessive) in all patches, as is formalized below:

                                                                                          {α,γ}

holds, and thus ei           < eSO
                                i .



    While Proposition 2 shows that unitization leads to inefficient harvest levels, it seems

intuitive that sharing a larger fraction of profits would enhance efficiency because larger

contributions lead owners to take more account of the spatial externality. This intuition is

formalized below:


Proposition 3. Under Assumptions 1-2, an increase in contribution 0 < αi < 1 leads to an

increase in the efficiency of the fishery.

    The intuition underlying Proposition 3 is that an increase in the contribution increases

the dependence of owner i’s profits on the performance of spatially connected owners. Thus,

owner i will place more weight on how her escapement affects the profits of her neighbors.

    We have shown that escapement under “partial” unitization (when αi < 1 ∀i) is inef-

ficiently low and that increasing the contribution αi increases the efficiency of the fishery.

This raises the question: How efficient is full unitization (αi = 1 ∀i)? Let eF
                                                                              i be the escape-


ment chosen by each owner under full unitization. The following proposition shows that this

escapement level will be equivalent to the first-best.


Proposition 4. Under Assumptions 1-2, the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium escapement

under full unitization (αi = 1 ∀i) is identical to the economically efficient sole owner’s

escapement, eF    SO
             i = ei , ∀i.




                                                17
Proof. Setting αi = 1 in Equation 17 yields the following escapement rule under full uniti-

zation:



                                                          bi
                                   fi0 (eF
                                         i ) =       PN            .                         (20)
                                                 δ    j=1 bj Dij

   The result follows by inspection of Equations 20 and 7.


   This intuitive yet powerful result seems to solve our efficiency problem: simply constrain-

ing all users to fully share profits yields economic efficiency. Under full unitization, each

owner chooses the escapement in her patch that maximizes the joint return of all patches,

which is precisely the decision that a sole owner would make. This derivation yields an

additional useful result:


Corollary 1. Under Assumptions 1 - 2 and full unitization αi = 1, the efficiency of uniti-

zation is independent of the dividend γi ∀i.


Proof. This result follows from the fact that Equation 20 is independent of γi .


   Provided that all patch owners are mandated to participate in the scheme, each patch

owner’s escapement choice is identical to the first-best choice, regardless of the dividend.

However, while the intensive margin decision of escapement is independent of the dividend,

the extensive margin decision to participate will clearly depend on this dividend. In the

following section, we consider the effects of unitization when participation is voluntary.

4     Unitization with Endogenous Participation

In oil and gas unitization in the United States, participation is typically mandatory. Mineral

rights holders in unitized oil and gas fields are required to share profits in a fully unitized

manner (αi = 1 ∀i). We have shown that a similar legal obligation might solve the spatial

externality problem present for spatially connected renewable resource owners. But we ask

whether contractual obligation is necessary for efficiency. Here we endogenize participation

decisions in order to determine if unitization need be mandatory in order to produce a

first-best efficient outcome.



4.1   Repeated play by patch owners

To explore the individual rationality of participation in the unitization scheme {α, γ}, we

couch our bioeconomic model as an infinitely repeated Prisoner’s Dilemma game with N

members. The relevant per-period payoffs are given below:

                                  i = bi (xUC   UC
                                           i − ei ).                                       (23)

ΠC
 i represents the shared profit of cooperation when all players choose the fully efficient


escapement levels eF    N                                                    UC
                   i . Πi represents i’s profit from defecting and choosing ei while the other


owners play eF                D
             j6=i . Finally, Πi represents i’s profit when all owners choose their uncoordinated


escapement, eUC
             i , i.e. when everyone defects.


    There are many potential strategies to consider, and we adopt a Nash reversion strategy

to punish defectors. Under this punishment strategy, any defector is punished forever by all

                                               19
other owners reverting to eUC
                           i . Here, if owner i defects during period t, she will enjoy the fruits


of her defection in that first period, and will be ‘punished’ by every other owner defecting

in the subsequent periods. Thus, we can calculate the dynamic benefits of cooperation and

defection as follows. The present value of profits from cooperation forever are the discounted

sum of ΠC
        i :

                                        =     γi               bj (xF    F
                                                                    j − ej ).

      Defection amounts to choosing the uncoordinated escapement of eUC
                                                                     i , which leads to a


steady-state defection stock of xUC
                                 i . Thus, the present value of profit to owner i from defecting


is:
                                              ∞

                                 = bi (xF    UC
                                        i − ei ) +     bi (xUC   UC
                                                            i − ei ).
                                                   1−δ
The first term represents the first period benefit of defection (choosing the uncoordinated

level of escapement while every other owner is still playing cooperatively), while the second

represents the discounted stream of benefits from the steady-state uncoordinated equilibrium.

Given the history of play, each owner will consider her profit taking as given the escapement

of other owners. In essence, owners will consider the short-term benefits of defection versus

the long-term difference in profits between sharing a cooperative equilibrium and going it

alone. If we find conditions under which JiC ≥ JiD for all owners i, then unitization is efficient

and supportable as a subgame perfect Nash Equilibrium. Whether this occurs will depend

on the design of the unitization scheme. Because efficiency requires αi = 1 ∀i (Proposition

4), we focus on the importance of the set of dividends γ = [γ1 , γ2 , ..., γN ].



4.2    Patch-specific dividends

We leverage the fact that our unitization scheme allows the dividends γi to vary across

patch owners. The key question here is: Does a set of dividends exist that 1) encourages

full participation and 2) is feasible? In considering this question, the result in Corollary 1

becomes crucial. Because harvest efficiency by each patch owner is independent of γi , we

can consider the minimum γi , denoted γ̂i , such that patch owner i would prefer cooperation
                                                                 PN
(equation 24) to defection (equation 25). As long as                i   γ̂i ≤ 1, the share structure is

feasible and yields first-best efficiency for the fishery.

   From Equation 24 and Equation 25, the minimum dividend γ̂i for owner i requires:


                          N
                          X
                   1                                         δ
                      γ̂i   bj (xF    F          F    UC
                                 j − ej ) = bi (xi − ei ) +     bi (xUC   UC
                                                                     i − ei ).                    (26)
                 1 − δ j=1                                  1−δ

   Solving for γ̂i gives the indifferent dividend for patch i:



                                        bi ((1 − δ)xF         UC
                                                    i + δxi − ei )
                                                                     UC
                                γ̂i =         PN           F     F
                                                                        .                         (27)
                                                j=1 b j (x j − e j )

   To explore the determinants of γ̂i , we will adopt the following approach. Consider a

spatially connected renewable resource with N patch owners, and focus on two such owners,

labeled i and j. What characteristics of these patch owners lead to high, or low, values of γ̂i

and γ̂j ? To answer this question, we isolate effects by holding in common all characteristics

between patches i and j, save one. We define the following conditions:


                                                    21
Condition 1. Patches i and j have “equi-inflow” if Dki = Dkj for all k.


Condition 2. Patches i and j have “equi-price” if bi = bj .


Condition 3. Patches i and j have “equi-production” if fi (e) = fj (e).


Condition 4. Patches i and j have “equi-retention” if Dii = Djj .


   We are interested in comparing γ̂i to γ̂j . We begin by noting that the denominator

for γ̂i from Equation 27 is the same as the denominator for γ̂j . Whether γ̂i ≶ γ̂j requires

considering only the numerators:


                    bi ((1 − δ)xF     UC   UC                F     UC   UC
                                i + δxi − ei ) ≶ bj ((1 − δ)xj + δxj − ej )                         (28)


We derive and will subsequently make use of the following lemmas:


Lemma 1. Under Conditions 3 and 4, eUC   UC
                                    i = ej .



Proof. This follows from inspection of Equation 13, and invoking Conditions 3 and 4.


Lemma 2. Under Condition 1, xF    F      UC   UC
                             i = xj and xi = xj .



Proof. Equation 1 implies that xi = f1 (e1 )D1i + f2 (e2 )D2i + ... + fN (eN )DN i and xj =

f1 (e1 )D1j + f2 (e2 )D2j + ... + fN (eN )DN j . For any set of escapements e1 , e2 , ..., eN , these are

equal by Condition 1.


   These facts give rise to the following propositions regarding the characteristics of patches

that determine the dividend required to induce voluntary participation.


Proposition 5. Suppose that Conditions 1, 3, and 4 hold, and bi > bj , then γ̂i > γ̂j .



                                                   22
Proof. Under the assumed Conditions, Lemmas 1 and 2 hold, so the only difference in the

numerator is bi and bj . The result γ̂i > γj follows trivially.

Proposition 6. Suppose that Conditions 1, 2 and 3 hold, and Dii > Djj , then γ̂i < γ̂j .

Proof. By Lemma 2 and Condition 2, comparing the numerator requires only comparing

−eUi C ≶ −eUC
           j . From Equation 13, and invoking Condition 3 and the assumption about


retention, eUj C < eUi C , and therefore, γ̂i < γ̂j .

Proposition 7. Suppose that Conditions 1, 2, and 4 hold, and fi0 (ē) > fj0 (ē) ∀ē, then γ̂i < γ̂j .

Proof. By Lemma 2 and Condition 2, only need to compare −eUC
                                                          i  ≶ −eUC
                                                                 j . From Equation


13, and invoking Condition 4 and the assumption about growth, eUC
                                                               j  < eUC
                                                                     i , and therefore,


γ̂i < γ̂j .


    The intuition underlying Proposition 5 is straightforward: patches with a higher price or

lower marginal cost of harvest (higher bi ) require a larger dividend γi of total fishery profits

to discourage defection. Proposition 6 hinges on the fact that patches with less self-retention

(smaller Dii ) will harvest to a lower level of escapement when defecting, making initial de-

fection more profitable relative to patches with higher self-retention. Proposition 7 reveals

a counterintuitive result on the minimum dividend required to entice patch owners into

the unitization scheme. In contrast to Proposition 5 which found that more economically

productive patches require larger dividends, Proposition 7 shows that more biologically pro-

ductive patches (higher fi0 (ē) ∀ē) require smaller dividends to encourage participation. This

result follows from the fact that patches with higher productivity will choose higher levels

of escapement when defecting, decreasing the benefit of initial defection and thus requiring

a smaller dividend to entice cooperation.

                                                        23
   In order for the dividend structure described by Equation 27 to be feasible, the individual

dividends must sum to less than unity:


                             PN                  F      UC
                               i=1 bi ((1 − δ)xi + δxi       − eUC
                                                                i )
                                      PN          F    F
                                                                      ≤ 1.                   (29)
                                         j=1 bj (xj − ej )

This leads to our next proposition regarding the efficiency of unitization under voluntary

participation:


Proposition 8. Under Assumption 1, there exists a discount factor δ̃ < 1 such that for any

δ ≥ δ̃, full unitization with endogenous participation is supportable, and first-best, economi-

cally efficient harvest can be achieved.


Proof. The denominator of Equation 29 is simply the first-best value of the fishery in steady

state. If δ = 1, the numerator is equal to the value of the fishery in the absence of unitization,

and as this is less than the first-best value of the fishery, the ratio in Equation 29 is strictly

less than one. On the other hand, if δ = 0, the numerator is strictly greater than the

denominator, as eUC   F
                 i < ei and the ratio is strictly greater than one. Thus, by the intermediate


value theorem, there exists some 0 < δ̃ < 1 such that the ratio in Equation 29 is equal to

one. For δ ≥ δ̃, the dividend given by Equation 27 is feasible and full participation with full

unitization is supportable, yielding first-best outcomes per proposition 4.


   This finalizes our main result: by generalizing the concept of unitization, we have shown

that fully efficient exploitation can be voluntarily achieved by completely self-interested patch

owners and that this result does not require infinite patience.

is that it is not renegotiation proof (Van Damme 1989) and punishers may have an incentive

to ‘let bygones be bygones’ and allow a defector back into the cooperative and resume profit

sharing. An extension that considers the potential of renegotiation proof strategies (such

as Bhat and Huffaker (2007) and Cave (1987)) or more sophisticated punishment strategies

(as in Tarui et al. (2008)) in unitized spatially connected renewable resources may prove

insightful.


4.2.2 Practical considerations


In the above analysis, the dividend was allowed to vary across patches. However, as a prac-

tical matter, such varying shares may be difficult for owners to agree upon. Fish harvested

in patch i may come from larvae produced by stock in patch j, which may make agreement

on unit shares difficult to come by. Wiggins and Libecap (1985) and Libecap and Wiggins

(1985) detail contracting issues in oil unitization, emphasizing the difficulties of unit share

agreement as a result of imperfect information. The biological systems underlying renewable

resources may make the process of agreeing on unit shares even more contentious.18




5     Conclusions

Spatial connectivity of renewable resources induces a spatial externality in extraction. For

this reason, spatial property rights alone are insufficient to solve the commons problem. We


                                              25
generalize the notion of unitization, developed to coordinate extraction of common oil and gas

fields, to spatially connected renewable resources. This coordination mechanism is framed

within a spatial bioeconomic model with a patchy “metapopulation.” Patch owners then

compete in a dynamic game because owner i’s harvest affects all other owners in subsequent

periods. Our main result is that unitization can serve to coordinate spatial property rights

owners. If designed properly, first-best harvest can be achieved, even in cases when the

resource would be completely destroyed in the absence of unitization. The unitization scheme

relies on two instruments: an owner-specific contribution (the fraction of profits an owner

must yield to the common pool) and an owner-specific dividend (the fraction of the pool

redistributed to the owner). By allowing the unitization scheme to vary by participant (e.g.,

as a function of patch-specific biological productivity or economic returns), the mechanism

can induce voluntary participation by all spatial property rights owners.

   The special structure of our difference game allows us to obtain sharp analytical results,

but the analysis is not without caveats. There is an implicit assumption throughout the

paper that the sole owner would achieve socially efficient harvest. While common in the

bioeconomics literature, this is somewhat of a heroic assumption, but it does reduce the

complexity of our problem. Incorporating other features such as ecological benefits or vary-

ing discount rates into the spatial bioeconomic model presented here may prove interesting.19

Considering harvest incentives under a more general economic model may also be fruitful,

as would considering the case of spatial reserves under spatial property rights. For example,

might a patch owner find it optimal to pay another patch owner to completely shutdown

harvest in her patch (Costello and Kaffine 2010)? While we have focused on spatial prop-

erty rights over renewable resources, this unitization scheme might apply more generally.

                                             26
For example, if property rights are assigned on the basis of allowable fish catch (individual

transferable quotas (ITQs)), owners may benefit from coordination on harvest via a uni-

tization mechanism. Owners of ITQ in the crab fishery in New Zealand coordinate via a

mechanism similar to this where owners contribute quota share to a cooperative (“Crabco”)

and profits are redistributed differentially to participants at the end of the season (Soboil

and Craig 2008).

   While the unitization scheme presented here yields first-best outcomes under manda-

tory participation and can yield first-best outcomes under voluntary participation, practical

considerations may constrain implementation, and unitization structures with less than full

participation and less than full unitization may maximize the value of spatial renewable

resource extraction.

Notes

   1
       For example, the 2007 reauthorization of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation

and Management Act allows for various tradeable property schemes. A recent study (Costello,

Gaines, and Lynham 2008) suggests that ITQs have been successful in slowing fishery col-

lapse.

   2
       See Hannesson (2004) for an excellent discussion of attempts to privatize the ocean with

ITQ’s and spatial rights. Examples of formalized spatial property right systems include

TURFs in Chile, community cooperatives in Japan and Mexico, and the 200 mile Exclusive

Economic Zones (EEZs) established by the Law of the Sea; a famous informal example occurs

in the Maine lobster fishery where harbor ‘gangs’ exercise de facto spatial rights (Acheson

1988).

   3
       For example, for spiny lobster, substantial losses (relative to optimal management) were

still found even with TURF alongshore widths of 100km, principally due to larval transport

by ocean currents and not because of adult movement. This stands in sharp contrast to the

size of existing TURFs in Chile and Japan (discussed extensively in Cancino, Uchida, and

Wilen (2007)) which may extend less than 1 km alongshore.

   4
       The problem of unitization and contracting between users of a nonrenewable common

pool resource has been studied in depth for the oil industry in a series of papers by Libecap

and Wiggins (Libecap and Wiggins (1984),Wiggins and Libecap (1985), Libecap and Wiggins

(1985)). They examine the contracting success, and frequently the failure, of private firms

drilling the same common oil field. They generally find that heterogeneity plays a key role

in thwarting the success of contracts to lessen rent dissipation and overproduction.


                                               28

       We focus here on examples of profit sharing across spatial units of ownership, as opposed

to profit sharing within spatially defined units of ownership. Within a spatially-defined unit

of ownership (i.e. a TURF), profit-sharing can be used to induce cooperation between

multiple harvesters. For example, profits are pooled among cooperative members within the

walleye pollack fishery of the Nishi region of Japan and redistributed to TURF members

(Uchida and Watanobe 2008). The loco fisheries in Chile’s TURF system also use partial

revenue pooling mechanisms within a TURF to mitigate race-to-fish incentives (Uchida and

Wilen 2005). Within the deep sea crab fishery of New Zealand, quota owners have “invested”

their quota shares within Crabco, the sole company involved in the crab fishing operation.

Profits are returned to investors based on the share invested in the company (Mincher 2008).

   6
       The cooperative was disbanded by a court ruling that held that the cooperative was

illegal on the grounds that it was illegal for a fisherman to profit from a right to fish without

undertaking any actual fishing activity.

   7
       This feature is present at some life-history stage for many commercially viable species.

   8
       See Costello and Kaffine (2008) for a discussion of how uncertain tenure affects harvest

incentives for renewable resources.

   9
       The parameter Dji captures larval dispersal across space and will be species-specific.

  10
       We leave the exploration of decentralized spatial bioeconomic models with stock effects

to future work.

  11
       State independence of the control variable also implies that the open loop and feedback

control rules are identical. This result was established, and coined state separability for

continuous time models by Dockner, Geichtinger, and Jorgensen (1985).

  12
       We make a few notes about Proposition 1 when Assumption 1 does not hold. If fi0 (0) ≤

                                                29

     ,   the optimal escapement is eUC
                                    it = 0 by the non-negativity constraint on eit . On the other


hand, if Dij = 0 for i 6= j, the optimal escapement is equivalent to the economically efficient

sole owner’s. Without dispersal, each owner controls a self-contained fiefdom and property

rights can be assigned confidently without concern for coordination or cooperation; efficient

harvest will occur for owners solely interested in their own profits. However, as noted in the

introduction, larval dispersal in fisheries is typically larger than practical spatial property

right assignments to individual users.

   13
        A small example is in Baja California where the 9 spatial property rights owners in the

cooperative “Fedecoop” would require 36 separate annual side payments. A large example is

in Chile where 453 permanent TURFs exist for harvesting an abalone-like snail, which could

require > 100, 000 side payments.

   14
        Consistent with our assumption that profits (rather than, e.g., revenues) are shared,

Libecap and Smith (1999) argue that production and cost shares must coincide to induce

efficiency in unitization contracts for oil and gas extraction.

   15
        In practice, the redistribution may not be entirely pecuniary. For example, in Chile

and Japan profit sharing partly pays for science, monitoring, and enforcement. For oil and

gas, coordination is undertaken by a “unit operator” a concept that has been adopted (in

principle, not in name) in some fisheries, e.g. the Chignik Salmon Cooperative (Deacon,

Parker, and Costello 2008).

   16
        Heintzelman, Salant, and Schott (2009) consider a similar profit sharing solution for

homogenous agents harvesting a common property resource and find that coordinating can

improve economic outcomes.

   17
        Note that equilibrium profile of escapements under the three cases we consider (sole

                                                 30
owner, uncoordinated owners, and unitization) are all independent of the state, and are thus

constant over time. We henceforth suppress time subscripts for ease of exposition.

  18
       Libecap and Wiggins (1984) argue that the difficulties of agreeing on a complete uniti-

zation contract led many oil fields to adopt prorationing, which created some margins for

rent dissipation, but was easier to reach agreement on.

  19
       Clark and Munro (1980) consider the case of varying discount factor when the sole owner

deviates from the social discount factor. They find that corrective taxes may be necessary

to ensure economically efficient behavior.
