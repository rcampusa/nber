                            Imports as a Cause of Injury:

                         The Case of the U.S. Steel Industry



                                      ABSTRACT



      Recently, the United States International Trade Commission conducted a

 Section 201 or "escape clause" hearing to determine whether imports have been the

 most significant cause of injury to the US. steel industry. This paper suggests a

 methodology for conducting the necessary analysis for such determinations, and

 applies it to the case of the steel industry.

      First, a reduced-form equation for steel industry employment is derived and

 estimated. The equation specifies industry employment as a function of the price

 of imported steel, the price of energy, the price of iron ore, a time trend, real

 income and (in one variant) the wage rate in the steel industry. The estimated

 coefficients are used to perform counterfactual simulations, which allow us to

 attribute changes in industry employment to their proximate causes. The analysis

 reveals that for the period from 1976 to 1983, a secular shift away from

 employment in the steel industry has been the most important cause of injury. For

 the shorter period from 1979 to 1983, secular shift and import competition are

 roughly equal in importance, with the latter being entirely the result of the

substantial appreciation of the U.S. dollar during this period.

     The charge of the International Trade Commission in the recent

"escape clause" hearings concerning the U.S. steel industry was to

determine whether imports have been the most significant cause of injury

to the industry. The ITC found positively in this case, and thus opened

the way for President Reagan to provide import protection for this

important domestic industry. In this paper, I present empirical evidence

that shows that the ITC ruling may have been in error.

     The study uses an econometric model of the U.S. steel industry to

attribute changes in domestic employment to a number of proximate causes.

Among the potential contributors to the industry's employment decline

that I considered are (i) competition from imported steel, (ii) secular

decline of the steel industry (due, for example, to reduce demand for

steel by the U.S. automobile manufacturers and substitution of aluminum,

plastics and other mateials for steel in construction), (iii) the

cyclical drop in the demand for steel caused by the recent recession,

(iv) an upward trend in the wages paid to steel workers, and (v)

increases in the price of energy, an important input into steel

production. Looking first at the period from January 1976 through

October 1983, I have estimated that if not for the secular decline in the

industry there would have been approximately 209,000 more jobs in steel

at period's end. By contrast, intensification of import competition, as
                                      -2-




measured by the decrease in the real dollar price of foreign steel,

accounts for only 37,000 lost jobs during this period. The simulations

also show that had economic growth proceeded at a steady four percent

annual rate throughout the period, thereby averting the recession of 1981

to 1983, the October 1983 employment count in the U.S. steel industry

would have been some 27,000 higher than was actually observed. Finally,

I have estimated that a rise in steel industry wages at a rate greater

than that for the manufacturing sector at large accounts for slightly

more than 5000 lost jobs, and that the increase in the real cost of

energy during 1976 to 1983 is responsible for the loss of almost 4000

jobs.

        In another set of estimates, I have studied the period from January

1979 to October 1983. For this shorter period secular decline again is

found to be the most significant cause of injury, responsible for

approximately 110,000 lost jobs. Import competition is next on the list

(81,000 jobs), followed in order to significance by the recession (49,000

jobs) and the rise in real energy prices (3000 jobs). By comparing the

figures for the two periods it becomes clear that competition from abroad

for U.S. steel producers actually abated during January 1976 through

January 1979, but intensified dramatically thereafter. In an effort to

explain this finding, I decomposed the decline in employment attributable

to the fall in the real dollar price of imported steel into three

components representing the portion due to the recent appreciation in the

value of the dollar, that due to changes in supply and competitive

conditions in foreign steel sectors (including any changes in alleged

unfair pricing practices) and that die to reductions in U.S. tariff rates

on steel imports. My conclusion is that the occurence of increasingly
severe competition from imports in this industry is entirely the result

of the dollar appreciation.
I. INTRODUCTION

      The allocation of resources in an open economy has many determinants. Among

these are the states of technology, tastes, factor accumulation, resource prices

and international competition, as well as the stage of the business cycle. A

change in any of these variables usually necessitates a reallocation of factors to

a new set of more profitable uses. As a result of this process of reallocation,

some sectors and factors gain, others lose. While long-run aggregate economic

welfare is maximized when complete adjustment to changing market conditions is

allowed to take place, the trade laws of the United States, perhaps in recognition

of the distributional considerations involved, provide for temporary safeguards

when increased international competition is the major cause of serious injury to a

U.S. Industry.

      On January 24, 1984, Bethlehem Steel Corporation and the United Steel

Workers of America filed a petition with the International Trade CommissIon,

seeking import relief under Section 201 of the Trade Reform Act of 1974. The

provisions of this "escape clause" require the petitioners to establish that the

industry has experienced "serious material injury", and that imports are "a

substantial cause of that injury", where the latter phrase is defined as ta cause

that is important, and not less than any other cause". Thus, the law requires

that market conditions in the industry be analyzed, and that all developments be

attributed to their proximate causes. The purpose of this paper is to show how

such an analysis can be conducted rigorously and objectively using econometric and
                           1
simulation   techniques.
                                                               .
                               It is hoped that the method described here will be found

to be useful for the conduct of escape clause investigations in the future.

      In order to determine whether or not import relief is justified under the

provisions of the Section 201 statute, it is necessary to account for all of the

events that have occurred in the international steel marketplace. In this paper I
                                         -2-




 will concentrate solely on the evolution of industry employment, adapting for this

purpose the methodology that I previously developed for attributing employment

 developments in an industry to their various structural causes (see Grossman,

 1982). The methodology involves the econometric estimation of a reduced-form

employment equation for the industry, where the explanatory variables are those

exogenous (from the point of view of the industry) factors that affect the

allocation of resources to that industry. Once the empirical relationship between

employment and its determinants has been established, counterfactual simulations

can be performed in which the exogenous variables are allowed to follow paths that

are different from those that were actually observed. The deviation of the actual

path of employment from the simulated path reflects the effect on the number of

jobs in the industry that can be ascribed to the fact that the exogenous variable

took on its historical values, rather than the assumed alternatives.2

      The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II the

methodology is described, and the estimates of a reduced-form equationfor

employment in the U.S. steel mills products industry are reported. The

counterfactual simulations are presented in Section III. A concluding section

contains a discussion of the findings.



II. REDUCED-FORM ESTIMATES OF AN EMPLOYNENT EQUATION FOR TEE U.S. STEEL INDUSTRY

     The level of employment in the U.S. steel industry is the outgrowth of the

interaction between the supply of labor to this sector and the (derived) demand

for labor by firms active in the sector. These in turn depend upon such variables

as the state of technology, the wage rates in the steel industry and elsewhere,

the prices of the other inputs to the production of steel and the price of steel

output. Some of these variables are themselves endogenous, responding to

developments in the international and domestic steel markets. Indirectly then,
                                        -3—




employment is affected by all those factors that influence the supply of and the

demand for steel, such as the level of industrial activity, the exchange rate, and

the price of steel that is being offered to the market by the foreign competitors

of the U.S. producers.

      If we are to attribute developments in the time path of industry employment

to their proximate causes, we might in principle wish to understand all of the

structural relationships that together determine the level of output of domestic

steel and the method of production that is used to manufacture that output. Such

a full-blown model of the steel industry would, however, be very difficult to

implement empirically, especially since data on many of the requisite variables

are not collected using a consistent definition of the industry. Fortunately,

there is a short-cut procedure available to us. The "cause—of-injury" question is

inherently a reduced-form one. That is, we are not interested per se in the

mechanism by which various disturbances affect the number of jobs in the industry,

but only in the ultimate quantitative effect of these exogenous shocks. All we

need do then to assess the total effect that a change in any given exogenous

variable is likely to have on industry employment is identify all of the

structural variables that influence the allocation of labor to the steel industry,

and estimate a reduced-form equation relating industry employment to these

exogenous variables. Once these relationships have been estimated, it is a

straightforward matter to ascertain what the effect on employment in the industry

has been of some particular development in the external environment. This is done

by specifying an alternative course for history, and then simulating the path of

employment under the maintained counterfactual. The deviation of the simulated

from the actual path of employment reveals the job loss (or gain) attributable to

the particular event under consideration.
                                              -4.-




          The derivation of the reduced-form employment equation begins with the

 specification of the production function for steel.3     I assume that steel is

 produced with five inputs: labor (L), capital (K), energy (E), iron ore (I)

 and scrap steel (H). The production function is assumed to have a Cobb-Douglas

 form,




 (1)                =   AeittK1L2E3I4M   1234
where it is the rate of Hicks-neutral technological progress and t denotes time.

         Energy and iron ore are assumed to be traded inputs, available to the steel

sector in infinitely-elastic supply at exogenous prices,    e and      respectively.
The quantity of each of these inputs used by a profit-maximizing industry is found

by setting its marginal value product equal to its price, or



                  ap Y

                         p.1

where       is the price of domestic steel.

         Capital, labor and steel scrap are non-traded factors. The supply of

capital in the steel industry is taken to be exogenous in the short run, and is

assumed to grow at a steady trend rate (including depreciation) of ó percent per

unit   time,

is a function of the total amount consumed according to a supply relationship.

specify the supply function simply as



                =   NeYt(pJp)C


where a is the aggregate price level.

      In this paper I consider two alternative treatments of the wage rate in the

steel industry. One possibility, following Grossman (1982), is to assume that

this variable is endogenous. Under this assumption, we need a structural equation

describing the supply of labor to the steel sector. A simple specification, which

allows for the possibility that labor is perfectly mobile between sectors in the

long run, but does not impose this restriction, is



(8)             =   L(w/p) d

where La is the aggregate supply of labor and is assumed to grow at constant rate

      Alternatively,   it has often been argued in the case of the U.S. steel

industry that wage rates are not determined in the usual way by the interaction of

the supply of and the demand for labor, but rather are a separate and relatively

exogenous factor that contributes to the evolution of employment in the industry.

Movements in these wages, it is claimed, are little affected by conditions in the

industry labor market, but rather reflect the relative negotiating success of the

steelworkers union vis-a-vis the steel producers, and the conditions in the U.S.

labor market at large.4     If this view is correct, then the industry wage rate

belongs as a separate explanatory variable in the reduced-form employment

equation, and it would be appropriate to inquire into the extent to which wage

pressures are themselves a cause of injury. Indeed, some industry observers have

further claimed that it is excessive wage pressures that deserve primary blame for

the current plight of the U.S. steel industry. In order to evaluate this

argument, and not rule it out a priori, I choose to remain agnostic on whether the

industry wage rate should be treated as an exogenous or an endogenous variable, by

estimating the employment equations that follow from either assumption.

     Finally, domestic steel is assumed to be an imperfect substitute for

imported   steel with exogenous price in foreign currency units, p. Thus, I am
assuming   that the excess supply of foreign steel to the U.S.   market   is perfectly

elastic, which may be a very reasonable approximation given the degree of excess

capacity that has characterized steel production in many countries during the last

decade.5 Domestic steel also is assumed to substitute imperfectly for the

aggregate basket of domestic goods, so that the demand facing the domestic steel

industry (which in equilibrium is equal to its output) is given by:
                                                                 —7—

                             PS                     PS


where    Q is aggregate industrial production, a measure of real industrial activity

that reflects the location of the demand curve for steel, E is the exchange rate,

t is the tariff rate applicable to U.S. steel imports and 4i is the rate of

secular demand shift. The latter incorporates the substitution of plastics and

aluminum for steel in construction, as well as the general down-sizing of

automobiles by the U.S. auto industry, two trends generally believed to be

responsible for a significant and persistent decline in the demand for steel in

recent years. Ideally it would have been preferable to identify these two effects

individually by including as separate variables in the demand equation the prices

of those materials that substitute for steel as well, as a measure of the state of

technical know-how in allowing such substitution, plus a measure of the size of

the average U.S. automobile, However, since our time series on employment is a

relatively short one, and since the secular trends in the demand for steel are

manifested rather slowly, it was not possible to treat these demand shifts

separately, but only to lump them with the other trend factors.

        If the industry wage rate is considered to be an exogenous variable, then

equations (1) through (7) and (9) are eight equations which together determine the

eight endogenous variables Y , K

                                                                                          ,   p s and pm as functions of the

exogenous variables, 1e'                  a' E, p*, t, w and Q. The reduced-form equation

for employment is, after taking logs,



(10) log L =       +
                       a1t   +
                                 a2   log(p /p ) +                     log(w /p ) +                     log(p./p)

                                         -8—




 Alternatively, if the wage rate is treated as an endogenous variable, then

 equation (8) is added to the structural system, and the reduced-form equation does

 not include the term a3 log (w/p).

      An important thing to notice about the reduced-form equation for industry

employment is that the volume of steel imports does not appear explicitly. This

is because the volume of imports is itself an endogenous variable, influenced not

only by developments in the steel sectors outside the United States, but also by

events at home. For example, if technological advances were to raise the

productivity of labor in all domestic steel firms, there would be a simultaneous

increase in the number of jobs in the domestic industry and a decline in the level

of imports. It would of course be wrong in this case to attribute the gain in

employment to an abatement of import competition. It seems that when we seek to

implement the Section 201 statute requiring an assessment of the injury caused by

imports, we should identify the state of import competition not by the volume of

imports or by the extent of "import penetration", but rather by the location of

the foreign excess supply curve for steel. Then, if we are willing to assume that

this supply curve is perfectly elastic, we find that the real price of imported

steel is the appropriate measure of import competition that enters into the

reduced-form equation.

      The reduced-form employment equation, in its two alternative forms, was

estimated using monthly observations from January 1973 through October 1983 (the

latest data available at the time of writing). The starting date was chosen

because prior to 1973 there were binding "voluntary" quotas in effect on exports

of steel to the United States.6   When such quantitative restrictions are binding,

it is impossible to assume, as we have done, that the supply of foreign steel to

the U.S. market is perfectly elastic.
                                               -9—




       Since   monthly data were used   in   the estimation, it was necessary to

 incorporate lags on all of the exogenous variables to reflect the period of

 adjustment necessary to move from one long-run equilibrium to another. That is,

 due to the existence of various rigidities in the marketplace (e.g.,long term

 supply contracts, methods of production that are fixed in the short run, etc.), it

 is exceedingly unlikely that the total cumulative effect on employment of a change

In one of the exogenous variables would be realized after one month. Instead, I

began by specifying an eighteen month lag structure for each of the exogenous

variables. Initial estimates showed, however, that full adjustment of employment

to changes in U.S. industrial activity and to changes in the real wage rate

occurred considerably sooner than eighteen months. The final specification

therefore Incorporated a period of adjustment of only five months for these

variables.

      Before proceeding to a discussion of the regression results, let me briefly

describe the data that were used in the estimation. The dependent variable was

taken to be the (log of the) average weekly hours of employment by production

workers in the blast furnaces and steel mills industry (SIC 3312).8         Both average

hours of employment per week and the total number of production workers were

collected from. the B.L.S. publication, Employment and Earnings. The net-of-tariff

dollar price of imported steel was calculated as a geometric weighted average of

the import unit values for three subcategories of steel product imports, as

reported in Highlights of U.S. Exports and Imports. The categories were (i)

tubes, pipes and fittings, (ii) universals, plates and sheets, and (iii) wire

rods, structurals, bars and pilings, and the weights were the import shares of

each of these categories for the year l977. The domestic price of imported steel

was adjusted for tariff changes, incorporating both the Nixon import surcharge and

the Tokyo Round tariff reductions. Average industry tariff rates were those
                                          -10-V




 calculated for use in the Michigan Model of World Production and Trade (see

 Deardorff and Stern, 1983). Finally, the entire series was deflated by the

 aggregate producer price index (B.L.S., Producer Price and Price Indexes), to

 express the prices in real terms.

       The real industrial activity variable was the (log of the) Federal Reserve

 Boards index of industrial production. The wage variable was the (log of the)

 average hourly wage of production workers for SIC 3312, taken from Employment and

Earnings, and deflated by the aggregate producer price index. The price of iron

ore was similarly defined as a real magnitude, where the numerator was the iron

ore price series from Producer Price and Price Indexes. Finally, the price of

energy faced by the steel industry was constructed as a composite index of the

prices of coking coal, electric power, natural gas and residual fuels (all from

Producer Price and Price Indexes, and all deflated by the aggregate producer price

index). The weights used' in forming this index were the shares of these

individual inputs in the total per unit   cost    of energy used in steel production,

as computed by Duke et. al. (1977).

     The coefficients from the reduced-form regressions are shown in Table 1. Two

sets of estimates are reported: the first column is for the regression that

included as an explanatory variable the real wage of steel workers; the second

regression excluded this variable. As is evident, the two sets of estimates for

the remaining coefficients are quite similar, so we will henceforth take as our

preferred set the one that includes wage pressures as an independent cause of

employment changes. All of the coefficients, with the exception of that on the

time trend variable, are to be interpreted as elasticities. In addition, all of

the elasticities reported are "total e1asticitis", that is, the full response of

employment to a change in the exogenous variable after complete adjustment has

taken place. (The figures in parentheses below each of the coefficients are the

standard errors of the estimates.)

       The estimated reduced-form coefficients show that employment in the steel

  industry is relatively sensitive to both business cycle fluctuations and
                                                                             import
 prices. The elasticity of employment with respect to industrial production is

 estimated as 1.40, significant at the one-percent level. This suggests that

 fluctuations in industrial activity have a more than proportional effect on

 employment in the steel sector. A one percent decline in import prices will cause

 a 1.067 percent fall in employment in the industry (again significant at the one

 percent level), as import competition exerts downward pressure on domestic steel

 prices, and thus reduces the derived demand for labor in the domestic
                                                                         industry.
 This is a higher degree of sensitivity to import competition than was found for

 eight of the nine industries that I studied in Grossman (1982). This
                                                                         probably
 reflects the fact that domestic and imported steel are fairly close substitutes,

 so that a fall in import prices exerts strong downward pressure on the price of

 domestically—produced steel.

      The estimates show that there has been a downward trend in employment in the

U.S. steel industry. For the period from January 1973 to October 1983 we estimate

that even if all of the exogenous variables included in the regression had

remained constant, employment would have fallen at a monthly rate of 0.751

percent. It would be useful to know what accounts for this secular shift
                                                                             away
from employment in the steel industry. Among the possible contributing

explanations are a general economy-wide shift in employment to the services and

high-technology sectors, a trend substitution of aluminum, plastics and other

materials for steel, labor-saving technological progress in steel production, and

a steady down-sizing of automobiles produced in the United States (automobiles

being a major source of demand for the output of the U.S. steel industry).

Unfortunately, the estimation of separate coefficients for each of these trend

variables must await the accumulation of additional data.
                                        -13-




      Employment in the steel industry is found to be insensitive to the price of

energy inputs used in steel production, although the large standard error on the

parameter estimate leaves open the possibility that the elasticity is actually

somewhat larger. According to the estimated coefficient, the "output effect",

whereby an increase in energy prices makes domestic steel production less

profitable and decreases activity in the industry, is almost offset by the

"substitution effectt', whereby higher energy prices induce substitution of labor

for energy in the production process.

      When industry wages are included as an exogenous determinant of industry

employment, the estimated elasticity is -.596. Thus, the total effect of an

exogenous increase of hourly wages of one percent would be a fall in hours of

employment of approximately six-tenths of one percent. As indicated above, this

labor demand response occurs largely within a five month period.

      The final variable included in the reduced-form regressions was the real

price of iron ore. The cost of iron ore makes up a significant fraction of the

total unit cost of steel production, and possibilities for substitution for iron

ore in the production process are limited, so one would expect that an exogenous

increase in U.S. iron ore prices (everything else constant) would effect a fall in

steel output as steel production becomes less profitable. This in turn should mean

a decline in industry employment. However, our estimates show exactly the

opposite relationship between U.S. iron ore prices and employment in the U.S.

steel industry. A possible explanation for this anomoly is that iron ore prices

are not, in fact, exogenous with respect to developments in the U.S. steel

industry, as was assumed. If periods of great activity in the U.S. steel sector

are associated both with high employment and upward pressure on world iron ore

prices, then we would observe a positive correlation between these two variables,
                                       -14-



although it would not be correct to attribute the increase in either of them to

the rise in the other.



III. COUNTERFACTUAL SIMULATIONS

      The U.S steel industry has experienced a decline in employment of more than

200,000 production workers during the period from 1973 to 1983. In order to

attribute this decline in employment to its various causes, it is necessary to

specify an historical counterfactual. That is, we need to compare the actual path

of employment with what might have been under an assumed alternative industry

development. In this section we calculate the loss of employment that can be

explained by import competition, by secular shift in factor allocation, by the

recent recession in the United States, by real wage pressures and by movements in

the real price of energy. In each case we specify an alternative path for the

exogenous variable of interest, assuming, for example, no intensification of

import competition, no secular shift out of steel employment, steady four percent

amiual growth in real output, etc. We simulate the path of the dependent variable

(hours of employment) using the actual and the assumed counterfactual values for

the exogenous variables, and identify the difference between the two sets of

predicted values as the relevant effect on employment. Finally, we can subtract

this employment effect from the actual path of industry employment to arrive at a

prediction of what employment would have been under the counterfactual assumption.

     For each variable we take two alternative starting points for our

simulations: January 1976 and January 1979. The shorter period coincides with

the major part of the decline in employment in the U.S. steel industry since 1973,

while the longer period can be justified on the grounds that it incorporates

roughly one complete evolution of the business cycle. This is also the period

designated by the petitioners to the ITC in the recent escape clause hearings.
                                        -15-



       A. Employment Loss Due to Import Competition

       As I have argued above, it would be inappropriate to identify import

 competition with the volume of imports, since the latter is an endogenous variable

 influenced by developments in both the domestic and foreign industries, as well as

 by changes in domestic and foreign demand. Instead, we should attribute job

 losses in the domestic industry to an intensification of import competition only

when there has been a shift in the foreign excess supply curve. Since we have

assumed that this supply curve is perfectly elastic, we must specify our

counterfactual in terms of movements In the price of imported steel.

      The price of imported steel to domestic consumers is the product of three

separate components. A decline in any of these components will induce a shift in

demand towards imported steel, and thus exert downward pressure on the price of

the domestic product. These components are     (1) the foreign currency price of

steel produced abroad for export to the United States, as determined by supply and

demand conditions in the foreign steel sectors, (ii) the exchange rate, expressed

in dollars per unit of foreign currency, and (iii) one plus the ad valorem rate of

tariff protection applied to steel imports. Thus, the job loss associated with an

intensification of import competition is really the sum of three separate effects:

that of exchange rate movements, that of tariff reductions, and that of

developments in the foreign steel sectors.

      There remains the question of whether, for purposes of an escape clause

determination, import competition as a cause of injury should be measured

inclusive or exclusive of the effect of exchange rate movements. Unfortunately,

the statutory language provides no explicit guidance concerning the treatment of

exchange rate changes, nor does the legislative history of Section 201 shed any

light on this matter.'°   One could argue on economic grounds that escape clause

protection ought not be granted when appreciation of the domestic currency is the
                                        -16-




 cause of injury to a domestic industry. The reason is that a real appreciation of

 a currency effects a worsening of the country's competitive position across a wide

 range of industries, including virtually all tradable goods sectors. Selective

 import protection would cause the currency to appreciate even further, and would

 shift the burden of adjustment to whatever macroeconomic events that caused the

initial appreciation onto the other, already-injured exportable and non—protected

importable industries. In other words, when exchange rate movements impart harm

across the entire spectrum of tradable goods industries, the justification of

escape clause protection on distributional grounds is weak, since any aid to one

injured industry comes at the expense of others in a similar position.

Nonetheless, the issue is essentially a legal one that is as yet unresolved, so I

will proceed to quantify the job loss in the U.S. steel industry attributable to

import competition under both alternative treatments of the recent appreciation of

the dollar.

      The total effect of import competition (including the exchange rate effects)

on steel industry employment cn be found by simulating hours of employment under

the counterfactual assumption that the real dollar price of imported steel

remained unchanged. This assumption implies a stable foreign excess supply curve

when drawn in the space of (real) U.S. dollars. In one simulation we set the

dollar price of imported steel (deflated by the domestic producer price index)

equal to its value in January 1976 for the entire period from then until October

1983. The second simulation was conducted similarly, but under the assumption of

no intensification or abatement of import competition since January 1979. The

actual and predicted paths of employment (measured in manhours per week) are shown

in Figures 1 and 2.11

     Evidently, intensification of import competition has been responsible for a

substantial loss of employment in the U.S. steel industry, but only when 1979 is
                                       —17—



taken as the base year. The figures show the effects of import competition on

employment being concentrated during the last quarter of 1980 and the first

quarter of 1981, and again during the first three quarters of 1983. We find that

if the price of imported steel had risen at the rate of inflation of the domestic

price index since 1979, the average level of production employment during August

through October, 1983 would have been 11.64 million hours per week, rather than

the actual average of 8.40 million hours. If import competition had remained at

its 1976 level in the intervening years, the figure would have been 9.90 million

hours per week. Dividing the figures for hours of employment by the observed

average number of hours per worker per week in each month, we arrive at a figure

of 80,959 for the job loss attributable to intensification of import competition

since 1979. The analagous figure for the loss since 1976 is 37,403 jobs.

      The timing of the import competition effect seems to coincide with the

periods of rapid appreciation of the dollar. To see how much of the effect of

import competition on steel industry employment can be attributed solely to

movements of exchange rates, we constructed an index of the dollar value of

foreign currency by weighting the bilateral dollar exchange rates for fifteen

major steel exporters by the share of each of these countries in U.S. steel

imports. We then simulated steel industry employment under the alternative

assumptions that the dollar maintained its value as of January 1976 and as of

January 1979 (i.e. we assumed that no dollar appreciation or depreciation took

place in the intervening years). In these simulations, the foreign currency price

of imported steel and the tariff rate applicable to steel imports were allowed to

take on their historical values. The results of these simulations are shown in

Figures 3 and 4.

      We find that a large part of the total effect of import competition on

employment since 1976 is attributable to the appreciation of the dollar. Had the
                                        -18-




dollar remained at its January 1976 level, there would have been (on average)

29,037 more jobs in the U.S. steel industry during August through October, 1983.

When we take 1979 as our base, the results are even more striking. Appreciation

of the dollar since then has been responsible for the loss of 82,701 jobs in the

U.S. steel industry (average for August to October, 1983), which accounts for more

than the full effect attributable to import competition during these years.

        Our next counterfactual simulation assumed only the absence of the Tokyo

Round tariff reductions. The average employment loss attributable to the decreased

rate of protection of the domestic steel industry after 1979 is 1,216 job.

Subtracting the exchange rate effect and the tariff reduction effect from the

total import competition effect, we conclude that very little of the decline in

employment in the U.S. steel industry can be explained by a change in supply and

demand conditions in the steel sectors outside the United States. The shift in

the foreign excess supply curve drawn in the space of real foreign currency units

accounts for only 7,150 of the jobs lost since 1976. And, if we take January 1979

as our baseline date instead, and ask what would have occurred had the foreign

currency price of U.S. steel imports grown at the same rate as the aggregate U.S.

producer price index, we find that the industry would have had on average 2,958

fewer jobs during August through October, 1983 than was actually the case. In

other words, leaving aside the effects of exchange rate appreciation and the

reductions in tariff rates, import competition actually has abated somewhat since

1979.




        B. Employment Loss Due to Secular Shift

        The reduced-form regression coefficient indicates that employment in the

U.S. steel industry has been declinIng by more than 0.75 percent per month for

reasons that, for the purposes of this study, can on1y be described as long-term
                                        —19—



 secular shift. As discussed above, the time trend variable picks up the effect of

 changes in technology, shifts of the demand for steel, and structural reallocation

 of resources into growth sectors such as services and high-technology products.

      Had the time trend in industry employment been zero since January 1976,

weekly hours of employment by production workers would have averaged 16.76 million

during August through October 1983. Similarly, we estimate that employment during

this period would have averaged 12.79 million production hours per week had the

secular shift been absent only since January 1979. These figures translate into

an employment loss of 208,734 jobs and 109,600 jobs, respectively.



      C. Employment Loss Due to Sluggish Real Income Growth

      Steel is an important intermediate input to many industrial activities in

the U.S. economy. It is not surprising, therefore, that employment in the

industry is sensitive to the stage of the business cycle. When industrial

activity is depressed, demand for steel will be so as well, and workers in the

U.S. industry will be laid off as a result.

      We conducted several simulations to ascertain the implications for steel

employment of the recent U.S. recession. In one pair of simulations we assumed a

steady rate of growth of real industrial production of four percent per annum.

Had such growth occurred from January 1979 through October 1983, the average level

of employment in the last three months of our time period would have been 10.37

million hours per week. Thus, the recession during this period is responsible for

a decline in employment of 49,251 workers. Replacing the actual path of real

income growth since January 1976 by a path exhibiting a steady four percent growth

per year yields an estimate for the average level of employment during August

through October 1983 of 9.48 million hours per week. This employment level would

have meant 27,031 more jobs. The difference between these two counterfactuals
                                       -20-




arises because the former assumes away the most recent recession while still

allowing for the boom that immediately preceded it, while the latter considers a

steady path of growth between roughly comparable points in the business cycle.

     A second pair of simulations was conducted under the more conservative

assumption of three percent annual growth in real icome. If such had been the

case since January 1979, the average August-October 1983 number of jobs would have

been 33,577 greater than was actually observed. Three percent growth of

industrial production for the entire period since January 1976 would have meant

3,777 more jobs on average during the period from August through October, 1983.



     D. Employment Loss Due to Wage Pressures

      Some observers have attributed much of the loss of employment in the U.S.

steel industry in recent years to the movement of wages in that industry. The

claim is that the steelworker's union has been unusually successful at the

bargaining table, and that the resulting wage hikes have caused steel

manufacturers to substitute for labor in the production process. We investigated

the validity of these claims by simulating a path for industry employment under

the counterfactual assumption that wage growth in the industry was exactly equal

to the average wage growth for all private, non-agricultural workers. If this had

been the case during the period from January 1976 thorugh October 1983, there

would have been only 5,047 more jobs in the U.S. steel industry during the last

three months of theperiod. Industry wage growth equal to average since Janaury

1979 would actually have meant 4,101 fewer jobs in the U.S. steel industry.

Evidently, the rate of wage increase in recent years in the steel industry has

been fairly close to the average for private, non-agricultural workers, so that

not much of the industry's recent employment decline can be explained in this way.
                                        -21-



       It should be pointed out that our wage figures are for direct compensation,

 and do not include fringe benefits. To the extent that benefits have increased at

 a faster rate in the steel industry than elsewhere in the economy, it is possible

 that this has been responsible for some of the loss in industry employment.12



       E. Employment Loss Due to Increase in the Price of Energy

       Our final pair of simulations was intended to measure injury caused by

 increases in the price of energy faced by producers of steel.     As for the other

 variables, we conducted our analysis with starting dates of January 1976 and

January 1979. In each case we assumed in our counterfactua]. comparisons that the

 composite price of energy inputs grew at a rate equal to the rate of inflation of

the aggregate producer price index. We found that an increase in relative energy

prices since 1976 can explain the loss of 3,582 jobs in the U.S. steel industry.

Had the relative price of energy remained at its January 1979 level throughout the

period since then, there would have been an estimated 2,966 more jobs in the

industry (on average) during August through October, 1983.



IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

      The findings from the counterfactual analysis are summarized in Table 2.

The table shows the total loss of employment, measured in numbers of production

workers, that can be attributed to each of the proximate causes discussed above.

I report in the table only the cumulative effect as of August-October 1983, for

the two alternative choices of starting dates.

     The analysis shows that for the period from 1976 to 1983 the most important

cause of injury to the U.S. steel industry has been a general secular shift away

from employment in this sector.'3 This trend incorporates several factors,

including possibly a labor-saving change in the production technology, faster than
                                        -22-




average growth of employment and productivity in the high-technology and service

sectors (which has meant that resources have been drawn away from more traditional

manufacturing industries), and a slow decline in the demand for domestic steel not

explained by either relative price or real income movements.14

      For the period since 1979 the evidence is mixed. Our estimates show that

secular factors have been quantitatively most significant even during this shorter

time period. Intensification of import competition has had nearly as large an

impact during this period, with the difference falling well within the confidence

interval for our analysis.15

I have argued further that the import competition effect is actually the sum    of
three separate components: the effect of shifts in the foreign excess supply

curve for steel (in foreign currency units), the effect of exchange rate changes

and the effect of U.S. tariff reductions. Of these, only the sharp appreciation

of the dollar in the last four years can be held responsible for the loss of a

significant number of jobs in the U.S. steel industry. Movements in the foreign

excess supply curve account for the loss of only 7,150 steel industry jobs since

1976, and in the period since January 1979, import competition measured in this

way has actually abated somewhat.

      What does the analysis imply about the merits of the Section 201 escape

clause case heard recently by the U.S. International Trade Commission? Clearly,

the period of analysis is important. The petitioners cited the period since 1976

as the relevant one. During this time, import competition cannot be considered to

be the most important cause of injury to the U.S. steel industry; the secular

decline that the industry has been undergoing for more than a decade has been

responsible for the loss of more than five times as many jobs as has the

intensification of import competition. In the most recent four years, however,

import competition and secular decline have been roughly equal as causes of injury

to the industry. But the injury due to import competition during this period is

entirely the result of the more-than- thirty-percent real appreciation of the U.S.

dollar. Thus, escape clause protection could only be justified under the Section

201 statute if it were determined on legal grounds that exchange rate effects do

qualify as !?injury caused by imports", despite sound economic arguments that

suggest that protection should not be provided in such instances.

                                       Footnotes



 1.    Historically, the International Trade Commmission, in making its Section 201

       determinations, has relied heavily on the subjective testimony of industry

       experts, and on other more casual forms of industry analysis. Incidentally,

       on June 12, 1984 the I.T.C. found in favor of the petitioners in the case

       that is the subject of this paper. As of the time of this writing, the

      Commission is deliberating on the form of protection to recommend to the

      President.

2.    Note that, in principle, this same methodology could be used to analyze other

      industry developments besides employment, such as the evolution of industry

      production, sales, profits, etc. An initial attempt was made to estimate a

      reduced-form equation for steel sector sales, using tons of carbon steel

      shipments (as reported by the American Iron and Steel Institute) as the

      endogenous variable. However, the equation left much of the variance in

      shipments unexplained, and most of the estimated reduced-form coefficients

      had large standard errors (in several cases, larger than the absolute value

      of the estimated coefficient). For this reason, we did not proceed with the

      simulations of steel shipments, concentrating instead on the employment

      equations for which the estimation yielded a better fit and more precise

      estimates of the parameters.

3.    The derivation of the reduced-form equation and the justifications for some

      of the assumptions are kept intentionally brief. The interested reader is

      referred to Grossman (1982) for a more detailed discussion.

4.    It would also be appropriate to treat wages in the steel industry as

      exogenous if labor is highly mobile and if the steel industry is small in

      relation to the U.S. economy. A high degree of intersectoral labor mobility
                                         —29—




       is consistent with the findings of Grossman (1982). Nine U.S. industries

       were studied there, and it was found that the price of imports had a

       non-negligible effect on the industry wage rate in only one of these.

 5.    The trigger price mechanism, in force since the mid-19701s, also contributes

       to a high elasticity of supply of imported steel into the United States. The

       trigger prices essentially serve as a price floor for European of Japanese

       steel in the U.S. market, so that even if the import supply curves from these

       sources would be upward sloping in its absence, they would be perfectly

       elastic in the neighborhood of equilibrium whenever the policy is binding.
6.     In fact, VER's continued to place an upper bound on imports from some foreign

       suppliers until the end of 1974. However, Crandall (1981, p.103) has shown

      in his careful study of the U.S. steel industry that the quantitative

      restrictions were binding before 1972, but ceased to be so after that date.
7.    The lag structures for import prices, for the price of energy and for the

      price of iron ore were specified as fourth-degree polynomial-distributed

      lags. Those for wages and real industrial activity were estimated as

      five-month free lags. In addition, the equations included a constant term,

      and were corrected for first-order serial correlation of the residuals using

      an iterative, maximum-likelihood procedure.

8.    SIC 3312 was selected over SIC 331 (blast furnaces and steel products)

      because 3312, by excluding some fabricators, is closer to the industry at

      issue in the recent escape clause proceedings.

9.    It would have been preferable to use actual import prices, rather than an

      index of unit values. However, the B.L.S. series for U.S. import prices by

      industry are too short to allow us to estimate the reduced-form regressions.

      Another possibility would be to use export prices of steel for our trade

      partner countries. Export prices for continental European steel are
                                       -30-




     available in the Metals Bulletin. However, the data series are not complete.

     Another problem with using these data would be that the existence of the U.S.

     trigger prices mechanism during our sample period suggests that European

     steel prices averaged across all export markets are a poor proxy for the

     price of European steel delivered to the U.S. market. In defense of the use

     of unit values in this case, it can be argued that foreign steel is a

     relatively homogenous product, so that changes in the value of shipments for

     a given quantity sold are unlikely to reflect changes in the quality of the

     product. Duke et. al. (1977) found that unit values tracked the prices

     reported in the Metals Bulletin fairly closely after a lag of three months.

10. Note that Congressional debate on the Trade Reform Act of 1974 took place

     during a period of fixed exchange rates.

11. Recall that the predicted path of employment under the counterfactual

     assumption of no intensification of import competition is found by

     subtracting from the actual employment values the difference between the

     simulated values using assumed and historical values for the exogenous

     variables. In effect, we add back in the residual from the reduced-form

     regressions in forming our prediction of "what would have been" under the

     assumed counterfactual.

12. Unpublished data from the Office of Productivity and Technology of the Bureau

    of Labor Statistics shows that total compensation for production workers in

    the steel industry has increased by 94.5 percent from 1976 to 1983. The same

    source reports an increase of 81.1 percent in total compensation to all

    employees in manufacturing industries in the United States during this

    period. If total compensation in the steel sector had grown at this slower

    (average for all sectors) rate, and if the estimated wage elasticity of - .596

    can be assumed to apply to total compensation, then an additional 4.1 percent
                                        —31—




      of the employment in 1976 would have been preserved in 1983. This amounts to

      approximately 15,000 jobs, as compared to the figure of 5046 for wage

      pressure alone.

13. A one-tailed t-test of the hypothesis that the estimated job loss

      attributable to import competition is greater than or equal to that

      attributable to secular shift for the period 1976 to 1983 can be rejected at

      the 99% significance level.

14. A rough calculation using data from Ward's Automotive Yearbook on pounds of

      steel in the "typical" U.S. car and on total car and truck production by the

      U.S. automobile industry, and assuming (arbitrarily) that the employment

      elasticity with respect to steel output is one, would suggest that the

      reduction in demand for steel by the U.S. automobile industry (due to both

      the down-sizing of cars and the retrenchment in the industry) could account

      for as much as one-quarter of the job loss attributed to secular decline.

15.   It is impossible to reject the hypothesis at even the eighty precent level of

      significance that the employment effect of secular shift and that of import

      competition are equal for the period 1979 to 1983.
