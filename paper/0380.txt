                     The Canadian Dollar, 1971-76:
          An Exploratory Investigation of Short—Run Movements



                               ABSTRACT




      This paper examines the movement of the Canadian dollar over

the 1971-76 period. Although Canadian prices increased substantially

more than U.S. prices over this period, there was no tendency for a

systematic depreciation of the Canadian dollar. To explain this

phenomenon requires the introduction of other factors into the

exchange rate equation. Among the variables that proved significant

are the Canadian terms of trade, measures of long-term borrowing, the

relative cyclical position of Canada and the United States, and the

market's errors in forecasting the current account balance. When used

together with relative prices, these variables track the movement of

the Canadian dollar very satisfactorily over the period.

        1.   INTRODUCTION

             Most discussions of movements of exchange rates over the medium to

        long run begin with some variant of the purchasing power parity (PPP)
        type of analysis. An application of PPP to the movements of the
        Canadian dollar over the period l97lQl—1976Q31 leads to a very
        puzzling result -   over a period when prices in Canada increased
        about 15% more than prices in the United States (GNE deflators) the

        Canadian dollar showed no tendency to a systematic depreciation. (See
        Figures 1 and 2.)    It is clear that other factors must have played an
-
    .   important   role in explaining, first, why the Canadian dollar did not

        depreciate almost continuously over the 1972—1976 period, and, second,
        what caused the cyclical movements over the period. The aim of this

        paper is to specify these other factors and to show that they kept up
        the value of the Canadian dollar at a time when PPP considerations
        would have resulted in a substantial depreciation.

             In Section 2 of this paper I set out a somewhat eclectic view of
        exchange rate determination.    I begin with the Haas—Alexander model,
        and show its relationship to the Dornbusch version of the rational

        expectations model. In both of these models the expected exchange
        rate plays a crucial role and it is to the modelling of these

        expectations that I devote a great deal of attention. Included in the
        elements entering into the determination of the expected exchange rate

        are purchasing power parity, terms of trade, measures of long—term
        borrowing, the relative cyclical position of Canada and the United
        States, and the market's errors in forecasting the current account
        balance. Each of these factors enters the equation with a lag to
                                     2




reflect the notion that it is only when the announcement of monthly or
quarterly data is made by the statistics—gathering agency that it can

affect the market's perception of what is happening.
      In order to model the errors in forecasting the current account
balance it is necessary to develop an equation to explain the movements

of the current account balance. A simple equation is presented in

Section 3 inwhich the current account balance is regressed on measures
of competitiveness, the terms of trade, and the relative cyclical
position. Residuals from this equation are introduced as a regressor

in the exchange rate equation. The various regression equations for
the exchange rate are also presented in Section   3.   In Section 4 I
compare the coefficients across the two equations and draw some rather
peculative conclusions from their relative magnitudes.     FinaLty, in
Section   5 I return to the questions posed at the beginning of this
.ection and discuss in general terms the movements of the exchange rate
over the 1971 to 1976 period.


2.   THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK

     Although there is a variety of theoretical models from which to
choose2 I shall use a variant of the Haas—Alexander portfolio balance

model3 as the starting point for the analysis. The Haas—Alexander
model can be developed as follows:
                                      3




     (JLS*(or ULS*/Scale) = a + b(RCAN—RUS) + cPFX — dPFXE
     tULS = e(ULS* —
                     EJLS1)
     ULS     = — UBAL/PFx   +   FXO




where ULS*(ULS) is the desired (actual) stock of net short—term

                   liabilities to foreigners
      RCAN         is the Canadian interest rate
      RUS          is the U.S. interest rate
      PFX          is the spot rate (Canadian dollars per U.S.
                  dollar)
      PFXE         is the spot rate expected one period (three
                  months) in the future
      UBAL         is the basic balance surplus
      FXO         is the change in Canadian reserves (intervention)


     The desired stock of net short—term liabilities to foreigners is a

function of the interest rate differential between Canada and the
United States, the current spot rate and the expected spot rate.

Actual liabilities are adjusted to the desired stock via the usual

stock—adjustment model. The change in privately—held net short—term
liabilities to foreigners (i.e. private short—term capital inflows) is
by definition equal to the basic balance deficit plus the increase in
Canadian reserves.4

    Substituting, we get
                                         4




     PFX =   — a/c + d/c PFXE — b/c(RCAN—RtJS)
             +   1/c   ULS_1 + l/ec(FXO—UBAL/PFX)


Note that if d = c (as suggested by theory) and if complete adjustment

occurs in the period of observation (e =           1    as suggested by Haas and
Alexander), this equation becomes


     PFX =   - a/c     + PFXE - b/c(RCAN—RtJS) +       1/c   ULS



     Dornbusch5 writes the spot rate equation as


     PFX = PFXE/(l+RCAN—RtJS)

             PFXE (l—RCAN+RUS)
         = PFXE — (RCAN—RUS)       if PFXE = 1



In writing the equation in this way one must be careful to ensure that
the same horizon holds for PFXE and the interest rates. The main point

of difference between Haas—Alexander (H—A) and Dornbusch is the
incorporation of the ULS term (or ULS_1 and FXO — UBAL/PFX) in H—A

and the a priori imposition of a coefficient of unity on both b/c and
d/c. These differences between the two theories can be subjected to
empirical testing.
     The crucial element in our treatment of PFX is the specification
of PFXE. Rather than a simple autoregressive equation (including

reserve change) as in H—A or simple purchasing power parity as in some
                                   5



versions of Dornbusch6 we incorporate a large number of economic
factors into PFXE. The basis of our treatment is the traditional

purchasing power parity theory modified to take account of other
factors, and the incorporation of some aspects of efficient market
theory. Thus we include in PFXE the following:


(1) purchasing power parity
(2)  relative cyclical position
(3) terms of trade
(4)  long—term borrowing
(5)  the error in forecasting the current account balance.

Each of these factors is entered with a lag to reflect the notion that
it is only upon the announcement of the statistics by the data—

gathering agency that the market changes its views of the evolution of
the variables that enter into the determination of the exchange rate.
I now turn to each of these factors in more detail.

      In some very long run, if all other things were equal, one could
argue that exchange rate movements should reflect differences in price

movements between countries. This venerable theory of relative

purchasing power parity (PPP) is still useful as a starting point for
the analysis of expected exchange rates.7 In a slightly different
guise it turns up in discussions of competitiveness which is usually
measured as the extent to which PPP is not achieved (although normally

limited to the manufacturing sector). Even the earliest exponents of
PPP recognized limitations to treating the exchange rate as being

determiried.solely by PPP.8 Of the qualifications they suggested,
some focussed on the question of why actual exchange rates were not

equal to equilibrium exchange rates whereas others dealt with factors
that would affect the equilibrium rate itself. In the latter category
                                  6



the relevant ones for our purposes are continuing long—term capital
movements and certain kinds of real changes in the economy.

     The change in the equilibrium or long—run expected exchange rate
is thus hypothesized to be a function of expected differential price
movements between Canada and the rest of the world (principally the

United States) over the relevant period, the change in the perceived

long—run level of long—term borrowings abroad by provinces,

municipalities, and corporations and perceived permanent real changes
in the economy that impinge on the exchange rate. Long—term borrowing
is important in that an increase in the continuing inflow of long—term

capital implies, in the long run, an increase in the Canadian current
account deficit which is consistent with an appreciation of the
Canadian dollar. There are two main elements in the category of real

changes to the economy. First, and more important, is the shift in the
relative price of resources of which Canada is a major producer. These
movements can be proxied either by Canada's own terms of trade figures
or by the ratio of world raw materials prices to manufactures prices.

The increase in the prices of Canadian resource exports is roughly

equivalent in its effects on the exchange rate to an increase in demand
by foreigners for Canadian goods in that there is a new higher
equilibrium value for the Canadian dollar that will result in the same
current account balance as the old exchange rate. The second aspect of
real economic movements that might affect the equilibrium value of the

Canadian dollar is the relative cyclical position of Canada and its
trading partners. If the cycles were synchronized then this factor
would have little effect. Even if the cycles were unsynchronized, to
                                  7




the extent that participants in the exchange market could "see through"
the cycle there would be no effect on the equilibrium exchange rate.

However, since business cycles tend to last for a period that is
probably longer than the horizon for "fundamental analysis" of most

participants in the exchange market, and since it may be difficult to
disentangle cyclical effects from other real effects there is probably

some adjustment of the equilibrium exchange rate over the cycle.
     An alternative interpretation of the effect of the relative
cyclical position is as follows. In theory, expected exchange rates

are a function of the expected relative price levels and not the actual
price levels but it is the latter that are used in the equation. The

cyclical term may be proxying for the expected price inflation in the

near future and thus plays an important role in the formation of the
market's expectations of future exchange rate movements. For example,
given current relative price levels,
                                       larger slack in Canada than in the
United States might signal that Canadian inflation will be slowing
relative to U.S. inflation and hence will tend to strengthen the
Canadian dollar. Note that the sign on the relative cyclical variable
is thus the reverse of that predicted by the simple monetarist approach

to the balance of payments in which lower income in Canada (more slack)
leads to a depreciation of the Canadian dollar.9
     In the context of the framework outlined thus far, one can

integrate the role of the announcement of the trade balance and/or

current account into the analysis. The change in the equilibrium
expected exchange rate is a function of perceived permanent changes in

the factors underlying international transactions, especially PPP,
                                    8




demand factors (such as the world price of raw materials), long—term

borrowing, and perhaps the relative business cycle position. The role
of the announcement of, say, trade numbers, is to provide another piece
of information to the market as to whether their assessment of

underlying shifts was correct. For example, suppose the prices of
Canada's exports of raw materials had risen on world markets as a
result of an increase in world demand for these commodities. The
effect of such a shift on the equilibrium exchange rate will depend on

(a) the extent to which it is a relatively long—run change, (b) the

effect of the change on the Canadian current account if the exchange

rate remained unchanged, (c) the required shift of the exchange rate to
wipe out the increase in the current account.'° Even if the market
were able to assess all these factors correctly, the Canadian dollar

would temporarily appreciate to a position above the new equilibrium
since there would be a transitory current account. surplus because of

the lags in adjustment to exchange rate changes. As the current
account moved back to zero, the Canadian dollar would depreciate to its

long run equilibrium, thereby yielding a capital gain to the short term
speculators. To the extent that current account announcements are
consistent with the expectations of the market, i.e. are anticipated,
there will be no effect on the exchange rate. Indeed in the scenario

outlined, there will be a declining although positive current account
balance associated with a depreciating Canadian dollar. However, any
trade numbers that are not consistent with expectations raise questions
about whether the initial assessment was in error (any of items (a) to
(C)   above) or whether another shock had occurred that had not yet been
                                          9




     perceived (e.g. a permanent shift in demand by Canadians for foreign
     goods). Given the errors in the statistics and given the randomness
                                                                         of
     any single month's numbers, a single unexpected data point is not
     likely to have very much effect on expectations (i.e. there is a high

     noise.-to—signaj. ratio) whereas a series of such data points would

     undoubtedly bring about a revision in views.
          Thus announcements about unanticipated changes in underlying

    factors (e.g. prices, discovery of exportable minerals, increase in

    gross borrowing requirements of provincial governments) can have a
    direct effect on expectations whereas
                                          announcements of outcomes (e.g.
    trade balances, basic balance) that are unanticipated have an indirect
    effect by requiring a r—examjnatjon of the market's assessment of the

    underlying factors. The way we introduce this element into the
    exchange rate determination equation is to enter the difference between
    the actual (announced) current account balance and that predicted by a

    simple equation. The latter explains the
                                                 current account position by a
    distributed lag on competitiveness or the reciprocal of the real

    exchange rate (i.e. relative price levels deflated by the exchange

    rate), the terms of trade, and the relative cyclical position.

         Turning to interest rate effects on the exchange rate, we can use
    theory to shed some light on the size of the coefficient of the
    interest rate differential term. Since we have treated PFXE thus far
•
    as the expected equilibrium exchange rate (based on the available
    information) ,   the actual value of PFX will differ from PFXE by an
    amount that depends on the magnitude of the interest rate differential
    and the length of time the differential is expected to persist.ll
                                     10



Empirically it is very difficult to get a proxy for this latter
consideration, and I therefore follow the usual practice and simply use
the three—month interest rate differential. Note that one expects a
coefficient of 0.25 times the average number of quarters the
differential is expected to last as the appropriate coefficient on this

variable.



3.   EMPIRICAL RESULTS

     The exchange rate equation discussed above can thus be written:
     PFX = 80 + 31 *     PPP(1)
            +   B2*BORR(_1) + B3*TOT(_l) +    B4*CYC(l)
            + B5*RESID(_l) + B6*ULS(_1) + 87*(FxO_UBAL/PFX)
            +   B8*(R90_R9OUS) + 39*PFX(_l)


where PFX       is the spot rate

      PPP       is the purchasing power parity variable
      BORR is the long—term borrowing variable
      TOT       is the terms of trade variable
      CYC       is the cyclical variable
      RESID is the residual from the current account equation

      R90—R9OUS is the 90—day interest rate differential (Canadian
                finance paper minus U.S. commercial paper)



In the preferred equation we define the explanatory variables as
follows:
                                           11




      PPP = PGNE/PGNEUS
                        (scaled to equal unity in 1971Q1) where PGNE
               and PGNEUS and the GNP deflators.
      BORR =     NLTCF/yGNE where NLTCF equals the net long—term
                                                                 capital
                 flows into Canada and YGNE is nominal GNP.
      TOT =    PX/PM (ratio of export to import prices)
      CYC =    RU—RUtJS    (Canadian minus U.S. unemployment rates)


We also tried other measures of prices as well as wage rates for PPP,

the relative price of resources to manufactures for TOT, output gaps
for CYC, and a number of other borrowing measures for BORR. Also, for

reasons given in footnote 9, we introduced a measure of potential
output into the equation.

     The current account equation used to generate RESID is as
follows: 12


                       7
     XBAL$ =    CO +   E
                           Cli*(ppp/pFx)..,i
                       0
                + C2*TOT + C3*CYC



Here XBAL$ is determined by an eight quarter second—order Almon
polynomial distributed lag on the competitiveness term and is also a
function of current terms of trade and a cyclical variable. The latter
are all defined in the same way as for the exchange rate equation.

TOT is sometimes defined in terms of the ratio of the price of

merchandise exports to that of merchandise imports and sometimes in
terms of the prices of goods and services exports and imports. In some

equations XBALJ$ is scaled by YGNE. A variety of external balances were
                                    12



tried as the dependent variable.

     The incorporation of the lagged dependent variable in the PFX
equation appears at first glance to be inconsistent with the rational

expectations approach taken thus far. This need not be the case,
however. As I have argued elsewhere,13 it is often difficult for
the market to determine what it is that changes in variables are

signalling. For example, increases in interest rates might reflect a
temporary change in the level of the money supply, a permanent change
in the level of the money supply, or a permanent change in the rate of
growth of the money supply. Each of these would have a different

effect on the time path of PFXE. Initially the market might not be
sure which type of shock has occurred. As time passes, however, the
market receives more information or is able to interpret the

information received with greater assurance. Hence there may be
delayed responses to changes as the nature of the change becomes more
apparent to the market. A similar story could be told, for example,
about terms of trade increases. At the time of the increase, it may
not be possible to be certain whether it is temporary or permanent. If
the increase does not reverse over time, the likelihood increases that

it is a permanent change and hence the market will have a delayed
response to the initial change.14

     A less rational interpretation of the lagged dependent variable

would focus on the elasticity of expectations of PFXE with respect to

PFX. There might be an adaptive response of PFXE to PFX if beliefs
about the future spot rate are not held with any strong conviction and

are therefore easily revisedin the light of spot rate
                                  13



developments. 15

     I begin with the results of the XBAL$ equation and go on to the

PFX equation. In the next section I compare the coefficients across
the two equations.

     In Table 1 I present the results of a variety of XBAL$ equations.

The number shown under COMP is the sum of the coefficients of the

distributed lag on COMP. The b-statistics are shown in parentheses and
that on COMP is the t—statistjc of the sum   of   the coefficients. Since
XBAL$ is measured at annual rates, coefficients are interpreted       as the
effect of a change in the exogenous variable on the current account
balance at annual rates. Consider equation (1)     .   Here COMP is based on
the GNP deflator, TOT on the ratio of goods and services export price

deflator to import price deflator, and CYC on the difference in
unemployment rates. A 10% increase in the exchange rate (holding PGNE
constant) will result in an improvement in the current account balance
after 8 quarters of $3870 billion at annual rates (—42571(1/1.1 —      1)).
To the extent that the change in the exchange rate results in an

increase in PGNE the improvement in the current account will be
lessened. There is no J—curve response in this equation although there
are perverse movements in the first quarter in some of the other
equations. An improvement of 10% in the terms of trade results in an
increase in the current account surplus of $1483 million at annual
rates. An attempt to introduce a lagged response to changes in the

terms of trade change was unsuccessful, suggesting that the main effect
of the terms of trade change was via price rather than via slow volume

response.'6 The cyclical variable indicates that an increase of
                                  14



one percentage point in the Canadian unemployment rate or a reduction
of one percentage in the U.S. unemployment rate leads to an improvement
of about $746 million in the current account at annual rates. A one

percentage point increase in the unemployment rate is consistent with
about a 2 percent decline in output (Okun's law) or about $2825 million

at the midpoint of the sample period. This implies a marginal response
of net imports to GNP of 746/2825 or 26.4%, or slightly higher than the

25.4% average trade share in 1973Q4. The results thus provide a

plausible representation of the factors driving the current account
deficit. Note that with competitiveness and the terms of trade equal
to unity and the relative cyclical position equal to zero the current

account deficit would equal $940 million at annual rates, according to
the equation.

     In equation (2) the CPI's in Canada and the United States were
used in COMP and in equation (3) relative wages were inserted.17

Neither variable performed nearly as well as the GNP deflator, so that
the latter was used in all the rest of the equations. In equation (4)
the terms of trade defined in terms of the prices of merchandise

exports and imports (i.e. excluding services and transfers) was used
instead of the broader terms of trade notions, and in equation (5) the
ratio of the price of raw materials to the price of world manufactures
was used. The former performed somewhat better than the broader
terms of trade and the latter somewhat worse but the differences are

not great.

     In equation (6) the cyclical variable is defined as the difference
between the Canadian output gap (real GNE divided by its potential) and
                                     15



U.S. output gap. Potential in each case is measured by a constant rate
of growth of output as predicted by a logarithmic regression of real

output on time over the period 1953 to 1973. This equation gives the
best results of all those that were tried but we used equation (4) to

define RESID in the PFX equation because of our concern that the
results in (6) are sensitive to the rather arbitrary measurement of

potential. To capture the notion that rates of potential growth might
affect the current account we added the ratio of Canadian to U.S.

potential output to equation (6).     In the resulting equation (which is
not shown in the table) ,   the ratio of potential outputs had a
t—statistic of only 0.8 and had a positive sign indicating a rather
weak positive connection between the rate of potential growth in Canada
and the Canadian current account surplus.

     Equations (7), (8), and (9) present equations for XBAL$ over the
period 1971—77 and for XBAL$/GNP over the periods 1971—77 and 1960—77.

Comparing equation (8) with equation (7) we find that the former has a
smaller coefficient on competitiveness, a larger J—curve effect, a
smaller terms—of—trade effect, and about the same size cyclical effect.

Extending the sample period (equation (9)), one gets smaller
competitiveness, a larger J—curve effect and much worse summary
statistics. Equations run over only the earlier part of the period
(19601—19701v) tend to have the wrong sign on the terms of trade term.
In experiments with different length of lag structure, the

eight—quarter lag performs best for both XBAL$ and XBAL$/GNP equations
for the 1971—1977 period.

    Similar equations work quite well for the balanc.e on trade and
                                  16



services (i.e. excluding transfers). However, when the merchandise
trade balance alone is used as the dependent variable there is a sharp
deterioration in the equation and the competitiveness variable becomes

much smaller and much less significant. Further research will be
required to explain this rather surprising result.

     In Table 2 I present the results of the PFX equations. Since, in
the Haas—Alexander PFX equation the coefficient on ULS(—l) and that on
FXO—UBAL/PFX were almost identical, and since the coefficients were not
significantly different in our equation we went immediately to a

specification with current ULS. Equation (1) presents the results of
the regression using PGNE in the PPP variable, a moving average of

total net new issues by provinces, municipalities and corporations
scaled by GNE in BORR, the broader definition of the terms of trade in

TOT, and the unemployment rate differential in CYC. Since the ULS term

is wrong—signed in equation (1) we dropped it in equation (2) with
little effect on the other coefficients. The equilibrium effects from
equation (2) are presented in (2E) and I now turn to a discussion of

this equation as an example of the type of results obtained from these

equations.
     In equilibrium the effect of a 1% change in PPP is a 1.53% change
in the exchange rate. This result is above the theoretically desirable
response of unity. The distributed lag is such that 78% of the
adjustment is completed in one year after the perception of the

relative price change. The equilibrium multiplier on the BORR term is
1.77. This means that a perceived permanent increase in the net total

new issues of provinces, municipalities, and corporations (a proxy for
                                  17



their financial requirements) on the order of 1% of GNP will lead to an
appreciation of 1.77 cents in the Canadian dollar. That is, in 1974

values, if these borrowers needed another $1.5 billion in funds, the

market would respond by assuming tht some fraction of this would be
raised in foreign—pay issues; the resulting appreciation of 1.77 cents
is required to achieve the offsetting increase in the current account
deficit.

     The equilibrium coefficient on the terms of trade variable is
1.23. Thus a 1% change in the terms of trade will result in a 1.23
cent appreciation of the Canadian dollar. The equilibrium multiplier
on the cyclical variable is 0.037. A one percentage point increase in
the unemployment rate in Canada or a one percentage point decrease in

the U.S. unemployment rate would lead to a 3.7 cent appreciation of the
Canadian dollar in the long run. As mentioned above, there are two

interpretations for this variable. The first relates to the effect of
the cycle on the current account balance and the market's assumption

that the cyclical movement is permanent or its inability to see into
the future to a period when the cyclical position will be reversed.

The second (and our preferred) interpretation relates to the cyclical
position as an indicator of future relative price inflation in the two
countries.'8 Thus an increase in Canadian slack leads the market

to expect an improvement in the Canadian inflation performance in the
future.

     The equilibrium effect of a change in the residual is —2.08 E—5.
Thus a residual of $100 million at annual rates in the current account,
i.e. an outcome that is $100 million better than predicted, will lead
                                   18



to an immediate appreciation of 0.065 cents in the Canadian dollar. If
the current account residual then returns to zero, this effect will
wear off gradually. However, a continuing residual of $100 million (as
•a result of a structural change, for example) will result in an
appreciation of 0.21 cent in the Canadian dollar. A one percentage
point increase in the short term interest rate in Canada results in an
0.81 cent appreciation of the Canadian dollar on impact and a 2.6 cent

appreciation in equilibrium if the differential is held indefinitely.
The large response probably signifies that a change in interest rate is

interpreted as reflecting a long—run change in monetary policy.
     Equations (3) and (3E) show that the Hildreth—Lu transformation
for first—order autocorrelation has little effect on the coefficients

and equilibrium multipliers. In equation (4) the lagged dependent
variable is dropped. As expected the coefficients change a great deal
and the SEE rises substantially.

     A variety of other measures of long—term borrowing were tried out

but none changed the equation to any great extent. Among the variables

used were: (1) actual long—term capital flows, (2) long—term capital
flows scaled by GNE, (3) net direct investment and the rest of

long—term flows, entered separately and scaled by GNP. Equation (5)
and (5E) present the results with actual long—term capital flows scaled

by GNE as the borrowing variable and the narrower definition of the
terms of trade as TOT. The price variable moves much closer to unity
and the coefficients on the other variables fall somewhat.-9

     To evaluate the ability of equation (5) to track the movements of
PFX over the sample period, we simulated the equation dynamically
                                       19



    beginning in 1971Q1. The results are presented in Figure 3. The RMSE
    of the dynamic simulation is .00372 compared to .00440 for the RMSE of

    the residuals of the regression equation, also uncorrected for degrees
    of freedom. That is, the RMSE from the dynamic simulation is 85% that
    of the one—step—ahead forecast.

         When the relative gap was used instead of the unemployment rate

    differential, the results deteriorated. The ratio of Canadian to U.S.

*
    potential   output did not enter significantly. The CPI performed less
    well than the GNE deflator for which it was substituted. Nor did the

    ratio of Ml's perform well. However, the ratio of M2's did enter
    significantly as shown in equations (6) and (6E) where PPP is
    represented by the ratio of the Canadian M2 to the American M2. Note

    that the cyclical variable becomes insignificant in this equation and

    the equilibrium response to the relative money supplies is

    substantially less than unity.20


    4.   COMPARISON OF THE TWO EQUATIONS
         One can draw some (admittedly speculative) conclusions by

    comparing the equilibrium multipliers in the equations for XBAL$ and
    PFX. Our interpretation of the PFX eqution rests on the view that a
    permanent change in long—term borrowing or in the terms of trade is
    translated by the market into an exchange rate movement that will
    result in the basic balance returning to equilibrium. Thus an increase

    of $1 billion in long—term borrowing abroad will result in an exchange
    rate appreciation that will eventually lead to a deterioration in the
    current account of $1 billion. Similarly an exogenous terms of trade
                                    20



 improvement will result in an appreciation that will bring the current

account back to balance. We have two measures of the size of

appreciation needed to offset a given borrowing or terms of trade
change —   the actual changes needed as determined in the XBAL$ equation
 (4) and the market's perception as shown for example, in the PFX
equation (5) 21

     According to the XBAL$ equation, an improvement of 1% in the terms
of trade will result in an offsetting appreciation of 0.28 % to bring
the current account back to balance. In the PFX equation a 1%

improvement in the terms of trade leads to a 0.65 cent appreciation of
the Canadian dollar. It is not surprising that the market
overestimated the importance of terms of trade changes. A priori one
would have expected that the increase in raw materials price would
result in an increase in the current account surplus both through the

increase in the price of existing exports and through the increase in

the volumes of raw materials exported. The latter effect turned out,
in fact, to be much less significant than anticipated and hence the

actual effect of the terms of trade was less than anticipated.

     The direct effect on the current account of a 1% increasein

unemployment, if maintained permanently, could be offset by a 1.73%
appreciation (XBAL$ equation) .   In equilibrium such a change in
unemployment leads to a 3.2 cent appreciation according to the PFX
equation. This result is consistent with our earlier argument tht it
is not just the direct effect of the unemployment rate that is the

cause of the appreciation but the indirect effect via future reductions
in inflation rates also play a role in affecting the market's
                                   21



expectations.

     A permanent increase of $1000 million in long—term capital inflows

can be offset by an appreciation of about 2.5% according to the XBAL$
equation, leaving the basic balance unchanged in the long run. In the
PFX equation an increase of $1000 million (at annual rates) in net

long—term capital inflows (using the average sample period value of the

GP to scale the borrowing) leads to an appreciation of 0.57 cents.
This rather substantial difference can be explained in either of two

ways. First, the market recognizes that current borrowing implies
interest payments in the future and hence does not respond as

positively as might be anticipated. Second, the noise—to—signal ratio
in the borrowing series is very high and therefore less attention is
paid to it than otherwise might be expected.   Finally, an increase of
$100 million in the current account balance that cannot be explained by

the variables in the XBAL$ equation can be offset by an appreciation of
0.25% according to the XBAL$ equation. The perceived appreciation
needed is 0.14 cent according to the PFX equation.


5.   THE EXCHANGE RATE REVISITED

     In the light of the above analysis we return to the questions

posed in Section 1 of this paper, in particular how to explain the fact
that the Canadian dollar did not depreciate over the period 1972 to
1976 when a substantial increase of Canadian prices relative to U.S.

prices had occurred during that time. As is apparent from the
theoretical and empirical discussion, it is our contention that factors

such as long—term borrowing, terms of trade movements, and interest
                                     22



rate movements have moved in such a way as to offset the PPP movements
for the period until 1976. It is clear from Figure 2 that the PPP
variable by itself would have resulted in a gradual depreciation from

1972 through 1976 with a temporary appreciation in the second half of
1974. The movement of the terms of trade variable would cause a

tendency to a sharp appreciation from 1972 through the middle of 1974

followed by a tendency mainly towards depreciation. The borrowing
variable begins to have a major effect starting in 1975 when the

provinces, municipalities and corporations increased their total

financial requirements and long—term capital inflows rose sharply. The
relative interest rate movement implied a depreciation from 1972
through the middle of 1973 followed by a strong appreciation especially
in 1975 and most of 1976 followed by a depreciation toward the end of
1976.

        Using the regression equation, one can decompose the movements of
PFX since 1971Q2 into elements attributable to each of the explanatory

variables. Because of the presence of the lagged dependent variable,
the techniques underlying the decomposition are somewhat complex and
are relegated to an appendix. In Figures 4a to 4f, I show the separate
effect on PFX of the movement of each of the explanatory variables
since 1971 Q2. Because of the importance of the initial conditions in
understanding the meaning of Figure 4, it is worth pointing out that

two of the explanatory variables, RESID(—l) and R90—R9OUS took on very
unusual values in 1971 II, namely $947 million and —1.38 percentage

points. Thus, for example, the contribution of any given interest rate
differential is relative to the initial value of —1.38.
                                  23



    Turning to the results in Figures 4a—4f, one can see that PPP
alone would have resulted in a depreciation of over 13 cents by 1976Q3
The increase in borrowing requirements implied an appreciation of
almost 2 cents by the end of the period, and the terms of trade

variable an appreciation of over 7 cents. The effect of the relative

cyclical position changed from a tendency to mild appreciation in 1973
to a tendency to a substantial depreciation in 1975—76. The interest
rate differential was worth about a 12 cent appreciation by the end of
the period when compared to the very low value it took in l971Q2. The

residual implied about a 2 cent depreciation compared to the very large
value it took at the beginning of the period. Finally, the effect of

the initial position of PFX and the initial residual (see appendix for

an explanation) was only 0.6 cents. Together these factors add to the
3.5 cent appreciation between 1971Q2 and l976Q3.

9.   If, as Dornbusch has suggested to me, there are reasons for
     expecting a depreciation over time in the equilibrium exchange
     rate because Canadian growth might be import—biased, one would
     want to include a term for potential output as well as a term for
     the relative cyclical position in both the PFX equation and
     the current account equations.

11. The following argument assuiies that, on average, the differen-
     tial is zero. To the extent that the average differential is
     a non—zero constant, the argument can be recast in terms of
     the difference between the actual differential and the long—run

     average differential.

14. Ideally, we would like to incorporate different lagged res-
     ponses to different explanatory variables since, presumably,
     the noise—to—signal ratio of changes differs among different
     variables. Degrees of freedom considerations prevent us from
     doing this.

17. Clearly unit labour costs are more appropriate than wage rates,
     but the latter were more easily accessible.
18. An alternative measure of the difference in expected price
     inflation in the two countries is the differential in long—term
     interest rates. When this variable is added to the equation it
     has the correct sign (positive) but is insignificant (t of 0.6)
     and its introduction leaves the other coefficients virtually
     unchanged. Similarly, when the differential in medium—term
     (five—year) interest rates is added to the equation it is
     completely insignificant (t of 0.3) and results in very little
     change to the rest of t-he equation. Compare the results in

     Based on Real Interest Differentials", Seminar Discussion Paper

19. A variety of other changes were made to equation (5) of Table 2
     to see how robust the results were to changes in estimation
     techniques. Applying the Hildreth—Lu technique results in only
     small changes to the coefficients. Given the problem of
     having a lagged dependent variable in an equation with residual
    autocorrelation, I used the instrumental variables
                                                        technique
    with the instrument applied to the lagged dependent variable.
    This resulted in somewhat smaller equilibrium multipliers,
    especially on PPP, and the wrong sign for the coefficient of
    RESID. First differencing the entire equation also leads
    to a reduction in the size of the equilibrium multipliers
    although all the signs remain unchanged.

20. The standard monetarist equation in which the logarithm of the
     exchange rate is regressed on the logarithm of the ratio of
     money supplies, the logarithm of the ratio of real incomes,
     the interest rate differential, and the lagged dependent
     variable always gives a significant negative sign on the
     interest rate differential, contrary to the theoretical
     model posited by the monetarists. Neither income nor money
     is significant in any of the equations.

21. Note the inconsistency between the argument that the market's
     views can differ from the actual multipliers and the incor-
     poration of residuals from the XBAL$ equation into the PFX
     equation which implies that the market knows the actual
     multipliers.

                        THE CALCULATION OF CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE
                            CHANGE IN THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE


          Assume an    estimated      equation of the form:


    (1)   Y(t) = a +    b*X(t)    +   c*Z(t)   +    d*Y(t_1)   +   u(t)

*
    In a dynamic simulation starting from t equals 1 we replace the
    right—hand—side lagged dependent variable by its simulated value after
    the first period.



    (2)   Y(t) = a +   b*X(t)     +   c*Z(t)   +    d*Y(t_1)              t >   1




    For the first period, one uses actual Y(O) on the right hand side. Now
    we wish to explain Y(t) — Y(O) by. movements of the explanatory

    variables.

          From (1) we have


    (3)   Y(O) = a + b*X(O) + c*Z(O) +              d*Y(_1) + u(O)


    Subtracting (3) from (2) we have
    (4)   Y(t) - Y(O) =     b*[X(t)_x(O)J       + c*[Z(t)_z(O)]
                            +   d*y(t_1)   —   d*Y(_l) — u(O)
                        =   b*[X(t)_x(O)]       *
                                               c*[Z(t)_z(O)]
                            +   d*[Y(t_1)_y(o)J + d*{Y(O)_Y(_l)]                -   u(O)
                                                 28



Recursively substituting we get


                             t—l
(5)   Y(t) — Y(O) =    b*[    E d1(X(t—i) —           X(O))]
                              0

                                  t—l
                       +   c*[          d1(Z(t-i) -      Z(0))]
                                   0

                             t—l.
                       +      d1[d*(Y(0)          -   Y(—l))      -   u(0)]
                              0




The first term on the right hand side is the contribution of the
movement in X to the movement of Y; the second term is the contribution
of the movement of Z. The third term can be interpreted as the
divergence of Y from its equilibrium in period 0. To the extent that
earlier movements in x or z had not completed their effect on Y by time

O and to the extent there Was an estimation residual in period 0 these
ha to be taken into accunt in explaining differences from Y(O)
      To compute the actual contributions we define variables CONTX,

CONTZ, and CONTINITIAL defined as follows:



CONTX(t) =   b*(X(t)   —   X(O))        +   d*CONTX(t_l)
CONTZ(t) =   c*(Z(t)   —   Z(O)) + d*CONTZ(t_l)
CONTINITIAL(t) =   d*(Y(0)         —    Y(—l))   —    u(O)   +   d*CONTINITIAL(t_l)


The values of CONTX, CONTZ, and CONTINITIAL are set equal to zero in

period 0 and simulations begin in period 1. By construction the sum of
these contributions will equal Y(t) — Y(O)                       in all periods.
