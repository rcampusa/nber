                                          ABSTRACT

This paper examines how the price of home heating affects mortality in the US. Exposure to cold
is one reason that mortality peaks in winter, and a higher heating price increases exposure to cold
by reducing heating use. It also raises energy bills, which could affect health by decreasing other
health-promoting spending. Our empirical approach combines spatial variation in the energy
source used for home heating and temporal variation in the national prices of natural gas versus
electricity. We find that a lower heating price reduces winter mortality, driven mostly by
cardiovascular and respiratory causes.

1        Introduction
        In the US, 17% of households spend more than 10% of their income on home energy.
Heating is the largest component of annual home energy consumption, despite being used
for only part of the year (RECS 2009).
        High heating costs impose a difficult trade-off on households: They have to keep their
home uncomfortably cold to save on heating or forgo other spending to afford their high
heating bill. How acute this dilemma is depends on how expensive home heating is. Through
both a substitution and an income channel, a higher price of heating could be harmful to
health. First, using less heating means exposure to lower ambient temperature, which has
been linked to cardiovascular, respiratory, and other health problems.1 Second, if families
do not cut back usage one-for-one when the price rises, their energy bills will increase. This
can lead to cutbacks in other expenditures that affect health, such as food and health care.
        This paper estimates the causal effect of heating prices on mortality in the US. A large
literature has documented that mortality peaks in winter and that cold weather is associated
with higher mortality. Our contribution is to examine whether high home heating costs
exacerbate this pattern of “excess winter mortality.”
        Our empirical design uses spatial variation across the US in the energy source used for
home heating. Natural gas and electricity are used for heating by 58% and 30% of house-
holds, respectively. Importantly, there is considerable geographic variation across counties
in whether an area relies on natural gas versus electricity. We combine this spatial variation
with temporal variation in the national prices of natural gas and electricity. The ratio of
the natural gas to electricity price varied substantially over the 2000 to 2010 study period,
most notably due to the boom in shale production of natural gas. We leverage the fact that
households in areas that rely more on natural gas for heating experienced a decline in their
home heating price as a result of the shale gas boom, relative to households in areas reliant
on electricity.
        We find that lower heating prices reduce mortality in winter months.2 The estimated
    1
     The main hypothesized mechanisms are changes in blood pressure and blood chemistry which increase
the risk of strokes, myocardial infarctions, and pulmonary embolisms, and higher infection risk due to a
suppressed immune system (Crawford et al. 2003; Liddell and Morris 2010).
   2
     We define “winter” in this paper as November to March, the coldest months of the year. Analyses of
excess winter mortality use December to March in the UK and Europe, where those are the coldest months
(Wilkinson et al. 2004). We include November because the average temperature is as low as in March in the
US (see Appendix Figure A1).We also show the results using December to March.


                                                   1
effect size implies that the drop in natural gas prices in the late 2000s, induced largely by the
boom in shale gas production, averted 11,000 winter deaths per year in the US. We also find
that the effect does not just represent short-run hastening of mortality. We show that the
effect, which is driven mostly by cardiovascular and respiratory causes, is robust to several
checks on the specification.
    Our paper contributes to the literature on the effects of cold weather on mortality
(Eurowinter Group 1997; Analitis et al. 2008; Deschenes and Moretti 2009), morbidity (Ye
et al. 2012), and nutrition (Bhattacharya et al. 2003; Cullen et al. 2004; Beatty et al. 2014).
To our knowledge, ours is the first study to estimate the causal effect of heating prices
— a plausibly important and policy-relevant mediating factor — on mortality or, more
generally, on health. Previous work has found that the winter spike in mortality is stronger
for people living in older housing, which tends to be poorly insulated, which is suggestive
but not dispositive that indoor temperature is a mediating factor (Wilkinson et al. 2007).
The studies closest to ours examine how home weatherization affects health; some studies
report reductions in morbidity, and others find null results (Critchley et al. 2007; El Ansari
and El-Silimy 2008; Green and Gilbertson 2008; Howden-Chapman et al. 2007). Most of
these studies analyze small samples and thus lack statistical power to examine mortality or
other objective health outcomes. Another related literature documents a positive association
between heating subsidies for low-income families and health, usually without isolating a
causal relationship (Frank et al. 2006; Grey et al. 2017). An exception is Crossley and Zilio
(2018) who use a UK program’s age-eligibility rule to study the effects of unconditional cash
transfers for the elderly labeled as “winter fuel payments”; the payments reduce one of the
two biomarkers for infection examined.
    Our paper also contributes to the literature on the consequences of shale gas production,
specifically on its health effects due to lower energy prices. Previous work in economics has
studied local economic effects of shale gas production on job creation and wages (Feyrer
et al. 2017; Jacobsen 2019), fertility (Kearney and Wilson 2018), and crime (DeLeire et al.
2014; Bartik et al. forthcoming). Shale gas also affects health through channels besides
energy prices. It often displaces coal in electricity generation, lowering pollution emissions
(Cullen and Mansur 2017; Fell and Kaffine 2018; Holladay and LaRiviere 2017; Knittel
et al. 2015; Linn and Muehlenbachs 2018). There are also potentially large local health
costs due to chemical contamination of the water supply (Jackson et al. 2014; Groundwater


                                               2
Protection Council 2009; Muehlenbachs et al. 2015). Several recent papers find a link between
fracking and poor birth outcomes (Casey et al. 2016; Currie et al. 2017; Hill 2018). The
health harm from the toxic chemicals used is likely much larger per person affected than the
health benefits from lower energy prices; however, lower energy prices affect a much larger
population. Thus, the net health effect of fracking aggregated for the whole US population
is ambiguous. Finally, our empirical strategy is similar to that of Myers (forthcoming) who
compares households that use heating oil or natural gas in Massachusetts to study whether
home energy costs are capitalized into home values.


2      Empirical strategy
      We estimate the effect of heating prices on mortality. As a proxy for the heating price
that an individual faces, we combine information on whether her locality uses natural gas
for heating and the national prices of natural gas and electricity. This approach enables us
to control for average differences across localities and time.

2.1     Estimating equations
      We estimate the following equation via ordinary least squares regression to quantify the
impacts of the price of heating on mortality:

 log(mjt ) = α+βShareGasj ×log(RelP ricet )+γj +τt +θZj ×log(RelP ricet )+δXjt +jt (1)


Each observation is a county-month. The outcome log(mjt ) is the log of age-adjusted mor-
tality in county j in month t. The key regressor is the interaction of ShareGasj — the
proportion of households in the area that used natural gas for heating in the base year of
2000 — and log(RelP ricet ). RelP rice is the ratio of the national price of gas to electricity.
When natural gas prices are higher (high RelP rice), areas with high ShareGas face rela-
tively higher heating prices. The hypothesis is that β > 0: A higher heating price increases
mortality. County fixed effects, γ, and month-year fixed effects, τ, absorb the main effects
of ShareGas and log(RelP rice). Throughout, we cluster standard errors by state to allow
for serial correlation, as well as spatial correlation among counties in a state.
      We include several control variables in our main specification. Because the study pe-
riod spans the housing market boom and collapse and the Great Recession, we control for
a housing price index, the unemployment rate, and the manufacturing share of local em-


                                                3
ployment income. The vector X also includes air pollutants linked to mortality. We also
control for area characteristics Z, specifically pre-period log median income and the share
of the population over age 70, interacted with log(RelP rice); these control variables help
safeguard against a spurious correlation from the Great Recession (or another phenomenon
with a similar temporal pattern as log(RelP rice)) having a differential impact on mortality
across socioeconomic or demographic groups (Hoynes et al. 2012).
      For the difference-in-differences estimation, we restrict the data to only winter months
(when possible), when energy use is mostly for heating and most of the year’s heating is
consumed. We also estimate a triple difference model that uses the non-winter months as an
additional comparison group, testing the prediction that the price of heating affects mortality
more in winter than in other, warmer months.
      Some winters or particular months in winter are colder than others, so we can also use
temperature to define the third difference. We calculate for each county-month a measure of
coldness, namely heating degree-days (HDD), as described in Section 3. The triple difference
model using HDD is as follows:

log(m)jt = α + λ1 ShareGasj × log(RelP ricet ) × HDDjt + λ2 ShareGasj × log(RelP ricet )
               +λ3 ShareGasj × HDDjt + λ4 log(RelP ricet ) × HDDjt + λ5 HDDjt
               +θ1 Zj × log(RelP ricet ) × HDDjt + θ2 Zj × log(RelP ricet ) + θ3 Zj × HDDjt
               +θ4 ShareGasj × log(RelP ricet ) × HDDj + θ5 log(RelP ricet ) × HDDj
               +θ6 Zj × log(RelP ricet ) × HDDj + γj + τt + δXjt + jt                        (2)


The prediction is λ1 > 0. Note that equation (2) controls for the county’s average HDD in
winter, HDDj , in parallel to HDDjt to adjust for systematic differences (e.g., demographics)
between colder regions such as the Midwest and warmer ones such as the South. The results
are similar if we omit these extra control variables, using average differences across places in
the severity of their winters as additional identifying variation.

2.2     Assessing the income and substitution channels
      An auxiliary outcome we examine is the average price of heating experienced by con-
sumers. We calculate the weighted average of the local prices of natural gas and electricity,
where weights are the local consumption of each energy source. A model analogous to equa-


                                               4
tion (1) but using log average local price as the outcome is like the “first stage” if we were
using instrumental variables estimation. We would expect β = 1 if our regressors were mea-
sured without error and if local and national average prices moved entirely in lockstep. The
coefficient will be less than 1 if there is either measurement error or price variation specific to
a locality, which we would expect due to local demand and regulatory factors plus a supply
side that is not fully integrated across the US.
     We also examine two other “1.5th ” stage outcomes to gauge the importance of the
substitution and income channels. First, we examine the (log) quantity of home energy use,
combining gas and electricity. When the outcome is log energy use, the coefficient β from
equation (1) can be interpreted as a price elasticity. We expect it to be negative: Consumers
substitute away from heating when it becomes more expensive. The data on home energy
use do not disaggregate it by purpose (e.g., heating, lighting). Thus, while the variation
in the price of natural gas is mainly measuring variation in a household’s heating price,
the outcome combines heating plus other energy uses, so the coefficient represents a lower
bound magnitude for the price elasticity of heating demand. Natural gas’s home use is
mostly for heating (space heating and water heating), with an additional small contribution
from kitchen ranges and clothes dryers. Non-heating home energy needs such as lighting,
refrigeration, and air conditioning predominantly use electricity throughout the US. Home
heating is also the largest home energy use, accounting for 42% of annual home energy
consumption, with water heating accounting for an additional 18% (RECS 2009). Other
major categories are lighting and appliances (30%), refrigeration (5%), and air conditioning
(6%).
     Second, we examine how higher heating prices affect expenditures on home energy use,
again with the caveat that we cannot distinguish spending on heating from other energy
uses (although in winter months, heating accounts for the vast majority of energy use). If
households are not cutting back one-for-one when the price rises, then we expect higher
energy prices to lead to higher energy bills. Of course, we cannot decompose how much of
the mortality effects are due to changes in the quantity of home heating versus changes in
expenditures on heating since a price change generates both effects as a bundle.




                                                5
2.3     Geographic variation in heating source
      Natural gas and electricity are the two most common energy sources used for home
heating, used respectively by 58% and 30% of households nationwide in 2000. Importantly
for our purposes, there is considerable geographic variation in energy source; in some com-
munities, almost every household uses natural gas for heating, and in other communities,
almost no one does. Figure 1 shows the share of households using natural gas as their heating
source across counties, based on 2000 US Census data.
      Whether a locality uses natural gas, electricity, or another heating source is, of course,
not random, and various factors explain the differences. Natural gas pipelines do not extend
to some parts of the US, such as Maine. Areas that are well-suited for hydroelectric power
generation have low electricity costs and thus rely more on electricity. For historical reasons,
much of the Northeast uses heating oil, a petroleum product, instead of gas or electricity.
Importantly, the geographic differences were determined long before the study period and
are highly persistent. (The correlation between a county’s share using natural gas in 2000
and 2010 is 0.99). Being predetermined does not rule out that an area’s heating source is
correlated with other factors affecting mortality, so the analysis controls for other locality
characteristics in parallel to heating source.

2.4     Temporal variation in energy prices
      Figure 2 plots the national prices of natural gas and electricity over the 2000 to 2010
study period. The data source is the US Energy Information Administration. (In this figure
and throughout the paper, monetary amounts are in 2016 USD.) Natural gas is one of the
fuel sources used in electricity generation, so the two prices co-move, but far from in lockstep.
Electricity prices changed somewhat over the time period, while natural gas prices rose and
then fell much more dramatically. As a result, the relative price of natural gas to electricity
rose and then fell over the period.
      Natural gas prices rose from 2004 to 2005 due in part to supply disruptions from major
hurricanes along the Gulf coast (Hurricane Ivan in 2004 and Hurricanes Katrina and Rita
in 2005) (Brown and Yücel 2008). In addition, increased efficiency of producing electricity
from natural gas boosted demand for natural gas during the early 2000s (Hartley et al. 2008).
The major reason for the drop in the price of natural gas in the mid-2000s was the sharp




                                                 6
increase in shale production of natural gas, which is also plotted in Figure 2.3

2.5       Home heating versus other heating
        While we sometimes refer to our results as due to home heating, the analysis cannot
isolate home heating from other indoor (e.g., workplace) heating. Some policy implications,
such as whether to promote increased energy supply, are similar whether the channel is home
heating or other indoor heating. For other policies, such as subsidies for consumer heating
bills, it would be valuable to isolate heating costs at home, which our research design does
not permit. A related, more minor limitation is that we cannot separate the effect of space
heating versus water heating; the energy source is the same in most households (RECS 2014).
Both types of heating likely affect health through similar mechanisms.


3        Data
        Our analysis focuses on the contiguous US between 2000 and 2010. We exclude Hawaii
and Alaska because our data source for temperature excludes them. The rest of this section
describes our data sources, with further details in the appendix.

3.1       Mortality
        We construct the mortality rate from restricted-use Vital Statistics microdata, specif-
ically records for all deaths in the US, indicating the month and county of residence (and
county of death), and cause of death. The data include the decedent’s age, sex, race, and
education level. We exclude counties with a small population over age 50, specifically those
in the bottom tenth percentile of all counties, as they have few (often zero) deaths per month.
        Following the literature, we age-adjust the mortality rate using population data from
the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results program. Our
main specifications examine the logarithm of the age-adjusted mortality rate, and we also
report the results in levels.
        We focus on causes of mortality that exhibit a high degree of excess winter mortality
(EWM). Overall mortality is higher in winter than the rest of the year, but the pattern is
more pronounced for some causes than others. We zero in on these causes because it is most
    3
     Natural gas markets are not fully integrated globally. Pipeline capacity was a bottleneck to US exports
in the late 2000s. Thus, natural gas prices fell in the US relative to other countries over this period (Hausman
and Kellogg 2015).



                                                       7
plausible that they are exacerbated by exposure to cold and also because doing so increases
statistical power. We use a data-driven approach to determine these causes. We collapse the
data geographically to the entire US and estimate a regression of log age-adjusted mortality
on a dummy for winter, separately for each of the National Center for Health Statistics
(NCHS) 113 Selected Causes of Death. Causes with a large positive winter coefficient have
more excess mortality in winter. We also estimate the model in levels to exclude minor
causes that might have spuriously large coefficients. We select the causes whose W inter
coefficients are in the top quartile in both levels and logs. This procedure identifies 16
causes. We exclude two causes, “deaths from smoke, fire, and flames” because its increase in
winter is not due to a direct physiological effect of cold; and “all other diseases” (the residual
category), because it is difficult to verify the mechanism for this “cause.” The remaining
14 causes fall within four alphabetic (i.e, broad) categories, and generally match the causes
highlighted in the literature as exacerbated by cold (e.g., cardiovascular, respiratory). These
high-EWM causes (hereafter, EWM causes) account for 61% of total mortality (and 63% of
total mortality in winter). Appendix Table A1 lists the causes and their degree of EWM,
and Appendix Figure A2 shows the seasonality for EWM and non-EWM causes.

3.2     Independent variables
      To construct ShareGas, we use 2000 Decennial Census data. The Census longform asks
the energy source for home heating, as does the American Community Survey (ACS), which
has been fielded annually since 2005. We use the 2000 Census Summary Files that report
aggregate data for each county. When our geographic unit is the Public Use Micro Area
(PUMA), we construct each PUMA’s value of ShareGas from public use microdata.
      RelP rice, the ratio of the price of gas to electricity, is constructed using monthly na-
tional price data from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA). We use national
rather than local prices, as national prices are exogenous to a locality, while local prices are
affected by local energy demand.4 For natural gas, we use the citygate price, which is the
price faced by local distribution companies. We use the citygate rather than residential price
because the latter incorporates fixed costs like the monthly fee to maintain a gas connection.
Hence, the citygate price better captures variation in the marginal price faced by consumers.
   4
     We investigated using pre-period local differences in the use of natural gas in electricity generation as an
additional source of variation. The two prices co-move more if gas and electricity markets are interconnected
in this way. However, this approach does not add statistical power.



                                                       8
For electricity, we use the residential price, as there are no citygate data available.
       The correct specification depends on the timing of consumers’ response to RelP rice.
We find that residential energy use responds to RelP rice with a lag of three months. This
is similar to the finding in Auffhammer and Rubin (2018) that natural gas consumption
responds to residential prices with a two-month lag.5 Consumers seem to cut back on usage
only after seeing their energy bill, which typically arrives a few weeks after the billing period
ends. In addition, the health effects of cutbacks in heating use or paying higher bills might
not be instantaneous. Hence, we use the average of the three- and four-month lagged price
to construct RelP rice. We obtain similar results when we use prices lagged one month less
or an annual-level price series. We also estimate models that incorporate mortality effects
in subsequent, post-winter months; the effect in subsequent months could be negative if
deaths are hastened by a short duration (“harvesting”) or positive if the mortality effects
materialize with a longer delay.
       The analysis also uses temperature data. We start with the PRISM dataset of daily av-
erage temperature for gridpoints across the contiguous US spaced 4 kilometers apart (PRISM
Climate Group 2004). We calculate the temperature for each census block and then use pop-
ulation weighting to construct the average for each county or other geographic unit. Our
mortality data are at the month level, so we use the daily temperature data to construct
heating degree-days (HDD) for the month. HDD is a commonly used measure of coldness
— or need for heating — based on the idea that heating demand is linear in temperature
when temperature falls below 65°F. That is, HDDjt = Tx=1 max{65 − tmeanjtx , 0} where
                                                    P

tmean is the mean temperature of area j on day x of month t, and T is the number of days
in month t.
       Controlling for air pollution is potentially important because it is correlated with weather
conditions and affects mortality (Ye et al. 2012). We use data from the Air Quality System
of the US Environmental Protection Agency, aggregating the daily monitoring-station air
quality indices (AQI) to the county-month level. We focus on particulate matter (2.5 micron
and 10 micron, separately) and nitrogen dioxide, as these are the pollutants correlated with
mortality; our results are similar if we control for all of the available AQIs.
       Because a major housing market run-up and collapse occurred during the study period,
   5
    By federal law, utilities must price the natural gas component of their service for cost-recovery only.
Any shock to the citygate price not predicted in advance by the utilities thus influences the residential price
one month later, explaining the additional one-month lag for citygate versus residential prices.


                                                      9
we control for a housing price index, available at the state-quarter level from the Federal
Housing Finance Agency. Similarly, the Great Recession had different impacts across coun-
ties so we control for the unemployment rate (available at the county-month level from the
Bureau of Labor Statistics) and the manufacturing sector share of total employee compen-
sation (available at the state-quarter level from the Bureau of Economic Analysis). We also
control for median household income and the population share age 70 and older, calculated
from the 2000 Census, interacted with log(RelP rice). We show robustness to varying our
set of control variables.

3.3       Other dependent variables
        We examine intermediate outcomes to shed light on why heating prices affect mor-
tality. We use local residential natural gas and electricity prices to compute the average
(consumption-weighted) price of home energy. We also examine residential energy use, con-
structed as the sum of natural gas and electricity use. Price and usage data are aggregate
state-month-level data from EIA.6
        To measure household spending on home energy, we combine 2000 Census microdata
(IPUMS version) and ACS data for 2005 to 2010. This analysis is conducted at the PUMA
rather than county level, as the PUMA is the finest geographic identifier provided. For
computational ease, the analysis collapses the data to the PUMA-year level.


4        Results
        We first present results on the “first stage” and “1.5th stage” outcomes of home energy
prices, quantity of energy consumed, and energy bills. We then present the mortality results.

4.1       Effect of heating price on energy use and spending
        We use ShareGas × log(RelP rice) as an exogenous source of variation in the home
heating price faced by households. We do not have household-level data on energy prices,
but we can use aggregate administrative data on residential energy prices to verify that our
regressor is a good proxy for household prices.
        The price variable is the weighted average price of residential natural gas and electricity
prices. Each observation is a state-month. As shown in Table 1, columns 1 and 2, home en-
    6
    Natural gas prices and quantities are provided on a volumetric basis. To make these data comparable
across the sample, we use EIA data on the heat content of natural gas supplied to residential customers.


                                                  10
ergy prices are strongly positively correlated with ShareGas × log(RelP rice). In column 1,
we include only state and month-year fixed effects. In column 2, we add the housing price in-
dex, unemployment rate, share of income from manufacturing, interactions of log(RelP rice)
with median income and the share of people over age 70, and air pollution indices.
       The coefficient on ShareGas × log(RelP rice) is less than 1 for several reasons. First
and foremost, the outcome is average energy prices, while the regressor is intended to proxy
for average heating prices. In addition, the outcome is average prices weighted by usage, so
it also incorporates any responses of usage to prices.7 Note that to convert our mortality
results into an elasticity of mortality with respect to the heating price, the relevant scale
factor is 1, not the smaller coefficient estimated here; a change in ShareGas × log(RelP rice)
can still be interpreted as a proportional change in the heating price faced by a household.
       We next quantify how households’ energy use responds to higher prices and then the
impact on their energy bills. (In principle, once we know one of these numbers, we could
calculate the other, but showing both is useful given that the data are available at different
geographic levels and based on different samples.) We start by examining the impact on
usage using EIA data, shown in Table 1, columns 3 and 4. As expected, higher prices lead
to less consumption. Both the outcome and key regressor are in logs, so the coefficient
represents an elasticity. The coefficient of -0.14 implies that households cut back usage quite
a bit, but not one-for-one with price. To quantify the elasticity, one needs to scale the
coefficient by the corresponding price-change coefficient from columns 1 and 2. We report
this implied elasticity, which is around -0.35, at the bottom of the table. This elasticity is
a similar magnitude as the winter natural gas demand elasticity for California estimated by
Auffhammer and Rubin (2018). In Appendix Table A2, we show that the estimates based
on our triple difference specification are similar.8
       The elasticity having a magnitude smaller than 1 implies that households are spending
more money on energy expenses when the heating price increases. We verify this using
household-level Census/ACS data. Columns 5 and 6 of Table 1 show that the heating price
shock is associated with a 24 log point increase in energy expenses. If the result is driven
by changes in winter expenses, then the coefficient is an underestimate of the impact during
winter months. (ACS does not release the survey month or distribution of months when
   7
    Also, we construct ShareGas weighting each household equally, whereas EIA’s usage-weighted measure
implicitly weights bigger users more. There might also be some measurement error in ShareGas.
  8
    Appendix Table A3 reports results varying how we construct RelP rice, in particular using different lags.

surveys are completed. The Census asks about annual spending on energy bills.) Column 7
and 8 examine the outcome in levels: a 10% increase in the price of heating is associated with
a $5 increase in the monthly home energy bill, averaged over the year. To help interpret
these magnitudes, note that the relative price of natural gas fell by 42% (54 log points)
between 2005 and 2010. This price decline led to a 12% or $315 annual decrease in energy
bills for natural gas users, using the estimates in columns 6 and 8, respectively.
       To summarize, we find that households reduce usage in response to an increase in their
heating price, but not fully, so they also experience a meaningful increase in energy bills
when the price of heating increases.

4.2      Effect of heating price on mortality
       We examine the effect of heating prices on the log of the age-adjusted mortality rate,
following Stevens et al. (2015).9 We focus on “EWM causes of death,” that is, causes with
a pronounced peak in winter. Focusing on EWM causes provides a more honed test of the
hypothesis that heating prices affect deaths due to exposure to cold and increases statistical
power. We report effects on all-cause mortality in Appendix Table A5.10
       Table 2 shows that a higher heating price increases mortality from EWM causes. Column
1 includes as regressors only county and year-month fixed effects in addition to ShareGas ×
log(RelP rice). Column 2 adds in our full set of control variables, listed earlier. In column
2 (our preferred specification), the elasticity of EWM mortality with respect to price is
0.057. Given that our EWM causes account for 63% of total mortality in winter, the implied
elasticity of total mortality is 0.036, which is similar to the estimated elasticity of 0.030 when
we directly examine all-cause mortality.11
       The next columns show the effects disaggregated by broad category: non-viral non-
respiratory infections; neurological; circulatory; and respiratory. The overall effect on EWM
mortality is mainly driven by circulatory and respiratory causes. Appendix Table A6 reports
results separately for each of the 14 EWM causes. The largest effect size is seen for emphy-
sema, other chronic lower respiratory diseases, acute myocardial infarction, and pneumonia.
   9
     We show robustness to using the age-adjusted mortality rate in levels in Appendix Table A4.
  10
     We pursued also estimating effects on morbidity using the Heath and Retirement Study and on hospi-
talizations using the National Inpatient Sample, but due to the smaller sample sizes, we are underpowered
to detect even elasticities considerably larger than our mortality estimates.
  11
     When we estimate our main specification for non-EWM causes, the coefficient on ShareGas ×
log(RelP rice) is 0.006 and statistically insignificant. As the income channel should affect non-EWM mor-
tality too, this pattern is suggestive of the importance of the substitution channel.


                                                   12
Interestingly, the price of heating does not seem to exacerbate influenza deaths.
       The effects we estimate are not due to deaths being moved earlier by just a short
duration, or “harvesting.” Appendix Table A7 shows that the cumulative mortality effect
is stable in magnitude when we incorporate effects in subsequent months. The cumulative
effect is statistically significant when we add up to three subsequent months; there is not
enough statistical power to determine at what point it becomes zero.
       Appendix Tables A8 and A9 show robustness of the results to varying the definition of
winter; excluding shale-gas-producing states; using residential instead of citygate, or annual
instead of monthly, natural gas prices; population-weighting the regressions; dropping the
Great Recession period; controlling for the state’s per capita spending on the Low Income
Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP)12 ; and varying the main set of control variables.
       We next bring in data for non-winter months to estimate triple difference models. We
use either W inter or HDD as the third difference. Table 2, column 7 shows that the effect
of heating prices on mortality is stronger in winter than the rest of the year. Reassuringly,
the coefficient on ShareGas × log(RelP rice) is close to zero: the price of heating has no
effect on mortality in non-winter months.
       Using HDD, we find that the price of heating increases mortality more in colder months.
HDD is normalized so that a unit change is the difference between every day in the month
being 65°F or above and being 32°F. A one-unit increase in HDDjt , relative to the county’s
average winter HDD, which we control for in parallel to HDDjt , leads to a 0.084 higher
elasticity of mortality with respect to heating price.
       The results are similar but somewhat weaker when we do not control for average HDD
(see Appendix Table A10), which is consistent with previous findings that, due to adap-
tation (e.g., better insulated homes in colder places), atypical cold for an area is what
especially affects mortality (Eurowinter Group 1997). As another reassuring placebo test,
when HDD = 0 in this specification, the heating price does not affect mortality.
       Table 3 returns to the difference-in-differences model to examine heterogeneous effects
  12
    LIHEAP provides assistance with energy bills to low-income households. On average between 2001 and
2010, 4.5% of US households received LIHEAP heating assistance per year, which is 23% of households below
150% of the poverty line. LIHEAP pays eligible households a preset amount each year based on income and
household size, and, depending on the state, also fuel type or the last year’s utility bills. Arizona is, to
our knowledge, the only state that varies the amount based on contemporaneous bills or prices (LIHEAP
Clearinghouse 2010). LIHEAP state-year spending data are from the Department of Health and Human
Services.

by poverty. Heating bills comprise a larger share of expenditures for the poor. For this and
other reasons, we expect heating prices to have larger effects on mortality among the poor.
Columns 1 to 4 each use a different poverty proxy. In column 1, the proxy is whether the
county’s median income is in the bottom half of the distribution across counties. Columns
2 and 3 use the proportion of households in the county that are below 150% of the federal
poverty line, as either a continuous variable or an indicator for the county having a below-
median proportion of households below the income threshold. Column 4 uses the decedent’s
education level, specifically an indicator for no high school degree. Across the board, the
point estimates suggest larger effects among the poor, but the finding is only statistically
significant in column 2 (p < 0.10) and column 3 (p < 0.05), which use the proportion of
households below 150% of the poverty line.
    Another dimension of heterogeneity we examined is sex. Table 3, column 5, reports
that the mortality effects do not significantly differ by sex.


5    Conclusion
    This paper finds that winter mortality is lower when the price of heating is lower. To
put the estimated elasticity of all-cause mortality with respect to the price of heating of 0.03
in context, the price of natural gas relative to electricity fell by 42% between 2005 to 2010.
Our findings imply that this price decline caused a 1.6% decrease in the winter mortality rate
for households using natural gas for heating. Given that 58% of American households use
natural gas for heating, the drop in natural gas prices lowered the US winter mortality rate
by 0.9%, or, equivalently, the annual mortality rate by 0.4%. This represents over 11,000
deaths per year.
    This effect size is large enough that it should not be ignored when assessing the net health
effects of shale production of natural gas. The findings also highlight the health benefits of
other policies to reduce home energy costs, particularly for low-income households.

      Notes: Standard errors clustered by state in brackets. Asterisks denote significance: * p < .10, ** p < .05, *** p < .01. Columns 1 to 4: The sample
     comprises state-year-months in the contiguous U.S. for winter months (November–March) between 2000 and 2010. Outcomes are constructed from
     EIA data. Columns 5 to 8: The sample comprises PUMA-years in the contiguous U.S. included in the 2000 Census and the ACS PUMS data between
     2005 and 2010. Outcomes are constructed from Census/ACS data. Log(RelPrice) is the log of the ratio of the US monthly citygate price of natural
     gas, averaged over the three- and four-month lag, to the US monthly residential price of electricity, also averaged over the three- and four-month lag.
     ShareGas is the proportion of occupied housing units in the state or PUMA in 2000 with natural gas as their main heating source. Average electricity
     and gas price is the state’s consumption-weighted average of the residential prices of electricity and gas, in dollars per million British Thermal Units
     (BTUs). Total energy consumption is the state’s total delivery of natural gas and electricity to residential consumers, in trillion BTUs. Total monthly
     energy bill is the mean monthly bill from electricity, gas and other fuels in the PUMA. Basic fixed effects are state and year-month fixed effects for
     columns 1 to 4, and PUMA and year fixed effects for columns 5 to 8. All other controls are the interactions of log(RelPrice) with the log of the median
     state or PUMA household income in 1999 and the share of people aged 70 and above in 2000, the state housing price index, the unemployment rate,
     the state’s manufacturing sector share of total employee compensation, and the AQIs for PM2.5 , PM10 , and NO2 . Implied elasticity is the ratio of the
     coefficient reported in that column to the corresponding coefficient from the first two columns (the “first stage”). Monetary variables are in constant
     2016 US dollars.

      Notes: Standard errors clustered by state in brackets. Asterisks denote significance: * p < .10, ** p < .05, *** p < .01. The sample comprises
     county-year-months in the contiguous U.S. between 2000 and 2010. In columns 1 to 6, the sample is restricted to winter months (November–March).
     Mortality rates are age-adjusted mortality rates expressed as annual deaths per 100,000 population; see data appendix for further details. ShareGas
     is the proportion of occupied housing units in the county in 2000 with natural gas as their main heating source. Log(RelPrice) is the log of the
     ratio of the monthly citygate price of natural gas in the US, averaged over the three- and four-month lag, to the corresponding residential price of
     electricity. Winter is a binary variable that equals one in winter months (November to March). HDD is the number of heating degree-days in the
     county for the month, based on a threshold of 65°F, in units of °F-days divided by 1000, and scaled to a 30-day month. Basic fixed effects are county
     and year-month fixed effects. Columns 1 to 6: All other controls are the interactions of log(RelPrice) with the log of the median county household
     income in 1999 and the share of people aged 70 and above in 2000, the state housing price index, the unemployment rate, the state’s manufacturing
     sector share of total employee compensation, and the AQIs for PM2.5 , PM10 , and NO2 . Column 7 and 8: All other controls is the above set plus
     the following: all possible two-way interactions between ShareGas, log(RelPrice), and the triple difference variable (either Winter or HDD), unless
     collinear with year-month fixed effects; and the two- and three-way interactions among log(RelPrice), Winter /HDD, and each of the log of the median
     county household income in 1999 and the share of people aged 70 and above in 2000. Column 8 also includes HDD; the interaction of the average
     county HDD in winter months with log(RelPrice); and the three-way interactions of the average county HDD in winter months, log(RelPrice), and
     each of ShareGas, the log of the median county household income in 1999, and the share of people aged 70 and above in 2000.

 Notes: Standard errors clustered by state in brackets. Asterisks denote significance: * p < .10, ** p < .05,
*** p < .01. For columns 1 to 3, the sample comprises county-year-months in the contiguous U.S. for winter
months (November–March) between 2000 and 2010. For columns 4 and 5, the sample comprises county-year-
months-education group and county-year-months-sex group respectively for winter months. Mortality rates are
age-adjusted mortality rates expressed as annual deaths per 100,000 population; see data appendix for further
details. ShareGas is the proportion of occupied housing units in the county in 2000 with natural gas as their
main heating source. Log(RelPrice) is the log of the ratio of the monthly citygate price of natural gas in the
US, averaged over the three- and four-month lag, to the corresponding residential price of electricity. Column 1:
Trait is an indicator variable that equals one if the county’s median household income is below the median of
all counties in the sample in 1999. Column 2: Trait is the proportion of households in the county with income
in 1999 below 150 percent of the poverty threshold. Column 3: Trait is an indicator variable that equals one if
the proportion from column 2 is above the median of all counties in the sample. Column 4: Trait is an indicator
variable that equals one for the subgroup that did not complete high school. Column 5: Trait is an indicator
variable that equals one for the male population. All columns include all controls from column 2 of Table 2, the
main effect for Trait, and the interaction of each control variable with Trait.

Notes: Average heating degree-days (HDD) and average age-adjusted mortality rates across US counties
(excluding Hawaii and Alaska) between 2000 and 2010 plotted by month. Average HDD is computed using
temperature data from the PRISM Climate Group, and is based on a threshold of 65°F, in units of °F-days
divided by 1000, and scaled to a 30-day month. Average age-adjusted mortality rates are computed using
the NCHS mortality data and expressed per 100,000 population on an annualized basis. Months we define
as winter in our analysis (November–March) are shaded in the background.

Notes: Average age-adjusted mortality rates across US counties (excluding Hawaii and Alaska) between
2000 and 2010, broken down by sex and EWM versus other causes. EWM causes are those that exhibit a
strong pattern of higher mortality in winter than the rest of the year, as described in the text; see data
appendix for further details. We normalize each series by its value in August (the month with the lowest
all-cause mortality rate). Age-adjusted mortality rates are computed using the NCHS mortality data.

    Notes: Standard errors clustered by state in brackets. Asterisks denote significance: * p < .10,
   ** p < .05, *** p < .01. The sample comprises state-year-months in the contiguous U.S. between
   2000 and 2010. Average electricity and gas price is the state’s consumption-weighted average of
   the residential prices of electricity and gas, in dollars per million BTUs. Total energy consumption
   is the state’s total delivery of natural gas and electricity to residential consumers, in trillion BTUs.
   ShareGas is the proportion of occupied housing units in the state in 2000 with natural gas as their
   main heating source. Log(RelPrice) is the log of the ratio of the monthly citygate price of natural
   gas in the US, averaged over the three- and four-month lag, to the corresponding residential price
   of electricity. Winter is a binary variable that equals one in winter months (November to March).
   HDD is the number of heating degree-days in the county for the month, based on a threshold of
   65°F, in units of °F-days divided by 1000, and scaled to a 30-day month. Monetary variables are in
   constant 2016 US dollars. Implied elasticity is the ratio of the coefficient reported in that column
   to the corresponding coefficient from the first two columns (the “first stage”). All columns include
   covariates analogous to those used in columns 7 and 8 of Table 2.

      Notes: Standard errors clustered by state in brackets. Asterisks denote significance: * p < .10, ** p < .05, *** p < .01. The sample comprises
     county-year-months in the contiguous U.S. between 2000 and 2010. In columns 1 to 6, the sample is restricted to winter months (November–March).
     Mortality rates are age-adjusted mortality rates expressed as annual deaths per 100,000 population; see data appendix for further details. ShareGas
     is the proportion of occupied housing units in the county in 2000 with natural gas as their main heating source. Log(RelPrice) is the log of the
     ratio of the monthly citygate price of natural gas in the US, averaged over the three- and four-month lag, to the corresponding residential price of
     electricity. Winter is a binary variable that equals one in winter months (November to March). HDD is the number of heating degree-days in the
     county for the month, based on a threshold of 65°F, in units of °F-days divided by 1000, and scaled to a 30-day month. Basic fixed effects are county
     and year-month fixed effects. Columns 1 to 6: All other controls are the interactions of log(RelPrice) with the log of the median county household
     income in 1999 and the share of people aged 70 and above in 2000, the state housing price index, the unemployment rate, the state’s manufacturing
     sector share of total employee compensation, and the AQIs for PM2.5 , PM10 , and NO2 . Column 7 and 8: All other controls is the above set plus
     the following: all possible two-way interactions between ShareGas, log(RelPrice), and the triple difference variable (either Winter or HDD), unless
     collinear with year-month fixed effects; and the two- and three-way interactions among log(RelPrice), Winter /HDD, and each of the log of the median
     county household income in 1999 and the share of people aged 70 and above in 2000. Column 8 also includes HDD; the interaction of the average
     county HDD in winter months with log(RelPrice); and the three-way interactions of the average county HDD in winter months, log(RelPrice), and
     each of ShareGas, the log of the median county household income in 1999, and the share of people aged 70 and above in 2000.

is restricted to months November to April in column 1, November to May in column 2, November to June in
column 3, November to July in column 4, November  PK to August in column 5, and November to September in

March to July; M onthof Ef f ect5 takes on a value of one in the months of April to August; M onthof Ef f ect6
takes on a value of one in the months of May to September; and Controls are all controls from column 2
of Table 2 and are fully interacted with the M onthof Ef f ectk dummies. K, the total number of months
after the contemporaneous effect, is 1 in column 1, 2 in column 2, and so on. The coefficients shown are
βk ’s, the effect of the winter price of heating on winter mortality k months after winter, after accounting for
intertemporal correlation (since we estimate the βk ’s jointly), and after removing the effect on mortality in
irrelevant months through M onthof Ef f ectk dummies (e.g., April is not a winter month, so is not relevant for
the contemporaneous effect). Cumulative effect is the sum of the βk ’s. All other definitions not noted above
are as in column 2 of Table 2.

   100,000 population; see data appendix for further details. ShareGas is the proportion of occupied
   housing units in the county in 2000 with natural gas as their main heating source. Log(RelPrice)
   is the log of the ratio of the monthly citygate price of natural gas in the US, averaged over the
   three- and four-month lag, to the corresponding residential price of electricity. HDD is the number
   of heating degree-days in the county for the month, based on thresholds of 65°F, in units of °F-
   days divided by 1000, and scaled to a 30-day month. All columns in panels A and B include the
   covariates from columns 7 and 8 respectively of Table 2. Panel C excludes from this set of control
   variables the two-way and three-way interactions based on the county’s average HDD in winter

B      Data appendix
     Appendix Table B1 lists the data source for each of our outcome and independent
variables. The following sections provide further description of our data sources and the
construction of variables used in this paper.

B.1     Mortality rate
B.1.1 Data source
      The data source for mortality is Vital Statistics records, specifically restricted-use “mor-
tality files with all county geographical information” obtained from the National Center for
Health Statistics (NCHS). These mortality files include a record for every death certificate
filed in the United States during the study period. Each record includes a single underlying
cause of death, up to twenty additional multiple causes, month of death, and demographic
data, including the deceased’s age, gender, race, Hispanic origin, education, county of res-
idence and county of death. The definition of the underlying cause of death follows that
of the World Health Organization (WHO): the disease or injury which initiated the train
of events leading directly to death, or the circumstances of the accident or violence which
produced the fatal injury. Causes of death are classified using the Tenth Revision of the
International Classification of Disease (ICD-10) during the 2000 to 2010 study period.
      We compute mortality rates by county, classifying individuals by their county of resi-
dence. We restrict our analyses to the contiguous US throughout the paper. We account for
substantial county boundary changes by aggregating counties to a larger stable unit.13 Specif-
ically, we combine Adams, Broomfield, Boulder, Jefferson, and Weld counties in Colorado;
Prince George’s and Montgomery in Maryland; Craven and Carteret in North Carolina;
Franklin and Gulf in Florida; Bedford and Bedford City in Virginia; Alleghany and Clifton
Forge in Virginia; Augusta and Waynesboro in Virginia; Prince William and Manassas Park
in Virginia; Southampton and Franklin in Virginia; and York and Newport News in Virginia.
      In addition, when analyzing county-level data, we exclude counties whose population
aged 50 and over in 2000 are in the lowest decile of the full sample to reduce noise from
mortality rates of counties with small population and missing observations when we use the
logarithm of the mortality rate.
B.1.2 Calculating age-adjusted mortality rate
     To calculate mortality rates, we use population data from the National Cancer Insti-
tutes’s Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (Cancer-SEER) program. These data
give yearly county population estimates by age group, sex, race, and Hispanic origin.14 For
2005, we use the SEER’s adjusted set of population estimates that takes into account pop-
ulation shifts due to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.
     We use these population estimates to calculate both crude and age-adjusted mortality
rates, expressed per 100,000 population. The crude mortality rate at county-year-month level
is the total number of deaths in that county in that year-month divided by its population
estimate in that year. The age-adjusted mortality rate is a weighted average of the crude

   We use vintage 2014 population estimates. The data and documentation are available at https://seer.

                                                 36
mortality rates across age categories, where the shares of each age category in the whole
U.S. population are used as weights.15 We use the age distribution of US population in 2000
(the “U.S. 2000 standard population”) published by SEER as weights in the calculation of
age-adjusted mortality rates. All mortality rates in the paper are expressed on an annual
basis obtained by multiplying the month-level mortality rates by (365/number of day in that
month).
B.1.3 Selection of causes of deaths
      We use a data-driven approach to select causes of deaths that exhibit significant “excess
winter mortality” (EWM), or higher mortality in winter months than in other months.
      We use the NCHS’s 113 Selected Causes of Death, which represent groupings of detailed
ICD-10 codes, as the mutually exclusive set of causes of death. To measure the degree of
EWM for each cause, we construct an observation for each month in the 2000 to 2010 period
(132 observations) and calculate the total deaths in the US, by cause, in that month. For
each cause separately, we run a regression of the number of deaths due to that cause (i.e., as
the underlying cause of death) on a Winter dummy, which equals 1 for November to March,
and year fixed effects. A similar set of regressions is estimated with the logarithm of deaths
as the outcome instead of the level. We then select causes whose Winter coefficient is in the
top quartile among all causes of deaths in both levels and logs (i.e., above 0.12 for logs and
0.02 for levels). We use both levels and logs of mortality because we want to select causes
that are both common and have a strong degree of excess winter mortality.
      We exclude two causes from the data-driven list of excess winter mortality causes:
first, Accidental exposure to smoke, fire and flames, since accidental deaths that are not a
physiological result of exposure cold differ from our focus, and second, All other diseases (the
residual category), since it is difficult to verify the mechanism for this “cause.” Appendix
Table A1 reports Winter coefficients in levels and logs and average monthly crude mortality
rate for each of the selected causes. The final selected list includes the following fourteen
causes of death, with their ICD-10 codes in brackets. These causes can be further grouped
into four broader cause groups.

        Group A: Non-viral, non-respiratory infections

           – Septicemia (A40-A41)

        Group G: Neurological diseases

           – Parkinson’s disease (G20-G21)
           – Alzheimer’s disease (G30)

        Group I: Circulatory system diseases

           – Acute myocardial infarction (I21-I22)
           – All other forms of chronic ischemic heart disease (I20, I25.1-I25.9)
           – Heart failure (I50)
  15
    We use the following 19 age categories: under 1 year, 1-4 years, 5-9 years, ..., 80-84 years, and 85 years
and over.


                                                     37
           – Cerebrovascular diseases (I60-I69)
           – Atherosclerosis (I70)

       Group J: Respiratory system diseases

           – Influenza (J09-J11)
           – Pneumonia (J12-J18)
           – Emphysema (J43)
           – Other chronic lower respiratory diseases (J44, J47)
           – Pneumonitis due to solids and liquids (J69)
           – Other diseases of respiratory system (J00-J06, J30-J39, J67, J70-J98)

B.2       Home energy price and usage
     All energy prices and consumption data come from monthly series published by the
U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), available at the state and national level.
The data are based on samples of firms supplying natural gas or electricity to residential
consumers, and include some processing by the EIA to account for non-response.16
     The raw data express quantities in kilowatt-hours for electricity and cubic feet for nat-
ural gas. To allow comparison between energy types, we convert these quantities to British
Thermal Units (BTU). The conversion is straightforward for electricity. For natural gas,
we apply estimates of the heat content of natural gas delivered to residential consumers for
each state and year using the company-level data available in the EIA’s Natural Gas Annual
Respondent Query System. For these estimates, we drop firms reporting heat content val-
ues of 0 or above 2,500 BTU per cubic feet, and weight the reported heat content for each
firm by the volume of gas supplied to residential consumers.17 We also apply two manual
edits. First, five state-year observations are missing residential consumer heat content data
for all firms; we use the all-consumers heat content for these five observations. Second, the
dominant firm in Arkansas is missing heat content data for 2001; we use the average of its
report in 2000 and 2002 instead.
     Lastly, to aid interpretation of monetary units, we deflate all prices in this paper—
including the prices of natural gas and of electricity—to 2016 prices using the Bureau of
Labor Statistics’s (BLS) Consumer Price Index (CPI-U).

B.3       Home energy bills
      For data on energy bills, we use Census 2000 5-Percent Public Use Microdata Sample
(PUMS) files combined with the 2005 to 2010 American Community Survey (ACS) PUMS
files. The Census/ACS data are available on an annual basis, and the finest geographic
identifier is the Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA). We aggregate the microdata to obtain
mean monthly energy bill for each PUMA for the year 2000 and 2005-2010. The relevant
question in the Census 2000 is “What are the annual costs of utilities and fuels for this
house, apartment, or mobile home?”, broken down into different types of utilities and fuels.
 16
      Response to the survey is required by law, and hence such non-response should not be a large problem.
 17
      Heat contents typically range between 900 and 1,200 BTU per cubic feet.


                                                     38
In the ACS, households are asked how much these bills cost them last month (for electricity
and gas) and last 12 months (for other fuels). We exclude households whose energy bills are
included in their rent or condominium fees.

B.4     Home heating sources (ShareGas)
      Our identification strategy uses cross-sectional variation in heating sources across ge-
ographic areas, represented by the variable ShareGas, the proportion of occupied housing
units in each state, county, or PUMA in 2000 that indicates that gas is their main heating
source. Gas refers to both utility gas from underground pipes serving the neighborhoods and
bottled, tank or LP gas. The data source for ShareGas at the state and county level is the
2000 Decennial Census of Population and Housing Summary Files, which provide aggregate
data at each of the aforementioned geographic levels.18 The relevant Census question from
which ShareGas is derived is “Which fuel is used most for heating this house, apartment, or
mobile home?” We account for substantial county boundary changes by aggregating counties
to a larger stable unit, as described in the mortality data section. ShareGas of the larger
stable unit is the weighted average of ShareGas of each county that makes up the unit, with
the weights being the county’s share of total population in 2000 of the larger unit.19
      The data source for ShareGas at the PUMA level is the Census 2000 5-Percent PUMS
files. Our sample consists of occupied housing units and excludes group quarters and vacant
units. We aggregate information at the household level to obtain the proportion of housing
units in each PUMA that indicates that gas is their main heating source. We account for
the change in PUMA definition due to Hurricane Katrina by aggregating three PUMAs in
Louisiana into one stable unit across our sample period20 .

B.5     Relative price of natural gas to electricity (RelPrice)
     Another key variable in our analysis is log(RelPrice), the log of the relative price of
natural gas to electricity in the US. We use the same data described in Section B.2 for
this. The electricity price for the denominator is the national counterpart of that described
previously: the national monthly price of electricity supplied to residential consumers.
     One candidate for the natural gas price is the national monthly price of natural gas
delivered to residential consumers, which is computed by dividing the reported revenue of
local distribution utilities by the associated sales volume. The relevant survey question
that the EIA uses defines revenue as “gross revenues including any and all demand charges,
commodity charges, taxes, surcharges, adjustments or other charges billed for gas delivered”;
consequently, fixed charges that utilities frequently include (e.g. basic monthly customer
charges that do not depend on volumes) are included. However, we expect consumers to
respond to the variable (i.e., usage-dependent) component of prices, not the fixed charge
component. In the data, since the fixed charges are averaged over a smaller volume in
summer, the residential price spikes in summer (Appendix Figure B1).
     Because of this, we use the national monthly price of natural gas at the citygate instead.
The citygate price is the price faced by local distribution utilities (companies that sell gas

     County population data come from the 2000 Census of Population and Housing Summary File 1.

     The Census Bureau merged 3 PUMAs (Louisiana 01801, 01802, and 01905) into 1 PUMA (77777) for

                                                39
to residential consumers); hence it captures variation due to natural gas prices and excludes
fixed charges to residents. In addition, utilities are required by federal law to price gas
on a cost-recovery basis.21 This means that absent forecast errors by the utilities, citygate
prices should capture the variation in gas price perfectly. With forecast errors, utilities are
legally required to return unexpected profits or losses made on natural gas to consumers by
adjusting the future months’ prices downwards or upwards. Citygate prices are not available
for electricity.
     When looking at annual outcomes in the Census/ACS data, we use the annual versions
of the price variables. These are based on a separate survey of the universe of firms in the
US, but are otherwise identical to the monthly versions.

B.6      Heating degree-days
     To compute the number of heating degree-days (HDD), we use daily gridded tempera-
ture data for the contiguous US (4 kilometers by 4 kilometers resolution) from the Parameter-
elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) data developed and maintained
by the PRISM Climate Group at Oregon State University (PRISM Climate Group 2004).22
The PRISM data incorporate the current knowledge of U.S. spatial climate patterns, includ-
ing elevation and prevailing wind patterns, and are the official spatial climate datasets of
the U.S. Department of Agriculture (Daly et al. 2008).
     To obtain HDD for each county-month, we first compute the geographic average daily
mean temperature of each Census 2000 block group. For each block group, we take a simple
average of all grid points within, or on the boundary of, the block group. We then compute
HDD for each month for each block group, based on
                                         T (t)
                                         X
                            HDDit =              max {threshold − tmeanix , 0}                            (3)
                                         x=1

where HDDit is the HDD of block group i in month t, threshold is a temperature threshold
(set at 65°F, following convention), tmeanix is the mean temperature of block group i on
day x, and T (t) is the number of days in month t. Next, we compute each county’s HDD
for the month by taking the average of the block groups within the county, weighted by the
population in Census 2000. Finally, we scale HDD to a 30-day month, and divide by 1,000,
to yield an average monthly measure of coldness. Block group geographic and population
data come from the National Historical Geographic Information System (NHGIS; Manson
et al. 2017).

B.7      Median household income and population share age 70+
     Data for county and state median household income and fraction of people age 70 and
above are from the 2000 Decennial Census of Population and Housing Summary Files. Data
at the PUMA level are from the Census 2000 5-Percent PUMS files. Both variables are
derived from the Census using the same approach as described above for ShareGas.
  21
     Note that they may still charge a markup on distribution of gas, which is more difficult for the state to
monitor.
  22
     The specific dataset used is version D1 of the AN81d dataset, retrieved February 2017, from http:
//prism.oregonstate.edu.

B.8     House price index
     State house price index used in the paper is the quarterly seasonally-adjusted purchase-
only house price index, available from the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA).

B.9     Unemployment rate
     We use the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ county-month unemployment rate as a control
variable. A few county-level observations are missing due to Hurricane Katrina; we use the
state unemployment rate for these observations, and include a dummy for affected observa-
tions in regressions. When analyzing the Census/ACS, we compute PUMA unemployment
rate directly from the microdata.

B.10      Manufacturing share of the economy
     We use the Bureau of Economic Analysis’s state-quarter personal income data when
controlling for manufacturing share of total employee compensation (meant to proxy for
share of the economy). A few observations (fewer than 0.5%) are missing; we impute these
observations by interpolation. Quarterly data are then matched to the appropriate time
period.

B.11      Air pollution data
     The data source for air pollution is daily station-level data from the US Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) Air Quality System (AQS).23 The AQS data contain daily air
quality indices (AQIs) for carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, particulate matter (2.5
and 10), and sulfur dioxide; data for some pollutants for some stations are missing. We
construct monthly AQIs for each geographic unit of analysis, and then aggregate to the
appropriate time period.
     To construct monthly AQIs for each county in our sample for analysis of mortality data,
we use a mix of procedures. For the first procedure, we compute each pollutant’s AQI at
the Census 2000 block group level, and then aggregate to the county level, weighting by
population. We compute the AQI for each block group as the average of all AQI measure-
ments taken within a month at all stations within 100 kilometers, weighted by the inverse
of the squared distance to the station. County AQI is then the population-weighted average
of block group AQIs. Block group and population data come from the NHGIS.
     The above procedure (setting a distance threshold and computing the AQI) is standard
in the literature using stations data, but it produces many missing observations. We patch
missing data using a second procedure. Specifically, if a county has more than 50 percent of
its population not assigned a pollutant AQI value in any month, we use a second procedure
to compute its AQI values for all months. For these counties, for each month, we compute
AQI based on the nearest five stations with available measurements, weighted by the inverse
of the squared distance between the station and the county centroid. This guarantees that
all counties have a pollution AQI measure for all months in consideration.
     Appendix Table B2 shows, for each pollutant, the breakdown of the procedure used to
compute AQI in the sample of counties used in our analysis of mortality data.
  23
    The EPA provides several ways of accessing the data. We use the pre-generated data files, accessed
February 2017.



                                                 41
     We construct monthly AQIs at the PUMA or state level for use in analyzing the other
outcome variables analogously. We then aggregate to the relevant time period for analysis.
This differs depending on the outcome variable. When looking at the effects on home energy
price, usage, and mortality, we aggregate to the monthly level directly. When looking at
the effects on home energy bills, we additionally account for the time structure in the ACS.
ACS documentation indicates that around half of data for each month are collected two
months prior through computer-assisted personal interviewing, and around half are collected
contemporaneously through mail or the internet. In addition, we account for possible lags
in bill payment. For this, we assume that two-thirds of interviewees in a certain month
report the bill paid in the previous month, and one-third report the bill paid two months
ago (because the most recent bill might not have been paid yet). Hence, when aggregating
monthly AQIs for a particular year when analyzing the Census/ACS, we include data from
up to four previous months (September the previous year gets one-sixth of a month’s worth
of weight, etc.).

B.12     Independent variables used in heterogeneity analysis
    Variables used in analysis of heterogeneity in the effect of heating price on mortality are
from the following sources:

    Poverty rate: Data on proportion of households in the county with income below
     150% of the poverty level is from the 2000 Decennial Census of Population and Housing
     Summary Files.

    Education: Data on the deceased’s education level is provided in the mortality files.
     We drop deaths that occur before the age of 25, with censored education level, for
     this analysis. To compute age-adjusted mortality rates by education level, we use
     Census/ACS population data, since the SEER data does not contain a breakdown by
     education level. We interpolate proportions for the years in which no population data
     exist (2001 to 2004).

    Sex: Data on the deceased’s sex is provided in the mortality files.

B.13     LIHEAP data
     As a robustness check, we use data on Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program
(LIHEAP) spending from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ LIHEAP
Data Warehouse. The data are based on mandatory reports from states for each fiscal
year, and are available at the state-fiscal year level starting in fiscal year 2001 (i.e. since
October 2000). For the nine months in our sample without LIHEAP data, we impute an
arbitrary value for LIHEAP per capita and include a dummy for affected observations in the
regressions.
