      This paper examines how measurement error biases longitudinal estimates of
union effects. It develops numerical examples, statistical models, and econo-
metric estimates which indicate that measurement error is a major problem in
longitudinal data sets, so that longitudinal analyses do not provide the
research panacea for determining the effects of unionism (or other economic
forces) some have suggested. There are three major findings:

      1) The difference between the cross—section and longitudinal estimates is
attributable in large part to random error in the measurement of who changes
union status. Given modest errors of measurement, of the magnitudes observed,
and a moderate proportion of workers changing union status, also of the magnitu-
des observed, measurement error biases downward estimated effects of unions by
substantial amounts.

      2) Longitudinal analysis of the effects of unionism on nonwage and wage
outcomes tends to confirm the significant impact of unionism found in cross—
section studies, with the longitudinal estimates of both nonwage and wage out-
comes lover in the longitudinal analysis than in the cross—section analysis
of the same data set.

      3) The likely upward bias of cross—section estimates of the effect of
unions and the likely downward bias of longitudinal estimates suggests that,
under reasonable conditions, the two sets of estimates bound the "true" union
impact posited in standard models of what unions do.

          archtetypical comment on virtually any study of the economic
          effects of unionism, or suitably modified, on any other empirical
          subject



     Longitudinal data, which follow the same worker over time, offer

researchers a potentially valuable way to examine often—raised objections to the

findings of cross—section studies. Unlike complex "structural model" approaches

to cross-section data problems, which often yield unstable and uninformative

results (Freeman and Medoff 1981), longitudinal data offer a distinctively dif-

ferent "experiment" for uncovering the effects of changes in economic variables.

In the case of unions, what is a more natural way to study what unions do than

to compare economic outcomes for workers (firms) before and after they change

union status?

      This paper presents a critical analysis of the "natural experiment." In

contrast to the archetypical comment cited above, it argues that longitudinal

analyses do not provide a research panacea for determining the effects of

unionism (or other economic forces). The main reason for this is the substan-

tial impact of measurement or misclassification error of the union (other

economic) variable on longitudinal work.

      The paper is divided into four sections. Section I develops briefly the

statistical models used in this (and other) longitudinal investigations of what

unions do. Section II examines the effect of measurement error in union status
                                        2




on estimated effects of unionism in cross—section and longitudinal studies.

Section III presents the results of estimating the effect of unionism on out-

comes in four longitudinal and cross—section data sets. In contrast to other

empirical analyses using longitudinal data, it treats two market outcomes which

are at the center of the "voice—response" face of unionism, dispersion of wages

and provision of fringe benefits, as well as wages. Section IV considers the

argument that cross—section and longitudinal estimates of union effects "bound"

the true   impact   of unionism.

      There are three basic findings:

      1) The difference between the cross—section and longitudinal estimates is

attributable in large part to random error in the measurement of who changes

union status. Given modest errors of measurement, of the magnitudes observed,

and a moderate proportion of workers changing union status, also of the magnitu-

des observed, measurement error biases downward estimated effects of unions by

substantial amounts.

      2) Longitudinal analysis of the effects of unionism on nonwage and wage

outcomes tends to confirm the significant impact of unionism found in cross—

section studies, with the longitudinal estimates of both nonwage and wage out-

comes lower in the longitudinal analysis than in 'the cross—section analysis

of the same data set.

      3) The likely upward bias of cross—section estimates of the effect of

unions and the likely downward bias of longitudinal estimates suggests that,

under reasonable conditions, the two sets of estimates bound the "true" union

impact posited in standard models of what unions do.

      All told, the paper concludes that because of measurement error and likely

selectivity of who changes union status longitudinal analysis is a useful tool

for "checking on" the result the cross—section studies but may very well yield

worse estimates of the parameters of interest.


I. Longitudinal Models of What Unions Do

      The standard cross—section analysis of the impact of collective bargaining

on the economic outcome or behavior of individual workers (or firms) involves a

multivariate statistical equation of the form

                            0. = a + bU. + cX. + U.                               (1)
                               1       1     1     1


where 0. = outcome for person i,

               dichotomous unionization variable (1 =   covered, 0 = not   covered),

           =   control   variables (education, sex) assumed constant over time, and

      U. =
       1
               error   term.

The recurrent objection to estimates based on (i) is that because of selectivity

of union workers U. is likely to be positively correlated with U1, leading to an

overstatement of the union effect. Since, as Abowd and Farber (1982) have

stressed, who gets a union job results from the decisions of both employers and

workers, the selectivity argument depends on whose decision dominates the hiring

process. In the case of wages it is generally assumed that, given high union

wages, firms select ure able workers from the queue facing them, producing

E(uU.) > 0. In the case of nonwage outcomes, it is often claimed that workers

sort themselves in such a way- that those who have strong desires for union—tThe

work conditions and nodes of compensation (and would thus obtain xmre of those

outcomes in nonunion settings that the randomly chosen worker) choose union

jobs. In this case firms either are indifferent or prefer those workers as well

(since they will be nxre satisfied).

      Longitudinal data provides a way to deal with the correlation between
                                                   4



unionism and the error term. Assuming that the part of u that is correlated

with U. is an individual effect constant over time, so that                           =
                                                                                          a1
                                                                                               +        with

E(1 U) =       0, addition of individual constants (which can be viewed as a form
of differencing) will eliminate the correlation between                         and                In a two—

period linear model one obtains

                                °it = b1J1t +                                                           (2)

where        takes the values —1, 0, 1. A multivariate analysis of (2) will yield

the desired b as long as the change in union status is properly measured and is

uncorrelated with the change in the random part of the error term.

        Equation (2) can be readily generalized to exploit more fully the longitu-

dinal data by allowing different changes in union status to have different

effects on wages. In particular, we can allow changes in outcomes to differ

among workers who join unions, leave unions, stay union, and stay nonunion:

                     °it =   a1UU
                                    +
                                        a2UN
                                               +
                                                   cz3NU
                                                           +
                                                               a4NN
                                                                      +

where UU, UN, NU, and NN are dummy variables that take the values 1 or 0
                                                                          it'                           (3)




depending on the union status in the two periods:

                    VU = 1, if union in both periods;

                    UN    1, if union in period 1, nonunion in period 2;

                    NU = 1, if nonunion in period 1, union in period 2;

                    NN = 1, if nonunion in each period;

and where the constant term has been suppressed.

        Equation (3) shows that the before/after nature of the experiment permits

calculation of three different union effects, each answering a somewhat dif-

ferent question:

        (1) What happens to nonunion workers who join unions compared to nonunion

workers who remain nonunion (obtained as the difference between the coefficients
                                                 5




on NU and NN, NU — NN, for short)?

         (2) What happens to union workers who leave the union compared to those

who remain union (UN - U1J)?

         (3) Among workers who change, what happens to those who join a union as

compared to those who leave a union ((UN — NU)/2 or some such other average)?

         It can be readily seen that when union differential is constant over time

(UI! =   NN) and when the effects of joining and leaving unions are the same in

absolute value (     NU — NN   =     UN   — uu   ),   Equation (3) collapses into Equation
(2). Less restrictively, if the only reasons for (3) to differ from (2) are

changes in union differentials over time, the estimated parameters will fulfill

the equality in absolute values given above, that is, the only difference bet-

ween the gains of workers who join unions versus those who leave is the changed

union differential over time.

         Equations (2) and (3) can be readily generalized to analyze data covering

more than two periods. The natural extension of (2) is to a fixed effects model

with individual constants (differences from mean values) for each person. The

natural extension of (3) is to a model with dummy variables for all possible

classifications of changes in status. For ease of exposition in this paper I

treat only the two—period case.


Interpreting Longitudinal Results

         Assuming that E(aU1) > 0, the longitudinal estimates of union impact

should be lower than cross—section estimates. In fact, empirical analyses of

wages do indeed show a lower impact of unionism in longitudinal than in cross-

section data, providing support for the "omitted ability bias" model given above

(among the panel studies are Duncan 19777, 1979; Brown 1980; Mellow 1981; Mincer
                                       C




1981; Chamberlain 1982). In Chamberlain's analysis, for example, addition of

individual constants reduces the union coefficient by 32% to 44%, indicating "a

substantial heterogeneity (ability) bias." The union wage effect still stands,

but its magnitude is smaller than in traditional cross—section analysis. As the

archetypical comment at the beginning of the paper indicates, many have

interpreted the smaller longitudinal estimates as providing better estimates of

the true union effects than the larger cross—section estimates. Indeed, under

the fixed—effect assumptions that changes in union status are properly measured

and that selectivity of changers does not produce a correlation of the error in

the change—in—outcome equation with changes—in—status, the longitudinal estimate

is unbiased.

      Are these assumptions likely to be valid in empirical work? What does

their violation do to longitudinal estimates of union effects?

      This paper argues that neither assumption is likely to be valid and that,

under reasonable conditions, measurement error and selectivity of changers will

bias downward longitudinal estimates of union effects. Because in practice

measurement error appears to be the principal econometric problem in analysis of

longitudinal data, I focus largely on the measurement error issue.

II. The Problem of Measurement Error

      In cross—section studies of unionism, one generally ignores measurement

erro in the union status variable on the assumption that only a small number of

workers are likely to be misclassified and thus that any bias in the estimated

union coefficient due to measurement error is modest. Misclassification of a

small number of workers will, however, produce a much larger error in longitudi-

nal than in cross—section analysis and thus cannot be readily ignored. The

reason for the greater error is twofold. On the one hand, random nasclassifica—

tion    of workers in two periods will produce a larger number of misclassified

workers than random misclassification in one period. On the other hand, by

obtaining information on union effects from generally small numbers of changers,

the longitudinal analysis will contain a smaller number of correct observations.

As a result the proportion of observations in error will be much larger in the

longitudinal analysis than in the cross—section analysis, producing a larger

bias.

        A numeric example illustrates the dramatically different effect of modest

misclassification on cross—section and longitudinal estimates. Assume we have a

sample of 100 workers, of whom 25 are union members and 75 are not. Assume

measurement error is such that 2 union workers are misclassified and 2 nonunion

workers are misclassified.1 Then we have the situation shown in Table lA. If

the true value of the outcome variable is 1 .00 for nonunion workers and 1 .30 for

union workers, our estimated means would be 1 .28 and 1 .01, giving an estimated

differential of 27%, a value that is 10% below the true impact of unionism.

        Assume that 20 workers switch union status in the period, 10 joining and

10 leaving unions. With 4 workers misclassified in each period, so that 8% of

union workers and 2.7% of nonunion workers are incorrectly classified, it can be

demonstrated (see Equation 12) that the longitudinal data set will be approxima-

tely as shown in Table lB.

        There are three points to note about this data set. First, the longitudi-

nal estimates of the union effect from NU and UN comparisons are the same:

1.25/1.03 or 21%, which is 30% below the true impact of unionism—— an atte-

nuation that is three times as large as that in the cross-section analysis.

Second, measurement error produces a pattern of differences in levels of wages

between the four sets: for example, workers measured as leaving unions have a
                                             9




lower wage in period 1 than workers who remain union, workers measured as

joining unions have a higher wage in period 1 than workers who remain nonunion,

and so on. Third, the best estimate of the difference in wages in the data is

the comparison of the mean level of wages for the UU set with the mean level for

the NN set, which yields essentially the correct 30% differential. For this to

be the best estimate of the union effect, however, workers in the two sets would

have to be otherwise identical, contrary to the assumed E(a±U) > 0

       More formally, I compare what measurement error in the dichotomous union

status variable does to the estimated union coefficient in cross—section

Equation (1) to what measurement error in the change in union status variable

does to the estimated union coefficient in longitudinal Equation (2). Because

of the restricted values of union status or change in status, the measurement

error is correlated with the workers' true status, so that the standard measure-

ment error in regression analysis must be modified, along lines set out by

Aigner (1973) and by Marquis et. al. (1981).2

       Consider first measurement error in a dichotomous variable. Let M

measured union status, U =     actual   status, and e    error. Then

                              M=Ue                                                    (4)

where possible errors are: —1, if a person's true status is union (u                i), pro-

ducing a nonunion classification (M =      0),   and 1, if a person's true status is

nonunion (u =    0),   producing a union classification (N     i).

       Now let rU be the probability that a union worker is misclassified and

rN is the probability that a nonunion worker is misclassified and 1 —           r    and

1 —        be the corresponding probabilities that the workers are correctly
      rN
classified. Then the relation between the expected error and           the   true status

is:
                                                                 10

so that from (4)

                                    E(M) =             + (1      —            -                                         (6)

Hence we can write M as

                                                       rU

                                                            rN)U
                                                                 +                     v                                (6')

where v is a random variable with mean zero and variance ci.

      The effect of regressing an outcome 0 on N rather than on U can be eva-

luated by substituting (6') into the true equation (1) and treating the random

      The bias on the coefficient on                                 from omitting Vj                is   the coefficient of

v1 in (7) times the regression coefficient of v on M, holding the Xe fixed.

Assuming, for ease of presentation, that N is uncorrelated with the Xe in (7),

we obtain the coefficient of v on N from (6') as a/cs, the random measurement

error component of the measured variance. Then the regression for (7) yields

for the coefficient on 111(b).

Since union status is binomal,                         =   u(i       —   U), where U                 mean proportion union. If

as in our numeric example, we assume that M U, which holds whenever rU rN(l -U),

Equation (8) simplifies to

                   E(b) = b(1 -

when        is correlated with X(r) the comparable equation is:


                            E(b)
                                        b(1_r - rN) -        bb XM                                      (io)
                                             1 -   r2
where              and b are the simple regression coefficients. Here the bias depends

on the relation between the Xs and both observed and true union status. If we

assume that the random component of the measurement error is independent of

        =                                               =
             0]     then, noting that                       r2mx, (10) becomes

                                        b(1—rU —r)—r
                                                N                                                        (10')
                          E(b) =
                                         1 - r


        Since the bias in (10) is greater than the bias in (9), we conclude that

as long as the random component of measurement error is uncorrelated with the Xs

the    cross—section estimate of the union effect is biased downward by at least

       rU
            -   rN   percent.3
        Turning           to the effect of measurement error on longitudinal estimates, we

proceed in a similar manner to the preceding analysis. In this case, the

equation relating measured and true changes in union status is

                                                 AN = AU +    e,                                         (ii)


where AN = measured change in union status (                          1, 0, -i),
            AU =     true   change (1, 0, —i), and

            e = error           (2, 1, 0, —1, —2).

            When rU and rN are independent over time, the relationship between the

true changes and the measured changes can be written as functions of rU and

                                                                                              = U or N) as

       Equation (12) is the critical equation in our analysis. The three terms

in each equation in which an r or r is multiplied by a (1 —                                                     r)   represent

misclassification errors. The terms in which (1 —                                            r)   is multiplied by (1 —              r)
represent true changes in the measured observations. As before, the error term

can take on only a limited set of values, dependent on the value of the true

change. The relation between the true values of &J and the possible error is

defined as in Table 2 below.

       But from this array it can be seen that

                        E(e) =                  +                                                                               (13)

For ease of analysis, assume that the true mean of unionism, (U), is constant

over time and that there is no constant response bias, E(N) = U. But it can be

shown (Marquis, et. al. 1981, p. 101) that MUN depends on

        With constant U, Tu = TNU. Now let T be the proportion of workers

changing union status in the sample (Tc = TUN +                                    T).   Then (17) simplifies to

                                            = Tc,                                                           (19)

while substitution of (18) into (17') yields

        Examination of (19) —            (19')   shows the answer to be negative. When

measurement error is large so that (1 — rU — TN)                                    is close to zero and when

is large       >        For example, let rU = rN = .40 and U (' r/(r +                                          = .50.
                                                                                                         TN))
Then        = .O4TC +   .48,    so that for                       > '               > o. In this case, measure-

ment error biases the cross—section estimate more than the longitudinal esti-

mate.

      On the other hand, when measurement error is modest, ——   a   in our earlier

numeric example ——      will   be less than    for moderate values of Tc, producing

a greater downward bias in the longitudinal calculation.

      Since the effect of measurement error on longitudinal as opposed to cross-

section analysis thus depends on the magnitudes of the various parameters in the

measurement error formula, I turn next to estimates of the critical magnitudes.


Evidence on Measurement Error

      The first parameters needed to evaluate the importance of measurement

error are the actual errors themselves —— rV and rN.    I have identified two sur-

veys which provide the type of information needed to estimate       and rN:

separate measures of the union status of the same workers at essentially the

same time. The first survey is a special supplement to the January 1977 Current

Population Survey, which asked workers whether or not they were covered by

collective bargaining and then asked their employers the same question. The

second is the May 1979 Current Population Survey which asked workers about their

         bargaining status on the "dual job" supplement and on the "pension"
collective

supplement. While there are differences in the timing of the questions in both
surveys, the time differences are sufficiently slight so that differences in
answers   provides us with a reasonable first-order approximation to random

measurement error in union status.

      Table 3 tabulates the responses to these two surveys. It shows that while

rU and rN are, as stated, modest in value, they are sufficiently non negligible

to produce potentially large response error bias in longitudinal data. In the

1979 CPS sample 6.4 to 8.1% of workers in the union category are misclassified,

and 1.9 to 2.3% of those in the nonunion category giving a value of 8.7 to 10.0%

for the critical r + rN figure. In the 1977 matched employer —                enploye
sample, 7.5% of workers in the union category are misclassified and              2.3 of
                                                                +
those   in the nonunion category giving a 9.8% value to r           rN.
        To check whether the differences in classification on the samples can, in
                                                   measurement error, I have esti-
fact, be interpreted as resulting from random

mated union wage equations for the sample of workers for whom there are

conflicting estimates of union status, and for the sample for whom there are no

such conflicts. If the conflict in responses is due to random misclassifica-

tion, one would   expect   no significant union wage effect for persons in the

sample in which estimates conflict, compared to a sizeable union effect in the

sample for which there are no conflicts in whether a person is union or not. As

can be seen in the unnumbered table below, estimates of standard log wage

equations (with the usual demographic and human capital controls) for the

samples yield the expected results:

where the +   before   the coefficient reflects the change in sign depending on

which estimate of unionism is used as the independent variable.

        Finally, taking the magnitudes of the estimated misclassification errors

in Table 3 as valid, we can apply the formulas given earlier to evaluate the

impact of measurement error on regression estimates of union impacts, given dif-

ferent proportions of workers truly     changing   union status. As can be seen in

20% change status the estimates are closer together. Consistent with the pre-

ceding analysis, when the proportion changing union status rises to relatively

high levels, the longitudinal estimates exceed the cross—section estimates.

     Table 5 turns to the next obvious issue: the proportion of workers who

actually change union status in a longitudinal data set. It examines the pro-

portions measured as changing status in four major longitudinal surveys:       the

May 1974—75 Current Population Survey (cs), the National Longitudinal Survey

of Men Aged 14—24 in 1966 (NLS) for the period 1970-78, and the Quality of

Employment Panel Survey (QES), 1973—77, and also records estimates of the true

proportion changing. The estimated true proportion changing are obtained by
                                    N.   and N.      from (18), which yields
summing the expected values of uN               rU

                               —           +                                   (20)

where Tc is the proportion of true changers, and solving for Tc. In the cases

where U changes over time, Equation (20) is still applicable because the impact

of changes in U has offsetting effects on E(MUN) and

      ifl three of the samples, the calculations yielded reasonable estimates of

the true proportion changing, and those figures are reported in the table. In

the May CPS sample, however, the formulas yielded no estimate, because under the

assumptions, measurement error by itself should have produced virtually the pro-

portion of changers observed.

      The key finding in Table 5 is that whether one looks at the measured pro-

portion of changers or at the estimated true proportion the values are on the

low side of the figures in Table 4. The measured changes (Mc) range from 6.2%

(cPs) to 24.2% (ilLS) while the "true" proportion changing vary from 9.1% (QES)

to 21% (ilLs). With these changes, measurement error biases downward the longi-

tudinal estimates by 14% (NLs) to 29% (PSID) to 34% (QES) and by even larger

amounts in the CPS, according to the estimates     in Table 2.
      In   sum, given measurement errors in union status that produce values of

rU + rN of about .10, and   true   proportions of workers changing status below .20,

the analysis in this section suggests that longitudinal estimates of the effect

of unionism on economic outcomes will be below cross—section estimates and, more

important, below the true effect of unionism as well.


Comparisons of Longitudinal and Cross-Section Estimates of Union Effects

      As noted in Section I, there have been several studies of union wage

effects u8ing longitudinal data. These studies have found lower union effects

than are found in comparable cross—section studies. By contrast, while there is

a large and growing cross—section literature on the effects of unions on out-

comes other than level of wages, such as dispersion of wages, labor turnover

(notably quit behavior), fringe benefits, and the like (see Freeman and Medoff

[1981] for a summary), there has been little longitudinal evidence regarding the

effect of union membership on these outcomes. This section provides evidence

that for two important "nonwage" outcomes, the dispersion of wages and fringe

benefits, and for wages, longitudinal analysis yields smaller estimated union

effects than does cross—section analysis, but that the estimated effects are

still fairly sizable and economically significant. This finding leads us to

reject criticisms that the results of cross—section studies of the nonwage out-

comes are more subject to "heterogeneity" or fixed effects bias than are the

results of wage studies. As measurement error should reduce the estimated

impact of unionism on all outcomes, this is consistent with the models given in

Section II.

      The analysis treats the four data sets set out in Table 5. In each case I

sought the largest possible sample for which the outcome variables and the union

variable were reported. In the Michigan PSID sample, in which one has a number

of possible years to examine, I report the results from a relatively long time

span, 1970—79, though I examined shorter spans as well. In contrast to some

studies, I include all of the special "poverty" sample as well as the random

sample in the survey. In the NLS sample I also chose a relatively long time

span to examine. As the May CPS sample covers one year and the QES covers three

years, the result is significant variation in the time span covered and, as seen

in Table 5, significant variation in the proportion of persons changing union

status as well.


Wages

        Table 6 presents the results of my longitudinal analysis of union wage

effects in the four data sets.6 It records the log wages for the four union—

change groups before and after the change, the change in log wages, and the

implied union effects and, for comparison, the cross—section estimate of the

union wage effect in the same data. While there is some variation among the

three types of longitudinal estimates, the general pattern of results is clear:

the longitudinal calculations yield lower estimates of the union effects than do

cross—section calculations. As many longitudinal analyses focus on the dif-

ference in changes in wages between those joining and those leaving unions, the

most significant comparison is between the (im — UN)/2 estimates and the cross—

section estimates.7 Consistent with the results of Mellow (1981) they show a

great reduction in the estimated union effect in the Nay 1974-75 CPS. As this

is the group with the smallest measured proportion of changers, this is to be

expected from measurement error. There is, however, one aberrant case in the

table: in the QES, the (NU — U1)/2 comparison yields a larger rather than

smaller estimated union effect than does the cross—section analysis. In this

case, the cross—section difference in wages was only moderately above the longi-

tudinal difference (uu and NN differ by .17 and .15) so that inclusion of

regression controls reduced the cross—section estimate to the lower level. Note

also that the pattern of differences in the log wages themselves, before and

after the change, are also generally, although not always, in line with the

impact of measurement error. The before—change log wages show that union

leavers have lower wages than union stayers, which agrees with the Section II

nwrierical example. The after—change log wages also show that union joiners have

lower wages than union stayers in all cases. By contrast, the before and after

comparisons of changers with nonunion stayers show a less consistent pattern.

      Finally, if we assume that the estimates of measurement error used in

Table 5 apply to these data, we can calculate the proportion of the difference

between cross—section/longitudinal coefficients due to measurement error. To do

this we estimate the relative bias of longitudinal to cross—section estimates

from Table 4, using the estimated true proportion of changers from Table 5, and

multiply the resulting statistic by the cross—section estimate in Table 6. This

yields .24 for the NLS and .16 for the PSID as the expected estimates from the

longitudinal analyses, if measurement error were the only factor operating.

Comparing these figures to the actual longitudinal estimates in Table 6, we see

that measurement error explains 44% (NLS) to 77% (PSID) of the

cross-section/longitudinal differences. While further analysis is required to

pin down the specifics of the misclassification effects in each data set, our

analysis suggests that measurement error can explain much of the difference

ween cross—section and longitudinal estimates of union wage effects.
                                       25



     This conclusion, while at odds with the widely used fixed—effects

interpretation of the difference between longitudinal and cross-section analy-

sis, is consistent with recent evaluations by other researchers. Chowdhury and

Nickell (1982) who correct for measurement error bias in standard covariance

estimates by instrumenting unionization on lagged unionization (on the grounds

that serial correlation in the U variable is strong but is absent from measure-

ment error), found that a longitudinal estimate of the union effect of .10

increased to .30 in the instrumental analysis. Their conclusion was that

"omitted quality variables bias the union effect upwards and the 'old—style'

cross section estimates are of the right order of magnitude after all."

H. Gregg Lewis, (1983) in an evaluation of the effect of measurement error on

union wages estimates, has also reached a conclusion similar to mine.


Dispersion of Wages

      The proposition that trade union wage policies are designed to reduce ine-

quality of wages within firms and across firms for workers doing similar work

has a long history in labor economics, stretching back to the Webbs. Numerous

cross—section comparisons of wage inequality have found that inequality is less

in union than in nonunion settings (see, e.g., Hyclak 1977, 1979; Freeman 1980,

1982; Hirsch 1982; Plotnick 1982). Standard wage regressions provide corro-

borating evidence, showing that for the most part the impact of most wage-

determining variables is smaller on the wages of union than on the wages of

nonunion workers. The magnitude of the estimated union impact is sufficiently

sizable to suggest that, despite the increase in dispersion due to union mono-

poly wage effects, unionism reduces overall inequality of wages.

       Do comparisons of dispersions of wages in a longitudinal framework con—
                                          26




firm   the cross—section results? How much smaller, if at all, is the eotimated

union effect on dispersion?

         To answer these questions I have tabulated the standard deviation of the

log of earnings for workers by their change in union status in the four data

sets referred to earlier. The resulting calculations are given in Table 7,

which follows the same format as Table 6. As can be seen, the longitudinal

calculations confirm the cross—section finding of lower wage dispersion under

unionism. Dispersion tends to fall when workers join unions and decline when

they leave, confirming the reduction in dispersion under unionism. There are,

however, notable differences in the magnitude and consistency of the effects by

groups, the NU — NN and (NU — UN)/2 comparisons showing larger union effects

than UU — UN comparisons and with the PSID and QES showing more variable results

than the other samples. To compare the longitudinal estimates to cross—section

estimates, I have made some crude calculations of what a full cross-section ana-

lysis (which involves correcting observed differences in variances by observed

differences in characteristics) might yield by reducing the difference in stan-

dard deviations between UU and NN workers in the before and after data by 30%, a

figure consistent with a full analysis of May 1973-75 CPS data (Freeman 1980,

Table 4). Without the adjustment the impact of unionism on dispersion estimated

with the longitudinal data is much smaller than the impact estimated with the

cross—section data. With the adjustment, the longitudinal estimate is still

noticeably smaller, by magnitudes comparable to those obtained in Table 6 for

wages.

         Finally, note that comparisons of the levels of the standard deviations

among groups tell a stronger story than did the comparison of the levels of

wages.8 In the before data, workers who leave unions have larger dispersions

than those who stay, and workers who join unions have larger dispersions than
nonunion workers who remain nonunion. In the after data, workers joining unions

have greater dispersion than workers who were always union members while workers

leaving unions have less dispersion than workers who remain nonunion. While

these patterns could be due to factors other than error in measuring union mem-

bership, they are consistent with a pure measurement error interpretation.

      I conclude that, as with wages, the impact of unions on dispersion found

in cross—section studies is confirmed in a longitudinal analysis and that the

magnitude of the effect is commensurably lower, at least partly as a result of

error in measuring union status.


Fringe Benefits

      The third cross-section finding which I examine with longitudinal data in

this paper is the finding that unionism increases the fringe component of com-

pensation, particularly those fringe benefits that are most desired by older

workers, such as pensions (for studies of fringe benefits, see Duncan 1976;

Goldstein and Pauly 1976; Donsimoni 1978; Soinick 1978; Leigh 1980; ViSCUSI

1980; Freeman 1981, 1983). As the QES is the only data set which provides

fringe benefit figures over time, my longitudinal analysis is limited to that

data set. I consider two measures of fringes, the number of fringes reported by

workers and the proportion with pensions.

      Table 8 presents the results of a longitudinal analysis for these two

variables, again following the Table 6 format. While changes in the list of

fringes in the surveys causes the number of fringes reported for the majority of

workers to fall, the evidence shows that workers who went from nonunion to union

gained fringes, while those going from union to nonunion lost relative to those

who remained union. The implied union effects are all positive, with, however,

considerable difference in magnitude. The NIJ — NN estimate, in particular,

greatly exceeds TIN — UU.   The pension coverage figures show a similar pattern,

with a sizeable increase in the proportion with pensions for workers joining

unions but no real change for those leaving unions. Comparisons of the longitu-

dinal with the cross—section estimates show no difference for number of fringes

but the usual diminution of the union effect for provision of pensions.9

Finally, note that the pattern of differences in levels of fringes is similar to

that found in dispersion for comparisons of UN's or NV's or UU's but is mixed in

comparisons of changes with NN's.

      Taking the results of Tables 6—8 as a whole, a reasonable generalization

is that longitudinal analyses confirm the qualitative findings of cross-

sectional analyses, with, however, smaller estimated union effects, possibly due

in large part to the greater impact of errors of measurement on longitudinal

than on cross—section statistics.


IV. Bounding the True Impact?

      If, as researchers usually assume, there is a substantial selectivity

problem in cross—section analysis, which doniinate.s any problems of measurement

error, then cross—section estimates of union effects overstate true union

effects. The preceding sections show that if there is a substantial measurement

error problem in longitudinal analysis, and if there is no countervailing

problem of selectivity of changers, then longitudinal estimates of union effects

understate true union effects. When both of these statements are true, we have

an important "bounding" result:

      Theorem: Under reasonable assumptions about the impact of measurement
error and of selectivity of persons into unions, cross—section estimite$ of

union effects provide an upper bound and longitudinal estimates provide a lower

bound on the "true" union impact in the model under study.

        To prove the theorem, it is necessary to show that (a) measurement error

biases longitudinal estimates downward to a greater extent than it does cross—

section estimates, which is done in Section II; (b) selectivity of unionists in a

cross—section biases cross—section estimates upward more than measurement error

biases those estimates downward, which I shall assume on the basis of the modest

estimated effect of measurement error in the cross—section; and (c) selectivity

of who changes union status in longitudinal data either biases longitudinal

estimates downward or biases them upward by less than measurement error biases

them downward.

         In this section I consider proposition (c).   I examine the likely impact

of selectivity in who changes union status on longitudinal estimates of union

effects. I shall argue that under plausible modesl of the economics of

unionism, selectivity of changers biases longitudinal estimates of union effects

downward, reinforcing rather than weakening or offsetting the effects of

measurement error. Hence, as long as (b) holds, the bounding theorem will be

valid.


Modelling Selectivity

         There are two types of selectivity involved in who becomes union or

nonunion: workers' choice of working union (nonunion) jobs and employers'

choice of workers. I model selectivity on the part of workers, then examine how

the analysis changes when employers select workers from the queue desiring union

jobs.

where d is the union effect and the remaining components reflect selectivity of
                                                            =         and that there is a true union
changers. Assume, for simplicity, that

effect d > 0. Then the selectivity bias is negative since

       f[(K -   d)/a]/[1         -   F()]      < [(K +    d)/a]/[1             -   f   ()] because k +    d > k -     d.

If, as is plausible given our findings on dispersion, a <a, the negative bias

is enhanced. If, by contrast, d = 0, and                         =
                                                                      aN   ,       selectivity   has —-   logically
enough -- no such bias effect.1°

      In this model if there is a union effect, the selectivity of changers

biases longitudinal estimates of that effect downward. Even if there is not, we

have established that selectivity on the part of workers does not bias upward

the longitudinal estimate and thus cannot offset the predicted downward bias

from measurement error.

      What about selectivity by employers?

      Rather than providing a detailed analysis of this question (which involves

complex double integrals), let us simply evaluate the qualitative impact of such

selectivity on our previous results. Since only union firms have a queue of

workers outside their plants, I assume that the only firm selectivity is selec-

tion of workers into union jobs. Firms will choose to hire workers with low

ds —— that is, those for whom the true union                         effect        is smallest (with a fixed

union wage effect, this involves picking workers with the highest productivity

—— and try to displace those with high d3s.

      With respect to workers who join unions, employer selectivity will augment

the downward bias in the longitudinal estimate. This is because firms will be
                                            '1




selecting    lower values of dNUj from the sample of workers for whom drUj >

K +      —          This   will reduce the inverse Mills ratio component of (23).

      With respect to workers who leave union jobs, the easiest assumption is

that because of seniority rules, firms have no selectivity, leaving (24) as is.

If firms are able to select who leaves, however, there is an additional negative

bias component to (24), so that we can no longer sign the net effect of selec-

tivity in (25). For the bias in (25) to remain negative, it is necessary that

the effect of firm selectivity on who joins a union dominate the effect of firm

selectivity on who leaves. This is plausible given that firms are free to hire

whom they want but not to fire or lay off.

      All told, our analysis of selectivity in who changes union status suggests

that, under reasonable selection criteria but simplified statistical assump-

tions, the longitudinal estimates of union effects will be biased downward,

establishing the bounding theorem.


Conclusion

      In this paper I have tried to show that measurement error is a significant

problem in analysis of longitudinal data. I have developed some models of

measurement error, examined numerical examples, and estimated the impact of

measurement error in four data sets. My analysis has not been complete. I gave

only cursory treatment to issues of the correlation between the random component

of measurement error and control variables and ignored completely the potential

impact of standard exclusion rules (such as requiring positive wages and sen-

sible values of explanatory variables) on longitudinal as opposed to cross—

section analyses. These errors of omission aside, the analysis suggests that

longitudinal anlysis is not the research panacea it is sometimes seen to be.

                                                        estimates of union
While omitted fixed effects bias upward cross—section

effects, measurement error and possibly selectivity of changers bias downward

longitudinal estimates. Under reasonable conditions, the two sets of estimates

bound the true impact of unionism, snd thus should be viewed as complementary

research tools. While neither is likely to yield the true parameter, together

they enable us to estimate the magnitude of the effects of unionism, which

appear to be quite substantial in empirical work.

       1The assumption that equal numbers of workers are misclassified implies
that the observed proportion union is an unbiased estimate of the true propor-
tion. It is a useful simplifying assumption that appears consistent with actual
measurement error (see Table 3) but is not critical to the numeric example or to
the ensuing statistical analysis.

       But simplifying we obtain (r+ rN)r2 > 0, which proves the inequality.

       41n the January survey there are two reported wages: one from the indi-

viduals, the other from employers. I have used the wage reported by the indivl—

duals in this analysis.

       5Speoifically, the formulas with changes in the value of U between the

periods are (Marquis et al. 1981, p. 101):


       E(Mu) r(_U) +                (1 — rU -         rN) Tmj +            and

                                                                           2ô
       6The measurement of wages varies across the data sets. In the CPS I

measure wages by the ratio of usual weekly earnings to usual weekly hours; in
                                               37




the PSID, I use average hourly wages; in the NLS, I use the reported hourly

rate; while in the QES wages are annual earnings from work divided by hours

worked times 52.

         71n regression analyses which impose N1J = UN, the coefficient is a

weighted average dependent on relative numbers changing status. The reader can

readily calculate weighted averages for contrast, if desired.

            full   analysis of the effect of measurement error or dispersion differs
                                                                                format,
somewhat from that of analysis of measurement error in the regression
but the qualitative effects of error are the same.

         9The cross—section regression for number of fringes is based on

regressions using 635 persons with 10 occupation, 6 industry, tenure, tenure

squared, education, race, sex, years of schooling, and marital status controls.

The regression for proportion with pensions is based on the same sample and

model.
          101 have benefited immensely from the comments of John Abowd in this sec-

tion. The statistical analysis which follows relies extensively on John Abowd

(1983).
          We can also compare the bias in the NU —         NN   and UU — UN estimates.

Following the analysis in the text, we find that the mean for NN is


           (f[(K -   )/a]/{1 - F[K -
so that the mean for N1J -     NN =    + {[(a       +   - 02/o*]f},   (1-F),


which is less than d when         +        <    which is likely since the dispersion of


 of wages is   less    than the dispersion of   nonunion wages. Hence, here too we have

 an   underestimate.
          12That is, a reasonable specification is d —Xa3, where a3 is our

 ability indicator with E(a )         0.
