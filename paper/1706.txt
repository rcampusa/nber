                     the Early Nineteenth Century:
                      Evidence from the Lives of

                                 ABSTRACT




       Much recent research has focussed on some decisions that affected

family composition in the past, including the determination of the age of

marriage and the timing of fertility. This paper considers another such

decision that has been relatively neglected, the determination of the age at

which children left the parental home. Observations drawn from a collection

of biographies of successful New England manufacturers, most of whom depart-

ed from their parents' homes in the first half of the nineteenth century,

indicated that their age of departure was concentrated In the late teen ages

and early twenties, with a median of 18 years. Multivariate analysis sug-

gested that the age at which these men had left home varied directly with

family income or wealth and inversely with the opportunity cost of their

retention at home. Sons whose fathers had died tended to leave home earlier

than otherwise, as did those whose first job away from home was in the

employ of a relative, while those whose families invested more in their

formal education appear to have stayed home longer.

           Recent years have witnessed an intensification of Interest in re-

 search on family behavior. Economists have increasingly turned their atten-

 tion to analysis of the determinants and consequences of family decisions,

 and historians have become more concerned with charting trends in the com-

 position and behavior of families in the past. Considerable attention has

 been devoted to some key decisions in the life—cycle of individuals that

 affect the family, including the determination of the age at marriage and

 the timing of fertility. Another such decision that has been recognized but

 has received relatively little direct attention is that of when children

 departed from the parental home.1

           Departure from the parents' home is of course only one of the transi-

 tions that resulted in a child's eventual independence from the parents; the

family economy would be affected not only by the child's place of' residence,

but also by any flows of income that continued from parents to child.2 Yet

the residential cecision is an interesting one for a number of reasons, with

implications for migration as well as family composition. This paper will

extend our knowledge of this aspect of the history of family behavior by

suggesting an analytical approach to the determination of the age at leaving

home and adducing empirical evidence on this decision for a sample of

individuals from nineteenth—century New England.



II. An Economic Interpretation of'      the   Age at Leaving Home

          The age   at leaving home can be seen as    one outcome of an implicit
process    of orajnins    irn    family memsers that determines     the   allocation   of
the    family's resources.      As a first approach, it might be posited as a
working hypothesis that within the relevant range of children's ages, both
parents and children derive utility from the continuing presence of the

children in the parental hcrne, end that this     retentIOn   is a normal gooa.

Increases in total family income would therefore tend to be associatec with

increases in the age at which children leave their parents' households.

       Economic analysis of family behavior has recently ceveloped a number

of implications of the fact that parents must determine not only how many

children they will have, but also the amount of resources they will devote

to each child. One analytical approach to this decision has been a formula-

tion in which parents derive utility from the quality, as well as the

quantity, of their children. This view assumes that the quality of a child

can be influenced by the family in a number of ways, principally through

investment in the child's health and education.    An economic interpretation

of the age at which children leave home can be based in part on this

formulation. In part, the amount of time a child spends in the parental

home will serve as an index of investment in the child's quality, with a

later age at leaving home indicating a larger investment. This was
particularly true in the past, when sending children away to school was

relatively uncommon; until quite recently, most children were likely tO

attend school only if they were living with their parents.3 In addition to

 formal education, nlneteenthcentUrY parents coula choose to teach their

 children a variety of occupational skills. Still other investments in

 children retained at home might have been significant, for parents could be

 expected to maintain more control over other aspects of their ctailOrefl's

 lives if the children continued to live in the parental none than if they

 had moved away.

        In the presence of any of these forms of investment by parents in

 their children, the length of time a child spent in the parental home would
                                        3


  tend to be a useful index of the
                                     quality of the child, with a later age of

  departure signalling a longer period, and generally a greater amount, of

  investment. The higher the rates of return to these investments in the

 children's human capital, the stronger the association would tend to be

 between family wealth and the length of time the child spent at home, for

 poorer families would lack the capital to finance
                                                     desirable investments in
 the education of their children.5

        Yet the age at leaving home in the nineteenth century cannot be

 interpreted solely in this way, for another set of forces also affected the

 timing of the child's departure from home. The premise that retention of a

 child at home is a normal good for both parents and children also implies

 that an increase in family income due to the ability of the child to con-

 tribute while remaining at home would tend to result in a later age for the

 child's departure. Therefore if employment opportunities existed near the

parents' home, the child might take a job and begin earning wages while

remaining at home, thus allowing some families to be able to afford to
retain their children that might otherwise have been unable to do so. Work

within a family business, or on a family farm, would of course constitute

such an employment opportunity just as much as would wage labor elsewhere;

families with businesses or farms large enough to employ the labor of

workers ir addition to the parents could substitute their children for hired

laborers, thereby gaining income from this employment that would allow the

family to retain its children at home longer.6

      Relatives outside the nuclear family also affected the age at which

children left home in the past. Grandparents or aunts and uncles played an

important role when the death of a father left a widow unable economically

to provide a home for the children. Even in cases in which both parents
                                       14




survived, extended families were a potential source of employment or

economic help at an early stage of a child's career, and a move to the

household of a relative might be seen as a special case of departure from

home, in which the resources of the extended family provided a way for the

child   to leave the parental home but to retain in some degree the economic
security of residence with adults likely to have some altruistic interest in
his   welfare.

         One way to place the preceding discussion within a unified framework

is to consider the child's departure from home as a migration decision. A

behavioral assumption underlying a standard economic analysis of migration

is that an individual moves in order to maximize net personal gain, with the
                                                   the present value of future
latter often represented in empirical studies by

real income. An extension of this approach to the migration of families

composed of husbands and wives has assumed that the movement of households

is motivated by net family gain rather than the net personal gain of either

spouse. Choices of location made by couples create the possibility of

positive costs for either or both individuals, in the form of a real income

less than that which would be available to the same individual unencumbered

 by the family relationship. These costs are borne by the family as long as

 the benefits from marriage are greater than the pecuniary losses; otherwise

 the husband and wife separate, and independent migration of the individuals
         7


         This analysis of the migration decisions of spouses can be extended
 to include those of children. The assumed behavioral motivation of' the

 maximization of net family gain can be maintained, and the costs to children

 of the family's location can be measured as the difference between the
                                         5



 income available to the child at tne family's chosen location and the max!—

 mum income available to the child elsewhere. Positive levels of earnings

 foregone by the chile due to remaining with his or her parents do not neces-

 sarily imply the child's departure, for these losses might be compensated by

 some combination of the child's nonpecuniary gains from residence with the

 family and income transfers from other family members.

           In this formulation, investment by the family in the education of a

 child living at home is a benefit to the child which, ceteris paribus,

 lowers the net gains to leaving the family during the period in which

 investment continues. The availability of work in a family business, or in

 a business near the family home, will similarly tend to lower the net income

gains from leaving the family. On the other hand, the better the
opportunities available elsewhere, the greater the potential gains to the

child from leaving the family. The ability of relatives living elsewhere to

offer jobs to the child creates one case in which good opportunities might

be available to the child at a relatively early age, because of the possible

willingness of relatives to discriminate in hiring in favor of family
members.

       Changes in the composition of the family can clearly affect the

family's choice of' location. A relatively common instance in the past might

have been the death of a parent. In the case of a husband's death, a wife

who did not remarry might often have had to sell the family farm or business

and move elsewhere to find employment; her new location might then be less

desirable for the children, resulting in their departure from home.8 The

father's death would of course not invariably have caused the family to

relocate, for even if the wife did not remarry, she might have continued to

operate the family business with the help of her children or hired labor.
                                       6



Indeed in some cases the absence of the father could have increased the

productivity of a child on the family fa'rn or business, and could therefore

have delayed the child's departure from home.

         The migration framework offers a relatively straightforward explana-

tion of when, and why, children leave home. Apart from time spent in con-

sumption, the time of children can broadly be divided into that devoted to

investment in human capital and that spent in production. The relative

amounts of time spent in these two activities are influenced by family

wealth, as well as such other factors as the quality of local educational

and work opportunities. The typical pattern is for the child's time to be

spent relatively more in investment at young ages and tnen, at varying

rates, to shift progressively toward production as the child grows older.

Manytypes of investment can be done at lower cost while the child is at
home, and this was probably true to an even greater extent in the past than
today.     Under such conditions, the larger the share of the child's time

spent in investment, the greater the cost advantages from residence with the

family, and the more likely the child would be to remain with his parents.

The same is not true for time spent in production. Productivity in most

occupations    varies considerably across space, due to differences in local
factor endowments and past investment      patterns.   If   the location of a

child's family is not that in which his productivity in his chosen

occupation is greatest, the cost in earnings foregone due to remaining with

his parents will rise as the child shifts a larger share of his time into

production. He will leave home when this cost becomes larger than the total

benefits of remaining, with the latter comprised of nonpecuniary benefits as

well as investment and other income transfers from the family.

 III. The Van Slyck Sample

          Relatively little is known about the age at which children typically

 left home at most times and places in the past. In part this is due to a
 lack of sources that yield quantitative information, for the departure of a
 child from home did not attract the attention from such institutions as the
 state or the church that was afforded to such other events in the experience

 of families as marriages, births, and deaths. This investigation will rely

 on an unusual source of evidence that provides direct observation of the age

 at leaving home and a number of possible influences on it for a limited but

 interesting sample of individuals.

          In 1879, a Bostonian named J.D. Van Slyck published a two—volume work

entitled New England Manufacturers and Manufactories.9 In a brief introduc-

tion, the author criticized the neglect of the histories of "the great

manufactorjes of New England, showing the rise, the marvelous growth, the

products of each," and argued that the success of these        industrial   enter-

prises was due so largely to individual enterprise that "to withhold from

their histories the personal lives of those who planted and fostered them,

would be little more than to exhibit the form without the spirit." Van

Slyck   undertook to remedy this neglect by writing short histories of the
leading   manufacturing firms of New England, including in   them what he called
"life—sketches"    of their founders or current chief executives. The capsule

biographies included in his two volumes provide the evidence for this

investigation.

        Van Slyck did not describe how the information for   these biographies
was gathered, commenting only that "no effort or expense has been spared to

make this a work of real value." The detail and accuracy of the biographi-

cal sketches support Joseph Kett's judgment that these were normally based

                                                                orientation
on autobiographical data submitted by the subjects. The factual
of the biographies is also consistent with Van Slyck'S stated intention to
                                                          . . avoiding much
restrict himself to "simple, concise and true narrative
                                                        .




use of that eulogistic 'ornamentation' so often degraded to fulsomeness."

       The format of the biographies is not
                                              standard, and the amount of

information varies considerably across individuals. Yet sufficient
information was available on a number of potentially
                                                       important variables to

allow their inclusion in the data set analyzed here. A full listing of

definitions of the variables included ann a description of the practices
                                           the appendix. The age of the in-
followed in coding them is provided in

dividual upon leaving home can be obtained from most of the biographies,

from either direct statements or indirect inferences. Most biographies

provide information on the occupations of the subject's fathers, and many

devote close attention to the early education and work experience of the

 future manufacturers.
                                                the variables coded in this
        Table 1 presents the sample means of

 investigation, and indicates the number of biographies containing

 information on each variable. The mean date of birth was 1815; nearly nine—
                                                    homes during the first half
 tenths of the sample members left their parental

 of the nineteenth century.

        The mean age at leaving home for 233 sample members was 18 years.

 Table 2, which presents the full distribution of this variable, shows that

 18 was also the median age. Sample members began leaving home in
 significant numbers around the age of 10, and the pace accelerated sharply

 in the early teens: whereas less than 5 percent had left home before the age

 of 10, and less than 10 percent by age 12, more than a quarter had left by

 the age of 16. Half the sample members had left home by 18, and more than

 80 percent had left by the age of majority. Nearly 95 percent had left by

 the age of 25, and virtually all had left by the age of 30.

        Most of the sample members' fathers (90 percent) were still alive

 when their sons left home. Nearly two—thirds of the sample members had

 worked for their fathers sometime before leaving home. Just over a quarter

 of all sample members had worked locally outside the family before leaving

 home. One in ten first worked for relatives after leaving home, 12 percent

 attended boarding school and returned to their families sometime before

their final departure from home, and one in ten attended school immediately

after leaving home and did not subsequently return home.

       There was no immediate link for most sample members between departure

from home and marriage. The mean age at marriage for 87 sample members for

whom this information is available was 26.2 years, more than eight years

greater than the sample mean age at leaving home.11 Information on both age

at leaving home and age at marriage is available for 72 sample members: the

mean interval between these events for those individuals was more than nine

years. Only eight of the 72 (11 percent) married in the same year they left

home, while 80 percent of them waited at least four years to marry, and half

married fully nine or more years after leaving home.

       The distribution of fathers' occupations provides one opportunity to

compare the sample to larger contemporary populations. Only 49 percent of

the sample members were sons of farmers. In contrast, as late as 1830 more

than 70 percent of the American labor force remained in agriculture. Two—

fifths of the sample members were sons of men who earned their living ex-

clusively in manufacturing activities, whereas Stanley Lebergott estimated

that in 1840 less than 10 percent of the national labor force was engaged in

manufacturing.12 Since Van Slyck's sample was composed of successful
                                          10



facturers, it is hardy     surprising   that sons of manufacturers are dispropor

tionately represented in it, or that sons of farmers are underrepresented.

        Yet   in view of the existence of major regional differences in the
distribution     of economic activity in the early nineteenth century, a con-

centration of manufacturers in a sample of New England residents might also

appear unsurprising. In fact, estimates of the sectoral distribution of

occupations in nineteenth—century Massachusetts suggest that the members of

Van Slyck's sample might have come from backgrounds not far from a repre-

sentative sample in this respect. Mans VinovskiS estimated that the share

of Massachusetts' labor force in agriculture fell from 58 percent in 1820 to

42 percent in 18140, while manufacturing accounted for 30 percent in 1820 and

141 percent in 18140.13 The fathers of Van Slyck's sample members appear to

have been somewhat more heavily concentrated in manufacturing, with 140

percent identified exclusively as in that sector and a total of 52 percent

mentioned     as having some connection, and less oriented toward agriculture,
with 33   percent    exclusively   in the sector and 149   percent   engaged at least

part—time. Yet depending on how the fathers described as engaged in more

than one activity in the biographies would have been categorized by the

federal census, the real differences in the distribution of activities

between the fathers of sample members and the working population of

Massachusetts     at the time might actually have been quite small. The occupa-

tions mentioned by Van Slyck can of course tell us         nothing   of the wealth or

other   important characteristics of these families relative to the general

population, but it is of interest to know tnat the sample members might have

come from families distributed among economic activities in proportions

similar to the general population of the region where they lived.

        Pending further research on the age at leaving home among other

 groups, little can be said of the representativeness of the experiences of

 the members of this sample. While the members of Van Slyck's sample might

 have come from backgrounds similar to those of many of their peers, their

 inclusion in his survey was premised on considerable eventual economic suc-

 cess, and therefore their actions cannot simply be assumed to have resembled

 those of other youths of their time. Van Slyck's sample furthermore con-

 tains only men; parallel information for women would be of obvious interest.

 For these reasons, the results presented below can be interpreted Only as

 statements about the behavior of the sample members; they might also be seen

as a source of hypotheses to be tested when the analysis of other data

allows comparisons with other groups.



IV. Regression Results

       Table 3 presents the results obtained from estimation of a regression

equation in which the age at leaving home was specified as a linear function

of a number of independent variables on which information was available in

the biographies, and which the analysis outlined above suggested might be

relevant to the cetermination of the age at leaving home.1 Overall, the

explanatory variables account for one third of the variance in the age at

leaving home, and their joint effect is highly significantly related to the

dependent variable.

       A number of the independent variables individually appear to have had

a major impact on the age at leaving home. Sons with living fathers

remained at home 2 years longer on average than those sample members alike

in other respects whose fathers had died prior to the sons' departure from

home. That the plight of nineteenth—century children whose fathers died was

  a sorry one, likely to throw them prematurely upon the mercy of the cold

 world outside their homes, would come as no surprise to readers of Charles

 Dickens; the result obtained here appears to indicate that for those in the

 sample the father's death tended to break up the residential unit of the

 family.15

        The effect of the son's employment by the father prior to the son's

 departure from home is positive and highly significant statistically, in-

 dicating that sons who worked for their fathers remained home an average of

 more than four years longer than those who did not. It should be noted that

 the negative coefficient associated with a father in agriculture cancels

 most of this effect, however, so that a large net impact is present only for

 Sons of fathers in the other two sectors (3.!! years for fathers in the

 service sector, and !!.3 for fathers in manufacturing). The direction and

large size of the effect of home employment for Sons of fathers employed in

the nonagricultural sectors are consistent with several effects noted in the

discussion earlier in this paper. First, the son's employment by the father

could have raised the family's income sufficiently to enable the son to re-

main at home considerably longer than he would have in the absence of this

employment. Second, a son's employment by his father might in many cases

have contained a large training component. This variable would then mdi—

cate continuing investment by the family in the child, raising the ad—

vantages to him of remaining at home. This is also consistent with the

differential estimated effects of the fathers' occupational categories, for

the men in this sample who grew up on farms left their parents considerably

earlier than sons of fathers employed in the other sectors; a son growing up

on a farm in nineteenth—century New England would have had to leave home to

gain access to the training and work experience that would help make him a
                                      13


successful   manufacturer. A third possible source of the effect is that the

ability of the father to offer the son a job could have been positively

correlated with the father's wealth. Fathers with larger businesses might

have   been better able to offer employment to their sons, and consequently
this   variable might serve in part to identify wealthier families. The

higher mean age of their Sons at leaving home would then be consistent with

the view that the retention of children at home is a normal good, with age

at leaving home positively related to family wealth.16 Although the impact

of each of these effects cannot be identified from the evidence available

here, they are not mutually exclusive.

         Another variable with a large positive impact on the age at leaving

home is that of the child being employed locally but outside the family

prior to leaving home. Sons who had held such jobs left home on average

more than 2 years later than those who had not. That children who found

local employment tended to remain at home longer than those who didn't

points to the probable importance of the contribution of the child to the

family's income as a factor in keeping the child at home.

         Sample members whose first job away from home was in the employ of a

relative left home an average of more than 2 years earlier than others.

This is consistent with the presence of some nepotism in hiring practices,

as employers might have been willing to offer jobs to relatives at younger

ages than to other workers. For some youths the extended family therefore

provided employment, and often also a place of residence, that constituted a

status intermediate between living at home and independence as an adult.

Not surprisingly, this was much more likely for children whose fathers had

 died, as 29 percent of those whose fathers had died prior to the son's

 departure from home found their initial employment away from home with a
                                       14


relative,   compared to only 9 percent of those whose fathers were living when

the son left home.17 The extended family therefore appears to have provided

insurance to a significant extent. Yet the large estimated effect of

initial employment by a relative on the age at leaving home does not derive

primarily from cases in which sons moved to the care of relatives after the

deaths of their fathers. This is apparent from Table I, which presents the

results for a similar regression estimated for the subsample of individuals

who left home before the deaths of their fathers. The estimated coeffi-

cients for nearly all the variables remain similar to those of Table 3; of

particular interest here is that the coefficient obtained for the effect of

employment by a relative upon first leaving home indicates that on average

this was associated with a departure from home of still more than two years

earlier than otherwise. The economic effect of the extended family was

therefore not limited to cases in which sons were forced to leave home by

the deaths of their fathers.1

       Sample members who attended boarding schools at some time before

leaving home eventually left home an average of nearly two years later than

others, while those whose first move away from home was to attend school did

not leave home at an age significantly different from others. There is

abundant evidence that basic education in the early nineteenth century was

commonly obtained by youths in the time they spared from work. Van Slyck's

biographies frequently include such statements as: "His father was a

blacksmith, and Charles was, in early life, called upon to assist him in the

shop, meanwhile attending school at irregular intervals," and: "His father

was a small farmer, and Loring assisted him on the farm, attending school,

meanwhile, a few months in the winter."19 Yet at a time when schooling was

typically obtained locally at minimal cost in terms of both cash

expenditures and time costs, those families that did go to the expense of

sending their sons away to academies or colleges for formal education were

probably members of the wealthier segment of society; while some of the

biographies mention attendance only at small schools near home, a number of

the subjects attended such schools as the academies at Andover and

Worcester, and such colleges as Brown, Dartmouth, Harvard, Princeton, and

Yale. That attendance at boarding schools tended to increase the age at

leaving home for some might therefore point to one way in which greater

family wealth caused a later departure from home.

       Several other independent variables yield insignificant and generally

small coefficients. The lack of effect of apprenticeship on the age at

leaving home might be due to the increasing informality of that institution

in the nineteenth century, as a number of sample members served terms of

only two or three years rather than the traditional seven; these shorter

periods of training apparently did not significantly disrupt the timing of

the child's departure from home.2° The year of birth of the subjects,

included to check for a possible secular trend in the age at leaving home,

does not indicate the presence of significant change over time.21



V. Conclusion

      Knowing when children departed from their parental homes in the past,

and what variables influenced the timing of this departure, is important to

historians and economists for a number of reasons. This paper has focused

on the departure from home from an interest in understanding when and why

individuals became independent actors in determining their own geographic

mobility. The paper first suggested some elements of an economic approach

to the determination of the age at leaving home. A data set drawn from
                                       16


short biographies of New England manufacturers collected in the mid—nine-

teenth century was then used to provide information both on the typical age

at which those in the sample left their parental homes and on some economic

and demographic correlates of this age.

         The empirical results obtained from this sample do appear to suggest

a coherent view of the process by which children left home in the early

nineteenth century. The age of departure was concentrated in the late teen

ages and early twenties, as the sample median age was 18 years, and four—

fifths of those in the sample left home between the ages of H and 2'4.

Those with living fathers, and those who worked prior to leaving home,

tended to remain at home longer than others; those whose first jobs outside

the home were in the employ of relatives tended to depart earlier. These

effects appear to be consistent with an economic analysis in which the

family's retention of its children within the relevant range of ages is

considered as a normal good; although measures of family wealth or income

are not available in the data set analyzed here, the most important van-

ables in the empirical results appear to represent potentially significant

influences on either family income or the opportunity cost of the child's

retention at home.

         It should of course be recognized that the results obtained here

cannot eliminate some other possible interpretations of the relationships
observed in the sample. Yet they do cast doubt on some. For example, it
might plausibly be argued that a number of the effects that appear in Tables
3 and I were consequences, rather than determinants, of the length of a

child's stay at home; thus perhaps the longer children remained at home, the

greater the likelihood that they would work locally, either for their

parents or others, and the more likely they would be to attend boarding
                                       17



 school before finally leaving their families. Yet children who stayed home

 longer would also have been more likely to depart after the deaths of their

 fathers. That Table 3 shows the opposite to have been the case suggests

 that the correlations observed here are not simply the consequences of

 differences in the duration of children's residence with their parents, but

 do point to some underlying economic influences on those durations.

       As noted earlier, the degree to which results from this sample can be

generalized to other groups remains to be determined by future research.

One interesting piece of comparative evidence can be offered here. The

distribution of the age at leaving home for the sons of farm families in two

rural New York counties in the early twentieth century is presented in Table

5. The New York distribution has a considerably higher central tendency

than that shown in Table 2 for the Van Slyck sample, with its median age of

21 three years greater than the median age of 18 found for the earlier

sample. The later distribution is also more skewed toward higher ages, as

more than a quarter of the New Yorkers had not left home by the age of 30,

compared to less than 1 percent of Van Slyck's subjects.22 These contrasts

are intriguing, for they not only call attention to the possibility that the

New England manufacturers left home on average earlier than others, but they

also serve to point out that the industrialists may have been unusual in

that all had left home by early adulthood.

      The considerable differences between these samples in time and place

make it unwise to place much weight on this comparison. Yet the men who

pioneered the American industrial revolution may in fact have differed from

their less successful contemporaries as much in their early migration and

labor market experiences as in their later careers. More research on the

        11n his recent survey of family history, Michael Anderson commented

that "leaving home to go into service, setting up in lodgings, living with

kin, and continuing to live at home with parents can be seen as alternatives

f or young people in the early stages of the life cycle. One of the problems

for future research is to try to discern who 'chose' which option and why;"

children by their fathers for formal education in nineteenthceflturY

between children's school attendance and family wealth or income, see Soltow

and Stevens, The Rise of Literacy and the Common School in the United

1890," Social Science History, Vol. 9, No. 2 (Spring 1985), pp. 12343.

        6This discussion assumes that the earnings of a child living at home

will be spent in the same way as other family income. This assumption

appears consistent with the nature of the ineteenthcefltUry family; thus
                                                      families, that "in the
Joseph Kett stated, concerning nineteenth—century
quasi—contractual relationship between father and sons, the obligation to

work lay heavily on the son;" Rites of Passage: Adolescence fl America, 1790

to the Present (New York: Basic Books, 1977), p. 29. In some cases the

wages of children employed outside the family were paid directly to the

parents; the biography of Philip Corbin, one of the subjects of this

 investigation, notes that "From the age of fifteen tO      that   of nineteen

 years, he was employed in farm—labor away from home, performing the full

 work of a man, and earning a man's wages, which were, however, received by

 his father;" J.D. Van Slyck, New England Manufacturers and Manufactories

 (Boston: Van Slyck and Company, 1879), Vol. 1, p. 187. Different

 assumptions about the control and expenditure of children's income are of

 course possible, not only for the period during which the child remained at
                                        22


  home, but also for that after his departure;
                                                 indeed, the passage just quoted
  is ambiguous on the question of where Corbin was actually living during the

 period in which his wages were being paid out to his father.

 analysis to children.

         8The definition employed here, as in the balance of this paper. is

 that the child's parental home is that of the surviving parent if either

 parent dies before the child's departure from his parents.

 some cases Van Slyck mentions the use of journals or other memoirs provided

by the subjects of biographies. Some of the subjects were dead at the time

Van Slyck wrote, and in these cases his information appears to have come

from a variety of sources, including relatives, business associates, and

papers of the subjects.

         Van Slyck's compilations appear to have been quite accurate. Of

the first 73 principal subjects named in the Table of Contents to Volume I,

22 are listed in the Dictionary of American Biography (New York: Charles

Scribrier's Sons, 1928). In all 22 cases, the month and year of birth are

the same in both sources. The same is true for date of death for nine of

the ten cases of subjects who had died prior to the publication of Van

Slyck's books; in one case the date of death differed by two years. The

state named as the place of the subject's birth was the same in both sources

in all cases.

       Sample members appear to have married at ages similar on average to

those of other men in New England at the time. The average age at first

marriage for Massachusetts males was 26 years in the middle of the

nineteenth century; Mans A. Vinovskis, Fertility in Massachusetts from the

Revolution to the Civil War (New York: Academic Press, 1981), pp. 148—19.

       13Vinovskis, Fertility in Massachusetts from the Revolution to the

Civil war, Table E.8, p. 220. It should be emphasized that virtually all of

the fathers of sample members described here as manufacturers were in fact

engaged in artisanal crafts on a small scale.

              second version of the same equation was estimated, for which ages

at leaving home greater than 21 were recoded and set equal to 21.             The

motivation for this lies in the interest of this investigation in the age of

independence of the child for purposes of determining such actions as

migration; it might be argued that a child who remained in the parental home

past majority had nonetheless probably become independent of his parents in

this respect, and remained in the parental home for different reasons, and

with different implications, than did younger children. Limiting the

dependent variable to a maximum of 21 allows a comparison of the results to

the unrestricted version, reported in Table 3, to check whether the behavior

of those children who did remain with their parents after reaching majority

significantly affected the results obtained here. The two versions of the

equation estimated produce results that are the same qualitatively, with a
                                         24


  general tendency for the absolute magnitudes of coefficients to be somewhat

  larger in the first, unrestricted version. The differences in magnitude are

  not great, however, and no separate discussion
                                                   appears necessary.
         151f each of the two effects of the father's death hypothesized
                                                                         had
 been present in a significant number of
                                              cases, the net impact might be
 expected to have been to raise the variance of the age at leaving home for

 Sons of deceased fathers above that for Sons of living fathers, for the

 father's death might have caused some Sons to leave home very young —
                                                                         those
 whose homes were broken up by the father's death — and caused others to stay

 home considerably longer than otherwise — those who took over family

 businesses. The net impact on the mean of the distribution would depend on

 the relative frequency of these two effects.        A comparison of the two
 distributions indicates that the mean age at leaving home for Sons of

 deceased fathers (1LL7) was considerably below that of sons with living

 fathers (18.3), and that there was some difference between the respective

standard deviations (5.9 and )4.J4)   The father's death therefore appears to

have lowered the mean of the age of Sons at leaving home and raised its
var lance.

        16Other studies report a positive relationship between the
                                                                   age of
children at leaving home and family wealth; Michael B. Katz and Ian E.

Capitalism, p. 262.

       17The correlation of 0.28 between the father's death and the son's

initial employment by a relative is significant at the .0001 level. As
                                          25



might be expected, the probability that a son whose father had died before

the child left home would go to work for a relative declined considerably as

the child's age increased: whereas 58 percent of such sons who left home

before the age of 1!I went to work for relatives, only 9 percent of those who

left home at 14 or older ages were first employed by relatives.

         l8Joseph Kett stressed this importance of the supervision of other

relatives in addition to parents in the early careers of Van Slyck's sub-

jects, noting that "dependency and residence at home were not interchange-

able concepts before the middle of the 19th century;" Rites of Passage,

p. 27.

              More elaborate regression specifications using additional independ-

ent variables designed to test for the presence of differences in the age at

leaving home by birth cohort failed to reveal any significant or consistent

pattern.

              It might be noted that a similar regression equation was also

estimated after adding one other variable, the son's birth order. That

variable yielded a small and insignificant coefficient, and its inclusion
                                      26


 did not have important effects on the estimated values of other coeffi-

 cients. Inclusion of birth order reduced the sample size to less than 70

observations; the results obtained are not presented here.

noted that inclusion in the tabulation presented here as Table 5 was

premised upon having left a farm in one of the two counties studied by

Young; like Table 2, an age at leaving is therefore given for everyone
included.

              Appendix: The Coding of the Van Slyck Biographies




         The quantitative evidence for this investigation was drawn primarily

from the biographies of New England manufacturers contained in J.D. Van

Slyck, New England Manufacturers and Manufactories, 2 volumes (Boston: Van

Slyck and Company, 1879). This appendix provides a listing of the variables

on which information was taken from the biographies, and a description of

the practices followed and definitions used in coding them.

         All principal subjects of chapters were included in the sample

analyzed if information on a reasonable number of variables was available in

their biographies; missing information on particular variables obviously

causes a number of these to be omitted from parts of the quantitative

analysis of this paper. In addition, other individuals mentioned in the

course of descriptions of manufacturing firms have been included in the

sample whenever information was available on the age at which they left

home; varying amounts of other information about these individuals of course

again means that some are omitted from the sample for particular empirical

specifications.

         The variables coded from the biographies are the following:

1.   Year of subject's birth: coded as the last three digits of the year.
     ________________________

2.   Nativity of subject's parents: coded as 0 for parents born in America,
     _____________________________

and as    1   for foreign—born parents. Foreign—born subjects were excluded

from the sample.

3. Age of subject at leaving home: coded as the age at which the subject

left his parents, or his surviving parent if only one was alive.       Whenever

possible this variable refers to the   final   departure from home, for those
                                               28


  cases    in which children had left and returned. Therefore a child who went

 away to school and then returned home directly from school was not deemed to

 have left home for the purposes of coding this variable. If a child went

 away to school but did not return home afterward, the age at the time of' his

 departure to school was taken as the age at leaving home. These conventions

 are aimed at distinguishing between departures from home that indicated the

 child would subsequently be an independent agent, for example for purposes

 of determining whether to migrate, and those in which the child remained

 tied to the parental household, with a return to his parents assumed at the

 time he left. Attendance at school appears to account for most cases that

 fall into the latter category.

 LI.
       Father alive when subject left home: coded as 0 if father was dead

when child left home, or as       1       if father was alive. Orphans were excluded
from the sample.

5—7. Father's occupation:

          5. Agriculture: coded as I if the father was a farmer, or           as 0
              if he was not.

          6. Manufacturing: coded as                1   if the father engaged in
              manufacturing, or as 0 if he did not.

          7. Services: coded as       1    if the father was engaged in commerce or

              a profession, or as 0 if' he was not.

In coding variables 5—7, fathers' occupations were not constrained to be in

only one of the three categories; a father who operated a farm and had a

shed on it where he did carpentry for a local market would be coded as

engaged in both agriculture and manufacturing.

8.     Subject employed by father or      family before leaving home:   coded as   1


if the biography mentioned that the child had worked for his father or
                                       29


another family member while at home, and as 0 otherwise. The one excep-

tion to this was for the childred of farmers, for whom this variable was

always coded as 1. The biographies commonly mention that children who grew

up on farms worked for their parents on these farms from early choidhood.

Although such mentions were omitted in a small number of cases, children of

farmers are assumed here always to have done some work on the farm while

they remained at home. For some evidence consistent with this assumption,

see Lee Soltow and Edward Stevens, The Rise of Literacy and the Common

School in the United States: A Socioeconomic Analysis to 1870 (Chicago:

University of Chicago Press, 1981), pp. 110—11, 121—22; Max George
Schumacher, The Northern Farmer and His Markets During the Late Colonial

Period (New York: Arno Press, 1975), pp. 14O-1, 148-49.

9.   Subject's first move to school: coded as   1   if the subject's departure

from home was made in order to attend school, and as 0 if it was not.

This variable was coded as   1   only if the attendance at school was not

followed by an immediate return to the parental home, or as 0 if it was

immediately followed by such a return; for the reasons for this practice,

see the discussion of variable 3, above.

10. Attended boarding school before final departure from home: coded as       1




if the subject attended school away from home and returned home immediately

thereafter, and as 0 otherwise.
