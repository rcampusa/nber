       Was the Transition from the Artisanal Shop to the Non—mechanized

                 Factory Associated with Gains in Efficiency?:

        Evidence from the U.S. Manufacturing Censuses of 1820 and 1850



                                   ABSTRACT


     There are few more dramatic episodes in economic history than the

displacement of the artisanal shop by the factory during the early stages of

the Industrial Revolution as the predominant form of manufacturing organiza-

tion. Despite the attention this development has received, however, the

issues of why and how it occurred remain in dispute. This paper employs

recently—collected samples of data on northeastern firms from the 1820 and

1850 Federal Census of Manufactures to investigate this transition in the U.S.

context. It argues that the evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that

even the early non—mechanized factories enjoyed an efficiency advantage over

the traditional artisanal shop organization. The growth of average firm size

in nearly all manufacturing industries between 1820 and 1850 indicates a

systematic movement toward the factory organizational form. Some shops did

survive, but they accounted for only modest shares of industry value added and

become increasingly concentrated in areas where the extent of the market was

less likely to justify firm expansion. Moreover, the estimation of production

functions suggests that the non-mechanized industries were generally

characterized by scale economies up to a threshold size similar to that of a

small factory.

     There are few more dramatic episodes in economic history than the

displacement of the artisanal shop by the factory during the early stages of

the Industrial Revolution as the predominant form of manufacturing

organization. Despite the attention this development has received, however,

the issues of why and how it occurred remain in dispute (Chandler, 1977; Dobb,

1963; Landes, 1969; Laurie and Schmitz, 1981; Mantoux, 1962; Smith, 1976).

Perhaps the most prevalent view holds that the factory system enjoyed an

advantage in technical efficiency over the traditional shop, and that

increasingly important market forces selectively favored the former class of

establishments in the competition for survival. A competing interpretation

concedes that the introduction of sophisticated machinery and new power

sources did render large plants more efficient in mechanized industries, but

questions whether the factory system was technologically dominant in Indus-

tries that were yet to be touched by such breakthroughs.

     The position that the early non—mechanized factories provided a more

efficient method of producing manufactured goods can be traced back at least

as far as Adam Smith (1976). Although recognizing that the use of machinery

was facilitated by the factory system, he argued that the extensive division

of labor in such establishments was an important source of their efficiency

advantage. Specialization by workers in narrowly defined tasks alone could

significantly reduce the amounts of inputs required per unit of output. In

recent years, this conventional formulation of why the early factories may

have been technically superior to artisanal shops has come under challenge.

Marglin (1974) and others have claimed that the critical feature of the

factory system was the more intense labor elicited through the application of

supervision and the interdependencies of job performance that accompanied

separation of tasks) Whereas they differ about the nature of the advance,
                                      2



Marglin and Smith agree in allowing early factories, both mechanized and non—

mechanized, considerable potential for measured productivity growth.

     Not all scholars accept this view that the non—mechanized factories

represented a significant technical or organizational advance over the artisanal

shop. Many doubt that the division of labor and other changes in the production

process associated with the introduction of the factory system in non—mechanized

industries were of sufficient importance to have accounted for more than minor

increases in efficiency (Chandler, 1977; Laurie and Schmitz, 1981). They either

question whether the factory system supplanted the traditionally—organized shops

in industries that had not yet mechanized, or suggest that the emergence of the

former as the dominant form of organization was largely due to factors other

than productive advantage. What is at stake extends beyond the narrow question

of whether one type of firm was more efficient than another. The controversy

bears on the issues of whether substantial economic growth was realized by

industrializing economies prior to the widespread utilization of machinery, and

whether this initial phase of industrialization was powered by the increases in

productivity, achieved through changes in the organization and composition of

the manufacturing work force. It is also directly related to the fundamental

question of whether major institutional change is the product of market forces

or of some other set of phenomena.

     Most studies of the emergence of early factories have focused on European

countries. Recently—collected samples of data on northeastern firms from the

1820 and 1850 Federal Censuses of Manufactures encourage investigation of the

development in the US, economy however.2 During the first half of the

nineteenth century, the Northeast led the other regions in experiencing a

rapid expansion of the manufacturing sector, as well as a movement toward

larger—scale production methods such as the factory system. This type of
                                       3




manufacturing firm organization spread well beyond machinery— and power—

intensive textiles to gradually displace artisanal shops in industries as

diverse as clocks, guns, hats, shoes, and umbrellas.

     Although the new sources of evidence greatly enhance our ability to study

the transition from artisanal shops to small factories, they do not contain

all of the information we might seek for such a subtle project. Nevertheless,

this paper argues that the evidence they do provide is quite consistent with

the hypothesis that the early non—mechanized factories did enjoy an efficiency

advantage over the traditional artisanal shop organization in most

industries. Section II discusses how the growth of average firm size in

nearly all manufacturing industries between 1820 and 1850 indicates a movement

toward the factory organizational form. Some shops did survive, but they

accounted for only modest shares of industry value added and seem to have

become increasingly concentrated in rural areas where the extent of the market

was less likely to justify firm expansion. In Sections III and IV, it is

shown that the estimation of production functions also lends support to the

view that the non— or less—mechanized industries3 were generally characterized

by scale economies up to a threshold size similar to that of a small factory.



                                     II.

     Perhaps the most basic requirement for demonstrating that the industrial

expansion of the Northeast during the first half of the nineteenth century was

accompanied by the displacement of traditional artisanal shops by more

efficient factories is to document that manufacturing industries did indeed

experience increases in firm size over the period. Evidence for such a

general increase in the scale of manufacturing establishments, in the form of

industry estimates of the average number of employees per northeastern firm in
                                      4



1820 and 1850, is accordingly presented in Table i. The narrow range of

manufactured goods produced in quantity in 1820 limits the number of

industries that can be examined; but of the ten industries for which a

sufficient number of observations is available, nine show a rise in the

average number of workers employed, with the average industry registering

growth in firm size of 66 percent over the thirty years. The data seem to

strongly support the view that larger—scale manufacturing plants were

superseding the shops over time, particularly since the firm size estimates

for 1820 are likely to be biased upward because of the disproportionate

underenumeration of small establishments in the census of that year.5

     One might question the relevance of these estimates for work on the

diffusion of the non—mechanized factory. Of the ten industries represented in

Table 1, cotton and wool textiles were certainly mechanized, and several

others could reasonably be judged as not having undergone the transition from

shop to factory during the period under study. The qualitative results are

not, however, sensitive to the inclusion of these industries. If the textile

industries are omitted, the remaining eight average an increase in firm size

of 43 percent between 1820 and 1850. If one further excludes the ambiguous

flour milling, glass, and iron industries, the remaining five account for an

average 66 percent rise. The two industries that relied most extensively on

simple instruments, human power, and a factory—like work organization, hats

and boots/shoes, experienced growth in firm size of 102 and 76 percent

respectively.

     Another way of investigating whether factories were supplanting artisanal

shops is to compare at a point in time the average firm sizes, by industry, in

the two regions to industrialize first, New England and the Middle Atlantic,

to those in the rest of the country. This approach has the advantage of

     aThese industries were severely affected by the underenumeration of small
firms in 1820. Hence, the average number of employees in firms of more than
five workers are reported here for the two years. As such figures could not
be computed from the state—level data from 1850, the estimates presented for
that year were calculated from the information contained in the sample of
manufacturing firm data drawn from the schedules of the 1850 Census of
Manufactures.

Notes and Sources:

     The 1820 estimates of the average size of firms, by industry, were
computed from the basic sample of manufacturing firms drawn from the 1820
Census of Manufactures. The basic sample from that year consists of the firms
located in the forty randomly selected counties, and differs from the total
sample in excluding firms from Philadelphia and Allegheny counties in
Pennsylvania. See Sokoloff (1982) for more details on the sampling proce-
dures. With the exceptions of the boots/shoes and paper industries, the 1850
estimates were calculated from the northeastern aggregate figures reported by
the U.S. Census Office (1858). The number of firms on which the estimates are
based appear in parentheses. The industries for which average firm size is
reported was limited by the scarcity of observations and a desire to have them
characterized by relatively homogeneous outputs.

allowing one to estimate the increase in firm size from cross—sectional

information for a year when data are more plentiful. The logic underlying it

is that the conditions that accounted for the traditional organization of the

manufacturing firm, including extent of market, stock of knowledge, and

others, will persist longer in those areas that lag with respect to industrial

development. As long as the year of comparison is not too late, average firm

sizes in these follower regions should yield reasonable estimates of the

average pre—industrial firm sizes.

     Such regional industry—specific estimates of the average number of

employees per firm in 1850 are presented in Table 2. They also support the

hypothesis that increases in the size of manufacturing establishments were

realized in the Northeast during the early stages of industrialization. In

nearly all industries, the average size of firms in either New England or the

Middle Atlantic was larger than in the other regions of the country. This

pattern holds over mechanized industries such as textiles, as well as non--

mechanized ones like hats and boots/shoes, and is representative of the

manufacturing sector in general. For the average of these sixteen industries,

firms in New England employed three times as many workers as did those in

regions outside the Northeast. The case for increases in firm size being

associated with industrial development is further bolstered by examining the

variation in firm size within the Northeast. As illustrated for the example

of Massachusetts in Table 2, average firm size was largest in the areas where

the extent of the market was greatest and industrialization had proceeded most

           6
rapidly.

     Although the finding that most manufacturing industries in the Northeast

experienced an increase in the scale of establishments during the first half

of the nineteenth century is well supported, this by Itself does not imply

Notes and Sources: These averages were computed from the industry data
compiled from the 1850 Census of Manufactures and reported in the U.S. Census
Office (1858). The figures presented refer to the number of employees, with
males and females receiving equal weight, and the figures appearing in
parentheses are the average firm sizes for Massachusetts industires. The
particular industries appearing in the table were selected with two criteria
in mind: the number of employees in the industry in the Northeast, and the
degree of homogeneity of output of firms in the industry. The industry
categoreis generally correspond to the definitions employed by the census.
The iron industry is an exception. It is made up of five different categories
reported in the census: forges, foundries, furnaces, miscellaneous iron
manufactures, and iron rolling.

that changes in production methods were associated with the growth of firms.

As noted above, some have argued that the production processes characteristic

of non—mechanized factories were so similar to those of artisanal shops that

no significant gains in productivity could have been realized by the transi—

tion from the latter form of organization to the former. Chandler (1977, pp.

53—54), for example, considers the larger establishments of the early

nineteenth century, in industries other than textiles, as little more than

expanded artisanal shops:

           After 1790, the artisans enjoyed growing local markets and
      had access to local supplies of yarn, leather, and wood and easily
      obtained cloth and metal from importers of British products.
      Although they became somewhat more specialized, they expanded
      their output to make their suits, dresses, hats, furniture,
      tableware, copper, brass, and pewterware by employing more
      apprentices and journeymen who continued to work in the
      traditional manner with traditional tools . • . The same could be
      said for the makers of sails, ropes, and glassware, and rum,
      whiskey, and beer. In all these trades new machinery was not
      extensively developed or used before the l840s.

In his view, it was not until the widespread diffusion of sophisticated

machinery and steam power during the 1840s that the manufacturing sector began

to make substantial progress.

     Other scholars concerned with the development of various industries that

were late to mechanize their production processes have concluded that many had

begun even earlier to make significant alterations in their methods of

manufacture (Cole and Williamson, 1941; Davis, 1949; Deyrup, 1970; Gibb, 1943;

Hazard, 1921). Their work has depicted the growth in the average size of

firms as reflecting a gradual but systematic movement away from the

traditional shops composed of a few highly skilled workers, and perhaps an

apprentice, toward establishments resembling factories. These new types of

firms were frequently marked by a minute division of labor that reduced the

share of the work force with general skills, greater supervision and attention
                                         9




to maintaining an intense work regime, and a concern for standardization of

product. One   of   the clearest statements of this transition in the

organization of production appears in Hazard (1921, pp. 85—86):

           He [Gideon Howard, a manufacturer of shoes in South Randolph,
      Massachusetts] had a "gang" over in his twelve—footer who fitted,
      made and finished: one lasted, one pegged and tacked on soles,
      one made fore edges, one put on heels and "pared them up," and in
      case of handsewed shoes, two or three sewers were needed to keep
      the rest of the gang busy. . . These groups of men in a ten—
      footer gradually took on a character due to specialization
      demanded by the markets with higher standards and need of speed in
      output. Instead of all the men working there being regularly
      trained shoemakers, perhaps only one would be, and he was a boss
      contractor, who took, out from a central shop so many cases to be
      done at a certain figure and data, and hired shoemakers who had
      "picked up" the knowledge of one process and set them to work
      under his supervision. One of the gang was a laster, another a
      pegger, one an edgemaker, one a polisher. Sometimes, as business
      grew, each of these operators would be duplicated. Such work did
      away with the old seven—year apprenticeship system.

     In a recent article, Goldin and I found that in most manufacturing

industries the proportion of the labor force composed of women and children

increased with size of establishment (Goldin and Sokoloff, 1982). We argued

that this variation in the composition of the work force was indicative of how

the production methods differed with the scale at which firms operated. In

our view, a sharply disproportionate number of women and children employed by

medium (6—15 employees) and large (over 15 employees) establishments was due

at least partially to the more extensive division of labor among workers

utilized by such firms. Since workers in these medium— and large—sized

factories were generally responsible for relatively narrowly defined or siátple

tasks, a greater share of them could be drawn from classes such as women and

children, who were lacking in general skills. Attention to maintaining an

intense work regime may have been another important feature of these firms,

and could also contribute to their disproportionate number of female and child

employees, since supervision and other measures aimed at maintaining
                                      10




discipline might be expected to have had a greater influence on their

productivity than on that of adult males.7

     Estimates of the proportion of the labor force composed of women and

children in 1820 and 1850, by size category of firm, are presented in Table 3

for selected non—mechanized industries. One of the most striking features of

this evidence is how firms in many of these industries do not appear to have

grown far beyond the shop of fewer than five workers before allotting a

greater share of positions to women and children. To take the example of

establishments producing boots or shoes in 1850, women and children accounted

for only 6.9 percent of the employees in small (1—5 workers) firms, while

making up 23.2 and 39.9 percent of the labor force in medium (6—15 workers)

and large (16 or more workers) firms respectively.    Firms in such industries

could evidently alter their factor proportions and production methods signif i—

cantly without radically increasing their scale of operation. When judged

relative to the maimnoth industrial establishments of the late nineteenth

century, the discrepancy between the average size of firms manufacturing

boots/shoes in Massachusetts (37 employees) and in regions other than the
                                                                     the
Northeast (2.6 employees) perhaps seems inconsequential. However,

production processes utilized by firms of these sizes appear likely to have

been substantially different, and the transition from one to the other may

have been associated with significant gains in efficiency.

     By documenting that there was a systematic tendency for firms to grow

larger and that production processes varied with firm size, several conditions

necessary for the existence of an efficiency differential between artisanal

shops and small factories have been established.     Before moving on to the

estimation of production functions or indexes of total factor productivity,

however, a problem common to such studies must be addressed. If the one form

of organization is technically superior to the other, why are they observed to

coexist?

     This dilemma is particularly troubling for the issue of the emergence of

non—mechanized factories, because they were not substantially larger than the

shops they displaced. If the artisanal shop persisted for only a brief

period, one might claim that imperfections in capital markets, sunk human or

physical capital, differences in entrepreneurial ability, and other such

factors simply slowed the adjustment to the long—run equilibrium. Given that

many firms in the industries at issue survived with fewer than six workers

until 1850, a more careful evaluation is required.

     Perhaps the most plausible theory of how shop—size establishments survived

despite their relative inefficiency is that they were concentrated in rural

areas where low population density and high transportation costs restricted the

extent of the market. In order to test this hypothesis, estimates were computed

from the 1850 sample, for urban and rural counties, of the distribution of

industry value added across firm size categories (see Table 4). The analysis

was conducted for two mechanized and six relatively non—mechanized industries.

In all of those for which there were sufficient observations, the share of urban

county value added produced by smallshops was rather modest. Although they did

not quite match the record of cotton textiles, where there were no shop—size

firms, three of the non—mechanized industries (hats, paper, and tanning) bad

shop—size shares of less than 10 percent. Only in boots/shoes did shop—size

firms achieve a share of more than 20 percent. Since that industry was

characterized by extensive product differentiation, the high figure might simply

reflect craftsmen who manufactured very specialized products and were not in

direct competition with the larger factories.

Notes and Sources: The percentages were computed from the northeastern firm
data contained in the Bateman—Weiss sample of the 1850 Census of Manufac-
tures. As that sample was designed to sample firms randomly within states,
rather than across, state—specific weights were employed to construct the
regional estimates presented here. Urban counties are counties that included
a city with a population of twenty thousand and had at least forty percent of
their population residing in "towns" with populations greater than twenty—five
hundred. The dual criteria were utilized because the population figures for
many counties in New York were decomposed only to the township level, leading
many rural areas to appear highly urbanized if only the latter criterion is
applied.
                                      14




    In general, the larger firms accounted for higher proportions of value

added in urban counties than in rural ones. The contrast is especially marked

for the furniture and tanning industries. Whereas the value—added shares for

shop—size establishments were 74.3 and 67.1 percent respectively in rural

counties, they were only 11.0 and 8.6 in the urban ones. The results for

these two industries suggest how important the extent of markets and other

factors that vary with locality were in determining the optimal size of firms

at a given location.8

     Finally, perhaps the most stringent test of whether the limited extent of

market prevented firms from expanding to realize scale economies in production

is to examine how frequently a firm that was smaller than the size at which

scale economies were exhausted operated in close proximity to another

establishment of the same industry. This would presumably have been a rare

occurrence if factories were more efficient than shops, because the firm in

question would have been driven to expand output or find itself out—competed.

Although this analysis only strictly applies to firms producing homgeneous

outputs and to the long run, the plausibility of there having been significant

scale economies would be much reduced if it were common for establishments

employing but a few workers to be located in the same neighborhood as other

firms of the same industry. So comprehensive is the coverage of the firms in

most of the Massachusetts counties by the McLane Report
                                                   -    of 1832, that it can

be employed to investigate how often artisanal shops were in such a position.

With this in mind, the tanning and hat industries were selected as test cases,

because they both had many small shops operating in Massachusetts as late as

1832 and were unambiguously non—mechanized (Sokoloff, 1984).

     Enumerators counted 185 tanneries and 90 hat manufacturers in 135 and 43

Massachusetts cities respectively. A close examination of the geographic
                                        15




distributions of these firms, by size, suggests that the output of shops

operating in proximity to other firms producing similar goods was not a

quantitatively important phenomenon. Despite the very modest average size of

the tanneries, 4.9 employees, only 12.8 percent of the industry's value—added

was produced by shop—sized firms in cities where another tannery was located.

The corresponding figure was even lower, 0.5 percent, for the hat industry.

Another way of summarizing the bearing of these data on the issue of how or

why the shops survived is to compute the proportion of their value—added that

was accounted for by establishments that were sole producers of the particular

commodities in the cities they were located in. This calculation reveals that

such sole—producer firms produced 93.3 percent of the shop output of hats, and

60.7 percent of tanning—shop output.9

     As city boundaries are only a crude proxy for the geographical extent of

markets in 1832, reactions to these figures may vary. Nevertheless, given the

virtual absence of hat shops competing directly with other manufacturers in

the same city, most would probably agree that the geographical distribution of

hat establishments lends strong support to the hypothesis that factories in

this industry enjoyed an efficiency advantage over artisanal shops. The

evidence on tanneries is less persuasive, but when one considers that the

cross—section does not reflect a long—run equilibrium and that some tanning

shops might have survived because of differentiated products, the data

certainly do not sustain a rejection of the hypothesis.



                                     III.

     The estimation of production functions constitutes another method of

investigating whether there were differences between the two types of firms in

total factor productivity. If factories were indeed more efficient than
                                         16




artisanal shops, production functions should yield evidence of economies of

scale. In addition, if there were, as one might expect, bounds on the extent

to which scale economies could be achieved through separation of tasks and the

intensification of labor, the estimated economies of scale in the less

mechanized industries would be exhausted at some moderate level of output.

The potential range of efficiency—enhancing measures was not so limited, for

highly mechanized industries, and their scale economies would presumably not

be fully realized until some higher levels of output.

     The firm   data   from the 1820 and 1850 censuses contain the basic

information needed to estimate production functions. Both sources provide

reports, at the establishment level, of the stock of capital utilized, the

number of employees in different categories (i.e., male and female), the value

of the raw materials consumed, and the value of output produced. Although the

1820 Census of Manufactures was marred by incomplete coverage of the existing

firms, it has the virtue of having collected information on categories of

inputs not covered in the 1850 census.

     Enumerators for the 1820 census requested firms to report their number of

employees in three categories: adult males, adult females, and children.

They also surveyed proprietors on both the cost of the raw materials utilized

and the amount of "contingent expenses" (i.e., the costs of insurance, fuel,

repairs, and other miscellaneous items). As is typical of manufacturing (and

agricultural) production data, the capital input is measured in terms of the

value of the capital stock.'° While some proprietors indicated in notes to

their schedules that they were providing estimates of the present value of

their capital stock, others chose to report the original cost. There also

appears to have been no generally adhered—to rule for whether working capital

was to be counted as a component of the capital stock." Another attractive
                                       17




 feature of the 1820 Census of Manufactures is that enumerators generally

 specified who owned each particular manufacturing firm, information that proved

 to be useful in constructing proxies for the entrepreneurial labor input.

      The 1850 Census of Manufactures retrieved similar information from firms,

but not in as much detail. Of particular concern is the practice of
                                                                        grouping
all male employees together.12 As the proportion of male employees that were

boys rose with firm size, the failure to report boys separately leads to an

overstatement of the labor input in large firms relative to small ones since,

on average, boys had neither the physical strength nor the skills of adult

males. A less significant defect is that the 1850 census did not gather

estimates of the "contingent expenses" borne by firms. Finally, the 1850

sample does not contain information about the owners of the manufacturing

establishments, making the task of imputing the entrepreneurial labor input

especially formidable.

      Two types of production functions have been estimated over these bodies

of data. In addition to the basic Cobb—Douglas form, the translog

specification has also been extensively utilized. Although the trauslog

functions seldom provided significantly (in a statistical sense) more

explanatory power than the Cobb—Douglas, they will be discussed below because

the translog form is more general and allows the estimate of the scale

coefficient to vary over size of firm. The Cobb—Douglas was employed, and the

results reported, in the form:

(1)                V/L =   A(K/L)1L5
where V/L is the value added per equivalent worker, A is the intercept,

K/L is capital per equivalent worker, and L is the measure of equivalent

workers. This form can easily be derived from the more conventional

formulation of the Cobb—Douglas production function:
                                      18




(2)                V = A1'L8

and has the advantage that the coefficient on labor (a) yields a direct test

of economies of scale since:

(3)                8 =   (y+) —l
      A series of Cobb—Douglas production functions, estimated over firms from

non—mechanized industries in the 1820 sample, are reported in Table 5•13 Each

of the first two regressions yields a statistically significant finding of

economies of scale, with the scale coefficient ranging from 1.10 to 1.15.

Additional variables are included in the latter two to investigate whether the

apparent increase in productivity with size of firm was continuous and due to

scale economies, discontinuous and associated with the use of the factory

system, or some combination of the two possibilities. When the dummy for

establishments with more than 5 employees, a proxy for factory size, was

included in the third regression, it proved statistically insignificant, and

only marginally raised the point estimate of the scale coefficient. The

further inclusion of an interaction term between this dummy variable and the

labor input (representing the degree of scale economies) also failed to

significantly increase the explanatory power of the equation. This

specification yielded an interesting pattern in the variation of productivity

with establishment size however. The estimated coefficients in the fourth

regression imply that scale economies were realized by non-mechanized firms up

to a threshold size of more than 5 employees, but that firms of this larger

size enjoyed a statistically significant, and substantial, step increase in

productivity. Similar regressions were estimated with the dummy variable and

the interaction term taking effect at a range of firm sizes between 6 and 15

employees. All of them yielded te result that establishments with more than

5 employees, large enough to potentially be classified as a non—mechanized

                             TABLE 5 (Continued)

Notes and Sources:

     These regressions were estimated over the subset of the sample of

manufacturing firms drawn from the 1820 Census of Manufactures that were in

industries other than cotton textiles, wool textiles, or iron supplied the

necessary information, and met the criteria imposed to exclude firms that were

operating part—time. The intercept represents a paper mill located in the

Middle Atlantic, and the average firm was located in a county where 57 percent

of the labor force was primarily employed in the agricultural sector. An

urbanization variable was not included in the specification, because the

information needed to calculate urbanization rates was not available for

several of the counties from which the sample was drawn. Value added was

calculated as the value of output, minus the value of the raw materials

consumed and the contingent expenses incurred. The capital input was set

equal to what the firm reported in response to the question, "amount of

capital invested." The measure of entrepreneurial labor employed:.was derived

from the information on the ownership of each firm. If a firm listed one

owner, the measure of entrepreneurial labor was set equal to one.   It two

owners were listed, two entrepreneurs were counted, and if three or more

owners were listed, three entrepreneurs were counted. When a firm was

reported as being owner by an individual (or individuals) and "company" (i.e.,

Jones and Company), the "Company" was disregarded. Thus, if the owners of a

firm were Jones and Company, one entrepreneur would be imputed. When an

establishment was incorporated or owned by a joint stock company, then it was

assumed that a manager supervised the operation and was counted among the

employees. In such cases, the ertrepreneurial labor input was set equal to

zero. In the cases where firms did not report their owners, one entrepreneur

                              TABLE 5 (Continued)



was assumed. The labor input was defined as the number of entrepreneurs, plus

the number of adult male employees reported, plus 0.4 times the total number

of female and child employees enumerated. This weight for females and

children was estimated from wage equations and is roughly equal to the ratio

of the wage of adult females or boys to that of adult males during the early

nineteenth century. The weight probably overstates the labor input of women

and children in 1820, but the regressions were also estimated with weights of

up to 0.6 without any change in the qualitative results. Several methods of

detecting, and deleting from the sample, those firms that were operating part—

time were tried. All yielded similar results. The regressions presented here

were estimated over a subset of firms that had been derived by deleting

approximately the lowest 18 percent of firms, with respect to total factor

productivity, from the entire sample. Establishments that had explicitly

indicated that they were part—time operations, as well as outliers

constituting the top 1 percent, were also excluded.

factory, were more productive than smaller firms, but that the available scale

economies were largely exhausted by this medium—size class of manufacturing
               14
enterprises.

     Other independent variables besides capital and labor were included in

the reported regressions in order to control for a variety of factors that

might be related to measured productivity, but as is clear from Table 5, the

qualitative findings are not sensitive to them. The set of industry dummies,

allowing for different intercepts, were intended to pick up industry—specific

effects such as disparities in the quality of inputs (such as skilled vs.

unskilled labor or young vs. older children) or fluctuations in the demand for

particular commodities.15 Similarly, the quality of inputs, the level of

technology, the price levels of inputs and outputs, and the severity of

cyclical disturbances might all have varied with industrial development across

geographic areas, and these potential effects account for why the highly

significant percentage—of—the labor—force—in—agriculture variable, as well as

the New England dummy, were included in the specification. These:.factors

should be controlled for in estimating whether economies of scale existed,

regardless of whether they were related to variation in actual productivity,

or to measurement problems.

     Another method of testing the hypothesis that non—mechanized factories

had significantly higher measured total factor productivity than artisanal

shops is to estimate a regression over firms in non—mechanized industries with

an index of total factor productivity as the dependent variable.   The

independent variables should include a dummy variable for establishments

likely to be operating as factories and measures of other relevant firm

characteristics. Such a regressln is presented in Table 6, and it utilizes a

threshold size, having more than 5 employees, as the proxy for factories. The
                                       23



 highly significant coefficient on that dummy variable indicates that the total

 factor productivity of establishments with more than 5 employees was on

 average more than 20 percent higher than that of artisanal shops, after

 controlling for other factors. The qualitative result is sensitive to neither

 reasonable changes in the threshold size adopted to distinguish factor—

ies from artisanal shops, nor to plausible alterations in the output

elasticities employed in constructing the index of total factor

productivity.

     The one feature of the analysis on which the finding that factories were

more productive than artisanal shops does depend, however, is the inclusion of

an imputed measure of entrepreneurial labor in the labor input. It is easy to

understand why the results should be so sensitive to the treatment of this

variable. The labor of the proprietor (or proprietors) accounts for a major

share of the labor input in small manufacturing establishments, and an

inappropriate decision to include (exclude) an imputed measure of it would

bias estimates of the productivity of such firms downward (upward) relative to

those of large firms where the fraction of the labor input provided by the

proprietors is smaller. Fortunately, both intuition and empirical evidence

provide a solid basis for imputing entrepreneurial labor and counting it in

with the measure of the labor input. Entrepreneurs were not typically

included in the enumeration of employees, but they seem to have been

associated with higher levels of measured output.16

     The evidence indicates that scale economies in non—mechanized

manufacturing industries, were available only up to some threshold firm

size. This would suggest that production functions should be estimated with a

specification that allows the scale coefficient to vary over establishment

size. The translog specification, which has been employed by other

Notes and Sources:

     The regression was estimated over firms in all but the textiles and iron
industries. The index of total factor productivity (I) was calculated from
the formulation

                       I =   V/(K30L70)
where y and        were derived from a Cobb—Douglas production function
estimated over manufacturing firms of all sizes. See the note to table 5 for
the methods employed to impute the entrepreneurial labor input and to
identify, and delete from the estimates, firms likely to have been operating
only part—time. Indexes, with and without the entrepreneurial labor input
imputed were also computed from the aggregate totals, within size categories
and unweighted for industry mix. Normalizing the values of the estimates,
such that they are equal to 100 for the artisanal shop class, yields the
following results:

investigators of nineteenth—century manufacturing (James, 1983), fails in our

case to provide more explanatory power than the Cobb—Douglas form, but it has

the definite advantage of yielding a point estimate of the firm size at which

scale economies were exhausted. Translog production function estimates for

both textile and non—textile firms are reported separately in Table 7 to

illustrate the difference in available scale economies between mechanized and

non—mechanized industries. Both regressions were estimated over those firms

with more than 5 employees, so as to abstract as much as possible from the

problem of how to deal with entrepreneurial labor and focus on establishments

where that component of the labor input would be relatively minor.   The scale

coefficients for the two types of firms have been plotted in Figure 1, by

level of value added, as an aid to the presentation of the results.17

     As is clear from Figure 1, both textiles and the non—mechanized

manufacturing industries exhibit economies of scale over some range of

output. Not surprisingly, scale economies extend over much larger firm sizes

in the highly mechanized textile industries than in the others.   The scale

coefficient equals 1.38 for textile firms, at the mean level of inputs, and

does not fall to 1.0 (the point where scale economies have been exhausted)

until approximately $54,000 in value added. This supports the conclusion,

also sustained by the estimation of Cobb—Douglas production functions over the

same set of firms, that statistically significant scale economies existed in

the textile industries up to a rather substantial establishment size.'8 In

contrast, the scale coefficient in other industries was 1.09 at the mean level

of inputs, and was reduced to 1.0 at about $9,500 in value added.    Consider-

ation of this evidence must be tempered by the recognition that the translog

specification does not provide significantly more explanatory power than the

Cobb—Douglas.19 Nevertheless, the evidence strengthens the case for non—

Notes and Sources:

     The scale coefficients for the two categories of firms were computed from

the coefficients in the respective regressions in Table 8. They were

calculated under the assumption that the same capital to labor ratio

prevailing at the mean level of inputs was maintained at all firm sizes.

Among the textile firms, the mean values of the inputs were 9.434 for the log

of capital and 2.546 for the log of the labor input. Among the firms in the

non—mechanized industries, the mean values were 8.907 for the log of capital

and 2.425 for the log of the labor input. The average textile and non—

mechanized firms were located in counties where 65 and 34 percent of the labor

force respectively were primarily engaged in the agricultural sector. The

scale coefficients mapped are the average of the ones computed for New England

and the Middle Atlantic.

mechanized factories having been more productive than    artisanal   shops, because

it demonstrates that scale economies are observed even when artisanal shops,

whose proprietors account for a substantial share of their labor input, are

excluded from the estimation. In addition, the implication that scale

economies were much more limited in non—mechanized industries than in mechan—

ized, fully exhausted at a firm   size   of about twenty adult—male equivalent

workers, seems quite reasonable and consistent with the variation across

industries in establishment size during the period.

        Observing that scale economies were realized in non—mechanized industries

up to only a modest threshold size should come as no surprise. One would

expect that the scale economies attributable to the indivisibilitias

associated with utilizing certain types of machinery would be greater and

require a larger establishment size than would the realization of economies

stemming predominantly from the division of hand—performed tasks within a

firm,   and the indivisibilities associated with the use of simple tools,
supervision, and a more disciplined work regime.      There are limits to the

extent to which tasks in a non—mechanized production process can be effect-

ively sub—divided and the activity of workers can be regimented.       Were the

gains in productivity realized by introducing a more extensive division of

labor and disciplined work regime, as well as other modest changes in

production methods that did not require high—cost capital equipment, of a

significant magnitude? The regression in Table 6 suggests that they were. In

industries other than textiles and iron, establishments with more than five

employees were on average over 20 percent more productive than the smaller

firms. Both this estimate and the scale coefficients estimated by production

functions imply that the transition from the artisanal shop (of, say, 4

workers) to the non—mechanized factory (of, say, 15 workers) was accompanied
                                      31



by a considerable advance in measured productivity.20

     One might choose to dispute the claims that the production process in

firms of fifteen employees was significantly different from that in firms of

four or five employees, or that the larger establishment deserved being class-

ified as a "factory." However, the evidence, presented in Table 3, that the

composition of the workforce varied substantially between such firms, would

seem to indicate variation in the production methods utilized. In particular,

the higher proportion of women and children (and perhaps lesser—skilled

employees in general) in the larger establishments is consistent with the view

that the latter were characterized by more division of labor and supervision

of workers. Moreover, differences between the production processes utilized

by the two firms are suggested by the finding in Sokoloff (1984) that the

fixed capital intensity of even non—mechanized manufacturing firms increased

with establishment size over this range. As for the question of how one

determines what size of firm constitutes a non—mechanized factory, it must be

admitted that the selection of any such point is somewhat arbitrary.

Nevertheless, firms in general do not appear to have grown far beyond five

workers before taking on some of the characteristics typically associated with

the early factories.

     Production functions can also be estimated over the sample of firm data

drawn from the 1850 Census of Manufactures. As mentioned above, however, the

omission of certain variables from this body of evidence complicates the study

of the extent of scale economies. Of particular concern is the failure to

have boy employees enumerated separately from adult males. Since the

proportion of male employees that were boys rose significantly with firm size,
                                      32




this feature of the data has the effect of biasing estimates of the scale

coefficient downward. In addition, the lack of information on the identities

of firm owners in the 1850 sample aggravates the problem of how to impute the

entrepreneurial labor input.

     A set of Cobb—Douglas production functions estimated over the firms from

the 1850 sample in non—mechanized industries are presented in Table 8. All of

the regressions indicate that factory—sized establishments had higher levels

of productivity than did artisanal shops. The conventional production

functions reflected in the first two equations find highly significant scale

economies, with the scale coefficient varying slightly between 1.11 and 1.12,

depending on whether one allows for different intercepts across industries.2'

     In the latter two equations, a dummy variable for the factory threshold

size of more than 5 employees and an interaction term between that dummy and

the labor input (which will pick up the change in the magnitude of scale

economies above the threshold size) are added to the independent variables in

the specification. When only the dummy variable is added in the :.t11jt1

equation, the results suggests that both continuous scale economies and a step

increase in productivity associated with firms larger than the threshold size

led to a productivity advantage for factories. The fourth equation also finds

tha non-mechanized factories were more productive or efficient than artisanal

shops. But since the interaction term effectively cancels out the coefficient

on the labor input for firms with more than 5 employees, the differential

tends to be attributed, in an accounting sense, to a step increase in product-

ivity that is on average enjoyed by all firms over the threshold size. What

scale economies were available appear here to have been largely exhausted by

factories of a rather modest size. The fourth equation does provide

significantly more explanatory power, although marginally so, than does the

Notes and Sources:

     The regressions were estimated over firms from the 1850 sample that were

of industries other than cotton textiles, wood textiles, iron, boots/shoes,

construction, or consumer perishables, supplied the necessary information, and

met the criterion imposed to exclude firms that were operating part—time. The

intercept represents a tnidddle Atlantic establishment producing consumer

household goods, and the average firm was located in a county where 33 percent

of the population resided in urban areas. Value added was computed as the

value of output minus the value of the raw materials consumed. The capital

input was set equal to the reported investment in capital. The labor input

was set equal to one plus the number of male employees reported, plus 0.5

times the number of females reported. The higher weight on female employees,

relative to that employed with the 1820 firms, is adopted here because adult

males and boys were enumerated together in the 1850 data, and because there

was a higher female to male wage ration prevailing then. Weights of 0.4 or

0.6 yield the same qualitative results. Several methods of identifying, and

deleting from the sample, those firms that were operating part—time were

employed. All yielded similar results. The regressions presented here were

estimated over a subset of firms that had been derived by deleting

approximately the lowest 22 percent of firms, with respect to total factor

productivity, from the entire sample. Outliers constituting the top 3 percent

were also excluded.

second, but any choice between the alternative specifications would have to be

offered tentatively. Nevertheless, what emerges as important is that a

variety of specifications, including different threshold sizes for distin—

guishing factories from shops, yield basically the same implications. They

are that the production technologies of non—mechanized industries were such

that establishments with more than 5 or 6 employees were significantly more

productive than those that were smaller. The sources of these scale

economies, however, were so rapidly depleted, that there is no robust and

statistically significant difference in productivity between non—mechanized

establishments with more than 15 employees and those with 6 to 15.22

     A regression with an index of total factor productivity as the dependent

variable was estimated over the 1850 data, as one with a similar specification

was over the 1820 sample. This equation is presented in Table 9, and it also

supports the hypothesis that non—mechanized factories had higher measured

total factor productivity than artisanal shops. The estimated coefficient on

the dummy variable for establishments with more than 5 employees implies that

even after adjusting for industry mix and location, the former class of firms

was over twenty percent more productive than the latter.23 When a dummy

variable for establishments with more than 15 employees was added to the

specification, it was positive but statistically insignificant, indicating

that the further hypothesis that there was no difference in productivity

between such firms and those with between 6 and 15 employees cannot be

rejected. The result that factories were more productive than shops is not

qualitatively sensitive to reasonable variation in the output elasticities

utilized to compute the index. Moreover, it is especially impressive in that

the failure to enumerate adult mEles separately from boys in the 1850 data

tends to bias the measured productivity of larger establishments downward

Notes and Sources

     The regression was estimated over firms in all but the textiles, iron,
boots/shoes, consumer perishables, and construction industries. The
boots/shoes industry was excluded because many of its establishments appear to
have been putting—out enterprises. The index of total factor productivity (I)
was calculated from the formulation

                            I =   V/(K234   L'766)

where y and     were derived from a Cobb—Douglas production function estimated
over manufacturing firms of all sizes. See the note to Table 8 for a
description of the methods employed to impute the entrepreneurial labor input
and to identify, and delete from the estimates, firms likely to have been
operating only part—time. Indexes with and without the entrepreneurial labor
input imputed were also computed from the aggregate totals, within size
categories and unweighted for industry mix. Normalizing the values of the
estimates, such that they are equal to 100 for the artisanal shop class,
yields the following results:

relative to that of artisanal shops.

     The correspondence between the production function analyses of the 1820

and 1850 samples of manufacturing firms in revealing the presence of scale

economies up to a rather modest threshold establishment size lends further

support to what was already a strong case for the finding. There seems to be

a systematic pattern in the data of medium— and large—sized firms in non—

mechanized industries having significantly higher measured total factor

productivity than smaller enterprises, and it emerges despite a very

conservative treatment of the part—time firm problem. The result is quite

robust with respect to both specification and the subsets of the data over

which the estimates are computed. It is somewhat sensitive to whether one

includes a measure of entrepreneurial labor in the labor input, but the basis

for this practice appears sound.

     Given that the evidence for this systematic discrepancy in measured total

factor productivity is substantial, a natural question is what to make of the

finding. The most straightforward interpretation is that it reflects a

difference between factories and artisanal shops in technical efficiency.

Although some might doubt that production techniques and efficiency could have

varied significantly over such a narrow range of establishment sizes, such

skepticism would seem to be undercut by the observations that factor ratios

did so. Moreover, if there was no appreciable difference in production

methods, how does one account for the clear tendency over time for the larger

firms to displace artisanal shops?

     The competing view is that the apparent differential in efficiency is an

artifact due to measurement problems. Probably the chief concern here is that

labor has been implicitly measured with the assumption that employees worked

the same number of hours per year in all of the firms over which the analysis
                                      39



was conducted. If there were a difference between factories and shops in the

numbers of hours they operated on average per year, the relative productivity

comparisons would be biased. However, the procedures adopted to identify

part—time enterprises, and exclude them form the estimation, should have

greatly reduced the significance of this factor. In addition, evidence from

the 1832 MeLane Report suggests that if there is any such bias, it might work

against the relative productivity of factories since these establishments

appear to. have operated fewer hours per day than the smaller shops.24 As for

the possibility that the labor regime was more intense in factories, that

workers expended more energy per unit of time, such a circumstance might well

be considered an indicator of the greater efficiency of that form of

organization.25



                                      V.

     While the result that scale economies were realized in non—mechanized

industries over a rather limited range of establishment sizes might initially

be surprising, it seems quite reasonable on reflection. In the context of a

non—mechanized technology, one would expect there to be constraints on the

degree to which stages in the production process could effectively be sub-

divided that would be binding at a relatively (relative to textile or other

mechanized industries) small firm size. Similarly, gains that non—mechanized

firms might realize from the intensification of labor, either by inducing

workers to expend more energy or by eliciting more effective labor in reducing

wasted motion, and whether achieved through greater supervision or another

method of imposing a more disciplined work regime, would also be expected to

be dissipated at a relatively mo'est plant size.26
                                      40




     Some might ask why firms did not grow to fully exhaust the potential

scale economies. The answer appears to be that to a great extents they bad

grown and were growing in regions where lower transportation costs and higher

density of population produced markets of sufficient size to justify

expansion.27 As shown in Tables 1 and 2, average firma size increased in most

northeastern manufacturing industries between 1820 and 1850. In the latter

year, firms were larger in the Northeast than in the rest of the country, and

were especially so in areas like the state of the Massachusetts or urban

localities where industrial development had progressed most rapidly. The

analysis of the production data has suggested that the scale economies in non—

mechanized industries were virtually exhausted by establisbinents of medium

size (6 to 15 employees). By 1850, few manufacturing industries in the

Northeast had average firm sizes below this threshold class, and those

artisanal shops that did survive were disproportionately located in outlying

rural districts. Other conditions might also have affected or constrained

decisions concerning the size at which a particular manufacturing, firm would

operate. Capital market imperfections and variation in the relative wages of

different classes of labor, for example, could have contributed to the

persistence of some artisanal shops. Moreover, the complete adjustments from

shops to non—mechanized factories might be expected to have taken a

generation, since skilled artisans who had made their investments in human

capital prior to the expansion of the market or the availability of how

technologies could have continued to operate as before but for lower returns.

     Although the evidence presented here may provide substantial support for

the hypothesis that non—mechanized factories were more efficient or productive

than artisanal shops, it does not help to distinguish between the competing

views as to what accounted for the differential. The higher measured total
                                       41




 factor productivity of the larger establishments, the sharp contrast in labor

 force composition, the increase in capital intensity with firm size, the

 systematic displacement of shops by factories, and the early nineteenth

 century descriptions of how the organization of work differed between the two

 types of manufacturing enterprises are consistent with both theories of

greater division of labor within the firm and of intensification of labor.

More research, almost certainly at the industry level, is required before the

relative importance of these and other factors in accounting for the

productivity advantage of non—mechanized factories can be determined.

     Despite the failure to resolve the issue of the source of the gain, the

finding that non—mechanized factories were significantly more efficient than

artisanal shops has substantial implications for the study of early

industrialization in the U.S. Not only does it supply an explanation of the

general increase in firm size during the early nineteenth century, but it also

demonstrates that manufacturing industries did not have to be mechanized to

experience significant productivity growth during the antebellum period. It

also suggests another contributor, in addition to simply the shift of

resources out of agriculture and into manufacturing, to the substantial

improvement in the relative economic position of the Northeast with respect to

the rest of the U.S. that took place between the Revolution and 1840 (Jones,

1980; Easterlin, 1971). More broadly still, it would seem to imply that

future research on the issue of why the Northeast led in industrialization

might profitably explore what conditions discouraged the expansion of the

scale of production in manufacturing establishments outside that region.

     'In Marglin's view, the appearance of greater technical efficiency is a

result of the mismeasurement of the labor input, that is, by hours of work.

He argues that a proper gauge of the labor input would measure the amount of

work provided, or the energy utilized, by the individual worker.

     2The 1820 and 1850 samples were drawn by Sokoloff and by Bateman and

Weiss respectively. This paper will also make some use of a sample assembled

by Sokoloff from the 1832 Treasury Department survey of manufactures, commonly

known as the McLane Report. See Sokoloff (1982) and Bateman and Weiss (1981)

for descriptions of these bodies of evidence.

     3mese categories of industries will henceforth be lumped together and

referred to as "non—mechanized." In this paper, they consist of all

manufacturing industries other than textiles and iron. This system of

classification is based on the widely—recognized contrast between the textile

industries and the rest of the manufacturing sector, in terms of the extent to

which the production process was based on the employment of sophisticated

machinery, as well as on information contained in the McLane   Report.   An

analysis of these data for eight of the leading manufacturing industries

indicates that cotton and wool textiles had by far the highest investments in

tools and machinery per unit àf labor employment. See Sokoloff (1984).

     4Further evidence that average firm size in the Northeast increased

during the period appears in Sokoloff (1982, Ch. 2).

     51n some counties, particularly those that were densely populated, census

enumerators appear to have surveyed only the larger manufacturing

establishments, regardless of industry. The rationale for this practice is

unclear. See Sokoloff (1982) for further details.

      6Regressions with size of firm   (measured   in a variety of ways) as the

 dependent variable, and industry dummies, extent of urbanization in county,

 proportion of county labor force in agriculture, etc. as independent

variables, have been estimated for both 1820 and 1850. The coefficients are

always positive on the urbanization variable, negative on the proportion of

 the labor force in agriculture variable, and highly significant.

     7The piece rate system of compensation may have also served as a method

of maintaining work intensity among women and children. For further

discussion of these issues, see Goldin and Sokoloff (1982).

     8Chi—square tests where conducted to determine whether one could reject

the hypothesis that the distribution of firms across size classes was the same

in urban counties as in rural ones. Utilizing the 1820 sample, one could

reject the hypothesis at the 5 percent level for all of the industries

appearing in Table 4 except cotton textiles and paper. By 1850 hats and wool

textiles had joined the latter two industries in having similar distributions

of firms across size classes in rural and urban counties. These :61t8 are

consistent with the view that transportation costs were sometimes able to

protect firms organized as shops in non—mechanized industries from

establishments organized as factories. These shops may have been able to

survive in rural areas because their factory competitors only enjoyed modest

efficiency advantages. In cotton textiles, wool textiles (eventually), and a

few other industries, the scale economies were evidently so substantial that

transportation costs could offer no effective shield for shops.

        small proportion of enumerators reported the aggregate totals, such as

the number of employees, for all of the tanneries or hat manufacturers in a

particular city, rather than list each establishment in that location

separately. In carrying Out the analysis, it was assumed that in such cases
                                         44




all of the respective firms were identical and of the average size.

        10Economists would typically prefer to have information on the rental

value of the capital, or an indication of the amount of capital actually being

utilized, to information on the value of the capital stock. Either of these

types of information would lead to an improved measure of the capital input.

Production functions estimated with the value of capital stock have, however,

performed quite well in practice. See the discussion of this point in

Griliches and Ringstad (1973).

        11Both of these errors and irregularities in the measurement of the

capital input will tend to bias estimates of the capital coefficient toward

zero.

        12Examination of the information on wage rates provided by firms

indicates that boys must have been included among male workers, rather than

reported separately as child employees. The average male wage rate is much

lower in industries known to have employed many boys, such as cotton textiles,

than in other industries. Furthermore, the cotton textile male wage indicated

by the 1850 returns, when compared to the adult male wage estimated from the

1832 McLane Report, would seem to suggest that adult males in that industry

suffered an enormous decline in their real wages between the two years, while

males in agriculture, and in manufacturing industries that employed few boys,

reaped large gains. See Goldin and Sokoloff (1982, fn. 28) for further

details.

             would be preferable to estimate production functions separately for

each industry classification. However, the number of firms in the 1820 and

1850 samples of manufacturing firms is inadequate for this procedure.

Manufacturing—wide production functions have frequently been estimated, and

the approach utilized here, of allowing the intercept to vary across
                                         45



 industries, resembles that employed by Griliches and Ringstad (1973).

Regressions that allowed the scale coefficient to vary across industries were

also estimated, but no statistically significant differences were observed.

The production function estimates presented in this paper constrain the

capital coefficient to be the same in all industries. Relaxation of this

assumption does not alter the qualitative results. The form of Cobb—Douglas

production function estimated here yields lower R2 than the coventional form

does.

        141n general, the regressions implied that scale economies were realized

only up to the threshold size specified by the dummy variable and the

interaction term in the particular equation. The coefficients on the dummy

variables were typically positive, large, and highly significant, indicating a

step increase in productivity for all establishments above the threshold

size. When the regressions were also estimated with a dummy variable and an

interaction term for firms with more than 15 employees, the two additional

independent variables proved statistically insignificant. It should be noted

that if artisanal shops operating in outlying areas enjoyed local monopolies

and were able to set output prices above competitive levels, then estimates of

the degree of scale economies or of the productivity differential between

shops and factories would be biased downward.

     15The introduction of industry dummies amounts to requiring that the

effects of the rest of the variables have to be estimated from the variation

around the industry means. Since much of the systematic variation in

variables, such as the capital—labor ratio, is between industries, the use of

industry dummies reduces the systematic variation in the variable, relative to

the noise, from which the coefficient is to be estimated. This leads to a

biasing downward of some coefficients and a general decline in the precision
                                      46



(and statistical significance) of the estimated coefficients.   This factor is

one reason for not allowing the capital coefficient to vary between

industries. For more discussion of this point, see Griliches and R.ingstad

(1973).

     '61f it was inappropriate to add a measure of entrepreneurial labor to

the labor input of the reported employees, then its inclusion would bias

estimates of the total factor productivity of small firms downward relative to

that of larger ones. The evidence, however, seems to indicate that an

entrepreneurial labor component should be included in the computation of a

total labor input. First, it is clear that the owners of firms were not

counted among the employees. For example, nearly 7 percent of the firms

reporting only one employee were owned by two individuals. Of greater

significance are the indications that at least amonS small firms, entrepre-

neurs were associated with additional output by establishments. Below, for

example, are listed the average outputs for firms with a given number of

employees and one owner versus those with two owners.   Given that the second

owner would be less likely to contribute to output than the first owner, if it

can be shown that the second owner does, it seems reasonable to infer that the

first owner did.

 Although   the number of observations in many of the individual cells is small,

 the consistent finding that firms with two owners had   higher   value added than

 those with one seems to suggest that the marginal entrepreneurs increased

 output. Although the difference is small between the two classes with one

 employee, the discrepancy may be narrow because the firms with one owner had

 an average capital stock that was more than 50 percent greater than that of

 firms with two owners. Notice also that if one did not count entrepreneurs at

all, firms with one worker would have the highest value added per worker.

      '7The translog production function has the following form:

(1)
                        V=y+L+aK+aLLL2+aK2+aLK
where all of the variables are logged. The scale coefficient CS) for any

specified levels of inputs can then be solved for:

(2)

Hence, the estimate of the scale coefficient varies with the size of firm. An

alternative production function with a variable scale coefficient is utilized

by Atack    (1977)   and Atack (1983).

      18The estimates imply that scale economies in textiles were exhausted at

approximately one hundred and fifty workers. One of the peculiar features

about the production function estimates, however, is that they suggest that

total factor productivity in textiles was significantly lower than in the non—

textile industries, As the magnitude of the discrepancy is quite large and

implausible, the author suspects that it is attributable to the unusually

severe effect of the economic contraction on the textile industry (forcing

firms to operate well below capacity), the generous exclusion of low pro-

ductivity (likely part—time operators) non—mechanized firms from the

regression, and possibly a widespread reporting of the original cost of

capital rather than the market value of the capital stock.
                                      48



     '9When a Cobb—Douglas production function was estimated over this sample

of non—mechanized firms, those with more than 5 employees, the scale economies

were not statistically significant.

     20The fourth equation in Table 5 implies that the total factor

productivity of an establishment with 15 equivalent workers would have been

approximately 7 percent higher than another with 4 equivalent workers. This

estimate is for two firms in the same industry, and based on the assumptions

that they have identical capital to labor ratios and are located in counties

with the same proportion of. the labor force in agriculture. It should be

recognized that the point estimates of the productivity differential between

non—mechanized factories and shops are sensative to how conservative one is In

dealing with the part—time operations problem.   Those presented here were

computed from the subset of establishments left after the bottom 18 percent of

firms, with respect to total factor production, were excluded fromt the

analysis (in addition to those that explictly indicated on the census schedule

that they were operating only part—time). The smaller the number of firms

dropped from the analysis, the larger the estimate of the total factor

productivity differential between factories and shops.

     21The qualitative result of significant scale economies is sensitive to

the imputation of an entrepreneurial labor input. Since the 1850 sample does

not contain information on the owners or proprietors of establishments, it was

assumed that each firm had an entrepreneurial labor input of one adult male.

Regressions of the number of owners on the number of employees, estimated over

both the 1820 sample and the MeLane Report sample, indicate that the number of

entrepreneuers increased only slightly as the number of employees did.

Assuming one entrepreneur per firm thus appears to be a reasonable

approximation, and probably introduces only a very small upward bias in the
                                         49




 scale coefficient. Again as with the 1820 sample, the magnitude of the

estimated scale economies is quite sensitive to how many firms are excluded to

deal with the part—time oeprations problem. THe truncation point employed

here, leading to the exclusion of the least productive 22 percent, is a

conservative one. A less stringent standard would yield an estimate of even

more extensive scale economies.

        22When a dummy variable and an interaction term for establishments with

more than 15 employees were added to the specification utilized in the fourth

regression, they failed to significantly increase the explanatory power of the

equation. When Cobb—Douglas and translog production functions were estimated

over all establishments with more than 5 employees, they yielded results

similar to those found with the 1820 sample. In particular, the translog

specification suggested tha scale economies were present and exhausted by

roughly $9,000 of value added, while the Cobb—Douglas found no significant

scale economies over this range of establishment sizes. When the Cobb—Douglas

production function is estimated over firms with between 5 and 24 employees,

however, the scale economies observed are statistically significant. This

discrepancy in qualitative results may be due to the failure of the 1850

census to separately enumerate adult males and boys, and the consequent

overstatement of the labor input in larger firms relative to that in smaller

ones.

        23The qualitative result is not sensitive to reasonable alternative

difintions of the threshold size tht distinguishes factories from shops. As

discussed above, the point estimate of the productivity differential decreases

as the number of establishments excluded form the analysis by the adjustment

made for part—time firms increases. It is also negatively related to the

threshold size utilized in the specification.
                                     50



     24Several hundred of the firms appearing in the McLane Report sample

reported the average number of hours per day that they operated.   Regression

analysis suggests that after controlling for industry, hours of operation were

negatively related to firm size. This finding is of only marginal statistical

significance however.

     25whether a form of organization that increases measured total factor

productivity by raising the intensity of work could be technically more

efficient than the alternative form of organization is a complex issue. The

extensive treatment that the question deserves cannot be provided here

however. Instead the simple logic of the market—forces argument in favor of

the proposition in this case is presented briefly, although some might claim

that it lacks historical relevance. If the organizational form with the more

intense labor regime (i.e., the factory) progressively displaced the other

(i.e., artisanal shop), this would suggest that the value of the marginal gain

in productivity was more than enough to compensate workers for their greater

exertions. If one assumes that the labor intensity supply schedule of the

individual worker is everywhere upward sloping, and the value of marginal

product schedule downward sloping, then the transition from the artisanal shop

equilibrium (with respect to wage rate and labor intensity) to the non—

mechanized factory equilibrium (with a higher wage and greater labor

intensity) would seem to have been associated with a shifting out of the

marginal product schedule. Since proprietors of manufacturing firms, as well

as workers, were increasingly attracted toward the factory, then the shift in

the marginal product schedule was presumably the result of a disproportionate

increase in output with respect to inputs (including work intensity).

Otherwise, the proprietors would opt for the more traditional form of

organization. This interpretation receives support from the wage regression
                                      51




estimates obtained from the various samples of manufacturing firm data that

wage rates increased with establishment size.

     261n both the MeLane Report and the 1850 Census of Manufactures, there

were many shoe establishments with small amounts of capital reported, and yet

many employees. These firms were also marked by substantially lower rates of

compensation for their workers (especially women). As many putting—out shoe

establishments did operate in eastern Massachusetts during this period, the

author suspects that many of the firms in the sample with very low labor

productivity were putting—out enterprises. Why these workers were so much

less productive remains a puzzle, but it may stem from their working fewer

hours, without supervision, or in a less—disciplined environment.

     27Lindstrom's (1978) findings that intra—regional trade and special-

ization in manufactured products increased dramatically in the Northeast

during the first half of the nineteenth century are also consistent with the

view that the extent of the market facing individual firms or localities was

growing. See Taylor (1951) for further discussion of these developments.
