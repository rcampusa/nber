       Two key attributes of a job are its wage and its duration. Much         has   been made of

changes in the wage distribution in the 1980s, but little attention has been given to job durations

since Hall (1982). We fill this void by examining the temporal evolution of job retention rates

in U.S. labor markets, using data assembled from the sequence of Current Population Survey job

tenure supplements. In contrast to the distribution of wages, which clearly changed in the I 980s,

we find that job retention rates have remained stable.

 1. Introduction

       How stable are jobs in the U.S. economy7 Has stability changed over time, and if so,

what is the nature of the change and which groups have been most affected? Very little is

known about these fundamental questions, because little previous research exists.' l'his lack of

research is particularly surprising in light of the fact that the wage and stability of a job are

certainly two of its key attributes, and the distribution across workers of one of those attributes

(the wage) has changed dramatically in the 1980s and has been subject to intense scrutiny.

       The plausibility of declining stability is suggested by the dramatic changes in the

distribution of wages that occurred in the 1980s. The salient changes are the deterioration of the

relative wages of young and less-educated workers, an end to the convergence of black and

white wages, and a closing of the gender gap in wages (Bound and Freeman, 1992; Burtless,

1990; Murphy arid Welch, 1992). Much research suggests that the bulk of these changes can be

explained by changes in the relative demand for skilled workers (Berman, Bound and Griliches,

1993; Blackburn, Bloom and Freeman, 1990; Katz and Murphy, 1992). But there is also some

work suggesting increased bifurcation of the U.S. labor market into "good jobs" and "bad jobs,"

with an associated disappearance of stable, relatively high-pay employment for the middle and

lower-middle classes (Bluestone and Harrison, 1986, 1988). This view is also reinforced by

innumerable media reports claiming to document increased job turbulence (for a review, see

Marcotte, 1993). Finally, there is evidence that training has changed in ways that mirror

changes in the wage distribution, with more-educated and more-experienced workers now


      Exceptions include Marcotte (1993) and Farber (1993). Marcotte examines PSID data
for the I 970s and 1 980s, while Farber examines layoffs and plant closings. There is also
evidence consistent with some firms or industries relying increasingly on part-time or non-
permanent workers (Abraham, 1990; Belous, 1989), although this evidence does not address
trends among random samples of workers. The research closest to ours is Swinnerton and
Wial (1993), which was done contemporaneously and independently.
 receiving relatively more job training (Constantine and Neurnark, 1994).

        In this paper we examine directly the temporal evolution of job stability in U.S. labor

 markets. We use data assembled from the sequence of Cunent Population Survey (CPS) tenure

 supplements, which are issued periodically and ask workers how long they have been with their

 current employer or at their current job. In addition to the information collected from the

 supplements, we use demographic characteristics and other variables available from the general

 CPS administered to the same individuals.

        Our empirical procedures for examining changes in job retention rates build on Hall's

 (1972, I 982) seminal work on estimating the distribution of eventual job tenure, and Ureta's

 (1992) extensions of Hall's work. At the same time, estimates of the distribution of eventual job

tenure are problematic if the survival function is not stable, so our research potentially calls into

question the assumptions and findings of that earlier work.

        In Section 2, we discuss the data used, our procedure for estimating retention rates, and

adjustments to remove the effects of heaping, rounding and business cycles. We present our

estimates of retention rates in Section 3, both in the aggregate and disaggregated by age, race,

sex, education, occupation, and current tenure. We conclude in Section 4.



2. Data and Methods

Estimating Retention Rates

       A concept central to our approach is the t-year retention rate, R(t), which gives the

probability that workers with a particular level of tenure today will have an additional t years of

tenure t years hence. The t-year retention rate may be defined for any subgroup of the

population, such as demographic groups or workers with particular initial tenure levels.

Denoting current tenure by c, and other characteristics by x, we write the t-year retention rate as

                                                 2
R(t). We refer to a sequence of retention rates, R,(t), t —    1,   2, ... , as a survival funcnon. The

survival function provides a complete characterization of the probability distribution of eventual

tenure.2 Because the survival function and the probability distribution of eventual tenure contaJn

precisely the same information, analysis may be based on either. From this point on, we work

exclusively with the survival function.

        Hall (1982) uses the 1978 tenure supplement and concludes that expected U.S. job tenure

is long, insignificantly different for blacks and whites, and significantly shorter for women. The

estimation of tenure distributions is complicated because the CPS data capture "incomplete

spells" (as would any non-retrospective data), that is, completed tenure-to-date for people's

current jobs. Because of this, the distribution of eventual tenure cannot be observed, but only

inferred by estimating the survival function for employment.

        Hall's estimation of the survival function from a single tenure supplement (i.e., from a

cross-section) requires two assumptions. The first assumption, which is particularly germane to

our research, is that the employment survival function is stable over time. This assumption

permits one to infer, for example, the probability that an employed 35 year-old with zero years

of tenure will accumulate at least ten more years of tenure (the ten-year retention rate for 35

year-olds), from data on 45-year-olds with ten years of tenure at the same point in time. In

particular, this probability is estimated as the ratio of the number of 45-year-olds with ten years

of tenure to the number of 35-year-olds with zero years of tenure.

        As Ureta (1992) points out, estimation of the survival function from cross-sectional data

also requires a second assumption, that the overall "arrival rate" (the number of workers

    2
      The probability distribution of eventual tenure is obtained from the survival function as
follows. For a given level of current tenure, let P(t) denote the probability that additional
tenure is greater than or equal to t years, but less than t+ 1 years. For short, we refer to P(t)
as the probability of t years of additional tenure. Clearly P(t) — R(t) - R,(t+l).

                                                 3
beginning new jobs) is constant. Hall corrects only for changes in arrivals due to cohort size

variation, but Ureta emphasizes that this is insufficient, because the period for which Hall was

estimating the distribution of eventual job tenure witnessed large changes in labor force

participation rates of women and older men, changes that also affected the arrival rate. To see

the nature of the problem, note that if current 35 year-olds have a higher participation rate than

current 45 year-olds, then the ratio of employed 45 year-olds with ten years of tenure to

employed 35 year-olds with zero years of tenure will understate the ten-year retention rate for

this group.

        Ureta develops a method of estimating the survival function that does not require stable

participation rates. This method requires the use of multiple CPS tenure supplements to

calculate historical retention rates.34 By linking a few supplements, Ureta is able to estimate

historical one-year retention rates as the ratio of the number of individuals with c+ 1 years of

tenure in year j+l to the number of individuals with c years of tenure in year j. Historical

retention rates are independent of changes in arrival rates, because they are calculated from data

on the same cohort at two points of time. To return to our previous example, the ratio of

employed 45 year-olds with ten years of tenure in, say, 1983, to employed 35 year-olds with

zero years of tenure in 1973 will not understate the ten-year retention rate for this group, even if

participation rates are rising for this cohort, because none of the new labor market entrants



     Ureta uses CPS tenure supplements for 1978, 1981, and 1983, ignoring (although
acknowledging) the change in the tenure question after 1981 that we discuss below.
    ' Hall notes that retention rates can also be calculated historically by stringing together
tenure supplements. In fact, he compares some crude calculations of retention rates from
cross-sectional and historical data. Because he is interested only in a qualitative
characterization of the long-term nature of jobs in the U.S. economy, however, he does not
focus on the differences that emerge from the two procedures, as both indicate the same
qualitative characteristic of relatively long-term job attachment.

                                                 4
(arrivals) between 1973 and 1983 can accumulate ten years of tenure by 1983.

        However, like Hall, Ureta must assume a stable survival function, for two reasons. First,

she estimates one-year retention rates using tenure supplements that are more than one year

apart. Second, she uses the estimated one-year retention rates to estimate eventual tenure

distributions.

        Here we dispense with the assumption of a stable survival function. In fact, our goal is

to assess whether the survival function is stable. As Ureta's work makes clear, we cannot

sunultaneously avoid this assumption while providing a complete characterization of eventual

tenure distributions. But we can avoid the assumption by linking together a longer sequence of

CPS tenure supplements, and using them to characterize tenure distributions based only on

observed historical retention rates.

       The basic t-year retention rate for workers with c years of tenure is calculated as the ratio

of the number of workers with t+c years of tenure in the tenure supplement t years hence

(N0't(t+c)), to the number of workers with c years of tenure in the current tenure supplement

(N°(c)), where the '0' superscript refers to the current year's supplement. Formally,


                                                N Ot(tc)
                                         R(t) = ______
                                                 N(c)


Retention rates can be calculated for any subgroup consistently represented across surveys. We

shall classify by age, sex, education, race, industry, occupation, and current tenure.

Characteristics of the Samples

       CPS tenure supplements are available for 1973, 1978, 1981, 1983, 1987, and 1991.


     Tenure supplements were also carried out in 1963, 1967, and 1969, but the micro-data
from these supplements are apparently not available in machine-readable form.

                                                 5
Conditional on any characteristic, we can compute the t-year retention rate for the span of years,

t, between any two supplements. Unfortunately, however, the question's wording has changed

over time. In 1973, 1978, and 1981, the question referred to time working at the present job or

business, asking "When did ... start working at his present job or business'?" In 1983, 1987, and

1991 the question referred to time working (continuously) for the present employer, asking "How

long has ... been working continuously for his present employer (or as self-employed)T' There

is no decisive way to determine whether or not respondents interpreted the questions differently.

Thus, to be safe, we are careful to focus on changes in retention rates that are not influenced by

changes in wording of the tenure question.

       In the first panel of Table 1, we show the set of spans for which we can directly estimate

retention rates (ignoring, for the moment, differences in the tenure question). The entries

indicate the span, t, for which the retention rate can be estimated, and the year at the top of each

column indicates the year from which all rates can be estimated. The span measures the number

of years between the year at the top of each column to some future year for which a supplement

is available. Thus, for example, the "5" in the upper-left-hand corner indicates that we can

directly estimate the five-year retention rate for 1973.

       The second panel of Table 1 displays the retention rates that can be compared over time.

Ignoring changes in the tenure question, we can compare changes in retention rates for four

combinations of years and retention rates: changes in four-year retention rates from 1983 to

1987, changes in 5-year retention rates from 1973 to 1978, changes in 8-year retention rates

from 1973 to 1983, and changes in ten-year retention rates from 1973 to 1981.

       However, changes in the tenure question limit the usefulness of some comparisons. The

most consistent comparison is that of four-year retention rates for 1983 and 1987. This

comparison uses data only from 1983 and afterwards, and hence relies on a consistent tenure

                                                 6
question. Comparisons of the five- and eight-year retention rates are problematic, because the

comparisons cannot be made with a consistent tenure question. For example, five-year retention

rates for 1973 are based on the early tenure question for both 1973 and 1978, while five-year

retention rates for 1978 are based on the early tenure question for 1978, and the later tenure

question for 1983. However, despite changes in the tenure question, a comparison of ten-year

retention rates for 1973 and 1981 is possible. For each of these years, retention rates are based

on the early tenure question in the initial year, and the later tenure question in the final year.

Thus, while estimates of retention rates for either 1973 or 1981 may be biased because of the

change in the question, we should nonetheless be able to accurately estimate the changein

retention rates from 1973 to 1981, as long as the estimated retention rates for each year are

equally biased.

        The retention rate estimates are based on ratios of counts of workers with various levels

of current tenure from different CPS samples of the population. The universe we use is

nonagricultural workers, currently working or with a job but not currently at work, aged 16 or

older. Although the CPS is a random sample, non-response to the tenure supplement can vary'

across years (and in fact does so quite substantially), and can vary differently based on

demographic or other characteristics. Thus, we have to control carefully for changes in the

representation of different workers among respondents to the tenure supplement in order to

obtain unbiased estimates of these counts. We use the standard CPS sample weight multiplied

by the reciprocal of the response rate to the tenure question for each race-age-sex subgroup, with

age grouped into five-year intervals.6




    6
      The CPS sample weight is the reciprocal of the probability of being sampled, adjusted
for non-interview and variation in the sampling of race-age-sex and residence subgroups.

                                                  7
Rounding and Heaping

        The empirical probability distributions of reported tenure for each of the six supplements

are indicated by the bars in Figure 1. The rough shape of these distributions is the same in each

of these six years, with the highest proportion reporting tenure in the range of 0-1 year, and the

proportion declining nearly monotonically in subsequent years.7 However, the empirical

distributions reveal some other features.

        First, for 1983, 1987, and 1991, the proportion reporting tenure of 1-2 years is lower than

the proportion reporting tenure of 2-3 years. This almost surely arises because of the wording of

the tenure question. In the 1983 and subsequent surveys, the tenure question asks how long a

person has worked for the present employer, If the answer is less than one year, the respondent

is queried as to length of tenure in months; otherwise the answer is recorded in years. This

suggests that if a person has worked more than one-and-a-half years, he is likely to respond that

he has been working for two years. So we might expect that approximately one-half of the

respondents who have 12-24 months of tenure are coded as having two years of tenure, rather

than one. In contrast, the pre-1983 survey asks for the year in which the spell of tenure began,

so this problem does not arise.8 The empirical probability distributions are consistent with this

rounding problem, as the proportion reporting tenure of 1-2 years in 1983, 1987, and 1991 is

roughly one-half of the proportion reporting tenure of 1-2 years in 1973, 1978, and 1981.°


    ' Our convention is that when a tenure interval is specified, the first value is included in
the interval and the second excluded. For example, 3-6 means 3 tenure        < 6.

    8
      For example, if a respondent to the January 1981 supplement began working one-and-a-
half years ago, he responds with 1980, and tenure will be coded as one year.

      Another apparent difference between the first three and the last three years is that for
the former, the spike at 0-1 years is larger. This may be attributable to the wording of the
tenure question. Individuals may regard themselves as having changed jobs, but not
employers, which would put more mass at low levels of tenure defined for the job instead of

                                                 8
       A second feature of the empirical tenure distributions is that the 1983, 1987, and 1991

distributions have spikes at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 years, to which we refer as "heaping." The

problem was originally identified by Ureta (1992), and presumably arises because of rounding

with regard to the number of years for which a respondent has worked for the present employer.

In contrast, for the three earlier supplements, in which respondents reported the year they began

the tenure spell, any such heaping is much less evident.

       We "de-heap" the data by estimating a mixture model for reported tenure, which we then

use to reallocate the heaped data. For this purpose (and only this purpose), we assume the true

tenure distribution is Weibull, with survival function exp[-(ctt')], where t' denotes true tenure,

and we assume further that individuals report true tenure with probability p and report the

nearest multiple of five with probability (l-p). We expect rounding to be more severe the longer

the true length of the tenure spell, so we allow p to depend linearly on reported tenure t, so p

y + ót, where we expect to find ó <0.

       Under these assumptions, the reported tenure distribution differs from the true probability

distribution for two reasons—heaping and sampling variation. We use the minimum chi-square

method to estimate the parameters a, l, y, and ô. First, we divide the possible values of

reported tenure into J cells, and then we fmd the values of the parameters that minimize


                                               0
where O is the actual number of observations in the cell, and      is the expected number of

observations given the parameters.t°



the employer.
    ° The cells used are 0, 1-2, 3-4, 5,6-9, 10, 11-14, 15, 16-19, 20, and 21 or more.
                                                 9
         After estimating the parameters of the mixture model, we "de-heap" the data. For each

multiple of five years for reported tenure, we calculate the probability that respondents have

reported the truth, using the estimates of y and ô. We then redistribute, to adjacent values of

tenure, the number of respondents estimated to have rounded. The redistribution is in proportion

to the percentage shortfall between the expected number of observations at each of the adjacent

values based on the estimated Weibull distribution, and the expected number of observations

based on the mixture of the Weibull distribution and the heaping mechanism."

         We treat the problem of half-year rounding, discussed above, in a similar fashion, by

assuming that independently of reported tenure (as long as it exceeds 12 months), individuals

report true tenure with probability 0 and report one year more than true tenure with probability

1-0. We then shift reported tenure down by one year for the proportion estimated to have

rounded up by one year."

Business Cycles

         Business cycles may influence estimates of retention rates as fluctuations in

unemployment affect the probability of termination, independently of Underlying changes in job




       Because the tendency to round appears to be approximately three times more likely at
multiples of five ending in zero than multiples ending in five, we use the following adjacent
values. For multiples ending in five, we defme the adjacent values as one year less or one
year more of tenure (e.g., for five years of tenure, we use four and six). For multiples ending
in ten, we define the adjacent values as one to three years less, and one to three years more.
    12
       We estimated the mixture model separately for each of the three years 1983, 1987, and
1991. The estimates of a ranged from .22 to .23, while those of 3 ranged from .73 to .80.
The estimates of y and ô were consistent with a very low probability of rounding at low
levels of tenure, but a rising probability with tenure; the estimates of y ranged from .975 to
.999, and the estimates of ô were -.009. Finally, the estimates of 8 ranged from .35 to .44,
consistent with our conjecture that roughly one-half of respondents round reported tenure
upward.

                                                 10
retention rates.'3 To correct for this potential bias, we attempt to adjust retention rates for

cyclical fluctuations by, in effect, adding back cyclical job terminations.

          Our proxy for the cyclical position of unemployment, Q(m), is simply the residual from

a regression of the monthly civilian unemployment rate on a nonlinear time trend.'4 We do this

separately for demographic subgroups, classifying by sex, race (white and black), and age (16-20

and 20+). Then we form E(m) =         1   - U,(m) and obtain the retention rate via


                             R (t) = N°'(t+c)                 i
                                          N(c)     [E(l)E,(2)...E,,(l2t—1)]



Clearly, if unemployment were always on trend (that is, U(m)=0 and E(m)=1), the adjustment

factor would be unity, so no adjustment would be made. Otherwise, the adjustment lowers

retention rates in booms and raises them in recessions, with the size of the adjustment depending

on the average deviation of the unemployment rate from trend over the span.

          To illustrate the potential influence of cyclical fluctuations on retention rate comparisons

in the simplest possible setting, consider the following example of a pair of 1-month spans:




     In addition, variation in the unemployment rate could influence the retention rate of
    L3


workers employed at any point in time, if unemployment is conelated with the quality of job
matches. We do not explore this source of bias.

        The unadjusted retention rates indicate that job stability is lower in Scenario 2 than in

Scenario 1. But with cyclical unemployment at 20% in month 1 in Scenario 2, the 20% drop in

retention is entirely attributable to the 20% increase in terminations caused by the cyclical

downturn. The adjusted retention rate is computed as (80/200) -(11.8)     .50. This is equivalent

to the retention rate in Scenario 1, because it adds back terminations caused by cyclical

unemployment.



3. Results

Basic Results: Four-Year Retention Rates

        Table 2 reports four-year retention rates for 1983 and 1987, classified by initial tenure.

The first two columns report results using unadjusted data. Retention rates decrease for workers

with less than 6 years of tenure and increase for workers with more than 6 years; overall, the

retention rate decreases from .57 to .56. The third and fourth columns report retention rates

estimated using de-heaped data; the results are qualitatively similar. Finally, the last two

columns report retention rates estimated from de-heaped data, adjusted for business-cycle effects.

Again, the results are qualitatively similar.'

    '  Because the effects of business cycles appear to be minor, in the disaggregated results
that follow we report results correcting for heaping and rounding only.

                                                   12
         Figures 2-A to 2-D provide a graphical display of changes in four-year retention rates for

the same tenure subgroups, classified also by five-year age groups.'6 The retention rates are

displayed for 1983 and 1987, along with 95% confidence intervals.'7 Overall, retention rate

patterns are very similar across the two spans. Closer scrutiny, however, reveals a few potential

movements that might deserve mention. Figure 2-A, for those with 0-3 years of tenure, reveals

no consistent pattern of retention rate shifts, but Figure 2-B, for those with 3-6 years of tenure,

reveals a decrease in the retention rate for workers up to age 40. The evidence for workers with

6 or more years of tenure, in Figure 2-C, is mixed, depending on the age at which the retention

rate is evaluated. Finally, the evidence for workers averaging over all levels oftenure, in Figure

2-D, reveals essentially no change, except for workers in their twenties, for whom retention rates

fell. While the change in the retention rates for these workers seems small, it is nonetheless

interesting that it shows up for the age group that has experienced the largest relative wage

decreases.

         Finally, in order to provide additional perspective, we transform our estimates of

retention rates into estimates of expected job tenure, under the assumption that the survival

function may shift across time spans but is otherwise stable (for example, across different

workers). Using exponential survival functions, the drop in the average retention rate from the

1983-1987 span to the 1987-1991 span corresponds only to a small change in average job tenure,

from 6.3 years to 5.9 years.'

Classification by Demographic Groups

       In Table 3 we provide further evidence on changes in job retention rates, reporting

estimated four-year retention rates for subgroups of workers for whom previous research has

documented changes in relative wages. First, we provide retention rates for college graduates

versus high school graduates and high school dropouts. Overall, the latter group experienced a

slight drop in the retention rate, from .48 to .47, while college graduates experienced an increase,

from .58 to .59. These results differ somewhat once we classify by tenure in the base year, with

the biggest relative change occurring for those with six or more years of tenure. Blacks

experienced larger drops in retention rates overall, and for each tenure group. Overall, retention

rates fell slightly for both men and women.'9

       Figures 3-A to 3-D provide a more in-depth look at changes in retention rates by

schooling group; they show the percent change in retention rates for each demographic group, by

tenure, by age group. Because the sample sizes become rather small, the confidence intervals

for these changes are rather wide. Thus, for example, looking at all tenure groups together, in

Figure 3-D, while the point estimates indicate that retention rates for college graduates increased


      The exponential survivor function is e', for which expected duration is 1/A. Our four-
year retention rate is an estimate of e. Thus, for example, the estimate of .51 in the last
column of Table 2 implies an estimate of A of .17, for which expected duration is 5.9.
       It may be surprising that four-year retention rates are not lower for women. Hall
(3982) estimated that in 1978, men were 30 percent more likely to reach five or more years
of tenure. However, Ureta's (1992) estimates that conect for changes in arrival rates imply
that the correct figure is 22 percent. Also, neither of these estimates fully captures the
increased attachment to the labor force of women who entered in the 1980s (e.g., Light and
Ureta, 1992).

                                                 14
relative to high school graduates and dropouts for workers through age 55, the increase is not

statistically significant for any age group. Figures 3-B and 3-C, for workers with 3-6 and 6÷

years of tenure, respectively, suggest the same qualitative conclusion. In Figure 3-C the increase

is statistically significant for workers aged 26-35.

        Figures 4-A to 4-D provide similar information for blacks and whites. In all cases, the

point estimates indicate that retention rates for whites increased somewhat relative to those for

blacks, except for the oldest workers. But given the small sample sizes for blacks, the increases

are never statistically significant.

C1assfication by Industry and Occupation
       We now turn to estimates of retention rates classified by characteristics of jobs, rather

than characteristics of workers, as shown in Table 4. The relative decline in blue-collar,

manufacturing jobs is frequently bemoaned as heralding the disappearance of stable, high-paying

jobs for less-educated workers (Bluestone and Harrison, 1986 and 1988). This classification by

industry and occupation provides evidenceon the relative stability of alternative jobs, and it is

useful for assessing whether changes in the industrial and occupational composition of the

workforce can explain the decreases in retention rates (however small) that have been

documented in some of the previous figures.

       The overall retention rate increased by .02 in the goods-producing sector and fell by .06

in the service-producing sector. In addition, retention rates were, and still are, higher in the

service-producing than in the goods-producing industries, suggesting that shifts away from

goods-producing jobs do not lead to less stable jobs. Next, the retention rates classified by blue-

collar and white-collar/service workers reveal that retention rates are generally slightly lower for

less-tenured workers in white-collar and service occupations, although this relationship is

reversed for more-tenured workers. Overall, however, retention rates are higher for white-collar

                                                 15
and service occupations, and decrease only for blue—collar occupations.

       En the following rows of Table 4, we classify by subgroups of white-collar and service

occupations. Not surprisingly, retention rates are highest for professional and technical workers,

and are lower by a substantial amount for clerical workers, and lower still for service workers.

Furthermore, while retention rates on average increase slightly for professional and technical

workers, they decrease slightly for the other occupations. Finally, for 1983-1987, the retention

rare in service occupations is lower than that in blue-collar occupations, suggesting that workers

who moved from blue-collar to service jobs may have entered less stable jobs. On the other

hand, by 1987—I 991, the retention rate in blue-collar occupations had nearly fallen to that in

service occupations.

A Longer-Term View: Ten-Year Retention Rates

       To this point, all our results refer to four-year retention rates for the spans 1983-1987 and

1987-199!. We devote most of our attention to these spans because they can be calculated and

compared using a consistent job tenure question, as explained in Section 2. However, we also

argued that ten-year retention rates for 1973-1983 and 1981-1991 could be compared

meaningfully, because for each of these spans we begin with the first form of the tenure question

and end with the second. Thus, at a minimum, we should be able to compare meaningfully the

changes in ten-year retention rates.

        Table 5 reports ten-year retention rates, which parallel those in Table 2 for four-year

retention rates. For all tenure groups, not surprisingly, the estimated ten-year retention rates are

considerably lower than the four-year retention rates. Interestingly, however, ten-yearretention

 rates increase slightly for all tenure groups; the average increase over all workers is .01. Thus,

 in contrast to the point estimates of four-year retention rates for the 1980s, which suggest

 slightly declining job stability, the point estimates of ten-year retention rates for the l970s and

                                                   16
1980s suggest slightly rising job stability. The differences across four- and ten-year spans may

occur either because four- and ten-year retention rates changed differently, or because the 1970s

were different from the 1 980s.

       Figures 5-A to 5-D provide a more in-depth view, classifying by age as well. For

workers with 0-3 and 3-6 years of tenure, ten-year retention rates increased for some age groups

and fell for others. For workers with six or more years of tenure, however, a decrease in

retention rates is observed for workers in their forties. Figure 5-D reveals that the increase in

retention rates is statistically significant for workers aged 21 to 30.



4. Conclusion

        In our view, the general conclusion to emerge from our study is the approximate srabthty

of aggregate job retention rates over the 1980s and early 1990s, in contrast to pronounced shifts

in the wage distribution. However, disaggregation by current tenure, age, race, sex, education

and occupation reveals some changes in four-year retention rates by demographic group that

correspond loosely to changes in the wage structure. In particular, reteation rates have declined

for high school dropouts and high school graduates relative to college graduates, and for blacks

relative to whites. However, except for the aggregate results for blacks, most of these changes

are small and statistically insignificant.

        Differences also emerge depending on the span examined. Using four-year spans in the

 1980s and early 1990s, for example, we fmd evidence of slight decreases in job retention rates in

certain segments of the U.S. labor market, and slight increases in others. Our preferred

estimates indicate that the overall four-year retention rate decreased from .53 for 1983-1987 to

 51 for 1987-1991. An analysis of ten-year retention rates for 1973-1983 and 1981-1991,

however, indicates that longer-term job stability increased slightly in the 1980s and early l990s

                                                   17
relative to the 1970s. Our preferred estimates indicate that the overall ten-year retention rate

increased from .26 for 1973-1983 to .27 for 1981-1991.

       Taken as a whole, the evidence to date certainly does not point toward a secular decline

in job stability. However, there is some evidence of relative declines in job stability for those

groups that experienced the sharpest relative wage declines over the sample period. It will be o

obvious interest to extend this analysis with future CPS tenure supplements.
