     Finite Lifetimes and the Crowding Out Effects of Government Deficits




                                   ABSTRACT




    This note explores the sensitivity of the short-run savings effects of

government deficits to assumptions about household planning horizons. Using a

lifecycle simulation model, we show that even though deficit policies shift

sizable tax burdens to future generations, individuals live long enough to make

the assumption of an infinite horizon a good approximation for analyzing the

short—run savings effects. In practice, periods of debt accumulation such as

that in the United States during World War II are reversed sufficiently rapidly

to make their short—run effects on consumption and national savings relatively

small.

    At least since Ricardo, economists have wrestled with the dual questions

of whether or not government bonds represent net wealth, and whether govern-

ment deficits affect national savings. The answers are far from obvious. James

Tobin (1952) asked rhetorically, "How is it possible that society merely by the

device of incurring a debt to itself can deceive itself into believing that it

is wealthier? Do not the additional taxes which are necessary to carry the

interest charges reduce the value of other components of private wealth? There

must certainly be effects in this direction." While Tobin (1980) concluded

these effects are small, the economic effects of government indebtedness remain

controversial,

     The argument that government debt does not represent net wealth may be

stated simply. While government bonds represent an asset to those holding them,

they represent a liability to taxpayers who must ultimately redeem them. These

assets and liabilities exactly offset each other; barring distributional effects

the existence of government debt should not affect total spending. A major

counter-argument, developed by Modigliani (1961) and Diamond (1965) among others,

suggests that debt does represent net wealth to the extent that the asset of

present generations is offset by a liability of unborn future generations.

     Robert Barro (1974) challenged this counter-argument by suggesting that any

burdens shifted to future generations may be offset by intergenerational trans-

fers. His article spawned a continuing debate on the so-called Ricardian

equivalence proposition. A substantial part of this debate has centered on

intergenerational economic linkages; whether transfer motives give consumers

effectively infinite horizons has been seen as a critical issue. The implicit

assumption in this debate has been that if appropriate linkages do not exist,
                                        —2—


 then debt burdens can be shifted to future generations and government deficits
                                              -



 affect national savings.

      This   note examines the quantitative importance of intergenerational link-

 ages for analyzing the short-run effects of govirnment deficits on national

 savings. The view that deficits significantly alter national savings lies

 behind the frequent assertions that they crowd out investment and reduce inter-

 national competitiveness. Our purpose is not to evaluate these claims, but

 rather to explore the limited question of whether or not the intergenerational

transfers induced by deficits, taken alone, are sufficient to justify them.

     Our conclusion is that while deficit policies like those the United States

has historically followed shift substantial tax burdens to future generations,

this effect is not large enough to significantly alter national savings in the

short run. The extent and nature of bequest motives are therefore of secondary

importance for judging whether deficits have short—run crowding out effects,

even though they are primary determinants of the 'ong—run effects of deficits.

     This note is divided into three sections. The first uses a stylized

lifecycle simulation model to show that actual human lifetimes
                                                                 are long enough
so that for purposes of analyzing the short-run effects of fiscal policies,

they can be approximated as infinite. This is true even though deficits can

have a potentially large impact on long-run capital intensity. Section II

reviews the U.S. experience on debt repayment policy, a critical factor in ana-

lyzing the long-run effects of these policies. We focus on World War II and

show that roughly two-thirds of the war debt was repaid within the lifetimes of

persons in the working population during the war. There is a brief conclusion.

I.   Deficit Policy in Lifecycle Models

     We use a lifecycle model to compute the net wealth effects of the govern-

ment debt accumulated during deficit periods, and to calculate the short-run

effect of deficits on national savings.1 We assume that agents work for the

first 1' years of their lives, and then retire for the final I -   1' years. In
our calculations, T = 55 and T' = 45.

     The government can finance expenditures either by levying taxes or by issu-

ing debt. We consider deficit policies which, for K years, transfer one dollar

to each living person.2 The government finances these expenditures with debt,

and beginning in year K + 1, it levies lump-sum taxes on working individuals to

meet its interest payments and maintain a target debt level.3   The assumption

that taxes are levied only on those who are still in the labor force is ex-

tremely generous to the view that models with finite lifetimes yield different

results about national savings than models with infinite horizons, since it

strengthens the positive relationship between an individual's marginal propen-

sity to consume and his net wealth increment from the deficit policy.

     We consider two possible government debt targets: one holds constant the

real debt stock, while the other holds constant the real debt stock per capita.

For each repayment policy, we compute the deficit's net wealth increment for a

person of age a, designated dW(a) and dW'(a) in the constant real debt and con-

stant real per capita debt cases, respectively.

     For individuals who are retired when the government begins a period of

deficit finance (a > 1') or who will be retired when it begins to levy the taxes

to finance the deficit (a > V -   K), the repayment policy does not affect their
net wealth increment:
                                   r                            aT-K
  dW(a) =   dW'(a) =                                                                     (1)

For younger agents, the repayment policy does matter. Their net wealth incre-

ments are given by:


                       -rK              -nK —rK

and

                                                                         a < T'    —   K. (2b)
                                               )(1e


      The aggregate wealth effect of a deficit policy is a weighted average of

the wealth effects in (1) and (2), with weights equal to the population shares

of the different age cohorts. Tablet reports the aggregate wealth increments

associated with a one—year deficit policy. If all of the taxes used to finance

the deficit were levied after the transfer recipients had died, the entries in

the table would be 1.0. The results suggest that for the two debt repayment

policies we consider, the present value of the associated tax payments are sub-

stantially less than half of the initial transfer. In economies with a popula-

tion growth rate of one percent, a one dollar transfer followed by a constant

real debt policy raises net wealth by an average of 85 cents if the real inter-

est rate is .01, by 65 cents if r=.03, and by 53 cents i-f r=.0S. If the govern-

ment targets real debt per capita, then the net wealth effects for these three
                                        —5—


real interest rates are 100 cents, 77 cents, and 63 cents, respectively. These

results, along with similar calculations for other parameter values, suggest

that deficit policies may transfer substantial tax burdens to future generations.

     To analyze whether these wealth transfers are accompanied by substantial

crowding out of contemporaneous investment, however, we must consider the asso-

ciated changes in national savings. We do this assuming that agents maximize

additively separable constant—elasticity utility functions


     V(a) =
              f   [c(t)T/y] e_t_dt                                               (3)


where & is the time preference rate, subject to the standard life—cycle budget

constraint,

     W(a) =       c(t) e_r(t dt                                                  (4)


where W(a) is age-a person's wealth. For this specification of preferences, the

marginal propensity to consume out of wealth is (0 -    r)/(e°"T       -
                                                                           1),
where 0 =   (r—6)/(1-y)   is the agent's consumption growth rate. Since agents of

different ages have different marginal propensities to consume, the age distri-

bution plays an important part in determining the short-run consumption effects

of deficit policies. We calculate the aggregate consumption effect by multi-

plying each cohort's wealth increment, computed as in (1) and (2), by its margi-

nal propsensity to consume and weighting the resulting consumption changes by

population shares.

     The first column of Table 2 shows the per capita consumption changes asso-

ciated with a one year, one dollar per capita deficit policy. With a real

interest rate of .03, a population growth rate of .01, and a consumption growth
                                       -6-


 rate of .03, per capita consumption spending rises by either 6.1 or 6.5 cents,

depending upon the debt repayment policy. A more realistic five year deficit

policy raises consumption by only 22 cents assuming the same parameter values.

Although the choice of parameter values and whtchdebt repayment policy the

government pursues can affect the short-run consumption -change by one or two

cents, these choices do not alter the general conclusion that deficits lead to

trivial changes in consumption spending.

     These results are very similar to those which would obtain in an infinite-

horizon model. With stationary population, an infinite—lived agent would not

change his consumption at all in response to the deficit policies we have con-

sidered. With population growth, however, the current generation does benefit

through its ability to share future taxes with as yet unborn generations. For

the parameter values we have chosen, this effect-Would lead to roughly a one

cent increase in consumption by an infinite-lived consumer.

     The central feature of the lifecycle model which explains our small short—

run consumption effects is that for all but the oldest consumers, the marginal

propensity to consume out of wealth is relative1y small. Even if the government

provided transfer payments to all currently living agents and financed them with

taxes levied after the youngest members of the current generation died, the

upper bound on the short—run consumption effect would be the population—weighted

average of marginal propensities to consume. Assuming the real interest rate is

three percent, this weighted average is .082 when n=.O1 and 0 =   .01,   and .072

                     .03.
                                                   -
                                 -
when n=.01 and 0 =                             -       -


     It   is essential to recognize that we have focused on the short—run savings
                                     —1—


effects of government deficits. To evaluate their long—run capital intensity

effects, we must account for the legacy of increased debt which remains even

after the budget is balanced. Absent altruistic bequest motives, this debt

raises household wealth, increases consumption, and decreases savings. Although

in any given year these savings effects may be small, they cumulate over time.

Simulation results presented in Auerbach and Kotlikoff (1986) suggest that defi-

cits may have sizable effects on the long—run capital stock. Future research

should explore these long run effects in greater detail.


II. Evaluating Historical Debt Repayment Experience

     Throughout our simulation exercises, we have assumed that the government

never repays the debt principal. This biases our short—run consumption effects

upwards, and generates a larger wealth increment from deficits, than more

realistic repayment policies might suggest. In practice, periods of rapid debt

accumulation tend to be followed by debt repayment.

    Actual repayment experience is illustrated in Table 3, which shows the path

of real debt per capita after three wars which were financed with heavy govern-

ment borrowing.4 Real debt per capita fell by nearly 47 percent in the two

decades following the Civil War, and by 57 percent during a similar period after

World War II. The experience after World War I is clouded by the onset of the

Great Depression only ten years afterwards. In 1929, however, the real debt

stock per capita had fallen forty-five percent relative to its level in 1919.

The deflation of the 1930s, coupled with debt—financed fiscal policy, led to a

pronounced increase in the real debt stock and by 1939, real debt per capita was
                                      —8-


over thirty percent greater than it was in 1919. Nonetheless, it seems reason-

able to regard the Depression period as something of an outlier and to conclude

from these data that repayment following debt growth is often quite rapid.

     We illustrate this point by considering the aftermath of World War II in

more detail. We calculate the fraction of the war debt which individuals of

different ages in 1945 would have expected to repay if they had anticipated the

path of real deficits over the next thirty years.5 For each year between 1946

and 1970, we compute the per capita change in the real debt outstanding, Abt.

We compute the expected present value of these repayments, viewed from 1945,

using survival probabilities drawn from the 1950 U.S. life table and discounting

the sequence of expected repayments using the path of realized real Treasury

bill rates. The expected present value of debt repayments for an age—a indivi—
                                    1970
dual in 1945 is therefore dW(a) =      S(a,i)R(i)Ab. where S(a,t) denotes the
                                  i=1946
probability that an individual of age a in 1945 would still be alive in year t

and R(i) is the i—year discount factor viewed from the perspective of 1945.

     The results of this calculation are shown in the first column of Table 4.

An individual aged twenty at the end of the war could expect to repay 72.9 per-

cent of the war debt within his lifetime.6 This fraction is relatively insen-

sitive to the individual's age. For a fifty year old, the expected repayment

fraction was 67.0 percent. An individual would have to have been at least 75

years old in 1945 to expect to escape half of the war debt repayments, and even

an eighty-year-old could expect to repay 43.3 percent of the war debt. On

average, one additional dollar of debt at the end of the war constituted only a

thirty—two cent increment to net wealth. This is less than half as large as the
                                     -9.-




estimates suggested by our calculations in the last section.

     To illustrate how wartime debt accumulation may have influenced consumption

and savings, the second column in Table 4 reports the change in consumption

which would have resulted if the United States government had repudiated its war

debts in 1946. The consumption effects, measured in 1912 dollars, range from a

decrease of $18.86 for twenty year olds, to a fall of $115.34 for persons aged

seventy, to a consumption drop of over three hundred dollars for an eighty-year-

old. The aggregate reduction in per capita consumption, however, would only

have been about $40. By comparison, per capita consumption in 1946 was $2604

dollars; even a dramatic policy such as debt repudiation would therefore have

caused only a 1.5 percent decline in aggregate consumption under the maintained

lifecycle hypothesis. These results suggest that the short-run savings effects

of government deficits are therefore even smaller than indicated by our simula-

tion results in the last section.


III. Conclusion

     Our calculations suggest that for analyzing the short-run savings effects

of government deficits, little of substance hangs on the presence or absence of

intergenerational linkages. In the absence of population growth, an infinite

lived consumer would not change his consumption at all in response to a govern-

ment deficit. In realistic lifecycle models, we find that each dollar of

government deficit will raise household consumption by roughly five cents. The

distinction between finite and infinite horizon models, which has been stressed

in much of the Ricardian equivalence debate, is therefore of little empirical
                                      —10—


 importance for analyzing the short-run savings effects of budget deficits.

      While the ability of debtpolicies to shift tax burdens to future gener-

ations does not justify a conclusion that deficits have a significant short-run

 impact on national savings, there exist a number of other
                                                             arguments supporting
this conclusion. First, tax cuts may portend future spending reductions because

of the political response to deficits or tax smoothing as suggested by Barro

 (1979). Consumers who internalize the government's budget constraint will then

feel richer and reduce their saving. This implies that even proponents of

Ricardian equivalence should regard current fiscal policies as having poten-

tially important effects on national savings. Second, a large body of evidence

suggests -the excess sensitivity of consumption to income changes. If this

reflects liquidity constraints or consumer myopia, then current tax reductions

financed by future tax increases are likely to raise consumption. Third, actual

taxes are not lump sum levies. Barsky, Mankiw, -and Zeldes (1985) argue that

deficit policies may raise consumption because they reduce the precautionary

demand for savings. In practice, the tax changes associated with deficits may

give rise to intertemporai substitution effects of the type studied in Auerbach

and Kotlikoff (1986). Future work should concentrate on measuring the empirical.

significance of these and other channels linking deficits and national savings.

    1.  Similar experiments could be performed in Blanchard's (1985) finite
horizon model.

    2. Our calculations assume that the primary deficit rises by one dollar
each year for each living person. This corresponds to an even larger change in
the measured deficit in our multi-year experiments, since the interest payments
on debt incurred in the first few years of the policy must also be financed by
borrowing.

    3. We assume that these taxes have no effect on labor force participation
decisions.

    4. Detailed information on the measurement and behavior of real government
debt in both the U.S. and the U.K. may be found in Barro (1984).

    5. Our calculations ignore a number of other policy changes in the post—war
period which have induced substantial intergenerational transfers. The most
important of these is the liberalization of Social Security benefits, a reform
which had it been anticipated in 1945 would have raised the wealth increment
for that generation.

    6. We assume that all debt repayments were applied to the accumulated war
debt, biasing our conclusion toward the finding that debt repayment was rapid.
War debt accounted for 74.5 percent of the outstanding real debt in 1945. If we
assumed that outstanding debts of all vintages were paid off proportionately
after the war, our calculations in Table 4 would show that expected debt
repayments equalled .504 of the war-time borrowing.

    7. We assume that all debt is domestically held. This exaggerates our
estimates of how repudiation affects consumption, since actual repudiation would
also effect a transfer from foreign debt holders to U.S. citizens.

Notes: Data on outstanding stock of publicly—held interest-bearing federal debt
        are drawn from Historical Statistics of the United States and the
        Federal Reserve Bulletin. The population measure is number of persons
        aged 16-plus, again drawn from Historical Statistics. The price level
        is the personal consumption deflator for the World War II episode, the
        all-commodities Consumer Price Index for World War 1, and the Warren-
