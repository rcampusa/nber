Identification of a Class of Health-Outcome Distributions under a Common Form of Partial
Data Observability
John Mullahy
NBER Working Paper No. 26011
June 2019
JEL No. C25,I1

                                          ABSTRACT

This paper suggests analytical strategies for obtaining informative parameter bounds when
multivariate health-outcome data are partially observed in a particular yet common manner. One
familiar context is where M>1 health outcomes' respective totals across N>1 time periods are
observed but where questions of interest involve features--probabilities, moments, etc.--of their
unobserved joint distribution at each of the N time periods. For instance, one might wish to
understand the distribution of any type of unhealthy day experienced over a month but have
access only to the separate totals of physically unhealthy and mentally unhealthy days that are
experienced. After demonstrating methods to bound, or partially identify, such distributions and
related parameters under several sampling assumptions, the paper proceeds to derive bounds on
partial effects involving exogenous covariates. These results are applied in three empirical
exercises. Whether the proposed bounds prove to be sufficiently narrow to usefully inform
decisionmakers can only be determined in context, although it is suggested in the paper's
conclusion that the issues considered in this paper are likely to become increasingly important for
analysts.

               The Red Queen said, 'That's a poor thin way of doing things. Now
               here, we mostly have days and nights two or three at a time, and
               sometimes in the winter we take as many as five nights together--
               for warmth, you know.'

1. Introduction

       Various health surveys pose questions like:


       Q1. For how many of the past 30 days was your physical health not good? ...was your
               mental health not good?
       Q2. On how many of the past seven days did you engage in vigorous exercise? ...in
               moderate exercise?
       Q3. On how many of the past 30 days did you smoke cigarettes? ...use electronic vapor
               products? ...use smokeless tobacco?


Responses to questions like these1 reveal some information about how such health indicators are
distributed, but do not identify the distribution of related outcomes like:


       O1. the number of days on which neither physical nor mental health was good
       O2. the number of days on which some exercise was undertaken
       O3. the number of days on which some tobacco-related substance was used


1
  Similar outcome structures are encountered in clinical settings. For instance, treatments for
chronic or episodic migraine may focus on the numbers of monthly migraine days and headache
days as outcomes to be assessed (Goadsby et al., 2017; International Headache Society, 2013).




                                                 1
That is, the outcome data are only partially observed in the sense that the specific day-by-day
joint distribution of the vector of outcomes is not revealed by responses to questions like Q1-Q3.
       It is possible, however, to bound informatively features of probability distributions of
outcomes like O1-O3 as well as partial effects of covariates thereon. This paper demonstrates
how such bounds can be derived from responses to questions like Q1-Q3 when the responses to
Q1-Q3 are themselves either fully (sections 2-4) or partially (section 5) observed.
       While this paper is motivated by--and will explore empirically--particular questions
where multiple health outcomes or health behaviors are realized over multiple time units, the
analytical approaches suggested here are generally applicable. The generic setting is one where
each of N2 units may experience any of M2 possible binary events. The available data do not
reveal whether any particular event m occurs for any particular unit n, but the total number of
each of the m events occurring across the N units is known. The outcome of interest is whether
a typical unit experiences any event, and the analytical goal is to learn features of the
probability distribution of the number of units experiencing any event. While one is not directly
able to learn this from the data, these probabilities can in general be bounded informatively.
       Section 2 provides the formal structure, notation, and main results regarding bounds on
probabilities, expectations, and quantiles. Section 3 illustrates these ideas with two microdata
samples. Section 4 shows how corresponding bounds on partial effects for these parameters can
be derived. Section 5 considers the situation where only categorical responses are available ("set-
measured" outcomes), demonstrates how bounds can be derived in such circumstances. Section 6
summarizes.


2. Bounds with Point-Measured Outcomes

Assumptions and Preliminaries

        y m,n  {0,1} are the outcomes of interest, with m  {1, ..., M} , n  {1, ..., N} , and M and

N finite, positive integers. For example y m,n = 1 if outcome m occurs on day n and is zero

                                                                    (         )       ( )
otherwise. Ym =  y m,n  are N-vectors with joint distribution Pr Y1, ..., YM i = Pr Y i where i
                       
is a placeholder for possible conditioning on covariates (a consideration addressed in section 4).
To reduce clutter i is understood but suppressed until section 4.



                                                 2
       Define M = {1, ..., M} , N = {0, ..., N} , and N + = {1, ..., N} . The y m,n are not observed

so the joint distribution Pr (Y ) is not identified with the available data. Further, define



                             
        Sn = 1  m M
                    y m,n > 0 ,        n  N+                                                    (1)

and
                                                         
        S =    n N   +
                         Sn =    n N   +
                                           1
                                             mM y m,n > 0.
                                                         
                                                                                                (2)



Note that S  N and further that neither the Sn nor S are observable. S is the outcome of

interest: the number of positive realizations of the binary events Sn over N .                 Each Sn

indicates whether at least one of the outcomes y m,n is positive at n, for example whether any

type of unhealthy day is experienced on day n. The results to follow can be modified to consider
                              
                    mM m,n
more general Sn = 1   y    > c but for simplicity the focus is on the baseline case c=0.
                              

       The paper's main goal is to demonstrate the use of observable data to identify as tightly
as possible the probability distribution of S across n, n  N .2 It is of interest to learn when

Pr (S = n) can be point-identified or, when it cannot, to learn the best bounds that can be

obtained for set identification. Primary interest may be in identification of the probabilities

Pr (S = n) themselves or in moments or quantiles of this distribution; moreover interest may

focus on the marginal distribution of S or on its distribution conditional on some covariates x.

       To this end define y m =  nN y m,n , and let y =  y1, ..., yM  have joint distribution
                                   +                                 

Pr (y) , which is assumed to be identified nonparametrically by the data. The y m are observable

in one of two possible ways. The first is where the y m are fully or point measured, i.e. where



2
  In the specific context where n indexes time units (days), this translates into identifying the
distribution of the number of time units (days) on which no or, reciprocally, any event occurs.




                                                  3
each y m is observed exactly as one element in the set N . The second is set measurement,

where the true value of y m is known to sit in one of P  N mutually exclusive and exhaustive

subsets of N but where the exact value of the y m may not be known. Until section 5 the

paper focuses on point-measured y m , but at that juncture set-measured y m are considered.

          Table 1 summarizes the structure of the data. The cells highlighted in orange are the
observables when the data are point measured.


                                          [Table 1 about here]


          It will turn out that in general the bounds derived here are informative, i.e. the bounds

intervals LB, UB are narrower than the theoretically possible values of the parameters of
                
interest. Whether they are sufficiently tight to be useful will depend on the context. Moreover,
the focus throughout the paper is on bounds for population parameters, which bounds will
themselves be population parameters. While analogy principle estimators (Manski, 1988) are
generally available for estimating these bounds, attention in this paper is devoted to
identification rather than estimation and inference.


Bounds on Probabilities

          This subsection considers bounds on Pr (S = n) , n  N . Define A =        {q   qNM   }. A
contains all the vector values that can be assumed by y; e.g., with M=2 and N=2

      {                                                  }
A = 0, 0 , 1, 0 , 2, 0 , 0,1 , 1,1 , 2,1 , 0, 2 , 1, 2 , 2, 2 . For n  N define
                     


                     {q    q  A, max mM {q m } = n,       mM q m = n },       n<N
          L (n) =                                                                          (3)
                  
                  
                  
                     {q    q  A, max mM {q m } = n ,     }                    n=N
                  
and

          U (n) =   {q    q  A, max mM {q m }  n,     mM q m  n } .                        (4)



                                                     4
Then the best bounds on Pr (S = n) available without additional assumptions are given by



                      (          )       (
       PrL (n) = LB Pr (S = n) = Pr y  L (n)         )                                  (5)

and

                       (
       PrU (n) = UB Pr (S = n)   )        (
                                     = Pr y  U (n) . )                                  (6)



       Intuitively, for any n  N L (n) contains the elements of A that must correspond to

S=n. These vectors will have one element equal to n and all other M­1 elements equal to zero.
No other vectors in A have the property that the sum of their elements necessarily corresponds
to S=n even though some of these other vectors in A could correspond to S=n. Conversely

U (n) is the set of vectors in A that could correspond to S=n but do not necessarily correspond

to S=n. These vectors contain no element greater than n (else S would be greater than n), and
will contain elements whose sum is at least n (else S would be less than n).

       The sizes of the sets L (n) and U (n) depend on n and M:



                  1,
                                  n=0
                 
       # L (n) =  M,              n  {1, ..., N - 1}                                    (7)
                 
                          M
                 
                  ( n + 1) - n M, n=N

and
                  1,
                                                n=0
                 
       # U (n) =          M  M + n -1                                                   (8)
                  ( n + 1) -                  , n  N+
                                              
                                M             
                 



Note further that Pr (S = 0) is point identified. That is, y=0--which is observable--is the only

possible outcome corresponding to S=0. For n  N + the width of the bounds interval

Pr (n), Pr (n) will generally exceed zero in the absence of additional narrowing assumptions.
 L        U   



                                                 5
            In some instances determining bounds for a set of possible values of S, not just for single
values, may be of interest.3 If so, bounds on the relevant set probabilities can be obtained as
follows. Let V  N be the set of interest and, analogous to (3) and (4), define



            Lv (V ) =   {q   q  A, max mM {q m }  V, min      { mM q m , N}  V }                 (9)

and

            Uv (V ) =  nV U (n) .                                                                (10)

Then

               (             )   (
            LB Pr (S  V ) = Pr y  Lv (V ) )                                                      (11)

and

               (             )    (
            UB Pr (S  V ) = Pr y  Uv (V ) . )                                                    (12)



While the upper bounds (12) are obtained as unions of the upper-bound sets (4) across all the
elements of V , the lower bounds (11) cannot be computed directly from (3). For instance,

suppose M=2, N=3, and V = {1, 2} . While neither L (1) = 1, 0 , 0,1
                                                                    {        }               {
                                                                                 nor L (2) = 2, 0 , 0, 2
                                                                                                           }
contains q = 1,1 since this value of q could correspond to either S=1 or S=2, the set Lv {1, 2}
                                                                                                  (        )
does contain q = 1,1 since this value of q must correspond to either S=1 or S=2.
                  


Bounds on Moments

            The r-th moment4 of Pr (S) is defined for any r>0 and is given by:


3
    E.g., the outcome of interest may be a dichotomization of S, 1(S  t) for some threshold t,

                                                (         )   (
with the parameter of interest being Pr 1(S  t) = Pr S  {t, ..., N} ).   )
4
    Before deriving bounds for moments of Pr (S) it will prove helpful to describe some general

results. Suppose for a set of generic parameters  =  j        { } lower and upper bounds, LB( j) and
      ( )                                           ( )
UB  j , have been determined. Suppose h  j is a smooth, monotone function. Then:
                                                                                                  (cont.)


                                                          6
          E Sr  =  nN n r × Pr (S = n) .                                                                (13)
             



Since (13) is of the form (from footnote 4)          j h j ( j )   with  j = Pr (S = n) and h ' > 0 one might

                                           
reasonably consider obtaining bounds on E Sr  as
                                           



                (    )
          LB E Sr  =  nN n r × PrL (n)
                
                                                                                                        (14)

and

                (    )
          UB E Sr  =  nN n r × PrU (n) .
                
                                                                                                        (15)



                                   
          While these bounds on E Sr  will generally be valid, they will also generally not be the

        Intuitions for these results may be gleaned by reference to an example summarized in
table 2 that describes a case with M=2 and N=3. The cells in panel A of table 2 display the

joint probabilities Pr (y) = Pr (y1, y2 ) atop the values of S that could possibly correspond to each

(y1, y2 ) combination.   Note that S  {0,1, 2, 3} . Panel B of table 2 shows for this example the

corresponding probabilities PrL (n) , PrE,L (n) , PrU (n) , and PrE,U (n) .

        Compare first the columns headed PrL (n) and PrE,L (n) . The entries are the same for

S=0 and S=3. For S=1 and S=2 the PrE,L (n) summands contain probabilities that are absent

everywhere in the PrL (n) column (these are shown in blue and orange). These probabilities are

absent for PrL (n) since they correspond to values of (y1, y2 ) associated with multiple possible

values of S. Conversely they appear for PrE,L (n) since they are assigned to the smallest possible

such values of S to make the smallest possible contributions to the weighted sum in (22); only
when assigned thusly can it be assured that (22) will always be a valid lower bound. Thus

PrE,L (n)  PrL (n) for all n, so that the lower bound in (22) is at least as large as that in (14).

        Using analogous reasoning, consider for the upper bound the columns in panel B headed

PrU (n) and PrE,U (n) . The joint probabilities corresponding to values of (y1, y2 ) that could

correspond to multiple possible values of S are assigned to the largest possible such S. While

such probabilities (those shown in blue and orange) appear multiple times in the PrU (n)

column, they appear once and only once in the PrE,U (n) column. Thus PrE,U (n)  PrU (n) , so

that the upper bound in (23) is no larger than the upper bound in (15).

        Note that probabilities in the PrE,L (n) and PrE,U (n) columns sum to one, whereas those

in the PrL (n) and PrU (n) columns sum to less than and more than one, respectively.5

  Moreover, for E S note that (22) and (23) are algebraically equivalent to what might be some
                    
readers' intuitive approach of defining a lower bound on E S as

Bounds on Quantiles
          One use of the set-probability bounds in (11) and (12) is in determining bounds on

quantiles of Pr (S) . Define for   (0,1) the  -quantile of Pr (S) as

           qA Pr (y = q)× min {  mM q m,       N   }.

3. Two Empirical Examples

       The first example uses a sample of 399,155 subjects ages 25+ from the 2017 Behavioral
Risk Factors Surveillance System (BRFSS). 6 The outcomes of interest are health status
outcomes measured by responses to these questions:


       Now thinking about your physical health, which includes physical illness and
       injury, for how many days during the past 30 days was your physical health not
       good?

       Now thinking about your mental health, which includes stress, depression, and
       problems with emotions, for how many days during the past 30 days was your
       mental health not good?


As such M=2 and N=30. The sample distributions Pr (y m = n) of the two outcomes are

depicted in figure 1. In this application S is the number of days (out of 30) on which individuals
are either physically unhealthy or mentally unhealthy.


                                          [Figure 1 about here]



       Of interest are bounds on Pr (S = n) for n  N , on E S and Var (S) , and on the
                                                             

quantiles QS () . Applying the results from section 2 provides these bounds. The bounds on

E S are displayed in panel A of table 3, the bounds on the quantiles QS () are shown in panel
   

B, and the bounds on the Pr (S = n) are depicted in figure 2 and tabulated in table A1. The

bounds interval for E S is .47 days. Lower and upper bounds on Var (S) are 96.6 and 117.6.
                       


                                [Figure 2 and Table 3 about here]


       The second example is based on a sample of 6,777 adults ages 25+ from the 2015 Health
Survey of England (HSE). 7 The outcomes of interest are three forms of physical activity
measured by responses to these questions:


       Think about the time you spent walking in the last 7 days. This includes at work
       and at home, walking to travel from place to place, and any other walking that you
       have done solely for recreation, sport, exercise, or leisure. During the last 7 days,
       on which days did you walk for at least 10 minutes at a time?

       Think about all the moderate activities that you did in the last 7 days. Moderate
       activities refer to activities that take moderate physical effort and make you
       breathe somewhat harder than normal. Think only about those physical activities
       that you did for at least 10 minutes at a time. During the last 7 days, on which
       days did you do moderate physical activities like:
                -- Digging in the garden,
                -- Spring cleaning or other heavy housework,
                -- Gentle swimming or cycling?

       Think about all the vigorous activities that you did in the last 7 days. Vigorous
       physical activities refer to activities that take hard physical effort and make you
       breathe much harder than normal. Think only about those physical activities that
       you did for at least 10 minutes at a time. During the last 7 days, on which days
       did you do vigorous physical activities like:
              -- Running,
              -- Fast cycling,
              -- A workout at the gym that makes you out of breath or sweaty?


Thus M=3 and N=7. S is the number of days (of seven) on which individuals engage in any
form of physical activity. The sample distributions of the three outcomes are shown in figure 3.

       The 2015 HSE is particularly interesting because it provides information not only on the
seven-day totals of vigorous, moderate, and walking exercise days but also indicates on which
specific day(s) each exercise type occurred.8 That is, the data are fully, not partially, observed.
This sample was chosen to illustrate how bounds derived as if the data were only partially

       The bounds on and observed values of E S are displayed in Panel A of table 4 while the
                                               

bounds on and observed values of the quantiles QS () are shown in that table's panel B. The

corresponding results for each Pr (S = n) are pictured in figure 4 and presented in detail in table

A2. The bounds interval for E S is .41 days, while the bounds on Var (S) are computed to be
                               

3.1 and 11.4 (the observed value of Var (S) is 7.1).

4. Bounding Partial Effects

       Obtaining informative bounds on parameters may sometimes prove sufficient to answer
questions at hand. Typical in applied health economics, however, are questions involving partial

effects (PEs) of covariates x on conditional-on-x versions of such parameters,  (x) . Building on

section 2, this section describes strategies for obtaining bounds on such PEs.
       Consider the discrete partial effects,

8
  Time patterns are considered relevant features of individuals' physical activities. For example,
the USDHHS Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans (USDHHS, 2018) recommends:
       For substantial health benefits, adults should do at least 150 minutes (2 hours and
       30 minutes) to 300 minutes (5 hours) a week of moderate-intensity, or 75 minutes
       (1 hour and 15 minutes) to 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) a week of
       vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of
       moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity. Preferably, aerobic activity
       should be spread throughout the week. [emphasis added]

straddle zero.

       Bounds on continuous PEs,  (x )  x , cannot be computed using this approach, but in

many instances these may be approximated reasonably. For example, consider the PE on some

parameter  (x) of an ostensibly continuous variable like age, which will necessarily be measured

coarsely (e.g. one-year increments). As such, one can imagine the "derivative"




                                       (
                                     age, x-age       )            (          ) (
                                                                age + 1, x-age -  age - 1, x-age   ).
           ((
        PE  age, x-age   ))   =
                                            age
                                                          
                                                                               2




Thus, using results from footnote 4,




           ( ((
        LB PE  age, x-age     )))              ( ((                    ))     ((
                                      .5 LB  age + 1, x-age - UB  age - 1, x-age             )))        (34)


and




                                                              14
           ( ((
       UB PE  age, x-age      )))         ( ((                ))      ((

               (               )
assuming the  age ± 1, x-age are identified.

       These ideas are applied to the BRFSS and HSE samples. For BRFSS x contains the

binary covariates: age 65+ (vs. age 25-64), female (vs. Male), college graduate (vs. not college
graduate), and white non-Hispanic race/ethnicity (vs. other race/ethnicity categories). For HSE
x contains the binary covariates: age 50+ (vs. age 25-49), female (vs. male), college-degree

holder (vs. not college-degree holder), and southern England regions (vs. northern). As above, it
is possible with the HSE sample to compare the PE bounds with the PEs observed in the data.

                                                                             (       )
       In the BRFSS analysis the theoretically possible range for PE E S x  is -30, 30 . The
                                                                                      

                          (           )
estimated bounds on PE E S x  are shown in table 5. For the age, sex, and college-graduate
                          

PEs the computed bounds are sign informative. The computed bounds on PE Pr S = n x       ( (    )) are
shown in table A3. For n2 the bounds for the age-65+ and college-graduate PEs are sign
informative, as they are for the college-graduate effect for n=30 and the race/ethnicity effect for

                      ( (
n1 (recall that PE Pr S = 0 x         )) is point identified in the BRFSS sample).

                                            [Table 5 about here]



       In the HSE sample the bounds on PE E S x 
                                                         (    ) for   age and college degree are sign

informative, as seen in table 6. The partial effects observed in the sample for the four covariates
are all close to the midpoints of the bounds intervals. For age 50+ and college-degree holders

                   ( (
the bounds on PE Pr S = n x         )) are sign informative for n1, as shown in table A4 (recall again
        ( (
that PE Pr S = 0 x   )) is point identified in the HSE sample).

                                            [Table 6 about here]

5. Bounds with Set-Measured Outcomes

         As noted in section 2 the outcomes y available in the data may themselves be only

partially observable, i.e. not point measured. Yet while the exact values of the y m may not be

observed in the data it is known in which of P observed sets of values each y m resides. Such

data are called here set measured, but they are also known as interval measured.

         Consider the outcome set N as a sequence containing P consecutive subsequences Kp ,

                                                                       {                 }
p  P = {1, ..., P} , P<N+1. 9 Thus, N = {K1, ..., KP } with Kp = k p,min , ..., k p,max , k1,min = 0 ,

kP,max = N . Some of the Kp may be singletons where k p,min = k p,max .

         For concreteness consider information on youth tobacco use from the 2017 Youth Risk
Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS), 10 a sample of 12,548 observations on high-school
students. The outcomes of interest are measured by the responses to four questions:


         During the past 30 days, on how many days did you...
                ...smoke cigarettes
                ...use an electronic vapor product
                ...use chewing tobacco, snuff, dip, snus, or dissolvable tobacco products
                ...smoke cigars, cigarillos, or little cigars


Thus M=4 and N=30. Possible responses are categorized as: 0 days; 1 or 2 days; 3 to 5 days; 6

to 9 days; 10 to 19 days; 20 to 29 days; all 30 days. As such one has P=7 with K1 = {0} ,

K2 = {1, 2} , K3 = {3, 4,5} , K4 = {6, ..., 9} , K5 = {10, ...,19} , K6 = {20, ..., 29} , and K7 = {30} .

                  (         )
The observed Pr y m  Kp for the four outcomes are depicted in figure 5. In this application S

is the number of days (out of 30) on which subjects use any tobacco-related product.
Understanding the use of multiple substances is an active area of research (Pesko et al., 2016).


                                        [Figure 5 about here]

       With set-measured outcomes the Pr y m  Kp     (        )   are generally identified while the

probabilities Pr (y m = n) will not be point identified for at least some n. Without information

on Pr (y m = n) for all n  N E  y m  will not generally be point identified. However the E  y m 
                                                                                            
                                        
can be bounded as can Pr (S = n) and E Sr  . If K1 = {0} then Pr (S = 0) is point identified.
                                        

       Consider first bounds on the E  y m  . The idea (Manski, 1989; Manski and Tamer, 2002)
                                       

is to compute bounds as pseudo-means as if all probability mass in a given Kp is assigned to its

                                (         )                                        (
minimum value k p,min (for LB E  y m  ) or its maximum value k p,max (for UB E  y m  ), i.e.
                                                                                               )

           (       )
       LB E  y m  =  pP k p,min × Pr y m  Kp
                                              (          )                                             (36)

and

           (        )
       UB E  y m  =  pP k p,max × Pr y m  Kp .
                                              (          )                                             (37)



       To obtain bounds on Pr (S = n) one follows the same strategy as in section 2, but with

                                                                                       (
set-measured outcomes each bound so derived applies to the set probability Pr S  Kp instead        )
of to the point probability Pr (S = n) . However, since every element in each Kp could have


                                    ( (
have probability as small as LB Pr S  Kp          )) or as large as UB(Pr (S  Kp )) then each element
                                          (              )        (        )
of Kp is assigned these values as LB Pr (S = n) and UB Pr (S = n) for n  Kp . Using these

bounds on each Pr (S = n) then allows one to compute bounds on E S exactly as in section 2.
                                                                  

                                                                               (
       Table 7 shows the Pr (y m = n) assigned from the observed Pr y m  Kp , with the     )
former used in turn to compute bounds on the E  y m  as in (36) and (37). Bounds on the
                                                

  (
Pr S  Kp   )   are depicted in figure 6 and tabulated, along with those for the corresponding

Pr (S = n) , in table A5. Table A5 also shows the PrE,L (n) and PrE,U (n) used used to compute



                                                     17
the bounds on E S reported in table 7. With these bounds, and given relevant covariates x, one
                 
could compute partial-effect bounds exactly as in section 4.

6. Summary

       This paper has suggested approaches for obtaining bounds on parameters of interest
when multivariate outcome data are partially observed in a particular yet familiar manner. The
approaches proposed here will generally result in informative bounds, as demonstrated in three
empirical exercises. Whether such bounds will be sufficiently informative to satisfy
decisionmakers' requirements can only be determined in context.
       Issues akin to those addressed here may be increasingly salient. Statistical agencies are
acting to protect against confidentiality-threatening data disclosure, and are doing so in part by
using various strategies that amount to creating different forms of partially-observable measures
in public-use samples (see Abowd and Schmutte, 2019, for an interesting assessment).
       For example, the public-use samples of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS)
previously contained information on specific dates on which respondents used various
healthcare services. Recently, however, only the months in which services are obtained have
been provided in public-use samples. In such contexts approaches like those suggested here can
be used to bound features of the probability distributions of outcomes like "contact days" or
"healthy days at home" (Bynum, et al., 2016; Burns and Mullahy, 2016; Slabaugh et al., 2017).
