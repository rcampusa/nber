                                                ABSTRACT

         This paper examines trends in computer usage and the effect on productivity         growth for

a sample of federal government agencies over the period from 1987 to 1992. We link data from

the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) on the growth in real output per employee with data from

a marketing     research firm, Computer Intelligence       (CI), on the growth in per capita computer

assets for a sample of 44 federal agencies.            The data show that computer      usage increased

dramatically    and that there was a shift towards more powerful, lower cost, distributed        systems

and that usage diffused more extensively throughout the sampled agencies.          These trends mirror,

while perhaps lagging, those experienced          by large private firms over the same period.     From

estimates of a Cobb-Douglas      production function for government services, we derive an estimated

output elasticity for computers of 0.06, which allows us to conclude that computers did contribute

significant y to output growth, thereby refuting the Computer Productivity         Paradox as it applies

to the public      sector.    Computers     do not appear to be responsible      for the disappointing

productivity    performance     of the service sector.     Although   the magnitude   of our estimated

elasticity   suggests   that the returns to computer investments      exceeded those to other types of

capital, our results are not conclusive.      We also observe a positive correlation between increased

computer usage and compensation           growth which is consistent with skill-biased technical change.

1.       Introduction

         There is a large and growing literature investigating             the economic impact of computers.
Much of this work has focused on the “information                productivity    paradox” suggested by Robert

Solow’s quip that’” we see computers everywhere but in the productivity                  statistics. ” This paradox
is closely related to the more general problem of assessing service sector productivity.                  Business

computers are used most intensively in the service sector and in the “service” functions of non-

service sector firms (e. g., payroll           and purchasing).     These are exactly the activities         where
economists      face the most       severe     analytical   constraints.      Good data sources      tracking   the
productivity     of services are scarce (Griliches,          1994), Accurately        measuring   quality-adjusted
output for services is extremely difficult. This problem is especially acute for computers because
of the rapid pace of innovation and the fact that computers and the services they support often                          ~
contribute      only   indirectly   to final    output.     Moreover,      although    we may      see computers

everywhere,      they still represent only a tiny fraction of our capital stock (on the order of 2% of

plant, property and equipment) and so aggregate effects may be hard to detect, Recent research
which has exploited         the availability      of detailed    firm-level     panel data have been        able to
successfully     address    some of these measurement            issues and have found that computers            do

contribute significantly to productivity         growth and offer higher returns than investments          in other
types of capital (Brynjolfswn,         1992; Lichtenberg,         1995). A related, but less well-developed
literature     has found that employees          who use computers            are better compensated      and that
computers may be enhancing the skill-based wage gap (Kreuger, 1993). While these results are
both important and interesting,        they focus exclusively        on the private sector and tend to over-
                                                                                                                          2

emphasize manufacturing.


          This paper presents initial evidence that private sector experiences with computers                        are

shared by the public sector. This is interesting both because the federal government                       is the single

largest   service   sector employer        and because         of its long-established        role in promoting      the

development     and deployment of advanced technologies.                 It is especially interesting in light of the

recent    controversy     over    public     policies       affecting    the   development       of the    Information
Superhighwq.2       We use data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) on the growth in real

output and compensation          per employee and data from a private market research                      firm on the
growth     in computer     assets for the period            1987-1992.     These data show that computer             use

increased dramatically       over the study period (see Table #1). The median value of computer
assets per employee increased 5 % per year, and there was a strong trend towards increased
                   ,
reliance on distributed systems based on PCs and terminals (e, g., PCs per employee, MIPS per
employee and DASD per employee grew at 53%, 40% and 23% per year, respectively).3                                    We
find that this increased       computerization           contributed    positively     to productivity    growth,   even

though growth in output per worker was disappointingly                      low, averaging 0.2 % per year.4          We

also find that compensation          per employee           grew more rapidly in the computer              intensifying




     2 The recent passage of the telecommunications      deregulation bill in the US and similar regulatory trends            -
in other OECD countries reflects the growing belief that global competitiveness will depend heavily on the state
of a count~y ’s information infrastructure. This only makes sense if computers contribute positively to economic
growth,

     3    These are growth rates for the medians.    See Table #1.


      4 By way of comparison, from 1985 to 1992, output per labor hour and compensation per labor hour for
private-sector manufacturing grew 2.8 % and 4.2%, respectively (see Statistical Abstract 1994, Table 1390).
Over the same period, the comparable numbers for the Federal agencies surveyed by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics increased O,2 % and 5,9%, respectively (see Productivity Statistics for Federal Government Functions,
Bureau of Labor Statistics, February 1994, page 1). For the 44 agencies which are included in our regression
analysis the comparable means are:

2.       Data Description

         We use data on the growth in productivity            and computer assets for a subset of U.S,

federal agencies over the period 1987-1992, The productivity              data are from the Bureau of Labor

Statistics’   (BLS) Federal Productivity        Measurement    Program.     Since 1967, the BLS has been
compiling output, employment         and compensation      indices for a significant share of the activities
undertaken      by the federal government. b This research program              is noteworthy      for both its
extensiveness and for the care taken to accurately measure real output over a long period. In
                ,
1992, the study covered 276 government organizations which are part of 60 Federal agencies
representing     almost 65% of executive branch employment.


         The BLS analysts        took   great    care defining      the real output    for the government
organizations     which are included      in their survey.     Output measures        were derived     in close
consultation with personnel in the target organizations          and vary depending on the function of the

organization,    For example,    output for the postal service is measured as the growth rate in the

volume of mail handled, with different indices for each type of mail and indices for the number                    “
of money orders sold. For the forest service,             output is measured for 28 different         activities
including the acres managed for wilderness             management     or the publications   issued for forest
research.




     5 Growth in compensation per employee for firms was positively correlated with the growth in PCs and
terminals per employee, but not with the relative intensity of computer usage in the initial year as measured by
the ratio of the number of PCs and terminals per employee for the firm relative to the industry mean in 1987,

     6 See Productivity Statistics for Federal Government Functions: Fiscal Years 1967-1992 (Febmary 1994),
and, Description of Output Indicators by Function for the Federal Government (March 1994) from the Bureau
of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, for additionat information, Also, Forte (1993).
                                                                                                                     4

           The BLS publishes        data in the form of aggregate statistics for 28 different government

functions such as “audit of operations”,            “traffic management”,    and “communications”.             Each of

these functional indices is computed by aggregating              a series of output measures for each of the
sampled organizations          which are engaged in activities associated with that function, For example,

the “audit of operations”        index is based on data for organizations in three different agencies. One
of these is the Office of the Inspector          General in the Department       of Labor for which output is

measured       as the number        of audits completed.       The BLS program         collects    information      on
approximately 2,500 different activities. The activity indices are aggregated to produce functional

indices and agency-level indices based on base-year employment weights. Although the BLS does
not publish the agency-level          aggregate indices, we were able to use these in our analysis.7                In

addition to computing          the growth in output per employee year, the BLS collects data on total
employment      and the growth in compensation            per employee year for the sampled organizations,


           The data on computer assets by agency comes from the market research firm, Computer

Intelligence    (CI), which conducts         site-level   surveys of total employment        and computer        asset
inventories for Federal government             agencies. The computer asset data includes an estimate of
the replacement     value of computer assets (CPURCH)              as well as physical counts of such things
as the number of mainframes,               minicomputers,     PCs, terminals,    total MIPS,        and total disk
storage (DASD),


        The CI data were aggregated            to the agency level and matched to the BLS agency-level

productivity    statistics,    resulting   in a data set with 44 agencies, covering almost 80% of the
employment      in the BLS sample.           (See Attachment     #1 for a list of agencies included in the
sample. ) Originally,         we had hoped to be able to match the two data sources at the organization
level, which would have resulted in a much larger sample. Unfortunately,                   the only information
we could match on was the name of the site/organization                     which did not generate reliable
matches.




     7 The BLS protects the confidentiality  of the organization   and agency-level   indices as part of its
agreement with the departments which participate in the survey,
                                                                                                                    5

            Since the BLS surveyed only a subset of the organizations              within an agency, its coverage

is partial (ranging from 1 % to 100% of agency employment),                      while the CI data (in principle)

reflect 100 % agency coverage. Also, the time periods covered by the two samples do not match
perfectly. The BLS data we use are from 1987 and 1992, while the CI data are from 1986 and

1991,8 This creates a matching problem across the two data sources which is reflected in our

inability     to perfectly    match    total agency     employment         in the two samples.       The average

employment-weighted          BLS coverage ratio in our sub-sample                is 0.84 and the average ratio of
BLS employment to CI employment               is 0.88. Ideally, these numbers should both be 1, or at least
equal. However,         their closeness   encourages     us to assume that the matching problem              is not

severe,


            The mismatch in coverage ratios may be interpreted in a variety of ways. First, we may

assume that the BLS productivity          index offers an unbiased estimate of total agency productivity
growth. In this case, we would wish to compare the growth in agency-level computer intensity

with agency-level productivity         growth. Alternatively,      we may assume that the average agency-
level computer         intensity   provides   an unbiased       estimate    of      computer   intensity   in those
organizations      sampled by the BLS. 9 The partial coverage of BLS data suggests that our estimates
of agency productivity         may be heteroskedastic.      The variance of our estimate of productivity

growth should be inversely related to the BLS coverage ratio (BLSSHR),                     It would be largest for
agencies for which BLSSHR is small. We adjust for this potential measurement                        error by using
BLSSHR to weight observations             in the regressions.


            To correct for the timing difference,      we convert all growth rates into annual growth rates
and assume that average annual growth was approximately                       the same over the two periods,
Finally, to further correct for potential measurement             problems imposed by matching across the



     a      The CI data are from 1986 and 1991, with a few of the second observations      from 1990 and 1992,


     9 From the site-level data, we may infer that computer intensity varies quite a lot across different
organizations in an agency (e. g., the CV in average agency epurch is 2,2). This makes intuitive sense since we
might expect certain agency functions to be more computer intensive than others (e. g., researchers versus park
rangers in the Department of Agriculture), This suggests that the first assumption is perhaps more plausible.
                                                                                                                             6

two samples, our analysis focuses on per capita measures, computed using the employment data
included in each sample. 1° This would correct for a multiplicative                       measurement       error, 11



         We face two additional data limitations.             First, the only measures of agency-specific              inputs

in our data are total employment,            the composition        of computer assets, and total agency outlays
(from the federal budget). We do not have information                        either on the stocks of non-computer

capital or on the demographics              or skill composition          of the labor force. 12 Second, the BLS

productivity    data are only available in growth form so we cannot compare productivity                                levels
across agencies, but this does allow us to control for a fixed agency-effect.


         The failure to control for non-computer               capital or differences in labor force composition

creates an omitted variables problem which potentially bias our result and complicates our
                  ,
interpretation of the labor output elasticities associated with increased computer intensity. If
computers      are complementary          with a higher-skilled          workforce     as suggested above, then our

estimates of computer productivity            would tend to overstate the benefits of computers,                   A similar
result would occur if the growth in computer                    capital intensity and other capital intensity are
positively correlated.     We attempt to correct for these omissions by including the growth rate in

hand side,


 3.      Data Analysis and Results



         We present our analysis in two sub-sections.                The first describes data trends and summary



      10 We substituted   employment     estimates   across samples to compensate       for missing values when necessary.


     11 For example, if the observed total employment and observed number of PC’s in Agency i are
CTOTPCi and Li, respectively and there was a multiplicative measurement error associated with observations
for agency i, cl, then CTOTPCi/L, would yield an unbiased estimate of the number of PCs per employee in
Agency i.

      12 We also lack information      on other potentially   relevant   factor inputs as materials,   knowledge   capital
(R&D). Moreover,    our data on computer       assets does not include estimates     of software assets.

statistics,   contrasting   public and private          sector experiences.     The second part discusses          our

regression     analysis of the relationship        between increased computerization          and productivity     and

compensation      growth.


 3.1      Trends and Data Patterns


          From 1987 to 199213, the output per employee year grew at only 0.2 % per year while

compensation      per employee year grew 5,9 % for the agencies included in the BLS survey. This

disappointing performance        was shared by the private service sector. The expansion of the service
sector’s share of GDP coupled to its disappointing              performance threaten fiture economic growth

and help account for the strong interest in better understanding                     the causes for low measured
productivity     growth, 14 It is worth noting that while overall growth was slow, certain functions
                      ,
experienced      quite rapid growth, For example, communications grew 7.9 % per year while

procurement      declined (3. 5%) per year, 15 Other functions which experienced                    relatively    rapid

growth included traffic management (+18 %/year), electric power and distribution                      (+7.4 %/year)
and personnel       investigations     (+4, 9%/year);       while functions for which productivity           declined
included legal and judicial activities (-1. 7%/year),           education and training (-2, O%) and personnel
management       (-2, 2%). Similarly,         there is a wide range in the productivity        growth rates for the



       13 As noted above, the timing of our two data sources are not identical,       The BLS data are calendar   years
1987 and 1992, while the Computer Intelligence data are for calendar years 1986 and 1990-1992 with the
following frequencies. 48 agencies 1986, 3 agencies 1990, 42 agencies 1991 and 3 agencies 1992. To simplify
the exposition, we will treat all of the data as from either “1987” or “1992” in subsequent discussions and
tables.

      14 Over approximately the same period, employment in the Federal government grew at only one third
the rate of the economy as a whole (0.5% versus overall growth of 1,4% per year from 1979 to 1992).
According to the Statistical Abstract of United States, Table 642: Employment by Selected Industry,

                                                                                                                            8

organizations       from which the functional          indices are computed.           For example,         output for the

organizations      which contribute to the index for information services (overall growth of 2.2 % per

year) ranged from a decline of (3.8%) per year to an increase of 26 % per year. 16


           Over this same period, computerization              of public sector work places continued at a rapid

pace (see Table #1). Although              all of the agencies in our sample owned computers                       in 1987,
changes in the numbers, value and composition                  of the equipment were substantial. 17The median
replacement        value of computer       assets per employee          grew 5.5% per year to about $853 per
employee in nominal terms, which suggests real growth of 25 % to 35 YOper year since computer

prices have been declining rapidly. 18


       In Table #2, we report regressions results which show how the total replacement value
                 ,
of computer assets in 1987 and 1992 varies with the number of different types of systems. The

parameters may be interpreted as estimates of the average system prices in 1987 and 1992. Our
data show that the average replacement              price for PCs fell by 10% per year from approximately

$2,300 to $1,300,         while the price for terminals            fell by 23% per year. Since the quality of
systems purchased tended to increase over time, these estimates understate the fall in real prices,

According to data from Multimedia              Computing       Corporation,     the average price for a government

computer was $2,500 in 1989, which is encouragingly                       close to our estimate in Table #2.’9



     16 The BLS publishes      the range of organizational     indices only if there are three or more organizations
which contribute    to the determination   of the functional   index so that it is not possible    to identify individual
organizations.

     17 Of the 48 agencies in our sample,        13 do not have mainframe      computers   in either or both years.
However,     10 of those have minicomputers     and all 48 have at least PCs or terminals         in both years.

      16 Berndt, Griliches, and Rappaport (1993) estimate that computer prices declined on average 20% to
30% per year from 1989 to 1992, Nominal prices declined 1] % per year, but changes in model specifications
and quality mask much steeper real price declines. When quality adjusted, the indices fall 24% 10 32%, Their
analysis is based on personal computers.

     19 See page 10.17 in Juliussen and Juliussen (1991). And, according to data from the Computer Business
Equipment Manufacturers Association (CBEMA), the average price for a microcomputer,      minicomputer and a
mainframe in 1987 were $2.4k, $57k and $1, 100k, respectively (Ibid, see page 10.8). According to the
CBEMA data, the Wares of total domestic shipments of micros, minis and mainframes were 38%, 25% and
                                                                                                                                           9

          This intensification            in the level of computerization                        was accompanied      by a shift in the
types of computers            used, and implicitly,               in the ways in which computers                   are used within the

organization.       While mainframes              remained important,                the growth in PCs and terminals suggests
that computer use was diffising                  more widely across the agencies. In our sample, the mainframe
plus terminal share of asset value declined from 57% to 34%, while the share of asset value

attributed to PCs increased from 1570 to 40 YO(see Table #2). Over the same period, the median

number of PCs per employee,                     MIPS per employee and DASD per employee grew rapidly, at
53%, 40% and 23% per year, respectively                              (see Table 1).20 Also noteworthy                are the increase in

MIPS per system and the decrease in DASD per system. The former attests to the dramatic
increase in computing power, while the latter provides additional evidence of the trend towards

distributed      systems.

                          ,
           Almost all of the agencies in our sample increased the number of minicomputers                                                 per
employee, PCs and terminals per employee, MIPS per employee and DASD per employee; while

almost half did not change the number of mainframes                                   and almost a third decreased the share of
mainframes .21 This provides evidence of the move towards distributed computing environments
with computer technology diffusing throughout                              the agency. During the same period, the number

of agency locations/sites             per employee increased for 8870 of the agencies in our sample. It seems

plausible that the move towards a more geographically                                   distributed organizational         structure was
facilitated in part by the increased deployment                            of computer technology.


           The patterns in computer utilization are quite similar to those experienced by the private



37% respectively. In comparison with the estimates in Table #2, these estimates imply penetration rates for
mainframes which are lower than ours and for PCs which are higher (i. e., lumping terminal shares with
mainframes). Since the CBEMA data include the private sector and reports domestic shipments, we would expect tile data to
differ in this way if the private sector is more computer    intensive than the public sec[or.


     20 These are median growth rates computed                      using CUPDATE            to determine    the length of time between
observations.

      21 Share of agencies         which increased          units per employee       (among those which report data): PCs (100% ),.
Terminals (98 %), MIPS (93 %), DASD (95%). Of those firms with mainframes                                   in both sample years, 48% do
not change, 2970 decrease and 2370 increase the number of mainframes.
                                                                                                                    10

sector over the same period (see Table #3). The data on private sector firms is from Computer

Intelligence    also, and covers Fortune          1000 and Forbes 400 firms.            A comparison       of median

values suggests that the government           agencies were less computer intensive than private sector
firms .22 Government       agencies had fewer mainframes,               minicomputers,      DASD and MIPS per

employee, but more PCs and terminals.              These differences do not appear due to the significantly

smaller median size of government            agencies, since scale effects ought to work in the opposite
direction.     These results     are intriguing     in that they suggest         that the government’s         role in
encouraging      the diffusion    of computer      technology     has not acted principally         via their role as
“pioneer-buyers”       or as benevolent           “monopsonists”.       Thus,     if the government         has been
instrumental     in encouraging     the development      or diffusion of technology,            it seems more likely

to have worked        either     via R&D funding,        the standards      process,     or some other        avenue.
Unfortunately,     the present data sample does not provide sufficient information                   for us to derive

much confidence        from      these   speculative    observations.      The present          sample   excludes   the
Department       of Defense      and contains      only limited     information      on the relative      timing    and

magnitude of government           versus private sector investments.




 3.2   Regression Results


        We examined        the relationship        between   government         productivity,      compensation     and   “
computers formally by estimating           several reduced-form         regressions.     Our results are discussed
in the two following       subsections.      The first examines         the relationship        between productivity

growth and computers and the second explores the relationship                    between computers and growth

in employee compensation,



     22 Comparim      of means is less valuable since there are several important outliers in the government
sample. These include the Department of Energy (Corp =2004) an the National Science Foundation
(Corp =2034), both of which are very computer intensive and both of which are arguably close to being pure
R&D organizations. When these agencies are excluded, the sample mean for computer assets per employee in
1992 falls to $1,110 and the number of PCs per employee falls to 0.07 in 1987 and 0,73 in 1992. This latter
estimate suggests that the observation that PCs were used relatively more intensively by the public sector is
robust.
                                                                                                          11

i.      Productivity   Growth and Computers



        If computers   enhance productivity,     then we should expect to see a positive correlation

between the level of computerization       and growth in productivity.    Production    theory provides us

with a theoretical basis for deriving our estimating        equation. We should expect real output (Y)
to be an increasing    function of capital (K) and labor inputs (L). The capital inputs could be

divided into computer capital (Kl) and other capital ~).          The CI data provide estimates of KI,
but ~   is not observed. The labor inputs should also be divided into skilled (~) and unskilled
labor (Lu) so that we can control for differences       in the quality of an agency’s labor force. The
effective level of labor inputs, L* = LU + (1+ 8)L~, where 6 measures the excess productivity
of skilled   workers   and should       be equal to their wage premium         over unskilled     workers.
Unfortunately,    we only observe total employment     (L = ~ +Lu). If we approximate the production

function for “government services” by a Cobb-Douglas           function, we obtain the following (in log

form) :



              h-l(q) = y, + ai + alln(K1,iJ    + aoln(Ko,iJ + aLln(Lu,it +(1 +e)L~,i) + pit              (1)


The parameter y, measures disembodied         technological   change, ~ is a fixed effect which captures

agency-specific   differences,   and ~,, is a random error with zero mean which captures the effect

of all other unobserved     variables    which contribute     to the determination     of real output.   (To

simplify the notation, we will drop the i and t subscripts, )


          After assuming constant returns to scale so al+ aO+ aL = 1 and converting to per capita
estimates,   we obtain the following:




                                                                                                         (2)




If the share of skilled workers is small (~/L        is 10% or less), then this further simplifies to:
                                                                                                         12



                       in(:)    =y +A +    alln(:)
                                                +sob(:)
                                                     +aLe;+p                                           (3)




This can be written in growth rates as:




                                                                                       KO
              ln(;)92-hl(:)87     “ y + u1(hl(+)92-hl(;       )87) + ao(ln(:)92-ln(=     )*7)
                                                                                                (4)

                                   +   aL6((;)92
                                            -(;)87)+
                                                  (P9*- Pg~)
                  ,

Converting   to growth rates eliminates the agency-fixed       effect and the intercept term, y, should

now be interpreted    as the growth in the technical parameter.      The BLS data provide a measure

of the growth rate in real output per employee (PROD92) and the CI data provide a measure of
the replacement   value of computer assets per employee (EPURCH).            We do not observe either
~ or L~/L, but if the capital-labor     ratio for non-computer    capital and the share of skilled labor
do not change over time or are not correlated with the computer capital to total labor ratio, then

the second and third terms drop out, and we are left with our basic estimating equation:



                  ln(l +growth(PR0D92))       = y+ a ~ln(l +growth(EPURC~)         +~                 ~ (5)


Table #4 shows a scatter plot of the growth rate in output per employee (PR0D92)                versus the
growth rate in the value of computer assets per employee (EPURCH).            From the plot, it appears
that PROD92 is positively correlated to EPURCH,           as expected. The regression results presented
in Table 5 confirm that this result is significant and large. The balance of this section discusses
each of these regressions       in greater detail and further refinements     which support     this basic
finding.
                                                                                                                      13

        As noted earlier,      since the BN       did not collect data for all of the activities undertaken

by an agency, we suspect that the measurement                    error may be larger for those agencies which

are only partially sampled. When the squared residuals from regression                        #5. 1 (PROD92 versus

EPURCH) --an indicator of variance -- are regressed against the BLS coverage ratio (BLSSHR),

the coefficient    is negative and significant         which is consistent          with our hypothesis      regarding
measurement       error.23   Therefore,   in subsequent          regressions,    we weighted the observations         by

the BLS coverage ratio (BLSSHR).             A comparison           of regression     #5.1 and #5.2 illustrates       the
effect of weighting, which results in an improvement                 in the significance    and only a minor change
in the level of our estimate. All subsequent            regressions       were weighted by BLSSHR.


        The coefficient on EPURCH provides an estimate of the output elasticity associated with
computer capital, crl. The estimate
                               .    of 0.069 from regression #5.2 implies that agencies for
                 m
which computer assets per employee grew 10% faster than the mean, experienced 2.5 YO faster

growth in labor productivity .24 This is a large effect and suggests that there may have been
excess returns associated with investments             in computer capital. The estimate is comparable                 to

estimated   elasticities     from other studies       such as Lau and Tokatsu                (1992),   who estimated
al =0.072    or Lichtenberg      (1995), who estimated al =0. 10-0.12.25


        If computers do not offer excess returns then in equilibrium,                      we would expect the ratio




     23 When the squared residuals from regression #1 in Table $4 .B are regressed against BLSSHR,              the
estimated coefficient and standard error are -0.002 (O,001), which is significant at the 5 % level,

     24 The computation is as follows:
(1)       from Regression #2 in Table 5 B, we have ln(l +gY,~) =0.008 +0.0691n(l +gK,~)
(2)       the BLSHR-weighted    mean for the 43 agencies for which we have data is ln(l +g(EPURCH))              =0,041
and therefore, the increase is approximately (0.008+0.069*1.   1*0.041)/(0.008 +0.069*0.04 1) = 1,026
Therefore, 10% higher g(EPURCH) implies g(PROD92) is about 2,6% higher.



     25 Brynjolfson   and Hitt (1993) estimate   an elasticity    for computer   capital of 0.0061 and for computer
labor of 0,0274.

of the elasticity of computer capital to other capital to be equal to the ratio of expenditure                shares,

or:

where Ri is the rental price for ~ and ~i is the elasticity. According to Lichtenberg                      (1995~b,
this implies that al= aO(O.108). Since capital’s share of total expenditures                 is around 30%, this

suggests that al ought to be about 0.03. Hence, our estimate of 0,069 which is over twice as
large implies that computer capital yields excess returns .27


        In Regression        #3, we include       employment       growth     and find a significant        negative

coefficient.   The coefficient on employment            growth (CEMPLE)          of -0.287 means that agencies
whose employment          grew 10% faster relative to the mean firm, experienced approximately                 2.0 %



slower productivity       growth. This result is compatible with a number of interpretations.                First, it
is possible that there are short-run decreasing returns to scale (e. g., because adjustment costs are
large). This is the opposite of what occurs in the private sector where we find that productivity
tends to be pro-cyclical      (since labor costs are quasi-fixed).


         Alternatively,     it may be the case that productivity           growth is exogenous         and both the

demand for computers and employment               are endogenous.      Agencies choose the mix of computers


      26 Lichtenberg (1995) derived the estimate that al= aO(RIK1/~)           = O.108a0 using private sector data as
follows. First, Lichtenberg noted that computer’s comprised 1.8% of total capital assets, or
(P, K,)/(P~)    =0.018. The relative asset prices can be converted to relative rental prices by multiplying by
(R+5,-E(p,))/(R     +60-E(pO)) where R is the interest rate, 8, is the depreciation rate, and E(p,) is the expected
rate of price appreciation, Lichtenberg followed Lau and Tokatsu (1992) who used long run averages to estimate
R= O.07, 6,=0,20,      8.=0.05,  E(pl) =-0.15, and E(pO)=0.05. Taken together, these imply that the ratio of
relative rental to asset prices, is 6 = (,07 +.20+.15)/(.07+.05-,05),       or RIK1/~=6(0,018)        =0, 108.

      27 However, a test of excess returns is not significant at the 10% level. The test HO: al-O .03=0 for
regression #5.2 is rejected ordy at the 10.6570 level. Since Lichtenberg’s estimate is based on private sector
data, it would be better to develop a test based on govermnent data.
                                                                                                       15

and labor to meet exogenously      imposed output requirements.      Agencies which experience faster
productivity    growth do not need to increase employment        as rapidly.



        Earlier we assumed that the capital-labor       ratio for non-computer   capital and the share of

skilled labor are uncorrelated.    If this is not true, then the second and third terms in equation #4
do not drop out and our failure to include these in the regression will lead to biased estimates

of U1. If ~/L     and L~/L are positively correlated with K1/L, which seems more likely than the
reverse presumption,      then failure to include these will bias our estimates upwards.


        In regression #4 we add the growth rate in compensation          per employee (E_COMP)        and

the growth rate in total agency outlays net of total compensation       per employee (E_NOUT).        The
former is intended to help control for differences in the composition of the labor force while the
                  ,
latter is intended to act as a proxy for non-computer capital. The estimated elasticity on
computer capital might be too high because one suspects that agencies which increased                their

computer usage also increased       the proportion     of skilled workers and it was really this latter
effect which accounts for the growth in output. Were this the case, then we should expect to see
the average compensation       per employee       growing   for these same agencies and so including
E_COMP         on the right hand side ought to control for changes in the skill composition         of the

work force. Similarly,      we expect that the level of agency outlays per employee           ought to be

positively correlated with the level of non-computer        capital and so E NOUT should serve as an         “

instrument to control for ~.      Including these additional right hand side variables does not affect

the estimated coefficient     for EPURCH.        Our estimate of al is not affected when we include

proxies for changes in the composition        of the labor force and non-computer      capital.


        A comparison       with regressions      run on similar data for the private     sector provides
additional evidence that the failure to include non-computer          capital in our regressions    is not

serious, In Table #6, we report regressions        based on an analysis of CI data for a panel of large

firms during the period from 1986-1993. Regressions          #6. 1-6.3 are similar to the per capita BLS

regressions     reported here; and regressions     #6.4-6. 6 are based on total output (as measured by
firm sales), Introducing      a measure   for non-computer      capital (E_PPE     or S_PPE)      does not
                                                                                                                        16

significantly change the estimated computer capital output elasticity of approximately                         0.03, Note
that this elasticity is smaller than the one estimated in the BLS regressions,                      and following the

earlier reasoning,      would suggest that there are not excess returns associated with computer

capital in the private sector. This is at variance with the findings in Lichtenberg                       (1995) which
may be due to changes between 1991 and 1993. Since these results are preliminary,                               however,

we should regard these estimates with caution.


          In Regressions         #5.5     through    #5.9,    we introduce      additional    information       from the

Computer       Intelligence     data on the composition          of computer capital. None of these additional
regressors     are superior to EPURCH               nor are they significant when added to Regression               #3. In

Regressions      #5 through #8, we experiment                with a variety of ways of measuring               changes in

computer factor inputs. The Computer Intelligence data provide a wealth of information on the
                  ,
counts of different types of computer assets which suggests that it might be possible to use this
information      to detect how the composition                of computer    assets influences      productivity,      We

include such measures as the share of all systems which are large systems (PSYS), the share of

total PCs and terminals            which are PCs (PPC),            the total number of PCs and terminals               per
employee (EPCTERM),               and the total number of large systems per employee (ESYS), None of
these experiments       resulted in significant          coefficients .28


          The failure of these regressions              to yield interesting results is not especially surprising.           “

The counts of systems are an extremely coarse indication of the composition of computer assets,

This is more true for mainframes                 and minicomputers      than it is for microcomputers            since the

latter are more of a commodity               product.     Moreover,   since mainframes       and minicomputers         are

much more expensive than PCs or terminals,                     investments   are lumpier and we are more likely
to face an integer problem.              Growth rates for many of the alternative             measures        are strongly

positively     correlated.     This is especially        true for the value of computer          assets per employee

(EPURCH)         and the number of MIPS per employee (EMIPS) or the number of minicomputers




    28 When included,         the coefficients   on the MIPS per employee    (EMIPS),   disk storage per employee
(EDASD)      or the share of large systems which are mainframes       (PMAIN)    were also not significant.
                                                                                                                   17

(MINI); for the number of minicomputers                      per employee       and the number of mainframes      per
employee (EMAIN);           and the number of PCs per employee (EPC) and the number of terminals

per employee (ETERM) .29 These suggest that once we include EPURCH                           in the regression,    we

gain little by adding EMIPS,          or if we include EPC, by adding ETERM,                 etcetera.


         In Regression      #9, we include the number of sites per employee (ESITES) as a candidate

measure for changes in the organizational             structure of the agency. We hypothesized           that ESITES
would decline if the agency became more distributed                    and this might affect computer utilization.
Neither this measure nor close substitutes              proved to be significant,


ii.      Labor Costs and Computers



         An alternative approach to assessing the impact of computers is to examine the effect of
computer inputs on labor costs which the BLS reports in two ways: (1) INDEX5, the growth in

unit labor costs (compensation            per unit of real output);             and, (2) INDEX4,     the growth     in
compensation      per employee.       Table #7 and #8 report a series of regressions            of the form:




                                                                                                                  (7)

where gz is the growth rate in INDEX4 or INDEX5; & is the growth rate in a factor input; and

Wj is a measure of the composition              of computer assets (e, g., the share of large systems which

are mainframes).




      29 Correlations   among the ln( 1 + growth rate(Xi)) were as follows:

are mainframes).


        Since an agency’s labor demand and production                 decisions     are intimately     related,       the

analysis discussed here should complement,           and partially, duplicate the earlier discussion.              It is

useful in the present context because it offers an additional check on data consistency,                     and more
importantly,     it seems to offer better insight into the effects of the composition        of computer assets

as will be discussed further below. The reason for this is that we know more about the labor
force of government          workers    and employment/compensation           trends    than we do about the
heterogeneity     in the outputs and productive      activities of goverment         services.



        If computers      enhance      labor productivity,      then they should       reduce unit labor costs

(INDEX5). The results in Regressions          #7.1 through #7.4 show this to be the case: the coefficient
on the replacement value of computer assets (CPURCH or EPURCH)                      is negative and significant.
Focusing on Regression #7.4, 10% faster growth in computer assets per employee (EPURCH)

resulted in 0.6 % slower growth in unit labor costs; while 10% faster growth in employment
(CEMPLE)         increased the growth in unit labor costs by 0.5%.                The negative coefficient            on

EPURCH         suggests that computers     do indeed enhance labor productivity,          mirroring         the results
presented above.


        The positive (though statistically not significant) relationship            between average unit labor
costs and total terminals and PCs (EPCTERM)                  in Regression   #7,4    is likely to be due in part

to the positive skill bias associated        with computer use. While             EPURCH         provides     the best

measure of an agency’s overall factor commitment to computers,                a high value for EPURCH may
be due to a few employees using expensive mainframe machines or many employees using less-
expensive desk-top devices, The variable EPCTERM                 addresses this issue and since we know that
income and computer use are strongly correlated               in the population     at large, we may conclude

that organizations     with high EPCTERM           are likely to have a larger share of higher-skilled,

higher-paid     employees.    These results offer further support for the view that computers                   are

complementary       ‘with higher skilled labor.
                                                                                                                  19

        The positive       coefficient     on employment       indicates   that organizations    that increased

headcount more quickly, increased unit labor costs more quickly also. This is inconsistent                    with

a view of technological         progress   where a few highly-skilled      computer workers replace a large
number of less-skilled workers in completing the same tasks. It is consistent with a shift towards

higher-skilled    activities,   which are also likely to be more computer-intensive.


        Regressions #8. 1 through #8,3 examine the effects of computers on the growth in average
compensation      (INDEX4).       First, the skill-biased     nature of employment    growth observed above
is further supported here by the positive coefficient on employment                growth which is measured
in all three regressions.       The second point worth noting is that compensation           is not significantly

related to an agency’s overall commitment               to computers,      as measured    by EPURCH,        but is

related to the extent of computer usage in the organization,               as measured by EPCTERM            (10%
higher growth in ‘EPCTERM resulted in 0.8 % higher growth in compensation                       per employee).


4. Conclusions       and Further         Research


        This paper analyzes the impact of computers                   on government   productivity     during the

period 1987 to 1992. Focusing on the public sector is interesting both because the government
is the single largest component of the service sector and because it plays such an important role
encouraging the development and diffusion of new technologies,                All of the research on computer

productivity     effects have looked at the private sector. It is worthwhile             examining empirically
how public sector experience             differs from the private sector. To address this question,               we

combine data from two sources: productivity            data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and
computer asset data from the marketing              research firm, Computer Intelligence (CI).


        The data illustrate the rapid increase in computer utilization which occurred during our

study period. This trend included a movement                towards more powerfil,       lower cost, distributed
systems.   A larger proportion         of government        workers were using computers        by 1992. These

trends appear to have lagged, but otherwise             essentially    duplicated those experienced      by large

private sector firms. This increased computer               usage appears to have contributed        positively   to
                                                                                                 20

productivity   growth and to be positively correlated with the increase in employee compensation.



        Our results would be stronger      if our sample were larger. The BLS and CI data both

collect data at the sub-agency     level, however,    matching   across the samples has not proved

feasible. In addition to expanded the number         of agencies sampled,   we would like to obtain
information    on how computers    are being used in the government     and the composition   of the

workforce.     While we wait to acquire additional data to pursue these strategies, we will explore

further comparisons     between the results from our private and public sector samples.
