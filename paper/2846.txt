                     COMOVEMENTS IN STOCK PRICES AND
                         COMOVEMENTS IN DIVIDENDS



                                ABSTRACT




     Simple efficient markets models imply that the covariance between

prices of speculative assets cannot exceed the covariance between their

respective fundamentals unless there is positive information pooling.

Positive information pooling occurs when there is more information, in a

sense defined here, about the aggregate of the fundamentals than there is

about the individual fundamentals.

     With constant discount rates, the covariance between prices (detrended

by dividing by a moving average of lagged dividends) in the U. K. and the U.

S. exceeds the covariance of the measure of fundamentals, and there is no

evidence of positive information pooling.   Regression tests of forecast

errors in one country on a real price variable in another country show

significantly negative coefficients. When the present value formula uses

short rates to discount, there is less evidence of excess comovement.

I.   Introduction

      Stock price indexes are correlated across countries.        Can such

correlations be justified in terms of correlation across countries in

fundamentals under efficient markets? In real dividends? Or in real

interest rates?

     For example, on October 19-20, 1987 the level of stock prices in all

the major stock markets of the world made similar spectacular drops.         Some

observers have stated that it seems unlikely that negative information about

fundamentals appeared in all these diverse economies during the crash.           The

crash is, however, only one episode.     Can stock price comovements overall be

justified by comovements in dividends and real interest rates?2

     Figure 1 upper panel shows real dividend indexes for the U. K        and the

U. S. for years 1919 to 1987.   Figure 1 lower panel shows the corresponding
real price indexes for the U. K. and the U.     S.   for the end of each year.

(These data, which are the basis for the empirical work here,      are defined

below.)   There is some apparent resemblance between the dividend series as

well as between the price series.   ut     simple comparisons of such plots do

not enable us to ask whether prices covary more than would be implied by

efficient markets models.   More theoretical apparatus is needed.




    •2Pthdyck and Rotemberg have analyzed whether there is excess co-
movement of commodity prices relative to co-movements in fundamentals.
Their analysis is rather different, in that they did not directly measure
the fundamentals.

II.    The Efficient Markets Model

       The efficient markets model                   is:

index       i)    and            is the true or fundamental    value corresponding to this

       Now, it should first be recognized that, under this model,                          for two
                                                                  *   *

and                   can be perfectly correlated with each other even if                  P     and

are perfectly uncorrelated with each other.                     Suppose that               and

are independent of each other, have the same unconditional mean and

unconditional variance and that some information variable      is available
                                                                                  I

values is pooled.                  By the usual errors-in-variables        formula,   (and assuming

we have subtracted means from all variables) both                      P.      and    P. will equal

                 and hence the two are perfectly correlated.                Since the information

construct an example where the two are perfectly negatively correlated with

                                                                                                        I    equals     P

     Let us arrange the asset prices                                  i —   1,    .        .   k,    into a k-element

vector       P            and the fundamental values                             i —   1               k into another

k-element vector P                     .     Then, in vector       form,    the efficient markets model is



                          EtPt                                                                                          (2)



writing           —            +            where         is a kxl vector of forecast errors,                     and

using the fact that price dividend ratios at time t                                     are in the information

set at time           t    ,   we know that the vectors                          and                are uncorrelated.

Therefore:



             Var(P*) =         Var(P)           + Var(U)                                                                (3)



where     Var(    )       denotes a             k x k    variance matrix.             The       ith diagonal ele-

ment of the above expression is


                                   —                 +
              Var(P)                       Var(Pi)       Var(Ui)                                                        (4)


Diagonal elements of                       Var(U) must be nonnegative because of                        the positive

semidefinite requirement for variance matrices.                                  Therefore


             Var(Pt)               Var(Pi).                                                                           (5)



This variance inequality was used by LeRoy and Porter (1981) and Shiller

(1981), to claim that aggregate                         stock price indexes appear to be too

volatile to accord with the present value models.                                     Essentially,          stock price

overpriced relative to fundamentals.                 This implication of the efficient

markets model will be tested in Table 2 below.



Portfolios of Stocks

      Another way of generalizing the original variance inequality (5) to

include covariance is to check the condition implied by (1) that:4

                                   -
                          var(P)       var(P)     positive semidefinite.                 (5')

This condition says that for any portfolio of assets (whose prices are

elements of             with portfolio price            and portfolio fundamental value
                  P)
P',   var(P't)          var(P)         i. e.,   it is impossible to construct a portfolio

with excess volatility.            Now, violation of this condition could happen if

var(P)    -
                 var(P)    is neither positive semidefinite nor negative

semidefinite,       which would mean that some portfolios show excess volatility

             <
var(Pt)          var(P)     but some portfolios do not.         For example, it could be

that components of the vector                   show excess volatility but that some

portfolios diversify away this excess volatility.                 Or, it could be that no

components of             show excess volatility, but because covariances between
                    P
prices Pft and             are large relative to covariances between fundamental
                     P.
values   P        and        portfolios can be constructed that show excess

volatility.        This would be a case where blame for failure of the present

value model could be placed squarely on the excess covariances rather than

excess variances. Violation of the condition (5') could also happen if

         -
var(P)        var(P)      is negative semidefinite.        This would mean that all

conceivable       portfolios show excess volatility.

Individual Stocks

       Suppose we made the vector         the vector of prices of all stocks, so

that   P has thousands   of elements, and form the corresponding vectors

and         Then an equally weighted market index t'indext is               The variance
       U.                                                          wP   .




of the market index is then 1/k times the average variance          var(P)      plus (k-

1)/k times the average covariance cov(Pi                   Since k is very large and
                                                  Pu).
since covariances are not negligible relative to variances (the market

component is a substantial component of individual stock price variance) the

variance of the market index indext is approximately equal to the average

covariance of individual stocks. Similarly, the variance of the market

index fundamental               is approximately equal to the average covariance
                     t'indext

between fundamentals cov(P Pt).             Thus, an observation that indexes sre

excessively volatile is itself an observation that individual stocks covary

too much on average to accord with the efficient markets model.              Earlier

articles    (LeRoy and Porter, 1981, Shiller, 1981) that claimed to find excess

volatility of stock market indexes have shown (if they are right) evidence

of excess covariance among individual stocks.            But these studies did not

provide evidence whether there was excess covariance between U. K. and U. S.

stock prices, or between major subindexes.
Definitions and Detrending

     The prices used for the econometric work were detrended by dividing by

a long moving average of lagged dividends.        This kind of detrending was

discussed in Campbell and Shiller (l988b) where a long moving average of

earnings,       rather than of dividends, was used to detrend.   Our results were

similar if dividends       or prices were used in place of earnings in the moving

average.        Since these long moving averages are fairly smooth and trendlike,

dividing price by such a moving average is essentially a method of

detrending or of removing low-frequency components.        Since only lagged

(before time t) dividends are used, no future information is used to detrend

the price per share at time t.        Thus, certsin criticisms made in the

literature of the uae of variance inequalities in econometric work are

obviated.       Under various nonstationary models for price and dividend

discussed in the literature,       the detrended price and detrended        will be
                                                                       Pt
stationary stochastic processes.        There are of course still potential small

sample problems in the use of these inequalities to test the model, which

will be addressed below.

     Two versions of the present value model are conaidered here.           In

version    I, the   discount rate is a constant, equal to the average of the log

of one plus the real return on an investment in the portfolio represented
                                                                          by
the index.       In version II, the discount rate is a short-term interest rate

plus a constant term so that the average discount rate is the same as in

version    1.

     The detrended fundamental value           was computed according to:




                                           7
          *           T-t-l          k               T-t-l             —
                                                             i
              —                                                                     T     t      (7)
                              Dit+k+lfl
                      k—0                  l+rt÷j* iT.110    l+r.

       In this formula, the present value of dividends starting with the end

of the sample, t — T, is proxied by the terminal price                     The moving

average of real dividends            that was used to detrend was an exponentially

                                                                 —
weighted distributed lag on past real dividends,                     (lp)Z(k_O,o)pkDitk.
The parameter p is taken as exp(-R) where R is the average of the log of one

plus the real return on an investment in the portfolio represented by the

index, and p is the same as the discount factor in version I of the model.

For the U. K.     ,   the estimated p was    0.935, for the U. S. it was 0.936.               The

"trend" is just the present value formula worked backward in time rather

than forward, and the trend as a forecast of the present value of future

dividends is just a forecast that the future will be like the past.                      The

trend was computed recursively from an initial condition by                     —                +
                                                                           Di           Ditl
              The detrended price            is defined as            where             is the
(lp)D..
real price index.

     This method of detrending, essentially initiated in Campbell and

Shiller (1988b), represents a substantial improvement over previous

discussions of the alleged excess volatility of stock prices.                  If we are to

consider whether stock prices move too much or comove too much, we are in

effect claiming that stocks should be priced differently.                  It is important

to have in mind some simple different pricing rule that shows less movement

or less comovement.           In my original paper (1981) the alternative was a

linear trend line for price.             In Mankiw Romer and Shapiro's (1986) it was a

proportional to dividend rule for price.            These alternatives are less

attractive:    no one would seriously consider a linear trend or a constant as

                                                8
a forecast for fundamentals,    and real dividend series are not at all smooth.



       As an alternative to using an arbitrary detrending rule, one may

compute an optimal forecasting rule for future dividends derived from a

cointegrated time series model.     This was done in Campbell and Shiller

(1988a) using a low-order vector autoregressive model.     However, by

construction,    such a model is incapable of forecssting that the present

value of future dividends will depend on a long average of past dividends,

since lags are limited by the length of the autoregression.     When an

ARIMA(l,l,l) model for aggregate U. S. real dividends was estimated (Shiller

1984), it was found that the optimal forecast of the present value of future

dividends did depend on a log exponentially weighted distributed lag on past

dividends, like the one used here to detrend.

       The present paper aims to make a point in the simplest way possible,

without reference to complicsted time series models and the linearizations

needed to make these serve our purposes when there are time-varying interest

rates.      The simple detrending rule should be interpreted in this light.



Data

       It was felt that a very long span of data was needed to examine the

propositions considered here, data covering many decades.     Obtaining many

observations by sampling frequently will not give us enough data for our

purposes,    see for example Shiller and Perron (1986) or Summers (1987).

There is a growing recognition of the need for a long time span in financial

data, see for example Fama and French (1987) and Schwert (1987).

       Finding stock price data with very long time spans is difficult. Most


                                         9
individual stocks do not continue for very long in unchanged form.          Fama and

French examined "survivor" companies that had stayed in business since 1926,

but these companies may be different from others.      To obtain really long

time series of representative stocks we are forced to deal with portfolios

of stocks rather than individual stocks, and these can be represented by

stock price indexes.   Long time series index data for prices and dividends

the U. S. sre available back to 1871.    Among major countries,    only for the

United Kingdom was it possible to find a clean, uninterrupted dividend and

price series that was nearly as long.    Time series on prices and dividends

in Japan are available back to 1879, but there is a break at World War IT,

after which major holders of stocks, the Zaibatsu, saw their holdings frozen

and then sold by the Supreme Command of the Allies in the Pacific. The

effect on their net worth of the exchange of nontransferable government

bonds for their stock holdings is hard to measure.     A   similar sale of stocks

by occupying authorities occurred in Germany after World War TT.       It was

decided therefore not to use these countries in this study.       Of course,

omitting them does not completely solve the problem;       U. K. and U. S.

investors must have been aware of the possibility of confiscation of their

holdings should the war have ended differently.     There is no way

statistically to consider infrequent big events that did not occur in the

sample.

     The annual   U. S. Stock real price index                    is the December

dividends (total for year) divided by the producer price index.       The

Standard and Poor Composite Stock Price Index and corresponding dividends


                                        10
per share adjusted to index, starting 1926, are from Standard and Poor

Statistical Service. Before 1926, the dividends per share are from Cowles

(1939)   .    The producer   price   index   starting   in 1913 is the December all

commodities producer price index from the U.             S.   Bureau of Labor Statistics.

For years before 1913, it is linked to the December index of all commodities

prices from Warren and Pearson (1935, pages 13-14).                For version II of the

model, the short rate is the annual return on 4-6 month prime commercial

paper, computed from January and July figures under the assumption of a 6-

month maturity.       These data are from the same sources as in Campbell and

Shiller (l988a,b), and differ from the data used in thoae papers in that

December,       rather than January, stock prices and producer price indexea were

used.        December was chosen to correspond to the specification of the

available UK stock price and dividend series.

        For the United Kingdom, the real stock price index                 1919-1986   is

the BZW Equity index (produced by Barclay's de Zoete Wedd) for the end of

the year divided by the price deflator 1929 — 1.00 for the year from

Friedman and Schwartz (1982), Table 4.9, Column 4, pp. 132-4 and updated.

The BZW Equity Index is an arithmetic market-capitalization-weightedindex.

The index was created retrospectively for earlier years.                Beginning with

1918, the index was constructed from end of year share pricea of thirty of

the largest publicly quoted British industrial and retail companies,

excluding financial, mining and oil companiea and companies whose activities

were primarily overseas.         For years after 1918, changes       in the 30 companiea

were made, in order to make the index ma representative am possible of

British industry, but in 1962 the index still included 24 of the original 3D

companies.        Starting with 1963, the index becomes the same aa the FT

for the end of the year.

     For the United States a longer dividend history is available than for

the United Kingdom.             Therefore,   different methods were used for the two

countries for choosing the initial value for
                                                                   E0 where tO is the beginning
of the sample used to compute variance matrices.                        In the United States,

dividend series are available for years back to 1871.
                                                                             D.to was therefore
taken as    E(j.-l,   .   .                where                was used to proxy for real
                                   DtO j           D1871
dividends    before 1871.          In the United Kingdom, the real dividend series

begins in 1918, however real price series are available much earlier.5

Under the assumption that the average dividend-price ratio was the same

before 1918,                  was taken as 6E(j—l,      .   .                  where 6 is the

average dividend-price ratio 1920-86 and where                               is used to proxy for
                                                                     P1871
prices before 1871.             Since a long average smooths over short-term

fluctuations,     this value for               is likely to be a good proxy for the true
                                        Dto
value if there is no long term trend in the dividend price ratio, even

though          would be a poor proxy for the dividend in a given year.

        In version   1,   we see from the variance matrices shown that there

appears    to be not only excess volatility in the individual countries           stock

There is no evidence of the positive information pooling that might justify

the covariance of prices exceeding that of fundamentals,           that is,

               >   0.     It was noted above, by viewing Figure    1,    that there is a
cov(UjUj)
broad similarity in appearance between the U. K. and U.           S.    real price series

and between the U. K. and U. S. real dividend series.            The excess comovement

might be described as just the same excess volatility in two closely related

countries.    The U.      S.   market shows rather more excess volatility than does

the U. K. market, and the portfolio that minimizes excess volatility puts

almost all the weight on the U. K. market.

evidence for this in the U. S..            The reason is that real interest rates have

been quite variable and positively autocorrelatedin both countries.               A


     6with other assumed stochastic processes, of course, the uncertainty
about these variance matrices may be even higher. For reasons stressed by
Kleidon [1986] and others, there may be a bias toward finding excess
volatility in small samples. With the lognormal random walk assumption for
dividends that Kleidon streqed, there is a tendency for the variance of
to be greater than that of P    but not so much greater es actually observes

negative or negligibly positive in the late 1930's and 1940's, positive in

thelate 1950's and early     1960's, negative in the 1970's,       and high in the

1980's.

coefficient of the price variable is always negative,      indicating both excess

volatility and exceaa comovement between the U. K. and the U.           S.   The
coefficient is usually near -1.00.      In the own-country regressions such a

value Tfor the coefficient indicates that any movements in the price variable

are totally due to forecast error.      The coefficient is significant at the 5%

level in both U. K. and U.   S.    when forecast errors in one country are

regressed on the price variable in the same country (i—fl.          It is also

significant at the 5% level when U. S. forecast errors are regressed on the

U. K. price variable, but it is not significant when the U. K. forecast

errors are regressed on the U.     S. price variable.   In panel B, we see that

forecast errors in one country are regressed on the price variable in that

country,   the coefficient is substantially    negative and significant in both
countries.   This means that while real interest rate movements are big

enough to possibly account for the movements in the stock price variable

     the real interest rate movements in fact do not account for the actual


                                          14
movements.   Simply put, it means that when prices are high they tend also to

be high relative to fundamentals.   When forecast errors in one country are

                                                                   the
regressed on the price variable in the other country in panel B,

coefficient is also negative but smaller and statistically insignificant.

There is thus a suggestion of excess comovement in the time-varying interest

rate case, but there are not enough data to be able to establish this with

any authority.
