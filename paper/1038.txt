                                Abstract



Previous tests of the permanent income hypothesis (PIll) have focused

on either nondurables or durables expenditures in isolation. This
paper studies consumer purchases of nondurables and durables as the
outcome of a single optimization problem.       It is shown that the
presence of adjustment costs of changing durables stocks may
substantially affect the time series properties of both components of
expenditure under the PIll.   However, econometric tests based on this
model do not contradict earlier rejections of the PIll in aggregate
quarterly data.

1.   Introduction

      The validity of Friedman's (1957) permanent—income hypothesis
(PIH) as a description of aggregate consumer behavior is an important
and long—debated issue in macroeconomics. Recently this hypothesis,

sharpened by the implications of rational expectations theory, has
come under intensive re—examination. Articles by Hall '1978), Sargent
(1978), and Blinder (1981) have exploited restrictions generated by
the PIH—cum—rational expectations to test the hypothesis in aggregate
time series data; summarizing this evidence, F].avin (1981) concluded
that the PIH should be rejected. Using disaggregated data, Hall and

Mishkin (1982) and Hayashi (1982b) have also found reason to question
the PIH.

     A difficulty with all of these papers is that none does a very

satisfactory job with the durables expenditure component of
consumption.    This is a potentially important problem: On the one
hand, because of lagged stock adjustment and accelerator effects, an
inadequate treatment of durables expenditure might lead to an
incorrect rejection of the PIH.   (This is true even if the durables
component is excluded from the data, if durables and nondurables are

nonseparable in consumer utility functions.) On the other hand, if
significant imperfections in consumer credit markets (the most likely
source of failure of the P11!) do exist, then we would expect this to
be reflected most strongly in the pattern of durables purchases (Darby
(1972), Mishkin (1976)). Insufficient attention to durables in this
case eliminates a good opportunity to distinguish the PIH from the
alternatives.

     At least two papers have tried to remedy the relative neglect of
                                  -.2—


durables. A note by Maniciw (forthcoming) argued that, under the PIN,

expenditures on durables should follow a mixed autoregressive—moving
average process; his finding that aggregate durables expenditure is
AR(1) is interpreted as evidence against the PIN.    (This conclusion

seems premature, as the usual alternatives to the PIN appear even less
likely to generate the time series behavior which Mankiw found.)
       The other paper which concentrates on durables is my own
(Bernanke (forthcoming)).    I looked at data on income and automobile

expenditure for 1400 families over four years. My estimates suggested
that consumer behavior in the sample 'could be well described by the

PIN.

       As the earlier work tended to exclude durables, however, the
papers by Mankiw and by me considered only durables expenditure in
isolation.    A natural step is to consider the jJ.! behavior of
durables and nondurables spending. The present paper does two things:
First, it presents a formal dynamic model of the consumer's decision

problem under uncertainty.     The model assumes that utility is a
nonseparable function of nondurables consumption and of the services
from durables, and that changing durables stocks involves costs of
adjustment. This analysis, which appears to be somewhat more general
than those previously used, can be used to derive exact, closed—form
decision rules suitable for use in estimation. These rules suggest
that the presence of adjustment costs may have a substantial effect on
the pattern of nondurable as well as durables purchases.
       Second, the paper uses the formal model to test the PIN in
aggregate time series data.     Under the econometrically tractable
assumption of constant interest rates, the PIN is strongly rejected by
                                    —3—
the data.       With variable interest rates, it appears that this
conclusion is somewhat moderated but not reversed. Overall, Flavin's
earlier findings are supported.


2.   The consumer's optimization problem
        This section presents an analysis of optimal consumer choice in a

dynamic stochastic environment. The model has the following features:

        1)   The consumer derives utility from both nondurables and the
services of durables. Nondurables and durab].es may enter the utility
function nonseparably.                                             -



        2)   There are adjustment costs (which take the form of foregone
leisure) associated with changing durables stocks.

        3)   Utility and adjustment costs are assumed to be quadratic in
form.

        U The consumer's income is a general stochastic process.
        5)   The real interest rate, the relative price of durables, and
the rate of stock depreciation follow known, but possibly
time—dependent, sequences.
        The integration of durables and nondurables purchasing decisions

is the most important novelty of the model. Also, previous analyses
have typically not allowed time—dependency of interest rates, prices,
and depreciation. (These variables are assumed nonstochastic to avoid
certain technical problems; however, most of the analysis below also
applies in the general stochastic case.) The principal restriction of
the model is the assumption that utility and adjustment costs are
quadratic.     This assumption is required for there to be any hope of
deriving closed—form decision rules.       It should be noted, however,
that all previous formulations of the PIH under uncertainty are also

based, either explicitly or implicitly, on a quadratic specification
of utility.1

        To begin, it is assumed that the utility enjoyed by a
representative consumer during a given period t is described by


(2.1)
            U(c,K,K1)    —     1()2    —
                                           (K_Kt)2   —
                                                         m(c_ct)(K_Kt)
                 —
                   (Kt+i_Kt)

c is the quantity of nondurable goods and services consumed during t.

   and Kti are the stocks of consumer durables held at the beginning
of periods t and t+1, respectively. , K, a, m, and d are parameters.
As noted, the expression (2.1) is quadratic in form.
        I assume that the service flow of durables is proportional to
durables stocks; thus the stock measures       and         enter utility
directly. The third term of the RHS of (2.1) permits •the durables and

nondurables aggregates to be nonseparable in utility. Positive values
of the parameter m imply that durables and nondurables are
substitutes.

        The last term in the RHS of (2.1) is nonstandard and requires
some explanation.      In parallel with the literature on capital
accumulation by firms2, this term represents "adjustment costs"
associated with net expenditure3 on durables during period t.        The

inclusion of some type of adjustment cost is required to motivate lags
in stock adjustment.     In the case of the consumer, the most likely
source of' adjustment costs is the time devoted to shopping for (and,
possibly, learning how to use) new durables. Assuming that consumers
                                             —5—

derive utility from leisure time (and dislike shopping), it is
appropriate to include these adjustment costs in the utility function,
as in (2.1). Not incidentally, having adjustment costs in the utility
function (instead of in the budget constraint) and assuming that these
costs are quadratic greatly increases the tractability of the problem.
        If total utility is taken to be the sum of expected discounted
values of present and future period—utilities, then the optimization
problem for an infinitely—lived consumer can be written as



(2.2)               max
                               E0

with r being the prospective real rate of interest between                            t and
t+1.      The forcing variables {rt},(pt},{ 5t' and                             are

time—dependent;                is a stochastic process with a known
distribution.        The sequence of budget constraints defined in (2.3)

requires the consumer to revise his consumption program In each period
so as to balance the expected present values of expenditures and
receipts; this is a reasonable specification for an Infinite—horizon
model.

        At the beginning of each period t the consumer learns the value

of the current income drawing, y. Already known are the other
forcing variables and the stocks of financial assets and consumer
durables left over from the previous period. The consumer's problem
is to choose nondurable consumption, c, and the amount of net
expenditure on durables, Kt+i_Kt.
        The first—order conditions associated with the two decision
variables in t are

where z1, the "cost of capital", is given by


(2.7)           z1 = rp +                 —




These equations follow from differentiating the objective function

with respect to (ct,Kt       and using the budget constraint for period
t.   The interpretation of the equations is as follows:     (2.5) says
that along the optimal path the consumer must receive the same present

utility from an extra unit of nondurable consumption today as from
(l+r) units tomorrow. The import of (2.6) is that, on the margin,
the consumer must be indifferent between the following two strategies:
1) increasing net durables stocks by one unit today, or 2) delaying
the net increase in stocks until tomorrow, applying the savings thus
achieved towards consumption of nondurables.

        (2.5) and (2.6) form a system of stochastic difference equations
in a and K.      The rest of this section will derive the consumers
optimal program, using these equations and the sequence of budget
constraints:     Propositions 1 and 2 below will describe a general
family of candidate solutions for the system (2.5)—(2.6). Proposition
3 shows how to select the actual solution from the general family.
Proposition li derives the exact solution for the case where the
nonstochastic forcing variables r, p, and cS are constant over time.



Proposition 1.       A family of candidate solutions for the
utility—maximizing path of nondurables consumption is given by
                                               -8—

                                          mK    +
                                                     RtGt/bt

where the stochastic process (Gt} j an arbitrary martingale.


Proof.   Noting that Rti/Rt:(l+rt) and that EtGt+i:Gt (by the
definition of a martingale), it Is straightforward to verify that the

stochastic process defined by (2.8) satisfies the first—order
condition (2.5).//



Proposition 2. Given a candidate solution for the nondurables process
as defined by (2.8), the associated solution For the evolution of
durables stocks is

that

Proof. Rewrite (2.6) as


(2.11)   bEtKt2 +    hKti    +
                                     Kt   =   (b/d)Nm2—a)!     +
                                                                   Et(m_zt+,)RGt/bt)

and we have used (2.8). Following Sargent (1979), P. 198, factor the
LHS of (2.11) as b(1 + hL/b +
                                  L2/b)EtKt2      =
                                                      b(1_xiL)(1_x2L)EtKt+2,
where I.. is the lag operator. Equating powers of I.. implies



(2.13)                       —h/b =
                                       x1 + x2
                               1/b =
                                        x1x2


Sargent shows that h < —(1+b) guarantees that 1) x1 and x2 are real

and distinct, and 2) If x1 Is the smaller root, x1 < 1 < 1/b < X2.             A

sufficient condition that h < —(1+b) in our problem Is assumption
(2.10), which is plausible a priori and is satisfied in the data.
     By standard methods the stochastic process {KtI that satisfies
(2.11) is found to be



(2.14)



Using the fact that



(2.15)                  (1—X1)(1...2)/12 = h + b +       1




the expression (2.14) may be re—written as (2.9).//


The next proposition specifies the stochastic process (Gt}.

Proof.   The first step is to show that, given that the consumer is
following one of the family of programs derived in Propositions 1 and

2, the stochastic process (Gt) defined by (2.16) leads to satisfaction
of the sequence of budget constraints (2.3).
      We look first for an expression for expected expenditure in t+i,

EtEXPti, defined by


(2.20)         Et(EXPti)                  Et(ct+j +            pt+i(Kt+i+i_(1_t+i)Kt)

On the presumption (to be verified) that {G} is a martingale,
                                         —11—
Propositions 1 and 2 imply



(2.21)          Et(ctj) =     +    — mEtKt i +    Gt(Rtj/bt1)

(2.22)          Et(Ktji) = X1EtKt+i      +   (1—x1)g +


where Gt is the current realization of (Gt} and               is as defined in

(2.19). The solution to the difference equation (2.22) (imposing the
boundary condition that Kt is a known number) is



(2.23)          Et(Ict+i+i) xKt +       (1—x1)       +
                                                         Gt


(2.23) is valid for integer values of I > .1, if the convention is
adopted that the last term on the RHS of the expression is zero for I
=   —1.

          Substituting (2.23) into (2.21) gives an explicit expression for

Et(cti); substituting the explicit expressions for Et(ct+j),
Et(Ktj), and Et(Kt+j+i) into (2.20) and collecting terms yields


(2.2k)         Et(EXPtj) =   w0(t,i)   +wi(t,i)Gt


where w0(t,i) and w1(t,i) are known sequences of coefficients defined
above.

          Satisfaction of the budget constraint in t requires that the
present value of expected future expenditures equal the present value
of expected future income plus current financial assets; that is,

Substitution of (2.2Z4) into (2.25) and solving for Gt yields (2.16);
that is, as promised, the value of Gt given by (2.16) insures that the

In the econometric work to follow I will emphasize the case in which
the nonstochastic forcing variables Irt,
                                                                    P       are constant.    To
prepare for this, and to counterbalance the abstraction of Proposition

3, Proposition            presents the explicit calculation of the (G}
sequence for the case of constant forcing variables.

depreciation rate , and the relative price of durables p are known to..
be constants. Without further loss of generality, let p = 1.                                Then

the consumer's optimal program is given by

parameters.

Proof.    The stochastic process (Vt}          is   the revision, between t—1 and
t, of the expected present value of income as of t.                    Clearly, IVt)
must be serially uncorrelated.             Thus the process {Gt} defined in
(2.31) is a martingale. This fact plus Propositions 1 and 2 imply,
after some simplification of the more general expression for
that (2.29) and (2.30) satisfy the first—order conditions of the

optimization problem.
      It only remains to be shown that constants g0 and g1 can be
picked such that the sequence of budget constraints is always
satisfied. Since the expression for g1 is used in the sequel, it will
be explicitly stated and derived; the solution approach for g0 will
only be indicated.

          must be chosen so that a shock to the present value of income,

     will throw in motion a sequence of'             expenditures   that precisely
exhausts, in present value terms, the initial windfall gain or loss

v. That is, g1 must be such that


                       dEXP
(2.314)
                 s=O          t+s /dv t   1




is satisfied. To evaluate (2.34) for a given g1, note that


(2.35)         dct5/dvt =       —m
                                     dKt 5/dvt +     {b(1+r))5g1

               dKt+3+i/dvt = x1 dKt5/dvt +             f(b(1+r)]'5g1

The expressions in (2.35) can be viewed as difference equations. With
the boundary condition that dLCt/dvt                           0, the solution to the
difference equation for dK
                                       t+s+1 /dvt is

(2.36), (2.35), and (2.20) together imply that (2.31i) can be written
as


                           b(1+r)20            (1+r)(1+f—O)

                           b(1+r) 2—1                 1+r-x1

                                                1—x1b( 1+r)



The exact expression for g1 follows immediately from (2.37).
     The calculated value of g1 guarantees, essentially, that if the
budget constraint is satisfied In period t—1, it will also be
satisfied In t.         The parameter g0 is set in order to satisfy the
budget constraint in period 0. The expression for g0 is messy and its
calculation, although straightforward, is tedious; thus I will not
report these here. However, the calculation of g0 and g, demonstrates
by construction that the program (2.29)—(2.31), already known to be
consistent with the first—order conditions, also satisfies the budget
                                             —16—

constraint in each period.//


        The propositions above have fully specified the optimal program
of nondurables consumption and durables purchases, both for the
general model stated at the beginning of the section and for what will
be referred to for brevity as the "constant—interest—rate case".
There is one remaining consideration, which is that the transversality

condition



(2.39)
                               lim bT(KT
                                       + lT

be checked.     (2.39) requires that net durables expenditures not grow
faster than 1/b indefinitely.               A sufficient condition for (2.38) to
hold is that the stochastic process {(m_z+1)fiG/bt} be of
exponential order less than 1/b. For the constant—interest—rate case,
this condition boils down to the requirement that r > 0.



3. An example
        Some insights may be gained by applying these results in a simple

example.     Suppose that b(1 +         r)    =   1, all t; this eliminates time
trends from the optimal consumption plans. Also assume p                           1 and a

constant depreciation rate, as in Proposition i4                      Then the decision

rule for nondurable consumption becomes


(3.1)          c =   (   +   mfl   —
                                       mK   + g0 + g1
                                                          t

                                                         1=0


where, recall, g0 and g1 are constants and v is the unanticipated
                                                  —17—
revision to total wealth in period i. Alternatively, first—difference

(3.1) to get



(3.2)              =
                       c_1      —
                                    m(Kt
                                             —
                                                 Kt_,) + g1v

With some manipulation, the decision rule for durables expenditure can
in this case be written as



(3.3)           Kti    —
                           Kt       (1—x1)(K —       K)
           ft
where Kt, the "desired durables stock", is defined by the expression


(3.1;)                     +                —m)
                                                   (g0 + g1 iO vi)
                                    :   :

The definition (3.1;) is justified by the fact that                      is the value of

         that satisfies the first—order condition (2.6) when there are no
adjustment costs (d =           0).         {1C} is a martingale. The response of the
desired durables stock to a favorable wealth shock is positive as long
as m < r + 6.

         Equations (3..2)—(3.4) describe the evolution of the components of
consumer spending in this example.                       The properties of the model in

this case can be illustrated by a thought experiment. Suppose that,
from an Initial steady state, the consumer experiences an
unanticipated increase in wealth (Vt > 0). This raises the desired
durable stock, by (3.11), and stimulates durables expenditure. Because
of adjustment costs, however, durables purchases during the period of
                                    —18—

the shock will not bring the stock to its desired level. Instead, a
gradual increase in stocks over the future will be anticipated.
     If m        0, this gradual adjustment of stocks will affect the
pattern of nondurable consumption. Suppose m > 0, so that durables
and noridurables are substitutes.      By (3.2), we see that nondurable
consumption will spurt upwards, then decline gradually toward a new
steady state. This decline mirrors the increase in durables stocks.
Note that nondurable consumption does not follow a random walk, as it
would if durables and nondurables were separable in the utility
function; instead, the effect of adjustment costs "spills over" from
durables to nondurables.
     The intuition underlying this example is as follows:          The

consumer, having received favorable news about his finances, would
like to own (say) a better car. However, it takes time to shop for
and acquire a new car.       In the interim the consumer compensates by
visiting expensive restaurants; the binge ends when the new car is

purchased.       (On the other hand, if m < 0 —— the consumer enjoys
expensive restaurants more if he can drive to them in a fancy car ——
the increase in wealth will cause dining out to be cut back
temporarily, in anticipation of the new car.)
     It is possible that this model may rationalize Halls finding

that, when c is regressed on ct1 and             the coefficient on
is negative.4 By (3.2)—(3.4), the covariance of c —       c_1   with

is equal to m(1—x1)(r+ _m)g1var(v 1)/(a—m2), which is negative when
O < m < i'   +    .   Presumably,     is functionally related to
leading to the negative coefficient in Hall's regression.

. Application   to .&ie time series data
     This section reports the results of the application of the formal
model to aggregate U.S. data. I will concentrate here on what Section
2 called the "constant—interest—rate case", in which not only real
interest rates but also the relative price of durables and the
depreciation rate are taken to be time—invariant.       Making these
assumptions greatly simplifies estimation.      The effect of allowing
interest rates and the other forcing variables to be time—dependent is
briefly discussed at the end of this section.

     14.1. Data. The data used are quarterly, from the national income
and product accounts. The sample period is 19147:1 to 1980:11. The
end date was chosen because the data were revised as of 1980:111; the
unrevised series were used for comparability to earlier work.      The
basic data were consumption of nondurable goods and services5,
expenditure on durable goods, and disposable income.     All the data
were per capita, seasonally adjusted, and measured in 1972 dollars.
Net durables expenditure and net stock series were constructed using
the annual stock data reported in Musgrave (1979).     I searched for a
constant depreciation rate that matched the gross expenditure data to
the endpoints of the annual stock series. The constructed quarterly
stock series correlated with the annual data quite well. The implied
quarterly rate of depreciation was .0506.
     14.2. Use of instrumental variables.    In her study of the
permanent income hypothesis in aggregate time series data, Flavin used
no instrumental variables in estimation; she easily rejected the PIH.

In contrast, Hayashi (1982a) employed an instrumental variables
                                       —20—

technique and found results generally more favorable to the Puff.          In

light of traditional results on simultaneity bias in the
consumption—income relationship, it seemed important to use
instruments for income.       Accordingly, I began by regressing the
disposable income series against a list of instruments.6 The fitted
income sen-s was used in place of the original series in all of the
subsequent estimation.

         An instrumental variables technique was also applied in an
attempt to correct for bias arising from the presence of transitory
components in expenditure. See section k.5 below.

         k.3 Empirical v series.     It was desired to have a "revisions to

present value of income stream" series to match the variable v,
defined in (2.33).      I proceeded as follows: The fitted income series

described in 1.2 above was exponentially detrended (to achieve
stationanity), then modelled as an AR(8) process with autoregressive

coefficients p1,p2,...,P8. The residuals of this autoregression may
be thought of as estimates of the innovations to current income
perceived by consumers during the sample period. Assuming that the
statistical model for income was correctly chosen, the revisions

series {v} can be shown to be proportional to the innovations in
income, with the factor of proportionality given by

Formula (14.1) was derived in a similar context by Flavin.           The
                                     —21-

intuition behind this expression is clear: An innovation to current
income has a much larger implication for the present discounted value
of the consumer's future income when the income process is
"persistent"; i.e, the autoregressive coefficients have a sum close to

one. Using this approach, and assuming that the quarterly interest
rate r was constant and equal to .01, I calculated that a one—dollar
innovation to current income during the sample period implied
approximately a $1ZL84 increase in the total present value of the
representative consumer's income stream.         (For r:.005, the
corresponding estimate was $16.811; for r=.015, it was $13.56.)
Assuming r.0125, Flavin found (p. 1000) that the present value of a
one—dollar innovation to income was $17.80.

     It should be noted that the method for relating innovations to
current and future incomes described here is not the only one
possible. For example, a similar approach in which growth rates of
income (rather than detrended levels) were fit by an AR(8) process
yielded much lower estimates of the long—run implications of current
income shocks. My variant of Flavin's method is used as the basis of
the results reported here partly to Increase comparability with her

work and partly because the use of assumptions more favorable to the
PIN underscores the robustness of this paper's results.
     4.11. Unrestricted estimates.     It is straightforward to put the
optimal consumer decision rules derived in Proposition 11 into a form
suitable for estimation. Quasi—first—differencing (2.29) and (2.30)
and using (2.31) gives us

across the coefficients of the RHS variables, including the implieit

restriction that g1 is an exact function of the other parameters.
Before imposing those restrictions, however, it is instructive to look
at unrestricted OLS regressions in the form of (14.2) and (14.3):

         The comparison of these regression results to equations (14.2) and

(11.3) makes the model seem rather promising. The parameter m appears
to have a value of about .045 (although the level of significance is
low), which would mean that durables and nondurables are substitutes.
                                   —23—

The value for m is "large" in the following sense:         It seems
reasonable to suppose that, empirically, the derivative of durables
expenditure with respect to income shocks is positive. For this to be
true in the model, it is required that m < z, where z is the cost of
capital. With r assumed to be .01, the average quarterly value of z
is about .07; therefore, a value of m of .015 or so is close to its
maximum a priori value.

       The regressions also imply a value of x1 of about .79, or an
average stock adjustment rate of about .21 per quarter. This seems
plausible.

       An anomalous feature of the regressions (4.4) and (4.5) is that
both      and Kt+i depend on lagged as well as current values of the
revisions to expected income variable v. Consumption is not a random

walk, even with the correction for lagged adjustment of durables
stocks.    Assuming that this is more than misalignment of the data,
this finding violates the model and the PIH in their strictest form.
However, as a reading of Hall's discussion suggests, this sort of
"refutation" of the FIR is not very substantive.       We can easily
imagine a modified version of the FIR in which there are short lags of
perception or action.7     The behavior of an economy in which the
modified FIR governed consumption would be similar to that of an
economy in which the strict FIR held.

       An interesting refutation of the PIN would be, not that there are
lags of perception, action, or data collection, but that there is an
excessive short—run response of consumer spending to a perceived
change in income or wealth.     This would, for example, imply a wider
scope for anti—recessionary fiscal policy than there is under the PIH.

Finding out whether "excess sensitivity't is important requires
estimation of the fully restricted model.
     4.5. Estimation of the restricted model. Before the full model
could be applied to the data, one more preliminary issue had to be
dealt with; this was the treatment of the trends in the components of
consumer spending.

     Flavin argued in her paper that a trend in per capita income
(due, say, to productivity growth) should induce a trend in per capita
consumption, even if individuals tried to maintain level lifetime
consumption patterns. This is because old people (whose wealth was

accumulated during periods of lower productivity and who therefore
have low consumption) are being replaced in the population by younger
people (who look forward to higher levels of income and therefore have
high consumption.)
     While this argument is reasonable, it does not tell us much about

the relationship between trends in income and in consumption.    For

example, the trend in consumption induced by growing income will
surely depend on the age distribution in the population; it will also

depend on the extent that generations are linked by bequests. At a
more disaggregated level, the trend in durables relative to the trend
in nondurables will be affected by many factors, such as relative
prices and the baskets of durable and nondurable goods which are
available. For these reasons, I left exponential trends in nondurable
consumption and durables stocks to be estimated jointly with the other

parameters.

     The full estimated model is given in Table 1. Equations (1) and
(2) are the same as (4.2) and (14.3), except that, first, the free
                                   —25—

trend terms trend and trendK have been introduced and, second, it is
assumed that the total response of spending to an income shock is
distributed over three quarters.    (Longer lags were tried and easily
rejected.)   It is not required that the distributed lags of durable
and nondurable spending have the same shape; however, equation (3)
imposes the restriction that the ratio of the total response of
durable spending to the total response of nondurable spending be the

same as given by the model.

     The parameters     and     are defined in equations () and (5) to
be the difference between the total observed response to an innovation

in the present value of income and the response implied by the
optimizing model, for nondurable and durable spending respectively.

Notice that the parameter g1 is not freely estimated but is
constrained to be a function of other estimated parameters, as in
(2.37).   The issue of interest is whether the "excess sensitivity"
parameters      and   are significantly different from zero.
     Estimates of the model which make use of all cross—restrictions
are given in Table 2.    It was assumed that the real interest rate r
was .01 per quarter; changing this assumption affected the estimate of
b, but not any other results.      Estimation was performed both by
nonlinear least squares (Table 2, column 2) and by three—stage
nonlinear least squares, using the instruments listed in note 6 (Table

2, column 3).     The reason for trying the instrumental variables
technique (above and beyond the use of instruments in constructing the
fitted income series) was to eliminate transitory components of
durable and nondurable spending; these transitory components have the
potential of creating "measurement error" bias in the estimates.
                                 —26—

However, the estimates generated by nonlinear least squares
(especially for m and x1) appear the more reasonable.      This suggests
that the potential biases were less important than the efficiency
losses arising from the use of instruments.

     What light do these estimates shed on the excess sensitivity
issue? According to the nonlinear least squares estimates, the actu:1
response of consumers to an income innovation is over three times that

predicted by the optimizing model.      The hypothesis that both     and

  are equal to zero can be rejected with 99% confidence using either
estimation approach.   This provides strong support for Flavin's
earlier finding that the PIH can be rejected in U.S. aggregate
quarterly data.
    k.6.   The variable—interest—rate case.      A drawback of the
estimates just presented (one that is shared with most previous
studies) is the assumption that the real interest rate is constant.

Unfortunately, relaxing this assumption introduces many complications.
As noted, the analysis of this paper allows time—dependency of
interest rates and other exogenous variables, but does not permit them

to be stochastic. If we ignore this problem, there are still a number

of essentially arbitrary assumptions that have to be made in measuring
real interest rates and modelling their time series properties. The
results, it turns out, are frequently sensitive to these assumptions.

     I experimented with a number of variable—rate models.         The

following two results were robust and are worth reporting:         1)

Permitting real interest rates to vary reduced the measured excess
sensitivity of nondurable consumption to income by about half.
However, the hypothesis of no excess sensitivity could still be
                                    —27—

rejected with a high degree of confidence. 2) Durables expenditures
exhibit considerable responsiveness to real interest rate changes;
but, allowing variable interest rates in the durables equation did not

seem to reduce the measured sensitivity of durables spending to income

by a significant amount.
        More work is needed on the effects of interest rates on consumer
spending. At this point, however, it does not seem that dropping the

constant interest rate assumption can go more than part way toward
explaining the excess sensitivity of consumption to income.



5. Conclusion
        Most recent studies of the permanent income hypothesis in
aggregate data have found evidence against it.        This paper has
investigated the robustness of that result in a number of ways:

        1)   Estimation was based on a model of joint consumer decisions
about durable and nondurable purchases, permitting explicit
consideration of how accelerator effects or lags in adjustment in
durab].es can "spill over" into decisions about nondurables.

        2)   Some consideration was given to the variable—interest—rate

case.

        3)   The distinction was made between failure of the PIR due to
short lags of perception or action and the more important cause of
failure, excessive sensitivity of consumption to income change.
        ) Instrumental variables were used to reduce potential
simultaneity and measurement error biases.

        5)   Alternative methods of measuring the relation between
innovations to current income and innovations in the present value of
                                    —28—

the income stream were tried.

        6)   Trends in consumption spending and the consumer's discount
rate were estimated, rather than imposed a
        None of these changes overturns the rejection of the PIH in
aggregate time series data.

        Future research might usefully pursue the variable—interest—case
in more detail; it would also be interesting to try to discover why
panel data studies seem on the whole more favorable to the PH! than
those done in aggregate data. Finally, a research issue is raised by
the following fact: Existing studies do not tell us whether the PH!
Is rejected because consumption has a Keynesian sensitivity to current

income; or, because consumers, although forward—looking, have a
relatively short horizon.      As the policy implications of these two
cases are rather different, it would be useful to try to distinguish
them.

analyses which consider only Euler conditions and do not derive
explicit decision rules.

2. See Gould (1968), Treadway (1969), Lucas—Prescott (1971).

3.   I use net rather than gross expenditure because the resulting
decision rules have a slightly neater interpretation. There are no
formal problems with having adjustment costs depend on gross
expenditure.
k. An analogous finding is in Hall—Mishkin.
5. Flavin excluded the services component because it includes service
flows of residential housing.   I did not find qualitative differences

in the estimates when services were eliminated.
6.   The instrument list included a constant, time, time squared,
population, and the following variables entering contemporaneously and

with a one—quarter lag:    real government purchases of goods and
services, real defense spending, real exports, the relative price of
imports, and beginning—of-period unborrowed reserves.

7.   In the investment literature, it is not usually argued that
Tobin's q—theory is invalid, even though empirically investment
depends on lagged as well as current values of q.
