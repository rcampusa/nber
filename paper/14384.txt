                                               ABSTRACT

I use a large cross country data set and panel probit analysis to investigate the way in which the interaction
between trade and financial openness affect the probability of external crises. This analysis is related
to debate on the adequate sequencing of reform. I also investigate the role played by current account
and fiscal imbalances, contagion, international reserves holdings, and the exchange rate regime as
possible determinants of external crises. The results indicate that relaxing capital controls increases
the likelihood of a country experiencing a sudden stop. Moreover, the results suggest that “financial
liberalization first” strategies increase the degree of vulnerability to external crises. This is particularly
the case if this strategy is pursued with pegged exchange rates and if it results in large current account
imbalances.

      1. Introduction
           During the 1990s a large number of emerging and transition economies
implemented profound market-oriented economic reforms. State owned enterprises were
privatized, fiscal imbalances were tackled, trade barriers were lowered, and in many
countries capital controls were eliminated. In the economic literature these economic
policies are known, somewhat misleadingly, as the “Washington Consensus.”1
           During the early stages of this process a number of authors became concerned
with the “sequencing of reform.”2 They argued that the order in which markets were
deregulated mattered, and that liberalizing capital restrictions too early could be very
costly. Many of these analysts were worried about the effects of a premature opening of
the capital account on the (real) exchange rate and on international competitiveness. In
particular, they pointed out that if restrictions on capital mobility were lifted “too soon,”
the country in question would be flooded with short term capital. This would result in an
appreciation of the currency and reduce profitability in the exports’ sector; in some
countries it could also generate a short term real estate boom. The main danger, they
argued, was that this increase in capital flows would be transitory, and that at some point
foreign investors (and speculators) would withdraw from the country, generating a
“sudden stop” and a costly crisis.
           As the 1990s unfolded a growing number of policy makers dismissed this
apprehensions about sequencing. Reforms were undertaken rapidly and almost
simultaneously, and many countries relaxed capital controls during the early stages of the
process. For some time this strategy seemed to work, as many countries experienced an
acceleration in growth. In the second half of the 1990s and early 2000s, however, growth
was replaced by a succession of deep and traumatic crises. In December 1994, the
Mexican Peso collapsed and was devalued by more than 50%. In 1997, when the
emerging world was beginning to recover from Mexico’s “Tequila” crisis, the East Asian
crises erupted, and it was followed by the Russian devaluation in 1998 and the failure of
the investment firm Long Term Capital Management. In 1999 Brazil’s real was
devalued; in 2000 Turkey faced an external crisis; the Argentine peso collapsed in 2001,

after 10 years of one-to-one parity with the U.S. dollar; and in 2002 Uruguay went
through a deep balance of payments crisis. In many of these countries – as well as in
those affected by “contagion” -- output declined and unemployment increased
significantly.
        During the early 2000s, and partially as a result of these crises, an increasing
number of analysts began to criticize the Washington Consensus and the market oriented
reforms. Nobel laureate Joseph E. Stiglitz was, perhaps, the most forceful of the critics.
In his 2002 book Globalization and its Discontent, Stiglitz argues that globalization
policies and market reforms have the potential of doing a lot of good, if undertaken
properly and if they incorporate the characteristics of each individual country. The
problem, according to Stiglitz, is that globalization was not pushed carefully or fairly.
On the contrary, according to him, during the 1990s and early 2000s reform policies were
implemented too fast, in the wrong sequence, and often using inadequate – or plainly
wrong – economic analysis. Three interrelated policy issues were at the center of
Stiglitz’s and other criticisms of globalization and the Washington Consensus: (1) in
designing reform packages during the 1990s, crucial aspects of the sequencing and pace
of reform were ignored. As a result, in many countries reform was implemented too fast
– Stiglitz prefers gradualism --, and in the wrong order.3 (2) Advocating (and imposing)
financial liberalization was a huge mistake. According to Stiglitz freer capital mobility
encourages speculation and increases the probability of external crises, including sudden
stops of capital inflows. And (3), the IMF involvement in the East Asian and
Argentinean crises was a disaster that made things worse rather than better.4
        In this paper I use a large cross country data set to investigate whether, as posited
by some authors, an increase in the degree of financial openness affects the likelihood
that a country experiences an external crisis. In particular, I investigate if a liberalization
process undertaken in the “wrong order” – that is, one characterized by an early
relaxation of capital controls – increases a country’s vulnerability to a crisis. More
specifically, I use variance component probit analysis to analyze how different variables

  Questions related to the sequencing of reform were first addressed by McKinnon (1973). The subject
was revived in the early 1980s by Edwards (1984). Both of these authors argued that the most adequate
sequencing implied postponing the opening of the financial account.

  Criticism of the Washington Consensus can also be found in Rodrik (2006).

affect the probability of countries being subject to sudden stops of capital inflows. I also
consider the role played by current account and fiscal imbalances, contagion,
international reserves holdings, and the exchange rate regime on the probability of an
external crisis. Throughout the paper I define “crisis” as a major and abrupt decline in
(net) capital inflows, or “sudden stop.”
         The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section II I discuss some policy
issues related to the sequencing of economic reform. In Section III I develop an
empirical model for analyzing the extent to which financial globalization and trade
openness, among other variables, have affected the probability of an external crisis.
More specifically, I investigate the way in which different combinations of trade and
financial openness affect the estimated probability of a sudden stop of capital inflows. In
Section IV I provide some concluding remarks. There is also a Data Appendix. The
paper differs from previous work on the subject -- including from some of my own
previous efforts --, in several respects: first, I use a new measure of the degree of
financial openness constructed from data collected by the Fraser Institute since 1975.
Second, I use a data set that includes a larger number of countries and years than those
used in previous works. And third, and perhaps more important, I address questions
related to the effects of alternative sequencings of economic reform on macroeconomic
vulnerability.
      2. Financial and Trade Liberalization in the 1990s and 2000s: How Much?
         How Fast? In which Sequence?
2.1      Trade and Financial Liberalization in the 1990s
         During the 1990s and early 2000s there was an unprecedented move towards trade
and financial liberalization throughout the world. Country after country reduced import
tariffs and quantitative trade restrictions, and lifted controls on capital mobility. Table 1
presents data on average import tariffs – measured in percentage terms -- and an index of
capital mobility for 6 regions for 1985-2004, computed by the Fraser Institute. This
capital mobility index goes from 1 to 10, with larger numbers denoting a greater degree
of financial openness. The data in this table are eloquent, and show that both trade and
capital controls have declined significantly in every region in the world. Average import
tariffs declined by 49% between 1985 and 2004. Tariff rates were reduced by 68% in the
                                                     4

advanced countries, 56% in Latin America and the Caribbean, 64% in Asia, 33% in
Africa, and only 4% in the Middle East.5 The final three columns in this Table also
confirm that the degree of financial openness was much higher in 2004 than in 1985. The
pattern of financial liberalization, however, has differed across regions. In Africa, the
Middle East and Eastern Europe financial liberalization proceeded through 2004. In the
Industrial nations, Latin America and Asia financial openness “peaked” in 1995; between
1995 and 2004 the index of financial openness declined slightly, indicating a small
readjustment of regulations on cross boarder capital movements.
         Ideally, one would want to have detailed data for a large number of countries and
years that would distinguish between controls on capital outflows and capital inflows.
This would allow researchers to deal with more granular and textured issues, including
issues that are germane to efforts to reduce capital inflows’ pressure on real exchange
rates. Unfortunately, these types of data are not readily available for a large number of
countries and/or years. The IMF only stated distinguishing between controls on inflows
and outflows in 1996, and researchers that have attempted to go back in time and
construct more detailed indexes have concentrated on a small number of nations.
Johnston and Tamirisa (1998) pioneered the attempt to build disaggregated data on
restrictions on inflows and outflows. Their analysis, however, dealt with one year only
(1996) and 45 countries. Other efforts to calculate the extent of restrictions on inflows
include Edison and Warnock (2003). Their index refers to the stock market only, and is
constructed as the ratios of market capitalization of “investible” securities to total market
capitalization. For an exhaustive discussion on measurement issues, including on the
difficulties of providing separate long time series for inflows and outflows and a large
number of countries, see Miniane (2004); see also the discussion and computations in
Chinn and Ito (2006). As with most measures of capital mobility, the Fraser Institute
Index used in this paper and summarized in Table 1, does not make a distinction between
controls on inflows and outflows. As argued above, constructing such an index for a



5
  Ideally one would also want information on non-tariff restrictions. These data, however, are difficult to
find for a large number of countries and years. The Fraser Institute, for instance, has only data for some
years since 1995; these shorter time series support the idea of a massive increase in the degree of trade
openness.

large number of countries and a long period of time, continues to be a challenge for
future research.
2.2        The Sequencing of Liberalization
           For a long time economists have argued about the appropriate sequencing and
speed of economic reform. During most of the 1980s – that is, before the massive push
towards reform -- the generally agreed view on sequencing was: (1) Trade liberalization
should be gradual and buttressed with substantial foreign aid. (2) An effort should be
made to minimize the unemployment consequences of reform. (3) In countries with very
high inflation, fiscal imbalances should be dealt with very early on in the reform process.
(4) Financial reform requires the creation of modern supervisory and regulatory agencies.
And (5), the capital account should be liberalized at the very end of the process, and only
once the economy has been able to expand successfully its export sector.6
           In the early 1990s the issue of speed and sequencing became central in analyses
on how to design a reform strategy for the former communist countries. In discussing the
problems faced by Czechoslovakia during the early period of its transition, Vaclav Klaus
pointed out that one of the main problems was deciding on “sequencing as regards
domestic institutional and price measures on the one hand, and liberalization of foreign
trade and rate of exchange on the other” (Klaus, 1990, page 18).
           Interestingly, this emphasis on speed and sequencing has a long history in policy
discussions. In fact, since the beginning of the economics profession, it has been dealt
with over and over again. Adam Smith, for example, argued in The Wealth of Nations
that determining the appropriate sequencing was a difficult issue that involved, primarily,
political considerations. Moreover, Smith supported gradualism, on the grounds that
cold-turkey liberalization would result in a significant increase in unemployment.
Consider the following quote from The Wealth of Nations: “[t]o open the colony trade
all at once..., might not only occasion some transitory inconvenience, but a great
permanent loss...[T]he sudden loss of employment..., might alone be felt very sensibly”
(Vol. II, Ch. VII, pt. III, page 120).
           Sometime during the early 1990’s the received wisdom on sequencing and speed
began to be challenged by the IMF and U.S. Treasury. Increasingly they called for an

6
    See Edwards (1984) for an early discussion on these issues.
                                                  6

early and rapid opening of the financial account. A number of authors and policy makers
-- including Vaclav Klaus -- argued that politically this was the only way to move
forward. Otherwise, the argument went, reform opponents would successfully block
liberalization efforts. In 1995, IMF official Manuel Guitián said, “There does not seem to
be an a priori reason why the two accounts [current and capital] could not be opened up
simultaneously…[A] strong case can be made in support of rapid and decisive
liberalization in capital transactions (Guitián, 1995 p. 85-86).”
           In the mid 1990s the U.S. government began pressuring the East Asian nations to
liberalize their financial account restrictions and to allow capital to move more freely.
Policy makers and academics in most of the Asia became extremely concerned about
these recommendations. They raised two main issues: On the one hand, they argued that
– as had been the case in a number of Latin American countries during the early 1980s –
liberalizing the financial account would result in massive real exchange rate appreciation.
This was against the decades-old policy of maintaining a highly competitive real
exchange rate as a way of encouraging exports. The second concern was based on a
vulnerability argument: an open financial account could make the East Asian nations
more vulnerable to abrupt declines in capital inflows. If this were to happen, the region
would incur in severe adjustment costs and high unemployment, and could even end up
with a smaller export sector.7
           The sequencing of reform discussion may be illustrated with the assistance of
Table 2, where there are four combinations of financial and trade integration with the rest
of the world. The conventional “trade liberalization first” sequencing is given by a
(gradual) move from Box 1, to Box 2, and eventually to Box 3:



       1                   2                  3


The “early financial integration” sequence, which has been criticized by Stiglitz and
others, has two variants. The “financial liberalization” first mode:

    See, for example, Park and Park (1995).
                                                        7




     1                     4                    3


The second variant corresponds to a faster and simultaneous trade and financial opening:



     1                     3


         Notice that Box 4 in Table 2 – a box characterized by a low degree of openness to
trade in goods and a high degree of financial openness – characterizes the main features
of the “capital account first” liberalization process. Another way of putting it is that
countries that followed the “conventional wisdom” sequencing of opening trade in goods
first and delaying financial openness, will never find themselves in Box 4.
         During the last two decades the following countries have had, during one point or
another, a relatively closed trade account (average tariffs in excess of 25%) and a
relatively open financial account (Fraser index of capital mobility higher than 6): Costa
Rica, Egypt, Guatemala, Jordan, Kenya, Mauritius, Panama, Paraguay, the Philippines,
Slovak Republic, Uruguay, and Venezuela.8 When alternative measures of financial
integration are used – such as an index based on the sum of external assets and liabilities
--, a similar list of countries with a relatively high level of tariffs and high degree of
financial openness is obtained. As pointed out, in terms of the typology in Table 2, these
countries are in Box 4, a box that belongs to the criticized “early financial reform”
sequencing.
         Many of the Latin American countries that suffered major external crises during
the 1990s and 2000s – including Argentina, Mexico, and Uruguay – had opened their
financial accounts early and rapidly. This contrasted with the case of Chile and
Colombia, two countries that maintained some controls on capital flows – and in



8
 In order to be in this list a country has to have had, at least for one year, trade and financial indicators in
excess of the thresholds presented above.

particular on capital inflows -- and did not default on their debts during the 1980s.9 An
interesting question, and one that I address in Section III of this paper, is whether
countries whose policies are characterized by Box 4 in Table 2 have faced a higher
probability of experiencing a sudden stop of capital inflows than countries with other
configurations of capital and financial openness.
      3. Globalization, Sequencing and Crises: An Empirical Investigation
         In this Section I investigate whether the degree of globalization affects the
probability of a country experiencing a sudden stop of capital inflows. I am particularly
interested in analyzing the way in which alternative combinations of financial and trade
openness affect the likelihood of a sudden-stops crisis. This analysis will shed some light
on the sequencing of reform debate, as well as on the validity of some of the criticisms of
the so-called Washington Consensus. I am also interested in investigating the way in
which capital mobility affects the role played by other variables – including external
imbalances and the degree of flexibility of the nominal exchange rate – in determining
the probability of a sudden stop.
3.1      The Empirical Model
         The point of departure is a variance component probit model given by equations
(1) and (2):




                                  1,           if y tj* > 0,

(1)              y tj     =

                                  0,           otherwise.




(2)              y tj*    =   αω tj + ε tj .




9
 On the Latin American reforms and crises see Edwards (2007b). Some countries introduced controls on
capital inflows in the 2000s, including Thailand and Brazil.
                                                        9


Variable y tj is a dummy variable that takes a value of one if country j in period t

experienced a sudden stop crisis (as defined below), and zero if the country in question
did not experience a sudden stop. According to equation (1), whether the country
experiences a sudden stop is the result of an unobserved latent variable y tj* , assumed to

depend linearly on vector ω tj , which includes a number of economic, structural and policy

characteristics of each economy, such as the degree of openness, external and domestic
imbalances and others. The error term ε tj is given by a variance component model:

ε tj = ν j + μ tj . ν j is iid with zero mean and variance σ ν2 ; μ tj is normally distributed with

zero mean and variance σ μ2 = 1 . In addition to the random effects model, I also estimated

fixed effects and basic probit versions of the probit model in equations (1) and (2).10
3.2        Specification and Variable Definition
           I define a “sudden stop” episode as an abrupt and major reduction in net capital
inflows to a country that, up to that time, had been receiving large volumes of foreign
capital. More specifically, I imposed the following requirements for an episode to
qualify as a “sudden stop” crisis: (1) the country must have received an inflow of capital
(relative to GDP) larger than its region’s third quartile during the two years prior to the
“sudden stop.” That is, prior to the sudden stop incident the country in question must
have been a high recipient of foreign capital. And (2), net capital inflows must have
declined by at least 3% of GDP in one year. Table 3 contains data on the incidence of
sudden stops for the period 1970-2004 for six regions as well as for the world as a whole.
In the econometric analysis I use a one year window, where data for the year following a
sudden stop episode are set as “missing.” The main purpose of this window is to avoid
double counting sudden stop episodes that are stretched over multiple years. However,
when the analysis was performed on the raw data, without a window, the results were
similar to those reported here (See Section 3.6 for details).




10
     In the “basic probit” estimation, the error term is assumed to have the standard characteristics.
                                                   10

        In specifying the model I follow the literature on external crises, devaluations,
sudden stops, and current account reversals.11 In the base-case specification I included the
following covariates, all of which are available for a large number of countries and years:
        •    The ratio of the current account deficit to GDP, lagged one period. This
             allows me to investigate whether the “current account matters” when it comes
             to crises.
        •    The lagged ratio of the country’s fiscal deficit relative to GDP.
        •    The lagged value of an index that measures “contagion.” This index is
             defined as the relative occurrence of a contraction in capital flows in each
             country’s “reference group.” The reference group, in turn, is defined for most
             countries as their region. As in Table 3 there are five geographical regions:
             Latin America, Asia, North Africa and the Middle East, Africa and Eastern
             and Central Europe. The advanced countries belong to a group of their own.
             In this calculation data for the country in question are excluded. The
             coefficient of this “contagion” variable in the probit equation is expected to be
             positive, reflecting the fact that when a similar country experiences a capital
             flow contraction, capital flows to the country in question will tend to decline,
             increasing the likelihood of a sudden stop.
        •    Percentage change in the terms of trade (defined as the ratio of export prices
             to import prices), with a one year lag. Improved terms of trade are expected
             to lower the probability of a crisis; its coefficient should be negative.
        •    Lagged international real interest rates, proxied by real U.S. 10 year
             Treasuries. As Eichengreen (2001) has argued, a decline in world liquidity –
             captured by higher international real interest rates – will tend to increase the
             probability of an external crisis. If this is indeed the case, the coefficient of
             this variable will be positive.
        •    A dummy variable for each region. In some of the regressions, instead of the
             regional dummies I included dummy variables for advanced countries.


11
   See, for example, Calvo et al (2004), Glick and Hutchison (2005), Edwards (2002, 2004a, 2004b),
Frankel and Cavallo (2004), Eichengreen et al (2006), Frankel and Rose (1996), and Milesi-Ferreti and
Razin (2000).
                                                   11


        •    A dummy variable that takes the value of one if that particular country has a
             de facto flexible exchange rate regime, and zero otherwise. The classification
             of exchange rate regimes is taken from the updated data set developed by
             Levy-Yeyati and Sturzenegger (2003).
        •    International reserves as a proportion of the country’s total external liabilities.
             This indicator was constructed from data provided by Lane and Milesi-Ferreti
             (2006). To the extent that a high level of international reserves held by the
             central bank is seen as an insurance policy, the coefficient of this variable is
             expected to be negative in the estimation of the probit equations.


        As a way of capturing alternative openness scenarios, I included the following
variables into the probit analysis:12


        •    A variable that measures whether the financial account is open. This variable,
             which I call Cap_Open, takes the value of one if in any given year a financial
             openness index constructed on the bases of the Fraser Institute indicator takes
             a value equal or higher than 6, in a scale from 1 to 10. This value of 6
             corresponds to the 25th percentile of the financial openness index.
        •    A variable that measures whether the trade account is open in any given year.
             This variable, which I call Trade_Open, takes the value of one if the average
             tariff in that year and country is equal or lower than 10%. This value
             corresponds to the 25th percentile of the average tariff calculated by the Fraser
             Institute for 1985-2004; that is, only 25% of the country-year observations
             have values lower than 10% (See the data appendix). Notice that a country
             may have “closed” trade – that is, import tariffs in excess of 10% -- and still
             develop (very) large current account deficits.

  I am not aware of any study that has attempted to deal with sequencing issues with a methodology
similar to the one used in this paper.
                                             12

       In Sub-Section 3.6, on extensions, I report and discuss results obtained when
additional covariates, including the degree of dollarization of the economy and liabilities
mismatches in the banking sector, are included in the analysis.
3.3    Basic Results
       The basic results from the probit estimates are presented in Tables 4, where as
customary, I report the marginal effects of each independent variable on the probability
of a sudden stop, evaluated at the mean values of the covariates. For presentation
purposes in this Table I don’t present the marginal effects of the regional dummies; none
of them, however, was significant, indicating that once economics variables are taken
into account, regional or geographical considerations don’t play an important role. At the
bottom of each column I also present the estimated probability of a sudden stop, also
evaluated at the mean values of the covariates. This is an important variable, which will
become the center of much of the analysis that follows.
       As may be seen, most estimated coefficients have the expected signs and the
majority of them are significant at conventional levels. The following aspects of the
results are worth discussing: (a) countries with large (lagged) current account deficits
face a higher probability of a crisis. The point estimate of the marginal effect of the
(lagged) current account deficit is rather small, however-- about one half of one percent.
(b) There is evidence of contagion. A higher incidence of capital flows contractions in
the region increases the probability of a sudden stop. (c) Higher world interest rates –
that is lower global liquidity – increases the probability of a crisis. (d) With other things
given, having a flexible exchange rate reduces the probability of a financial crunch.
Moreover, the marginal effect of the flexible exchange rate regime is rather large, at
approximately (minus) 2 percentage points. (e) The estimation reported in column (4.1)
in Table 4 suggests that after controlling for the current account deficit, the public sector
deficit plays no role in determining the likelihood of a crisis. However, as may be seen in
column (4.2), once the current account variable is excluded, the public sector deficits
have a positive effect on the probability. That is, a marginal increase in the government
deficit that is not reflected in an external (current account) imbalance has no effect on the
probability of a crisis. (f) Interestingly, and perhaps surprisingly, with other things given,
                                                   13

neither changes in the terms of trade nor the stock of international reserves appear to
affect the likelihood of a sudden stop.
       From this paper’s perspective the most important results are related to the
coefficients of the two openness variables. As may be seen, the coefficient of the
financial openness dummy is significantly positive in the three regressions; moreover, the
point estimates of the marginal effects are rather large, suggesting that with other
variables given (and at their mean values), moving from a “closed” to an “open” financial
account increases the probability of a sudden stop by approximately 4 percentage points.
The results in Table 4 also show that the coefficient of the trade openness variable is
always positive; the values of the z-statistics, however, are low. Only in one of the three
regressions they exceed one, and in none of them they are significant at the 10% level.
Aizenman and Noy (2004) have argued that financial and trade openness are highly
correlated across countries and time. This correlation may explain the low degree of
significance of the trade openness variable.
       The results reported at the bottom of Table 4 show that, when all the covariates
are at their mean values, the estimated probabilities of a sudden stop are on the low side,
ranging from 3.2% to 4.2%. In the Sub-Sections that follow I investigate how these
estimated probabilities – and the marginal effects – change when the probability
functions are evaluated at alternative values of the covariates and, in particular, when
they are evaluated for different configurations of trade and financial openness.
3.4    Probabilities of Sudden Stops under Alternative Configurations of Trade and
       Financial Openness: A Preliminary Exercise on the Sequencing issue
       An important property of probit models is that marginal effects and estimated
probabilities are conditional on the values of all covariates. This means that if the value
of one of the independent variables changes, the overall estimated probability– and of,
the estimated marginal effect of all covariates for that matter -- will also change.
Denoting the (normal) cumulative probability distribution by Φ , the probit model is
defined by:


(3)            Pr( y jt ≠ 0 | ω jt ) = Φ(αω jt )
                                                      14


The marginal effect of covariate z1 is calculated as the slope of the probability function,
evaluated at a specific set of values of the covariates ω jt s . If the estimated probit

coefficient of z1 is α 1 , and we want to evaluate the marginal effect of z1 at a point where
covariates have values captured by vector ω~ , the marginal effect of z1 (evaluated at ω~ )
is given by:


                   ∂Φ
(4)                    = Φ ' (αω~ )α 1 .
                   ∂z1


         In order to provide some insights into the sequencing issue, I use the estimates
from column (4.3) in Table 4 to compute the probabilities of experiencing a sudden stop
for the four configurations of financial and trade openness that appear in Table 2 (in
performing this exercise the values of the other covariates have been maintained at their
means).13 That is, in terms of equation (3) above, I consider four alternative vectors ω~ in
the computation of the overall estimated probabilities presented in Table 5. Each of these
four vectors corresponds to a different combination of trade openness and financial
openness. For example, the estimates for the “Closed Trade Account - Close Financial
Account” box (with a calculated probability of a sudden stop of 0.022) was estimated by
evaluating equation (3) when the Cap_Open variable takes a value of zero, and the
Trade_Open variable also takes a value of zero; in this calculation all other covariates
take their mean value. Likewise, the estimated probability “Closed Trade Account -
Open Financial Account” box (0.068) was obtained by evaluating equation (3) when the
Cap_Open variable takes a value of one, and the Trade_Open variable also takes a value
of zero.
         The results obtained for the estimated overall probabilities of a sudden stop crisis
are presented in Table 5, where robust standard errors were used to compute the z-
statistics. A first reaction to these computations is that in all four possible combinations
of trade and financial openness the estimated probabilities are on the low side. Even in
the highest case the estimated probability is lower than 0.10. Second, and as expected

13
   The reason for choosing equation (4.3) for this exercise is that it provides the tightest estimate of the
effect of trade openness on the probability of a sudden stop.
                                                15

from the estimates reported above, these results show that the highest probability of
facing a sudden stop is obtained when both the trade and financial accounts are open.
This result, however, has to be interpreted with caution, for at least two reasons: First,
the coefficients of the trade openness indicator in the probit equations were estimated in a
rather imprecise way (the z-statistic for the trade openness variable in column (4.3).
Second, the probability estimates in Table 5 were obtained by evaluating the probability
function at the mean values of all other covariates. This, however, is a somewhat
artificial exercise, as it is highly unlikely that countries that have very different
configurations of trade and financial openness –and/or follow different sequences of
reform --, will face the same values of other covariates. Indeed, the concern about the
“financial liberalization first” sequence is that it will result in a very large and
unsustainable current account deficit; moreover, it has been argued that this sequence is
particularly risky in the presence of pegged exchange rates. In the Sub-Section that
follows I address this issue by evaluating the sudden stop probability function under two
alternative scenarios that include different current account deficits and exchange rate
regimes.
3.5        The Role of Current Account Imbalances and the Exchange Rate Regime in the
           Sequencing Debate
           Authors that favor a gradual liberalization course, where the financial account is
opened towards the end of the process, and only after trade liberalization has been
consolidated, have argued that that particular sequence avoids very large current account
deficits.14 Moreover, and as pointed out above, critics of early financial liberalization
have been particularly concerned about the rigidities imposed by fixed exchange rates.
Indeed, many of the major crises of the 1990s and 2000s – including the Mexican crisis
of 1994, the East Asian crises of 1997-98, the 1998 Russian crisis and the 2001 Argentine
currency collapse -- took place in countries that had built very large current account
deficits – in the order of 6% to 8% of GDP – and had pegged or rigid exchange rates. In
order to analyze the roles played by both of these variables, in this Section I report results
for estimated probabilities of sudden stops under two alternative scenarios in terms of the
configuration of trade and financial openness, current account balances, and exchange

14
     Stiglitz (2002).
                                                     16

rate regime. (For the actual methodology used, remember the discussion on equations (3)
and (4), and the explanation on how the results in Table 5 were obtained). The two cases
under consideration are:


             •    Scenario A: A country with a fixed exchange rate regime moves from a
                  “closed-closed” situation to an “open financial-closed trade”
                  configuration; that is, it moves from Box 1 to Box 4 in Table 2. In
                  addition, I assume that in the process of opening up financially the country
                  develops a large current account deficit (8% of GDP). In that regard, in
                  this scenario the estimated probability of a crisis is computed by
                  evaluating the probit function when the flexible exchange rate dummy
                  takes a value of zero, and the current account variable takes a value of
                  0.08. This scenario, then, reflects a “financial liberalization first”
                  sequencing that is accompanied by the development of a large current
                  account imbalance, under fixed exchange rates.
             •    Scenario B: Gradual transition from a “closed-closed” configuration to an
                  “open-open” one. I further assume that during the liberalization process
                  the country adopts a flexible exchange rate regime and that, due to the
                  gradualism of the process, it is able to maintain the current account deficit
                  at “reasonable” levels (3.5% of GDP). This means that in this scenario the
                  estimated probability of a crisis is estimated by evaluating the probability
                  function in equation (3) when the flexible exchange rate dummy takes a
                  value of one, and the current account variable takes a value of 0.035. In
                  terms of Table 2, this scenario corresponds to a gradual move from Box 1
                  to Box 3.15


I use the estimates from column (4.3) in Table 4 for evaluating the probabilities under
these two scenarios. Under both Scenarios A and B the initial conditions are
characterized by closed trade and financial accounts. As may be seen from Table 5, in

15
   The “gradualism” aspect of this scenario is built into the assumption that the current account deficit
doesn’t explode, and remains within sustainable levels. This is indeed a feature of gradual liberalizations
(see Edwards, 2002).
                                                    17

this case the estimated probability of a sudden stop crisis is 0.022. The estimated
probabilities of experiencing a sudden stop crisis under the two alternative sequencing
Scenarios described above are:


               •   Scenario A (abrupt “financial account first” strategy): Estimated
                   probability of experiencing a sudden stop: 0.133.
               •   Scenario B (gradual “financial account last” strategy): Estimated
                   probability of a sudden stop: 0.062.


        As may be seen, under both scenarios the overall estimated probability of a
sudden stop increases relative to the “closed-closed” initial condition. However, it
increases significantly more (from 0.022 to 0.133) under Scenario A than under Scenario
B (from 0.022 to 0.062). These results suggest, quite strongly, that both the exchange
rate regime and the evolution of the current account deficit are key variables for
determining the likelihood of a capital inflows crunch. In particular, maintaining the
current account deficit within limits during a reform process reduces a country’s
vulnerability very significantly. Likewise, adopting a flexible rates regime reduces the
risks of a crisis in an important way.
        Another important result is that according to this exercise, under Scenario A the
country in question is more vulnerable to external shocks than under Scenario B.16 For
example, the marginal effect of world real interest rates shocks is twice as large under
Scenario A as under Scenario B: 0.014 vs 0.007. Notice, however, that under both
scenarios these probabilities are still low in absolute terms.
3.6     Extensions, Robustness, Instrumental Variables, and Future Work
        In this section I investigate the robustness of the results and I discuss directions
for future research. I also present results obtained using instrumental variables probit
estimates. In dealing with robustness I focus on the definition of both the sudden stop
indicator and of the openness indexes.



16
 The marginal effects under these alternative Scenarios are not reported fully due to space considerations.
However, they are available from the author on request.
                                              18

       Extensions and Robustness: The results reported above were obtained when the
sudden stops indicator was defined using a one year window. This means that the
observation corresponding to the year immediately following a sudden stop episode was
set as missing. However, one could alternatively define the episodes without using a
window. The results obtained when this is done are presented in column 1 of Table 6,
where as before I report the marginal effects (as in previous Tables, and due to space
considerations, I don’t show those for the regional dummies; once more, however, none
of them was significant). As may be seen, the estimated marginal effects are not very
different from those discussed above and presented in Table 4; moreover, the overall
message from the previous results is maintained.
       An important question is whether the results discussed here are driven by the way
in which the two openness indicators were defined. In order to investigate this possibility
I estimated the variance component probit model using two alternative set of indicators
for openness: (a) I excluded (that is, I set to “missing”) observations where either the
Fraser Institute financial openness index or average tariff variable took intermediate
values. That is, in constructing this alternative index I set the capital open indicator equal
to one if the index is greater than 6 and zero if its value is smaller than 3; all observations
with an index value in between these two values were set to “missing.” Likewise, for the
trade openness index, I set to “missing” all observations with import tariffs in between 11
and 20 percent. The results obtained when these alternative indexes of openness were
used are reported in column 2 of Table 6. (b) As additional measures of integration to
the world economy I used continuous indexes of financial openness and tariff averages
computed on the bases of the Fraser Institute data (remember that the indexes used in the
regressions discussed above where 0-1). I called theses variable Tariff and Financial Op;
a higher value of Tariff indicates a lower degree of trade openness, while a higher value
of Financial Op captures a higher degree of financial openness. These results tend to
support those reported above. The coefficient of trade openness is negative, but not
significant at conventional levels; that of financial openness is significantly positive. It is
important to notice, however, that in this case the marginal effect – computed at mean
values of all covariates – is very small: a unitary increase in the financial openness index
raises the probability of a sudden stop by less than one tenth of one percent.
                                                    19

           In order to explore further the role of trade openness, I replaced the tariffs-based
indicator with the more traditional “exports plus imports, over GDP” ratio. The results
obtained are in column 4, Table 6. As may be seen, these results strengthened our
previous findings. Notice that the overall predicted probability continues to be very low.
           Some authors have argued that the extent of dollarization of an economy –
including mismatches between dollar denominated assets and liabilities in the banking
and corporate sectors --, play an important role in determining its vulnerability to crises.17
In order to investigate this issue I added two dollarization-related variables to the
estimation (a shortcoming of this exercise, however, is that the dollarization data are
available for a relatively smaller set of countries): (a) the ratio dollarized deposits to total
deposits in the banking sector. This variable is called Dollar_Deposits, and was obtained
from Levy-Yeyati (2006). And, (b) an index of currency mismatches constructed by
Eichengreen et al (2005). This index, however, is not available as a time series. In the
results reported below I make the assumption that countries had the same degree of
mismatch for the 1985-2004 period. Because of this, the results obtained when the
Eichegreen and Panizza index was used should be interpreted with extreme care.
           The results obtained are in columns 5 and 6 of Table 6. As may be seen, the
coefficients of these dollarization-related variables are not significant at conventional
levels. This suggests that, with other things given, the degree of dollarization does not
affect in an important way a country’s vulnerability to a sudden stop. It is important to
notice, however, that this does not mean that dollarization plays no role in crisis episodes.
Indeed, it is possible that the costs associated with sudden stop crises are higher in
dollarized nations. This issue, however, is beyond the scope of this paper.
           Instrumental Variables: It is possible, although in my view unlikely, that the
analysis presented in the preceding sections is subject to endogeneity. In particular,
under certain circumstances capital restrictions (and maybe, even trade restrictions) may
be increased as a result of the perception that a sudden stop will occur in the future. In
order to address this potential endogeneity issue I estimated the probit model using




17
     See, for example, Eichengreen et al. (2005).
                                                    20

maximum likelihood instrumental variables procedure suggested by Amemiya (1978).18
In this estimation I used the two continuous indexes of openness (Tariff and Financial
Op) used in the estimation of column (6.3) in Table 6.19
         In determining the instruments I relied on several findings from the empirical
literature on capital controls: (1) Political developments also play an important role in
determining the extent of capital restrictions. (2) More advanced countries tend to rely
less on capital controls. (3) Distance and geographical location are exogenous
determinants of trade flows and openness. Based on these considerations, in the
instrumental variables estimation the following instruments were used: a measure of civil
liberties, as a proxy for political instability; an index of ethnic fractionalization; lagged
change in the terms of trade; the lagged contagion indicator in other regions; lagged
current account balance; lagged (real) world interest rates; the log of GDP per capita in
1970; regional dummies; latitude; and an index of predicted trade flows over GDP,
calculated using a gravity model. 20 The results obtained from the instrumental variables
probit estimates are reported in Table 7. The results obtained generally support the
findings on the effects of financial openness on the probability of a sudden stop. The
covariates have the expected signs and most are significant. The most important result
from this paper’s perspective is that the coefficient of financial openness is, as in the
previously reported estimates, significantly positive; moreover, its point estimate is
similar to that obtained when no correction for potential endogeneity was made. On the
other hand, in the instrumental variables estimation the coefficient of Tariff is not
significant at conventional levels.
Future Work: The analysis presented above has relied on the nonlinear properties of
probits to investigate the way in which different variables – including the degree of trade
and financial openness, the exchange rate regime and current account imbalances –
interact to determine the probability of a country experiencing a sudden and abrupt
decline in capital inflows. An alternative way to deal with this issue – and one that is
18
   The identifying restriction is that the number of instruments excluded from the main equation is equal or
greater than the number of endogenous variables.
19
   The estimation of IV probits when the endogenous variables are binary is extremely complex. For this
reason in this paper I used the continuous indicators discussed above.
20
   As Aizenman and Noy (2004) have shown, there is a strong empirical connection between trade
openness and the degree of capital mobility. The use of gravity trade equations to generate instruments in
panel estimation has been pioneered by Jeff Frankel. See, for example, Frankel and Cavallo (2004).
                                                       21

beyond the scope of this paper – is to introduce in the estimation terms that interact two
or more covariates. This specification would provide information on the cross effect of
one of the covariates on the probability of a sudden stop.21 Future work on the subject
could indeed investigate the nature of these interactive terms and cross effects.
Additionally, future work should focus on trying to determine whether different forms of
financial restrictions affect the probability of a crisis in different ways. As pointed out
above, a particularly interesting question is whether controls on capital inflows and
controls on outflows have the same effect on the probability of a crisis.
           Other promising avenues for future work include devising alternative ways of
depicting different sequencing scenarios. The approach taken in this paper provides
interesting insights, but it is not based on a fully dynamic analysis where different
sequences can be identified sharply. Moving in this direction would require constructing
new openness indexes that would capture the interplay between trade and financial
openness. This would be extremely useful, as it would help policy makers understand the
way in which the interplay between trade and capital account openness affect
vulnerability. As pointed out earlier, another area of future research is constructing
indexes of financial integration that differentiate between controls on outflows and
inflows for a large number of countries over many years.
           The results reported above deal with the effects of alternative degrees of openness
on the probability of a sudden stop crisis. An important question – and one that
complements the analysis presented here – has to do with the costs faced by a country
once a crisis erupts. In particular, are these costs similar in countries that have followed
alternative opening strategies? Or, are theses costs different for countries that followed
different liberalization sequences? These important questions are beyond the scope of the
current paper.
       4. Concluding Remarks
           In this paper I used panel probit and a large cross country data set to investigate
whether an increase in the degree of openness – both trade and financial – affects the
probability of external crises. I was particularly interested in investigating the way in
which the interaction between openness in the trade and capital accounts – the so-called

21
     See Edwards (2007a) for an application to external crises.
                                                22

sequencing of reform -- affect these probabilities. I also focused on potential roles of
current account and fiscal imbalances, contagion, international reserves holdings, and the
exchange rate regime as possible determinants of external crises. In the analysis I used
new measures of capital account and trade restrictions developed by the Fraser Institute.
A main objective of this work is trying to determine whether rapid reforms that open the
financial account early on increase a country’s degree of vulnerability to crises. The
results reported in the preceding pages provide some (preliminary) evidence suggesting
that “financial liberalization first” strategies increase the degree of vulnerability to crises.
This is particularly the case if these strategies are pursued with pegged exchange rates
and if they result in large current account imbalances. Although these results should be
interpreted with caution – in particular due to the imperfect nature of the index of capital
mobility --, they do support the view that “sequencing matters,” a view expressed early
on by McKinnon (1973) and Edwards (1984), and more recently by Stiglitz (2002).
           Finally, it is important to emphasize that this paper has dealt with only one aspect
of policies aimed at opening an economy. Indeed, I have not addressed issues related to
the effects of financial and/or trade liberalization on total factor productivity growth,
aggregate growth and/or welfare. At this time, however, there is a considerable body of
empirical evidence suggesting that countries that are more open to international trade
experience faster total factor productivity growth than countries that restrict trade.22
Whether this is a long term effect, or one that eventually dies off is still the subject of
some discussion. There is also evidence that more open economies are able to adjust
more rapidly – and less costly – to external shocks.23 The evidence on the effects of
financial openness on growth and overall economic performance, however, is not that
clear cut. A challenge for future research is to develop a unified empirical framework
that considers the simultaneous effects of financial and trade openness – and the
sequencing of reform --, including the effects on growth, welfare and vulnerability to
crises.
