                                               ABSTRACT

We investigate the theoretical possibility and empirical regularity of two troublesome anomalies that
frequently arise when cross-price elasticities are estimated for a set of brands expected to be substitutes.
These anomalies are the occurrence of: (a) negatively signed cross-elasticities; and (b) sign asymmetries
in pairs of cross price elasticities. Drawing upon the Slutsky equation from neoclassical demand theory,
we show how and why these anomalies may occur when cross elasticities are estimated for pairs of
brands that are substitutes. We empirically examine these issues in the context of the widely used
Multiplicative Competitive Interaction (MCI) and Multinomial Logit (MNL) specifications of the
fully extended attraction models (Cooper and Nakanishi 1988). Utilizing a database of store-level
scanner data for 25 categories and 127 brands of frequently purchased branded consumer goods, we
find that about 18% of a total of 732 cross elasticity estimates are negative and approximately 40%
of the 366 pairs of cross elasticities are sign asymmetric. Finally, we find that the occurrence of negatively
signed cross elasticities can be partially explained by a set of hypothesized relationships between cross-price
elasticities and brand share and elasticities of income and category demand.

                                           1. INTRODUCTION

        One of the most perplexing puzzles empirical researchers confront when analyzing

category-level data in order to estimate substitution matrices are results that appear to

contradict both economic theory and managerial insight. For example, many studies of

cross elasticities show that the sales of competing products are negatively related to the

prices of those products. Such estimates not only seem to violate economic theory regarding

product substitutes but also pose a managerial dilemma: why would the sales of my product

increase when my competitor lowers his price? The objective of this paper is to shed light

on this puzzle and to provide insights into what patterns of results can be expected from

estimates of price-based substitution matrices.

        More specifically, we address two related problems encountered in many empirical

studies when one seeks to employ flexible demand specifications for market share models

(such as the “fully extended” versions of either the Multiplicative Competitive Interaction

(hereafter MCI) or the Multinomial Logit (MNL) models, also referred to as the Exponential

Competitive Interaction (ECI) model). 1 Flexible demand specifications directly incorporate

the concept of differential cross-competitive effects and have other desirable properties

(Cooper and Nakanishi 1988, Cooper 1993, Fok, Frances, and Paap 2002).

        The first problem with flexible specifications of market share response models is that

they occasionally yield cross-price elasticities that are negative and statistically significant,

even when there are good reasons for expecting that the brands are substitutes. Second,

because flexible models allow differential cross effects to be asymmetric with respect to not

only magnitude, but also sign, the situation arises where, for example, the estimate of the

 Hanssens, Parsons, and Schultz (2001, p. 124) advocate use of the ECI label rather than MNL to avoid
confusing the MNL/ECI share model with the logit model of individual-level demand or brand choice.


                                                     2
cross elasticity reflecting the influence of i ’s price on j ’s market share has the opposite

sign to the estimate pertaining to the effect of j ’s price on i ’s market share. This leads to

an interpretive quandary: such a result seemingly indicates that a pair of brands are

simultaneously substitutes and complements.

           It is interesting to note that the phenomenon of negative cross-elasticities has been

documented across a number of studies reported in the marketing science literature. For

example, in their meta-analysis, Sethuraman, Srinivasan and Kim’s (1999) found that

negative cross-elasticities accounted for about 10% of the 1,060 cross-price elasticities they

assembled from 15 published studies. These authors included the negative cross-elasticity

estimates in their meta-analysis but posited that they are likely due to measurement errors.

           The doubtful presence of negative cross-elasticities in market response models has

led researchers to develop techniques to reduce or even eliminate their occurrence. For

example, Bucklin, Russell and Srinivasan (1998, herein BRS) show positive substitution

patterns can be assured by relating the cross elasticities to the row-conditional brand

switching probabilities based on individual level data and aggregated to the corresponding

market level. Since brand switching probabilities are always positive, the resulting market

share elasticities are also positive. In an empirical application for nine brands of liquid

laundry detergents, BRS also present an unrestricted fully-extended MCI attraction model

for which 38% of the elasticities that are negative. Similarly, many multinomial logit and

probit specifications use a single parameter for the price coefficient. An appealing feature

of such models is that the cross elasticities 2 are based on the own-price coefficient and as

long as this coefficient is negative in value, the cross elasticity will always be positive.

         This paper adopts a different perspective and raises the issue of whether these

negative substitution rates are indeed incorrect, or whether they represent a real

phenomenon in substitution patterns that can be analyzed and interpreted. In this spirit, we

address the issues of both negative and asymmetric-signed cross elasticities in the general

context of quantity-based market share models. We begin by providing a theoretical

rationale for these phenomena and then conduct an empirical assessment of predictions

stemming from this theory. The following research questions are directly addressed in this

paper:

         1) Is it theoretically possible for signs of cross-elasticities to be negative for a set of

              brands that are substitutes? As a corollary of negative signs, is it possible for a

              pair of cross elasticities to be asymmetric in sign?

         2) Does empirical evidence support hypotheses stemming from the theoretical

              underlying patterns of signs in cross-elasticities?

         The theoretical findings are based on an application of the well-known Slutsky

equation from demand theory (Deaton and Muellbauer 1980) to the context of quantity

based market share models.                As an illustration of this effect, consider the theoretical

substitution pattern between two competing brands of liquid laundry detergents: Tide (P&G)

and Wisk (Unilever). Figure 1 presents the classic indifference curve analysis often used in

utility theory to explain the difference between compensated and uncompensated tradeoffs.

The indifference curves are given by the parallel curved lines, U1 and U2. The horizontal

axis represents the demand for Tide (XTide) and the vertical axis is demand for Wisk (XWisk).


elasticity is eii = β p (1−msi ) where ms i is the market share for brand i, β p is the estimated price coefficient
from the logit model and   eii   is the uncompensated own price elasticity. The corresponding cross-elasticity is
eij = − β p ms j for i ≠ j . Since β p is typically negative in estimation the cross elasticity is usually positive.



                                                           4
The straight lines (I0,I1 and I*1) represent budget constraints. Since the optimal consumption

bundle is at the point where the highest indifference curve is attained, the best point for this

set of prices is A.

                                     INSERT FIGURE 1 HERE

             The first consequence of a change in the price for Solo (here a price decrease) is a

shift and rotation of the budget constraint out to I1. The new optimal point is at B. The

uncompensated cross price elasticity for Tide given Wisk’s price change is given by the

relative change in the demand for Tide given the relative change in the price for Wisk, or

(ΔX   Tide         )(
             / X Tide
                 0
                                 )
                      / Δp Solo / p Solo
                                    0
                                         . Under consumer demand theory, there is no property that

restricts this value to be positive. Indeed, from Figure 1, the quantity demanded of Tide

actually increases in response to the Wisk price decrease.            The general possibility of

negative cross-effects has been acknowledged (see Deaton and Muellbauer, 1980) and arises

because the income effect of the price change overwhelms the substitution effect.

             The substitution effect in Figure 1 is the movement from point A to point C. This

substitution effect is often called the “compensated” elasticity (e.g. see Allenby and Rossi

1991, Montgomery and Rossi 1999b) since it involves the bundle of consumption chosen if

customers were given enough money (i.e. compensated) to attain the utility available from

the original choice (A) which means moving the budget constraint to I 1* . A well known

property of the compensated price elasticity is that it must always be positive, although, as

we will discuss, it is not required to be symmetric – also see Montgomery and Rossi 1999 on

this point.

             What is not well understood is how often and under what circumstances that

negative cross elasticities arise. It is also not well known how this relation translates into


                                                   5
market share elasticities. The theoretical analysis presented in this paper is concerned with

the properties of the decomposed cross-elasticities in the context of market share response

models. This analysis reveals that asymmetries are a natural property of market share

response models.    Moreover, standard consumer demand theory does not rule out the

possibility of asymmetric and negative signs in market share models. We extend our

theoretical analysis to derive the conditions under which one may expect these properties to

surface in estimation of market share response models.

       In the marketing science literature there are few market response models which

consider the difference between compensated and un-compensated elasticities. Notable

exceptions include Allenby and Rossi (1991b) and Montgomery and Rossi (1999).

Montgomery and Rossi (1999) develop a method to measure compensated price (brand

quantity) elasticities directly. An important feature of compensated elasticities is that they

must (in theory) be positive since they measure movements along a fixed indifference curve.

Allenby and Rossi (1991b) develop an individual level discrete choice model for which

magnitude asymmetries in cross-elasticities are explained by opposing effects of inferior

versus superior brands’ income elasticities. Our work closely complements this stream of

literature by studying market share elasticities with a similar decomposition of elasticities

into income and substitution effects.

       As the above discussion indicates, conventional wisdom is that negative estimates of

cross-price elasticities are incorrect (“wrong-signed”). As a corollary, asymmetric signs for

cross elasticities must also be implausible. Our analysis suggests that negative signs can

occur in cross-elasticities (or absolute cross-effects) whenever a combination of the

following conditions holds:




                                              6
        1) There is a high income elasticity for the competing brand, especially when the

            focal brand’s budget share is large,

        2) There is a high category demand price elasticity for the competing brand,

        3) The Hicksian (or compensated) substitution rate between the two brands is small

            relative to 1) or 2).

These results are very general – they apply for any quantity- based market share equation,

regardless of the specification studied.

        We conduct an empirical study to document the extent to which such apparently

anomalous results occur.         The empirical application is based on data for 25 FMCG

categories in the context of the fully-extended attraction based models – in particular, the

MCI and the MNL/ECI specifications for market share. The choice of categories studied is

such that, a priori, all alternatives are expected to be substitutes – i.e. to yield positive cross-

price elasticities.

        A summary of the empirical estimates consisting of 732 cross-elasticities reveals that

negative signs occurred in about 18% of possible instances (depending on the model

specification used) and asymmetric signs occurred in about 40% of cases. Out of 25

categories studied, for only seven categories were all the cross-elasticity estimates positive.

Finally, we find that our hypothesized relationships between the cross elasticities and

income effects, brand share, and category demand elasticity can partially explain these

patterns in the cross effects.

        The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the theoretical background for

quantity-based market share models from the perspective of the neoclassical theory of

consumer demand. Section 3 considers the decomposition of the market share elasticity




                                                 7
based on the Slutsky relation and a set of testable hypotheses is derived from this

decomposition. Section 4 describes the database for which MCI and MNL/ECI market

share models are applied to estimate a large cross-section of price elasticities used in testing

hypotheses. In Section 5 we present our results and in Section 6 we discuss the implications

of our theoretical and empirical findings. Section 7 presents the conclusion from this

analysis and discusses potential further research.


2. CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENTS FOR QUANTITY-BASED MARKET SHARE
                          MODELS

        The starting point for the theoretical analysis is a discussion of the properties

governing attraction-based models drawn from marketing and economic theory. These are

logical consistency, homogeneity, and symmetry. In this paper we focus primarily on

symmetry requirements and develop the symmetry properties of market share models. These

properties are then analyzed to formulate a set of hypotheses that are subsequently subjected

to empirical tests.


2.1 Logical Consistency

        By definition, the share of any brand must fall within the zero-one interval (the

“range” restriction), and shares summed over all brands within a product category must

always equal one (the “sum” constraint). The range restriction further requires that the

maximum of any of the alternatives be greater than zero and less than one. The scope of this

paper is focused on cross elasticities estimated within the class of models that satisfy the

logical consistency requirements (cf., Naert and Bultez 1973, McGuire and Weiss 1976,

Weverbergh, Naert, and Bultez 1981).




                                                8
        Formally, define the market (quantity) share of the i th brand as si = qi / ∑v =1 qv
                                                                                            m




where qi is quantity sold of brand i. By definition, the share of any brand must fall within

the zero-one interval and shares summed over all brands in a category must always equal

one, i.e.,

               m

             ∑s
             i =1
                    i   = 1, 0 < si < 1, for all i = 1,...,m                          (1)


Logical consistency requires a bit more, however. Let there be a set of factors affecting

the si , denoted by X h , h = 1,..., H where h denotes a particular marketing mix variable (e.g.

price, advertising) affecting the i th brand:

               s i = g ( X 1 , X 2 ,...,X H ) ,i = 1,...,m                           (2)

where g () is a continuous and at least once differentiable function. Since shares must always

sum to unity, it follows that:

                                         m
                                               ∂s i
                                       ∑ ∂X
                                        i =1
                                                      ≡ 0 ∀h ∈ 1,...,H                (3)


Hereafter we refer to (3) as the “zero sum” constraint, and note that it is required for logical

consistency.

        To avoid unnecessary complexity, we focus our attention on price and represent

price using the X variable. In the analysis that follows, it will be useful to construct an

m × H matrix whose elements correspond to the effects of variable X h on the market share

of brand i . Let the rows of this matrix represent m brands, and let the columns represent H

explanatory variables affecting the m brand market shares. Let a typical element of this F

matrix be, ƒ ih where:




                                                             9
                                      ∂si
                              ƒih =                                              (4)
                                      ∂X h

Thus, this F matrix of derivatives is of the form:

                                      Explanatory Variables
                               ⎡ ƒ 11 ƒ 12  ƒ 13 ... ƒ 1H ⎤
                               ⎢                          ⎥
                               ⎢ ƒ 21 ƒ 22 ƒ 23 ... ƒ 2H ⎥                        (5)
             Brands        F = ⎢ ƒ 31 ƒ 32 ƒ 33 ...       ⎥
                               ⎢                          ⎥
                               ⎢ ...    ...   ... ... ... ⎥
                               ⎢ƒ                         ⎥
                               ⎣ m1 ƒ m2 ƒ m3 ... ƒ m H ⎦

Note that the zero sum constraints (3) imply that the column sums of F in (5) must all equal

zero, i.e.

                       m
                       ∑ ƒ = 0, for all h = 1,..., H                             (6)
                      i=1 ih

For the remainder of this paper we focus on the role of price in the market share response

function and (for notational convenience) represent price using the non-subscripted X

variable. The focus on price means that H = 1 and that the matrix in Eq. (5) is of dimension

m ×1.

2.2 Market Share Models and Economic Theory

        Additional restrictions on the fi responses can be derived from the economic theory

of demand, as was originally noted by McGuire, Weiss and Houston (1977) who proposed

that “economic consistency” be added to the list of desiderata for market share models along

with logical consistency. Except for studies by Houston, Kenetkar, Stacey and Weiss (1991),

Montgomery and Rossi (1999), and Montgomery (2002), the literature on market share

response models appears to have paid limited attention to the matter of economic

consistency. Here we consider two basic properties of demand functions specified by the



                                                  10
economic theory of consumer behavior (Deaton and Muellbauer 1980 pp. 43-46):

requirements for homogeneity, and for symmetry.

2.2.1 Homogeneity Requirements. Let X 1 through X m be the prices of brands 1

through m , and let X m +1 be money income. According to basic economic theory (Deaton

and    Muellbauer       1980,     Chapter        1),      demand            functions      should    not         be

subject to money illusion, but instead should be homogenous of degree zero in

prices and income. More specifically, suppose that the prices of all m products

and    money       income       are   increased          by      the        same        percentage   amount,

ΔX i / X i ≅ Δ ln X i ∀i = 1,...m + 1 .    In this case, although nominal prices and nominal

income all change by the same proportion, relative (or “real”) prices and (“real”) income are

unaffected. According to demand theory, when relative prices and real income are

unaffected, quantities demanded and therefore quantity shares also remain unchanged.

Moreover, this result does not require that one make the restrictive assumption that all

consumers share identical preferences. As has been shown by Sonnenschein (1973), even if

preferences of individual economic units differ, the aggregate demand functions must still

be homogenous of degree zero in prices and income, i.e.,

                                          m +1
                                                 ∂si      m +1

                                          ∑
                                          i =1 ∂ ln X i
                                                        = ∑

                                                               fi X i = 0
                                                                                                           (7)

Note that the homogeneity requirements (7) imply a different type of sum constraint from

the column sum restriction (6) required for logical consistency. In particular (7) is a row

constraint involving a different matrix having one more column and fih Xh elements rather

than fih in (5). Thus we call the row sum restrictions in (7) homogeneity restrictions, and

note that they are required to ensure consistency with economic theory.

2.2.2 Symmetry Requirements. Is it theoretically possible for a pair of cross elasticities for

two brands to be asymmetric with respect to their signs? The well-known Slutsky equation

from neoclassical demand theory provides the framework needed to analyze this question

(Deaton and Muellbauer 1980, pp. 45-6). The Slutsky equation decomposes the observable

cross-effects of a change in the price of good j ( X j ) on the quantity demanded of good i

( qi ) into two components: (a) the “compensated price effect” representing the substitution

effect along an indifference curve rate where a consumer’s utility (u) remains unaffected;

and (b) the “income” effect indicating how qi increases or decreases with changes in

income ( X m+1 ) , shifting the indifference curve but holding prices constant.

        In Appendix A, the Slutsky equation is derived in terms of quantity market shares

rather than quantity levels. For an individual consumer, this leads to the following

decomposition of market share ( si ) cross elasticities ( Eij ) with respect to price ( X j ).


                                  ∂ ln si   ∂ ln qi                            ∂ ln q i
                        E ij ≡            =                           − Bj

                                                      u =constant                          Prices =constant
                                                                                                              (8)
                                                      ∂ ln ( ∑v =1 q v )
                                                                  m

                                                 −
                                                          ∂ ln X j

for any i ≠ j , where B j is the share of the consumer’s total category expenditures or budget

allocated to good j :

                                                              X jq j
                                                  Bj =                                                        (9)
                                                          ∑v=1 X v qv
                                                              m




        The first two terms on the right hand side of Eq. (8) are market share analogs to the

components of the (Marshallian) quantity demand-based Slutsky decomposition: the

“compensated” cross price elasticity ( ∂ ln q i / ∂ ln X j , u = constant) and the competing


                                                         12
brand’s budget share (not quantity share) weighted by the focal brand’s income elasticity

( B j × (∂ ln q i / ∂ ln X m +1 ) , prices = constant). The third term is the elasticity of primary or

category       demand      with        respect              to       the   price   of   a   particular   good,   say,   j

(∂ ln ( ∑v =v q v )/∂ ln X j ).
           m




         The sign of the first component of Equation (8) defines whether the relationship

between the two goods is one of substitutability (positive) or complementarity (negative).

Moreover, a key result from demand theory is that the compensated price effects must be

pairwise symmetric with respect to both sign and magnitude (Deaton and Muellbauer 1980,

pp. 43-46), i.e.

                                                            ∂q i ∂q j
                                                                =     = R(i & j)                             (10)
                                                            ∂X j ∂X i

Note however, that Eq. (8) does not imply magnitude symmetry with respect to

compensated cross-price elasticities. That is, it is not the case that ∂ ln q i / ∂ ln X j

= ∂ ln q j / ∂ ln X i unless, coincidentally, X j / q i = X i / q j .

         For notational convenience, let us define the income elasticity of brand i as

                                       ∂ ln qi
                             Ii =                 ,                                                          (11)
                                      ∂ ln X m +1

the elasticity of primary or category demand with respect to the price of brand j as


                              Cj =
                                                  (
                                           ∂ ln ∑v =1 q v
                                                      m
                                                                 )                                           (12)   and
                                                 ∂ ln p j

the compensated cross-price elasticity ( ∂ ln q j / ∂ ln p i , u = constant ) by

                                           Xj
                                  Eij* =          R (i & j ) .                                               (13)
                                            qi



                                                                      13
We can therefore rewrite Eq. (8), the uncompensated cross-price elasticity (Eij) as:

                         Eij = Eij* − (B j I i + C j )                                 (14)

       Given this symmetry of compensated price effects, it becomes apparent that a

sufficient condition for the observable share cross-price elasticities to be asymmetric with

respect to magnitude is that the sums of the budget share-weighted income elasticity and the

category demand elasticity for the two goods be unequal, i.e. E ji ≠ Eij when:

                      Eij* − (B j I i + C j ) ≠ E *ji − (Bi I j + Ci )                (15)

       Furthermore, it may be seen from Eqs. (8) and (14) that sign asymmetry may obtain

between a pair of cross-elasticities if the following conditions hold:

                       Eij < 0, iff :     (B Ij i     + C j ) > Eij*
                                          (B I        + C i ) < E *ji
                                                                                       (16)
                       E ji > 0, iff :        i   j



where the Eij* ’s are compensated price elasticities, as defined by Eq. (13). A parallel set of

conditions for sign asymmetry may be defined by reversing the inequalities in Eq. (16).

       Thus, if: (a) the income elasticity of one brand, say i, multiplied by its budget share,

plus the elasticity of total demand with respect to the price of that brand exceeds its

compensated cross-price elasticity with another brand, j , and, (b) the latter quantity exceeds

the sum of the comparable income and category demand elasticities for the other brand, j ,

then the cross elasticities for those two goods will be pairwise asymmetric, both with respect

to sign and magnitude.

       Having established that such asymmetry is theoretically possible, we naturally ask:

What can be said about when one might encounter the conditions identified above for




                                                        14
magnitude asymmetry (Eq. 15) or sign asymmetry (Eq. 16)? This issue is addressed in

Section 3.

         It is worth noting that Allenby and Rossi (1991b) have developed a model of brand

choice which generates asymmetric responses to price promotions for packaged goods

brands differing in quality. The key mechanism which gives rise to the asymmetry in their

context is the sign difference in income effects (Ii and Ij) between a high versus a low quality

brand. In an empirical study of margarine brands, these authors report support for their

model.

2.2.3 Measurement Considerations. It also bears noting that Deaton and Muellbauer

(1980, p. 45) remark that the law of demand does not preclude the possibility that the

(Marshallian) quantity demand elasticity be positive. Their observation is based on the

Slutsky decomposition of the Marshallian demand function, and suggests that even though

the own-price compensated response must always be negative, it is possible (though not

likely) that this be outweighed by a positive income effect for “superior” goods. Goods that

follow this behavior are known as Giffen goods, a special sub-class of inferior goods, where

the good is highly inferior and purchased in sufficiently large quantities to make the overall

demand effect positive. Although they do not comment on cross-elasticities, their

argument/logic applies there in an analogous manner.

         A further problem which frustrates attempts to diagnose conditions underlying sign

asymmetries in empirical work is that the theory underlying the Slutsky decomposition

relates to the behavior of a single, utility maximizing consumer. Hence, issues of underlying

heterogeneity must be considered in interpreting cross-elasticities estimated from aggregate

market share data. In the economics literature, it has been shown that, in general, if




                                              15
consumers differ in their preferences, then one would not expect aggregate demand

functions to satisfy Slutsky symmetry conditions which apply at the individual level

(Sonnenschein 1973; and Diewert 1974, 1977, and 1980).

       In a similar vein, Blattberg and Wisniewski (1989) analyze how asymmetries in

response to price promotions are affected by the distribution of consumers’ preference for

packaged goods brands differing in quality. Studies of individual household purchasing of

such goods reveal substantial levels of heterogeneity in preferences (Chintaguna, Jain and

Vilcassim 1991, Ainslie and Rossi 1998) and in promotional responsiveness (Allenby and

Rossi 1991a). The latter authors investigate the bias in cross-price elasticities obtained from

an attraction-type model estimated with aggregate data when the population of underlying

consumers is heterogeneous. A combination of simulation and analytical techniques is used

to assess the performance of an aggregate “nested” logit model which groups packaged

goods brands into sub-markets reflecting quality-price differences. They conclude that the

use of the aggregate level model is justified when three conditions are met: (i) all consumers

are exposed to the same marketing mix variables; (ii) all brands are close substitutes; and (iii)

price distributions are not concentrated at extreme values.

       Virtually all of this work in marketing on asymmetric competition implicitly or

explicitly assumes that the goods under investigation are related to one another only as

substitutes – complementarities are specifically excluded. As a result, the focus is on

asymmetries in the magnitude of substitution cross effects. Since only positively-signed

estimates are expected, negative cross-effects are often dismissed as “wrong-signed”

anomalies, irrespective of whether they are pairwise symmetric or asymmetric with respect

to sign. Here we take a different position and argue that such anomalies merit deeper




                                              16
investigation. Even if there were a bias against presenting and publishing such anomalous

results in cross-elasticities, they continue to be reported in empirical studies – possibly

suggesting this phenomenon is more widespread than is currently recognized. 3

         Sign asymmetries have been subjected to little in the way of close scrutiny and our

understanding of the robustness of cross-elasticities estimated from the extended versions of

the aggregate attraction models is very limited. More evidence relating to the properties of

estimates obtained from aggregate attraction models similar in spirit to Allenby and Rossi’s

(1991a) and Christen, Gupta, Porter, Staelin, and Wittink’s (1997) studies of aggregation

bias would constitute useful contributions to the existing literature.

         Overall then, whereas theoretical explanations such as differential income effects

between pairs of goods differing in quality may be invoked to account for asymmetries in

the magnitudes of cross-price elasticities, it is difficult to offer a plausible substantive

interpretation for asymmetries in the signs of cross-price effects, other than the operation of

various threats to the statistical conclusion validity of the estimates, such as aggregation bias,

over-parameterization, collinearity and the like.

                           3. PREDICTIONS FROM THEORY

         The preceding analysis highlights possible reasons for observing seemingly aberrant

estimates of cross-price elasticities among brands that conflict with an overall pattern of

substitutability among the brands expected on a priori grounds. In particular, we single out


3
   Meta-analysis studies that review price elasticities have not always distinguished between market share
elasticities and volume elasticities. It is well known that since an individual brand’s Marshallian quantity
demand elasticitiy is the sum of the market share elasticity and the primary demand elasticity (and the purchase
incidence elasticity if one were to estimate this separately, see Gupta 1988), then the size of the primary
demand elasticity may outweigh the market share elasticity – even in the case of the own-price elasticity. It is
straightforward to show that this will occur in the same way for cross elasticities. Researchers often note that
the primary demand component of a price elasticity is small relative to the market share component, typically
citing results of Bell, Chiang and Padmanabhan (1999) or Van Heerde, Gupta and Wittink (2003).


                                                      17
three patterns of anomalies where estimates of cross-elasticities depart from the expected

pattern of substitution. First, we analyze conditions under which negative cross-elasticities

may arise. Second, we consider when magnitude asymmetries can be expected among

positive, sign-symmetric pairs of cross-elasticities. Finally, we discuss the case of sign

asymmetric cross-elasticities. Using the Slutsky relation from Eqs. (8) through (10), we now

formulate hypotheses identifying factors that predict the aforementioned phenomena.


3.1. Positive vs. Negative Signed Cross-Elasticities

        As defined in (10), the second term, R(i&j), on the right-hand side of Eq. (13) is the

Hicksian substitution between the two products. It must always to be positive since this

measures the movement along a given indifference curve. Given that price and quantity

must also always be positive, the first term on the right hand side of Eq. (13) is always

positive and hence E*ij in Eq. (16) must also always be positive.

        Our initial hypothesis is related to the first term in the bracketed component of Eq.

(16), the income elasticity of the focal brand (Ii), weighted by the revenue share of the

competing brand (Bj). Since revenue share (Bj) is always positive and income elasticity (Ii)
                      B                            B




is typically positive (i.e., for superior goods), ceteris paribus, we expect that the greater the

value of the product, B j × I i , the more likely it is that B j × I i will be sufficiently positive to

overcome the (positive) value of the first term in Eq. (16) containing the compensated price

elasticity (E*ij) hence, the greater the likelihood that the sign of the cross-elasticity (Eij) will

be negative. This may occur, for example, when the competing brand (j) is superior, the

focal brand (i) is a large share brand and the two brands occupy distinct positions, such that

the compensated substitution effect ( R (i & j )) is small. Thus, our first hypothesis becomes:




                                                  18
       H1: The larger the value of the product (Bj Ii) of the revenue share of the
                                                     B




           competing brand (Bj) and the income elasticity of the focal brand (Ii),
                                  B




           the greater the likelihood that the sign of the cross elasticity of the
           focal brand’s (i) share with respect to the competing brand’s (j) price
           (Eij) is negative.


       One caveat to this logic bears noting. It seems likely that the revenue shares of the

competing (Bj) and focal (Bi) brands will be inversely related, since over all brands, shares
              B              B




must sum to one. If the competing brand’s revenue share (Bj) increases, the focal brand’s
                                                                B




revenue share (Bi) may decrease. Especially in mature categories (or whenever category
                  B




demand elasticity is close to zero), this means that the quantity sold of the focal brand (qi)

decreases.

       Since we expect category demand with respect to the price of the competing brand to

be negative (Cj <0), then the last term in Eq. (14) is positive and hence, ceteris paribus, the

greater the competing brand’s category expansion effect (a larger absolute value for Cj), the

less likely it is that the cross-elasticity of the focal brand’s share with respect to the

competing brand’s price (Eij) will be negative. Therefore, we state our second hypothesis as:

       H2: The greater the absolute value of the elasticity of category demand
           with respect to the price of the competing brand (Cj), the less the
           likelihood that the sign of the cross elasticity of the focal brand’s (i)
           share with respect to the competing brand’s (j) price (Eij) is negative.

       When would we expect this category expansion effect to be small?              There is

evidence that the price elasticity of category demand changes over the product life cycle

(Hanssens, Parsons, and Schultz 2002, pp. 338-339). Specifically, the behavior of category

price elasticity has been found to vary widely across categories according to stage of

maturity and market structure (Nils, Dekimpe, Steenkamp,and Hanssens 2001). Multi-

category comparisons of the primary demand effect reveal that the primary demand effect is




                                              19
often not significant. For example, Hoch, Kim, Montgomery, and Rossi (1996) found that

average (across stores) category demand was inelastic in eleven of eighteen categories of

food and non-food products sold in supermarkets. A common result is that the category

demand effect for mature product categories is relatively small when compared with the

share effect (see Bell, Chiang and Padmanabhan 1999; Van Heerde, Gupta and Wittink

2003). For similar reasons, the difference in the category demand elasticity for a pair of

competing brands may also be expected to be small.

        A third hypothesis we offer to help explain negative cross-price elasticities stems

from the homogeneity condition (Eq. 7) requiring that the row sums of the substitution

matrix must be equal to zero. As shown in Berndt and Silk (1993), this requirement is

satisfied for the MCI model, but not for the MNL/ECI model. The logic behind the

following hypothesis is found in the requirement that for any row in the matrix (5), the cross

elasticity terms plus the own-elasticity must sum to zero.

        To see the implications of this requirement, consider the following example with

three brands, and the first row of the substitution matrix Eq. (5). Let E11 be the own price

elasticity and E12 and E13 be the cross-price elasticities for brand 1 with respect to the prices

of brands 2 and 3 respectively. Then the closer the absolute value of E11 divided by the

maximum (positive) value of the cross-price elasticities is to zero, the greater the likelihood

that a given cross-price elasticity is negative.

        H3: (MCI model only.) The smaller the absolute value of the focal
            brand’s own-price elasticity, relative to the maximum value of its
            cross-price elasticities with respect to the other brands, the greater
            the likelihood that the cross-price elasticity is negative.

        Finally, we consider how the term in Eq. (14) involving the compensated

substitution rate, E*ij (see Eq. (13)) might affect the sign of the cross elasticity, Eij. Consider



                                                   20
first the influence of the quantity of the focal brand i, qi. The larger qi, the more likely it is

that Eij will be negative. To see this, note that since R (i & j ) is positive and symmetric for

the two brands, it follows that when qi is large then the influence of the compensated

substitution rate is lower--i.e., the denominator of the first term in Eq. (14) increases.

However, the latter effect may be offset by a fall in the budget share for the competing brand

( B j ), accompanying an increase in the budget share of the focal brand i (Bi). Without further
                                                                              B




a priori insight into the association of an increase in quantity sold and the income elasticity

(given by the shape of the Engel curve), we cannot draw conclusions on the directional

impact of qi on the sign of the cross-price elasticity. Furthermore, except in industries that

follow Cournot-style quantity setting behavior, quantity sold cannot be treated as exogenous.

Given this ambiguity, we are unable to formulate a directional prediction concerning the

influence of qi. Therefore, we include this variable as a covariate in the analysis discussed

3.2 Pairwise Sign Asymmetric Cross-Elasticities

         Lastly, we turn to sign asymmetries in pairs of cross elasticities. Here the Slutsky

equation (see Eqs. 16 or 17) does not provide clear, a priori guidance as to what will cause

the signs to be asymmetric, since such an outcome will depend on a set of complicated,

nonlinear and implicit relationships governed by the functional forms of Eij and E ji .

Absent the necessary foundation for formulating hypotheses, we resort to conducting

exploratory empirical analyses wherein we relate the presence of sign symmetry vs. sign

asymmetry in pairs of cross-elasticities to the constructs represented on the right-hand side

of Eq. (14).

       4. DATABASE AND ESTIMATION OF MCI AND MNL SHARE MODELS

   We begin this section with a description of the database employed in our empirical

analysis. Following that, we discuss the specification of the MCI and MNL/ECI share

models used to estimate cross-elasticities. Lastly, we discuss the specification of the models

used to estimate the income and category demand elasticities required to implement

empirically tests of our hypotheses.

4.1. Database

       The source of the data analyzed here is the Dominick’s Finer Foods database,

provided by the James M. Kilts Center, Graduate School of Business, University of Chicago.

We investigate 127 brands from 25 sub-categories. The sub-categories are purposely

selected so as to be composed of relatively homogeneous choice alternatives. That is, for

each retailer category studied (laundry detergents, toilet tissue etc.) we identify sub-

categories within which we expect all brands should be highly substitutable. Table 4.1

provides a list and description of the sub-categories, including the number of brands in each

sub category, as well as the number of store-weeks of data available.

                              INSERT TABLE 4.1 HERE

        A total of 86 stores are in the Dominick’s chain, and we have a maximum of 105

weeks of data available for any sub-category.       In some sub-categories stockouts were

observed, such that for given weeks the choice sets available to consumers were constrained.

To avoid possible bias arising from these constrained choice sets, we use only the weeks and

stores when the entire sub-category was available to consumers on the shelves. The data

utilized includes measures of price per volume, price per unit, presence of promotions, and

both quantity and unit sales. This approach may not capture dynamic or temporal effects of



                                             22
pricing and promotions, but we see this is as a missing observation problem and therefore

leave that for future research.

       An important issue is the choice of the set of substitutable items comprising each of

the sub-categories. The phenomena of sign and magnitude asymmetries in cross elasticities

may be rather trivial for a set of brands that were a priori complementary to one another (as

an example, consider the subcategories pasta and pasta sauce). Thus, we restrict the scope of

this research to market share attraction models for only substitutable items and choose

categories where it is reasonable to assume that discrete choices are made within a category

by a majority of consumers. As may be seen from Table 4.1, we consider, for example,

different types of dishwashing detergent to be separate sub-categories, e.g., automatic

dishwasher detergent and regular dishwashing detergent brands. For some categories, we

also separate out the form of the product (e.g. liquid vs. powder), since households may

purchase multiple forms for different use occasions. Often, there will be only one UPC at

this level.   Relating this discussion back to our earlier definition of the Hicksian

compensated substitution effect, we select sub-categories in such a way that we are

reasonably confident that the term R (i & j ) > 0.

       In order to minimize aggregation effects, we do not aggregate data across stores—in

line with the finding in Christen, Gupta, Porter, Staelin, and Wittink (1997) that an

aggregation bias arises in estimates for nonlinear models when sales data are summed across

stores, and weighted average price of the UPCs are employed.

4.2. Specification of MCI and MNL Share models

       We estimate own and cross elasticities for the fully-extended specifications for the

MCI and MNL/ECI attraction models. Details on the derivation details and properties of the


                                               23
fully extended versions of the attraction models are discussed in Fok, Franses and Paap

(2002). In attraction models of market response, market share for a brand depends on its

attractiveness relative to the sum of the attractions of all competing brands (Bell, Keeney,

and Little 1975). Attraction is specified as a function of a set of marketing mix variables

and other covariates. For the fully extended model, each brand’s attraction is related to a

set of covariates for all brands, i.e.,

                                                            m   H

         MCI:                                                                                 (17a)
                                                           j =1 h =1



                                                ⎛       m H                   ⎞
         MNL/ECI:                     Ait = exp⎜⎜ ui + ∑∑ β hji X hjt + ε it ⎟⎟               (17b)
                                                ⎝      j =1 h =1              ⎠

where ui is the intrinsic attractiveness for brand i, xhjt is the value for covariate h for brand j

at time t and β hij are parameters relating the sensitivity of the attraction to changes in the

covariate. The error component is ε it and can take on a rich structure to accommodate a

host of econometric issues (cf. Fok, Frances, and Paap 2002). The estimation procedure

involves a “log-centering” linear transformation proposed by Cooper and Nakanishi (1988,

pp. 28-29). 4

         The covariates in our model include retail price, in-store promotions and a number of

seasonal and event-based indicator variables. After log-centering, the reduced form models

for the MCI and MNL/ECI models, respectively, are:

MCI:

  The log-centering procedure applied to the fully extended model is possible because of the scale invariance of
the geometric mean (or SIGM) property of attractions. This property is developed in Berndt and Silk (1993).

where c = category, s = store, M=month, t = week, mc = number of brands in category c,

{i,j}= brand subscripts, scsit is brand i‘s share in t, ~
                                                        scst is the geometric mean of the shares of

the brands in c for t, X csit is the retail price for brand (consistent with our notational

convention used throughout the paper), s csj ,t −1 is lagged market share for brand j , and

{cpn,bns,pco} are metrics for promotions, i.e. coupon, bonus buy and a simple (promotional)

price reduction, respectively. We originally coded promotions as dummy variables – a zero

or one if a promotion is present for any UPC. The final promotion variable used in

estimation is a weighted index of the promotions run across UPCs within a product line (e.g.

Little 1998). The weights represent the share of the UPC for the brand over the entire

observation series. Due to the narrow definition used for the categories studied, the number

of UPCs per brand is often low and therefore the weighted promotional index is highly

correlated with the non-weighted promotional variables. The components ( μciM + μcie )

represent brand specific monthly and event-based unobserved variables.

       For the MCI model, we then add a one to the promotion metric before taking logs,

since this would otherwise require taking a log of zero for weeks/stores where no promotion

was present. Because of the linear additive link function, the MNL/ECI model does not




                                                         25
require us to add a one to the promotion variable. In both cases, the purpose of these

covariates is to control for store-level promotional activities.

        The other controls used in the market share specifications are mainly seasonal

indicator variables. We use a rich set of variables to account for unobserved demand shocks.

First, to account for unobserved monthly activities for these stores, we add in a set of

monthly indicator variables. Second, we add in “event” based indicator variables. These

events include major retailing chain-wide events that often have a considerable effect on

store traffic. Examples of such events include Thanksgiving, Halloween, Easter, etc. . The

presence of lagged responses is a common concern with sales models, although not so much

with market share models. Nevertheless, the models include lagged market share terms for

m-1 brands in each category.

        For the empirical analysis, we use brand level data for each store and each week.

We perform no aggregation across stores and weeks and minimal aggregation across SKUs.

In estimating the parameters of Eq. (18), we constrain the estimates to be equal across stores

and across weeks.       While it is also valid to study micro-level parameters (e.g. see

Montgomery 1997), our interest is more at the brand-market level (e.g. the Chicago DMA)

than in identifying factors useful for fine-tuning the price structure at the store level.

4.3 Estimates of Cross-Price Elasticities

       Price elasticities are calculated based on the estimated attraction coefficients ( β̂ ij )

for all brands competing against a focal brand. The elasticity expressions for the MCI and

MNL models are given by (Cooper and Nakanishi 1988, pp. 144-145):

                                                m
       MCI:                    Eˆ ijMCI = βˆij − ∑ wv βˆvj                            (19a)
                                                v =1



                                          ⎛         m
                                                             ⎞
       MNL/ECI:                Eˆ ijMNL = ⎜ βˆij − ∑ wv βˆvj ⎟ X j                    (19b)
                                          ⎝        v =1      ⎠

where wv is the mean market share for brand v, X j is the mean value of retail price, and the

“hat” above each value indicates that the parameter is estimated. The metrics ( wv , X j ) are

arithmetic means of the quantity market share across the 52 weeks and the arithmetic mean

of the prices for the competing brands, also across the 52 weeks. A total of 732 cross-price

elasticities were estimated for the 25 sub-categories listed in Table 4.1. The number of

cross-elasticity estimates per sub-category depends on the number of brands available in a

category, which varies from a minimum of 3 to a maximum of 12. Note that the number of

observations (stores × weeks) upon which the cross-elasticity estimates are based varies

from a minimum of 3,910 to a maximum of 9,030.

       Table 4.1 also summarizes pertinent information about the signs of the MCI and

MNL/ECI estimates. The relative incidence of negative-signed and sign-asymmetric cross-

elasticities is very similar for the MCI and MNL/ECI models, both in total and with respect

to how these anomalies are distributed across the 25 sub-categories. Of the 732 cross-

elasticity estimates, 16.9% are negative for the MCI model and 17.8% for the MNL/ECI

model. When the estimates are treated as pairs (732/2 = 366), the percentage of sign



                                                  27
asymmetric cross-elasticities is 40.7 and 43.7 for the MCI and MNL/ECI models,

respectively. The proportion of the cross-elasticities within a category that are negative is

quite stable across categories, being zero in seven of the 25 categories and ranging from

10% to 30% in the remainder. The incidence of sign asymmetric pairs is similarly stable

across categories, again being zero in 7 of the 25 categories and varying from 4% to 10% of

the pairs in the other categories.

        Table 4.2 documents the distribution of the pairs of sign symmetric and sign

asymmetric estimates according to their statistical significance, as judged by whether the

ratio of the cross-elasticity estimate to its standard error was equal to or exceeded 2.0 in

absolute value. Whereas for pairs of positive, sign symmetric cross-elasticities, both

estimates are statistically significant for more than 60% of the pairs, such is the case for less

than 30% of the negative, sign symmetric pairs, and for less than half of the sign

asymmetric pairs. Again, the distributions of the MCI and MCI/ECI estimates are very

similar with respect to statistical significance.

4.4 Estimation of Category Demand and Income Elasticities

        A separate econometric model is estimated to obtain the category demand elasticities.

For each category we specify a log-log model for category demand ( Qcst = ∑i =c1 qcist ) for
                                                                                              m

                              Qc                                   Q

                           j =1




                                                      28
where X cst = ∑i =c1 wcis X cist is a price index with expenditure share weights (constant over
                    m




time) wcis . The parameter δ cQ represents the category demand parameter with respect to the

category price index and in fact is the estimated category demand elasticity. The category

price elasticity for brand i can be found by differentiating Eq. (20) with respect to the price

(or C i = ∂ ln Q / ∂ ln X i ).

         In generating the income elasticity we had several choices for our metric of income.

First, we could measure sensitivity of quantity demanded to actual income and measure

using a survey-based demographic database, such as Consumer Expenditure Survey from

the Bureau of Labor Statistics or the census. This is a common approach used in consumer

demand theory (cf. Hausman, Leonard and Zona 1994, and Deaton and Muellbauer 1980).

The problem with using available demographic data is the lack of temporal and cross-

category variance. While we expect an aggregate measure of income to affect the total

amount spent on groceries within a year, we do not expect this variable to have much

explanatory power for disaggregated subcategory choices.         We therefore draw on the

approaches used by past research (e.g., see Allenby and Rossi 1991b, and Deaton and

Muellbauer 1980) and use the total amount spent on the subcategory as our metric for

income. This income metric is also consistent with the definition of income ( X m +1 ) in

Appendix A.

         The estimation equation used to generate income elasticities is a log-log quantity

specification, controlling for prices and for other demand side shocks, and is also a function

of the total category income:

     5. CROSS-CATEGORY ANALYSES OF ANOMALIES IN ESTIMATES OF
       CROSS-PRICE ELASTICITIES: HYPOTHESIS TESTS AND RESULTS

         We begin this section by defining measures of the explanatory variables used in the

cross-category analyses to account for the types of anomalies in cross-price elasticities

discussed above. We then outline the statistical models used in implementing the hypothesis

tests and exploratory analysis related to each type of anomaly. Finally, we present our

empirical findings.

5.1 Definitions of Explanatory Variables

         We employ the following measures for the key constructs identified in the preceding

analysis as factors influencing the sign and magnitude of cross-elasticities.

Bi = ( X i qi ) / ∑ j =1 (X j q j ) = brand i’s share of total category expenditures where each
                     m




      X i qi is a sum across stores and weeks;

Ci = elasticity of category demand with respect to the price of focal brand i, estimated

      by the coefficient obtained when the natural logarithm of the total category

      volume ( ln ∑ j =1 q j ) is regressed on the natural logarithm of the price of brand i
                         m




                                                              30
     (ln Xi), Ci ≤ 0. See Eq. (20).

Ii = elasticity of demand for brand i with respect to total category expenditures,

    estimated by the coefficient obtained when the natural logarithm of quantity

    purchased of brand i (ln qi) is regressed on the natural logarithm of total

    category expenditures ( ln ∑ j =1 X j q j ), Ii ≥ 0. See Eq. (21).
                                        m

      to the maximum (positive) value of its cross-price elasticities with respect to

      the other brands, E*ii < 0.

mc = the number of brands in category c, mc > 1.

        Ci and Ii are pooled (across stores and weeks) estimates from the category demand

and quantity demand models, respectively, discussed earlier in Section 4.4. The variable E*ii

is taken from the estimation of the MCI and MNL/ECI models. Both the number of brands

(mc) and the budget shares Bi are observed. Table B4.4 in the supplemental Appendix B

0.737, Std. Dev.: 0.346) and category demand elasticities (Median: -0.349, Std Dev.: 0.434)

across the 127 brands marketed in the 25 product categories.


5.2. Testing Hypotheses (H1-H3) Relating To Negatively vs. Positively Signed Cross
Elasticities

        Hypotheses H1-H3 were derived from the Slutsky relation for the cross effect

term, Eij , per Eq. (14):


                    Eij = (X j / qi )R (i & j ) − (B j I i + C j ) < 0


        We employ two distinct models in implementing tests of H1-H3. The first is a binary

where dc’ are dummy variables for C-1 (C = 6) categories comprising the cross-section of

products listed in Table 4.1. Note that the dependent variable is defined as the probability

that a cross-elasticity is negative, where the binary dependent variables used in the

estimation was set equal to one if a cross-elasticity was negative ( Eijc < 0 ), and zero, if

positive. As may be seen from Table 4.1, 124 of the 732 (17 percent) cross-elasticity

estimates for the MCI share model were negative while 130 of the 732 (18 percent) cross-

elasticity estimates for MNL/ECI share model were negative. The hypothesized relations

discussed in Section 3.1 predict that:

                             H1: φ > 0; H2: η> 0; H3: θ >0.

       The first six variables on the RHS of Eq. (24) (the intercept, the set of category level

dummies, the ratio of price of the ith brand to quantity sold for the jth brand, the number of

brands in the category, and the main effects of budget share and income) serve as control

variables for the (unobserved) Hicksian demand component, (X/q)R(i&j). An alternative

way to capture the Hicksian demand component is, of course, to specify an intercept

parameter for each pair of brands. However, no matter how many categories are studied,

the number of parameters required to do so is extremely large, leading to numerical

convergence problems and low degrees of freedom and power for testing hypotheses.

         Since the underlying dependent variable is continuous, we also tested H1-H3 based

on a linear regression model, estimated via generalized least squares (GLS). The latter

estimation adjusts for a possible lack of independence among the observations and facilitates

correction for the presence of heteroskedasticity. 5

Summary statistics for the variables specified in Eq. (24) are presented in the supplemental

Appendix B, Table B5.1A1. From that table, it may be seen that although the means (0.521

and 0.062) and the standard deviations (1.253 and 0.135) of the MCI and MNL/ECI cross-

elasticity estimates, respectively, are quite different, the relative variability of the two sets

of estimates is similar (coefficients of variation: 2.400 and 2.177, respectively). The two sets

of cross-elasticity estimates are also fairly highly intercorrelated (r = 0.667). The simple

correlation between Eij and the binary dependent variable for the logit model is -0.636 for

the MCI estimates and -0.407 for the MNL/ECI estimates. Note that the hypothesized signs

of the coefficients for the relevant variables in Eq. (24) are the reverse of those for the

binomial logit, i.e.,

                  H1: φ′ < 0; H2: η′< 0; H3: θ′ < 0.

         Parameter estimates for the binomial logit Eqs (22) and (23) and the regression

model in Eq. (24) are presented in Table 5.1. In the case of the binomial logit results, H1 and

5
  Interdependence among a cross-section of observations of Eij may arise here because for each brand, there is
a set of cross-elasticities between that brand and all the other competing brands within the same category. To
illustrate, for a category of 10 brands, there will 9 cross-elasticities for each brand. Bijmolt and Van Heerde
(2001) make use of an iterative GLS method for multilevel or hierarchical models, due to Goldstein and
Rashbash (1992), to account for such interdependencies. When we applied this procedure to the data in this
study, tests indicated that the estimated within-group covariance was close to zero.


                                                               33
H2 are supported by the estimated coefficients for B cj I ic and Cic respectively; the relevant

coefficients for both the MCI and MNL/ECI estimates have the predicted signs and are

statistically significant (p < 0.01, one-tail tests). However, H1 is supported by the GLS

results for the MCI cross-elasticities but not for the MNL/ECI specifications, where the sign

of estimated coefficient (φ′) for B cj I ic is the opposite of that predicted, albeit not statistically

significant.

                                 INSERT TABLE 5.1 HERE

        The GLS results for both the MCI and MNL/ECI cross-elasticities are inconsistent

with H2; the sign of the coefficient estimate (η′) for C cj is positive, rather than negative as

hypothesized (again, the estimate is not statistically significant). Diagnostic tests indicate

that collinearity is not the source of the “wrong” signs here.

        The results pertaining to H3 for the MCI cross-elasticities are also mixed. The

estimated GLS coefficient (θ ′) for E*ii has the hypothesized sign and is statistically

significant while that from the binomial logit (θ) is the opposite of that hypothesized (albeit

again not statistically significant). Recall from the discussion in Section 3.1 that H3 is not

applicable to the MNL/ECI model.


5.3 Analysis of Pairwise Sign Asymmetric Cross-Elasticities

Having obtained modest evidence in support of our three principal hypotheses, we now

consider empirical findings for those situations in which theory did not provide

unambiguous predictions. As a point of departure for the exploratory analyses of sign

asymmetries, consider the difference between a matched pair of cross-elasticities:




                                                  34

                                qi q j

        An exploratory analysis of possible factors influencing sign asymmetry between

pairs of cross-elasticities was conducted again using both a binary logit and a linear

regression model. For the logit model, the dependent variable is the probability that both

members of a pair of cross-elasticities have the same, rather than opposite signs.

binary variables on the right-hand side of Eq. (27) are defined as follows:

         D1 (ΔB c ) = 1 , if B cj > Bic ; = 0, otherwise.

                                   (               )
         D2 (ΔI c ) = 1 , if I ic > I cj ; = 0, otherwise.

         D4 (ΔC c ) = 1 , if C cj > Cic , = 0, otherwise.


The binary dependent variable employed in estimating Eq. (26) was defined as: D(SS ) = 1 if

E cji and Eijc have the same sign; = 0, if the pair is sign asymmetric.




                                                                      35
       As may be seen from Table 4.1, for the 366 pairs of cross-elasticities estimated for

each share model, sign symmetry was observed for 59 percent (217) of the MCI estimates

and for 56 percent (206) of the MNL/ECI estimates.

        Parallel to the structure of the binary logit model in Eqs. (26) and (27), the following

linear regression model was also estimated by means of GLS, where here the dependent

variable and regressors are continuous, rather than binary as in the logit model.

        Summary statistics for the explanatory variables included in the binary logit and

regression models are presented in the supplemental Appendix B, Tables B5.2A1-B5.2B3.

Parameter estimates for binomial logit Eqs. (26) and (27) and regression model Eq. (28) are

given in Table 5.2.

        Overall, the exploratory analysis conducted using these two models failed to reveal

any covariates that were consistently associated with sign asymmetry in MCI and MNL/ECI

cross-elasticity estimates. While the signs of the estimated coefficients for the covariates

obtained for the MCI cross-elasticities tended to be consistent with those for the MNL/ECI

for each of the logit and regression models, the signs were not consistent across models.

Moreover, the covariates that appeared to be statistically significant in the binomial logit

model tended to be different from those significant in the regression model.

5.4 Summary of Hypothesis Test Results

       We summarize results of the various tests of our hypotheses discussed above in

Table 5.3. Confirming evidence for H1 was obtained in three of the four tests. The tests for


                                                           36
H2 were supported by the binomial logit model but not supported by the regression models.

H3 (MCI only) was only supported by the results from the regression models. Whereas the

binomial logit model produced hypothesis test outcomes that are qualitatively similar for

both the MCI and the MNL/ECI cross-elasticity estimates, the regression model test results

for MCI and MNL/ECI were equally split between agreeing with respect to confirming H2

and conflicting with respect to support vs. rejection of H1.

                               INSERT TABLE 5.3 HERE

        If the binomial logit results are discounted on grounds of being subject to possible

threats arising from heteroskedasticity and non-independence of the underlying observations,

then greater reliance should be placed on tests arising from the regression model where

adjustments were made to address those issues. Doing so, one is led to conclude that with

the exception of H2, all the hypotheses obtain support from the tests conducted with MCI

cross-elasticities. More specifically, the GLS estimates of the regression model for MCI and

MNL/ECI are concordant with respect to H2 (disconfirmation), but discordant with respect

to H1; recall that H3 is applicable only to the MCI cross-elasticities. As was pointed out

earlier, the correlation between the MCI and MNL/ECI cross-elasticities is substantial and

their coefficients of variation are of similar magnitude. The data for the regressors in the

MCI and MNL/ECI models used to test H1 are identical. Hence, at this point we are unable

to account for the conflicting results obtained with respect to the latter pair of hypotheses.



                            6. DISCUSSION

       Market share models are commonly used to measure market level substitution

patterns. A troubling issue encountered in such studies is that seemingly anomalous results




                                               37
can and do arise. As Montgomery and Rossi (1999) observed: “Unrestricted least squares

estimates of own and cross-price elasticities are often of an incorrect sign and unreasonable

magnitude, particularly if the analysis is performed at a relatively low level of aggregation,

such as the account or store level” (p. 413). This paper advances understanding of such

troubling observed anomalies in two ways.

       First, we demonstrate that the presence of negative cross-elasticities is at least

theoretically possible and can be explained by the relative magnitudes of the share-weighted

income elasticity, the unobserved Hicksian compensated rate of substitution, and the

category demand effect. Second, we further show that asymmetries in the signs for adjacent

pairs of cross elasticities are also theoretically possible and explicable in the same way.

This latter finding implies that it is possible for a pair of brands to be simultaneously a

substitute and a complement to one another.

       The value of these theoretical insights in large measure depends upon the extent to

which the aberrant effects addressed occur in empirical work. Using market share attraction

models, we estimated cross-elasticities for 25 categories of consumer packaged goods,

involving a total of 127 brands. Our findings reveal that among the 732 cross elasticities

estimated, about 17-18% are negative. In only seven of the 25 categories were all the

estimated cross elasticities positive. In light of this incidence of negative signs, it is not

surprising that in about 40% of the 366 pairs of cross-elasticities, the estimates were

asymmetric with respect to sign.

       Our theoretical analysis of the Slutsky equation led to the formulation a set of

hypotheses that could account for the occurrence of negatively-signed cross-elasticity

between a pair of brands that are substitutes in the sense that the unobserved Hicksian




                                              38
compensated price elasticity is positive. As summarized in Table 5.3, some empirical

support was found for each of our three hypotheses. In the case of pairwise sign asymmetric

cross elasticities, we concluded that the Slutsky equation was of little help in predicting the

phenomenon of sign asymmetry. Instead, we undertook an exploratory analysis in search of

empirical regularities but found none, as our theoretical analysis had suggested.

6.1 Implications

       Given these findings, what advice can we offer? Rather than dismissing negative

cross-elasticity estimates out of hand, we propose that investigators assess whether they can

be explained by the combination of an income effect, substitution effect and the category

demand effect, as indicated by H1-H3. Drawing on the elasticity estimates from this study,

we illustrate the usefulness of such additional analyses. For example, in the case of the

powdered laundry detergent category, we find a negative cross elasticity of -0.45 for Tide

with respect to the price of Oxydol (both, incidentally, P&G brands). Although Oxydol has

a revenue share of approximately 10%, Tide has a relatively large income elasticity of

around 1.1. Moreover, the elasticity of Oxydol’s price changes on category demand is -0.31.

These effects work in combination to produce a negative cross elasticity for Tide with

respect to Oxydol.

       Analysis of the antecedents of asymmetries in cross-price elasticities identified in

this study can also be useful to assist managers in understanding key properties of a brand’s

competitive position such as its clout and vulnerability. A focal brand is said to be

vulnerable when the cross elasticity of the focal brand with respect to some action taken by a

competing brand is high and positive. A positive cross-elasticity reflects vulnerability in the

sense that it is measures how much share that a competing brand’s price changes can draw




                                              39
from the focal brand. Clout is the converse of vulnerability; viewed in terms of the

substitution matrix, it is the opposite diagonal, and represents how much share that the focal

brand can draw from the competitor.

          While more complex methods are available (cf. Cooper and Nakanishi, 1988, Chapt.

6 and Kamakura and Russell, 1989), a simple 2 by 2 contingency table analysis will serve to

illustrate how determinants of asymmetric cross-price elasticities affect a brand’s clout and

vulnerability. First, assume that the two brands are approximately symmetric with respect to

their compensated cross-elasticities. Second, assume that there is no category expansion

effect of price (i.e. in Eq. 14, Ci=0). The two remaining dimensions are the income elasticity

of the focal brand and the expenditure share value of the competing brand. Extending the

previous example of Tide competing against Oxydol, we identify low and high vulnerability

regions as follows:

                                            Focal brand income elasticity ( I Tide )

          We conjecture that the special case of negative cross-elasticities is most likely to

arise in the upper right hand quadrant, where the focal brand, Tide, enjoys such low

vulnerability that the competing Oxydol brand turns out to be complementary to Tide. This

illustration highlights that an understanding of the antecedents of cross-elasticities can be

useful in diagnosing the level of clout and vulnerability a brand may possess. Development

of a more general taxonomy of the factors underlying clout and vulnerability is beyond the

primary focus of the present paper, negative cross-elasticities.

       The kind of informal analysis outlined above appears broadly consistent with

Montgomery and Rossi’s (1999) position that while restrictions from economic theory

should not be expected to hold exactly in practice, they do nevertheless represent useful

source of prior information from which the analyst should draw.

6.2 Limitations and Directions for Further Research

       Several limitations and directions for further research deserve to be mentioned. First,

we acknowledge that we are able to report only partial support for our hypotheses. At least

in part, this may be due to the intrinsic non-linearity that is inherent among the set of

variables used to test these hypotheses. For example, it is likely that a change in expenditure

share also affects a change in the compensated price elasticity because both make use of the

quantity variable. Of course, it is also the case that absence of evidence is not the same as

evidence of absence. Thus, even though the hypothesized relationships may be correct, the

empirical implementation may not have been adequate to identify and reliably quantify the

relationships.

       Second, our theoretical results hold for any quantity market share response model.

However, our empirical study considered only two types of fully extended attraction models.

This leaves open the important question of what are the properties of other types of market

share response models that are also used to measure substitution patterns, such as random

coefficient logit models (e.g. Besanko, Gupta and Jain 1998, Nevo 2001), classic demand

models such as log-log quantity models (cf. Christen, Gupta, Porter, Staelin and Wittink

1997, Montgomery and Rossi 1999) or aggregate probit models (cf. Chintagunta 2001).




                                              41
       Third, the implications of our results for models in the new empirical industrial

organization literature merit consideration (Kadiyali, Sudhir, and Rao 2001). Since some

cross elasticities in a substitution matrix may be negative, how does this condition affect the

measurement and analysis of competitive structure? A negative cross elasticity between two

competing brands implies that the two brands are complementary in purchases. Our paper

shows that these results are not necessarily invalid.       The presence of negative cross

elasticities may, however, yield some counter-intuitive interrelationships among competitors.

The implications for equilibrium analysis of substitution matrices that include negative cross

elasticities should be investigated.

                                       7. CONCLUSIONS

       Researchers often examine empirical findings with respect to their “face validity.”

Judgments about face validity are generally grounded in some theoretical insights about

what result should be expected/unexpected and/or what is plausible/implausible. In this

paper, we have emphasized the properties of homogeneity and symmetry from neoclassical

demand theory as desiderata for estimates of cross-elasticities. While asymmetry is

generally accepted as an inherent property of a substitution matrix, our results demonstrate

that both negative signs and sign asymmetry in substitution patterns are theoretically

possible.   These theoretical insights were empirically verified with market data. Our

analyses suggest that almost one in five of the cross elasticities are negative. For only seven

out of the 25 categories studied did we find all cross elasticities to be positive. Asymmetric

signs across pairs of cross elasticities occurred about 40% of the time. While we have

reported a substantial amount of progress in developing a theoretical understanding of the

conditions under which negative and sign asymmetric cross-elasticities can occur, more

needs to be done to better predict when they are likely to occur, and in such situations, how

to interpret them.

APPENDIX A: Derivation of the Slutsky Equation in Share Elasticity Form
        Following Deaton and Muellbauer (1980, p. 45), we may write the well-known
Slutsky equation from consumer demand theory (in the notation used throughout this paper)
for any i and j:
                                        ∂g i     ∂h             ∂qi
                                              = i −qj                                   (A.1)
                                       ∂X j ∂X j              ∂X m +1
where
                                     qi = g i ( X m +1 , X ) ≡ hi (u , X )
                                                                                        (A.2)
                                     u = Ψ ( X m +1 , X )
and
                  X j = unit price of good j
                  X = vector of prices for choices j = 1,...m
                  q j = quantity demanded of good j
                X m +1 = consumer' s total budget or expenditures = ∑v =1 X j q v
                                                                         m


                     u = utility
                g i ( ) = Marshallian (uncompensated) demand function
                hi ( ) = Hicksian compensated demand function
                Ψ ( ) = indirect utility function

Given that the Slutsky equation (A.1) relates to quantities demanded but the present interest
is in market shares, we need to move from a quantity elasticity to a quantity share elasticity,
where “share” refers to good i’s share of total demand, i.e., where
                                            q
                                      si = m i , ∀i =1,..., m                                 (A.3)
                                           ∑ qv
                                           v =1

And, by (A.2) we can use qi as the Hicksian demand qi = hi (u, X ) . Note that:
                                       ∂ ln S i X j ∂si
                                               =                                            (A.4)
                                      ∂ ln X j si ∂X j
Substituting the Hicksian demand function into (A.3) and differentiating good i ’s share with
respect to j ’s price, we obtain:
                                    ⎧ m               ∂ ∑v =1 q v    ⎫

The second term in the brackets on the right hand side of (A.6) is the elasticity of total
demand with respect to the price of good j. Further, it is readily shown that the first term in
the brackets on the right hand side of this equation (A.6) is the familiar Slutsky equation
written in elasticity form, i.e.:
                         ∂ ln qi ⎛⎜ ∂ ln qi ⎞⎟      ⎛     ∂ ln qi ⎞
                                  =              − ⎜⎜ B j          ⎟⎟                         (A.7)
                                    ⎜        ⎟
                         ∂ ln X j ⎝ ∂ ln X j ⎠      ⎝ ∂ ln X m + 1 ⎠ Price = constant
                                                       u = constant



where B j is the budget share of the j th good,
                                                                      X jq j

Substituting (A.7) into (A.6) yields:
               ∂ ln S i ⎛⎜ ∂ ln q i ⎞⎟

                                       u = constant


Note that in general, whenever the conventional price elasticity in (A.6) is asymmetric, so
too is the share elasticity in (A.8). But in addition, the share elasticity (A.8) will be
asymmetric if the elasticity of total quantity with respect to price differs considerably
between goods i and j .
