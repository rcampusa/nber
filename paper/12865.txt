This paper examines unemployment duration and the incidence of claims following a 36 percent increase
in the maximum weekly benefit in New York State. This benefit increase sharply increased benefits
for a large group of claimants, while leaving them unchanged for a large share of claimants who provide
a natural comparison group. The New York benefit increase has the special features that it was unexpected
and applied to in-progress spells. These features allow the effects on duration to be convincingly separated
from effects on incidence. The results show a sharp fall in the hazard of leaving UI that coincides
with the increase in benefits. The evidence is also consistent with a substantial effect of the benefit
level on the incidence of claims and with this change in incidence biasing duration estimates. The
evidence further suggests that, at least in this case, standard methods that identify duration effects
through nonlinearities in the benefit schedule are not badly biased.

                                          1. Introduction
          Breaking a longstanding deadlock, legislative leaders and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo
          agreed today to increase New York State's maximum unemployment benefit by 36
          percent, the first raise in five years. Under the plan, which was quickly approved
          by both houses of the Legislature, the maximum weekly benefit of $180 will
          immediately rise to $245.

          New York Times, April 12, 1989, p. B1.



           The effect of unemployment insurance (UI) on unemployment is of interest for two main

reasons. First, many authors have argued that UI is a major determinant of differences in
unemployment across countries and over time.1 Second, the magnitude of the effect of UI on

unemployment is a key input into optimal UI benefit calculations.2 A large literature has

examined the effects of UI on unemployment.3 However, the validity of the sources of

identification used in much of the literature has not been carefully examined. Most work on UI

identifies its effects through cross-state variation in benefits or by assuming a linear relationship

between earnings and duration. Thus, the work requires the comparability of different states or

requires strong functional form assumptions. Sometimes changes over time within a state are

used as an additional source of variation.4 This paper continues an approach to identification that

examines data from before and after sharp changes in the generosity of UI payments. This quasi-

experiment or natural experiment approach follows the methods begun by Classen (1981), Solon

(1985) and Meyer (1989).5 This paper examines the effects of a 36 percent increase in the

maximum UI benefit in New York State on the incidence and duration of UI claims.

       Several aspects of the New York reform make it particularly suitable for examination.

First, the benefit increase was unexpected. A benefit increase had been prevented in the past

because of a procedural deadlock in the Legislature.6 After the announcement of an agreement

between the legislative leaders and the governor, the reform was passed in a few hours and took

effect six days later. Second, because the procedural deadlock had previously prevented a benefit

increase, the increase is unlikely to have been caused by economic conditions in the state. Third,

unlike most UI benefit increases, the higher benefits were available to those who had started their
claims before the increase became effective. Thus, we can examine the effect of the higher

benefits on the durations of a pool of claimants whose decision to file could not have been

influenced by the higher benefits. Finally, unemployment was fairly stable in New York State

during this time period and the state is large enough that we can disaggregate results by industry

and sub-state region.

       The difficulty of identifying UI effects occurs in its most extreme form within a single

state at a point in time. The weekly UI benefit is a constant fraction of previous earnings except

when an individual receives the minimum or maximum weekly benefit. Since previous earnings

strongly influence the payoff from returning to work, the economic benefits of returning to work

and the economic gains from receiving benefits are each largely influenced by a common

variable, previous earnings. Regressions of spell length on weekly benefits and previous

Zhang (2003, 2005).
   6
    The New York Times reported that: “The New York increase, however, was held up because
negotiators in the Legislature had until recently insisted on tying that issue to discussion of
increases in workers compensation benefits. It was only after the two were severed that the way
to a vote was cleared.”

                                                 2
earnings consequently cannot easily distinguish between the effect of UI and the highly

correlated influence of previous earnings. Identification is impossible without a functional form

assumption on the relationship between previous earnings and spell length.7

       A key idea behind this study is illustrated by Figure 1. Figure 1 displays the schedule

relating the UI weekly benefit amount (WBA) in New York to previous average weekly earnings.

The schedule is typical of those in the other states. The solid line is the schedule prior to the

April 17, 1989 increase in the maximum weekly benefit amount. The dashed line is the revision

to the schedule due to the benefit increase. Between the minimum and the maximum, the weekly

benefit amount is one-half of previous weekly earnings. The UI reform increased the benefits
received by the High Earnings group with previous weekly earnings greater than E3, and

increased the benefits of the Medium Earnings group with earnings between E2 and E3. But, the

Low Earnings group, with earnings between E1 and E2, was unaffected by the change. These
Low Earnings individuals provide a natural comparison group to capture changes over time

common to all individuals in the state. By comparing changes in spell lengths and the number of

claims before and after the benefit increase for these three groups, we estimate the effects of

higher benefits.

       The New York benefit increase was unexpected and applicable to all weeks claimed after

April 17, 1989 regardless of when an individual filed for benefits. This unusual aspect of the

change allows us to examine the effect of benefits on those who had filed just prior to the

increase and for whom the increase was unexpected. Thus, we can separate the effect of higher

benefits on duration from its effect on the composition of the pool of claimants who start spells.

There is only a small literature on the effect of benefit generosity on UI take-up, but research

indicates that between one-quarter and one-half of the unemployed eligible for benefits have not


   7
    This identification problem created by the dependence of program generosity on an
individual's previous earnings is common to many social insurance programs and is emphasized
in Krueger and Meyer (2002). See Meyer, Viscusi and Durbin (1995) for a similar paper on
workers' compensation.

                                                  3
filed in recent years.8 Corson and Nicholson (1998) and Blank and Card (1991) estimate the

effect of the weekly benefit amount on UI take-up rate and find elasticities of 0.2 to 0.6 in

aggregate Current Population Survey state by year data. Blank and Card find no significant

effect in Panel Study of Income Dynamics micro data. McCall (1995) finds elasticities that range

from 0.26 to 0.35 in microdata. Anderson and Meyer (1997) using administrative data from the

Comprehensive Wage and Benefit History project and find benefit amount elasticities ranging

from about 0.4 to nearly 1.0.

          Since the benefits of filing for UI depend on a person's expected duration of

unemployment, one might expect those who enter the UI pool when benefits rise to be different
from those who currently receive benefits. It is unlikely that available explanatory variables

would be able to account for this tendency, as they explain only a tiny fraction of variation in

durations. No previous study has been able to examine the effect of benefits on the duration of

UI claims without possible bias due to changes in the pool of claimants. One might believe that

endogenous takeup would necessarily lead duration elasticities to be biased downward.

However, as the model below clearly shows, this may not be the case. Intuitively, those who do

not apply for benefits are likely those with shorter expected (and on average actual) durations.

However, those among the pool of initial non-applicants who are most likely to be induced by a

benefit increase to apply are those who would receive the most from the increase, i.e. those who

expect to have a long duration and thus receive that higher benefit for many weeks. Thus, the

bias in the duration elasticity could be upward.

          There are drawbacks to examining one state over a two-year period. There may be

important macroeconomic changes during the period. The techniques used in the paper remove

any bias if such changes affect the different earnings groups equally. However, if changes in the

macroeconomy affecting unemployment are peculiar to the High and Medium Earnings groups,

then biases would result. Most macroeconomic shocks are thought of as shocks to particular

                                                   4
industries or regions. Therefore, we look within industries and regions in New York to see if

similar patterns emerge. Fortunately, New York State is large enough for these sub-state

analyses.



                         2. The New York State UI Law and the Data


       This section describes the main characteristics of New York State's UI law and the data

used in the study. To qualify for UI, an individual had to have worked at least 20 weeks out of

the preceding 52 and have earned an average of at least 80 dollars during those weeks worked.9
The weekly benefit paid after a one week waiting period was 50 percent of average weekly

earnings, so that the minimum weekly benefit was $40. The maximum weekly benefit was

originally $180 and increased to $245 on April 17, 1989. The maximum weekly benefit rose

again on April 16, 1990 to $260. The potential duration of benefits was a uniform 26 weeks

during the period examined.

       The individual claim data used in the study come from separate data files for 1988 and

1989 which include all UI recipients who began claims in those years. The number of days of

benefits received is recorded, as well as age, sex, race, education, the 4-digit SIC of the previous

employer, the week the claim was filed, previous earnings and weeks worked, and the 5-digit zip

code of the claimant. Close to one-half million claims are available for each year.

       We asked the New York State Department of Labor to delete some classes of

observations from the tapes on which we perform most analyses. Claims from firms with mass

layoffs during the year are dropped, as are claims from firms with extended strikes. These

deletions were made because strikes might unduly influence the results and individual


   9
    A provision which applied to less than one percent of claims allowed eligibility for those who
worked 15 weeks over the last 52 weeks with a weekly wage of at least $80 and who worked at
least 40 weeks in the last 104 weeks with at least $3,200 in total earnings during those 40 weeks.


                                                  5
observations from mass layoffs or strikes cannot be taken as independent in either incidence or

duration calculations. In New York, workers on strike are eligible for UI benefits after eight

weeks. An examination of Current Wage Developments reveals only three work stoppages

involving 1,000 or more workers in New York during the sample period. Observations from

these firms are deleted including 32,000 NYNEX Corporation workers who were on strike from

August 6 to December 4 of 1989. Observations from firms with mass layoffs according to the

BLS definition are also excluded. The BLS defines a mass layoff to be a layoff of at least 31

days duration, involving 50 or more individuals who filed initial claims for UI during a

consecutive 3-week period.10 The exclusion of mass layoff data is based partly on the value of
the dependent variable, so it likely induces a small amount of bias in duration estimates.11 In all,

the strike and mass layoff exclusions reduce the 1988 sample from 476,173 to 454,169 and the

1989 sample from 581,881 to 519,846.



                3. A Model of UI Takeup and Biases in Duration Elasticities



        This section provides a theoretical model of the takeup decision and discusses some of its

implications.12 In particular, we show how endogenous takeup can bias estimates of the benefit

effect on unemployment duration. We suppose that a potential applicant maximizes expected

utility, which is taken to be a function of income and the stigma or transaction costs of applying

for UI. The worker weighs these costs of applying against the benefits, which are determined



   10
    See U.S. Department of Labor (1989, 1990) for tabulations of mass layoffs by industry and
time period.
   11
    The changes in duration and incidence are very similar in the first two quarters if these
exclusions are not made. For the last two quarters, the main change is that 32,000 striking
workers from NYNEX Corporation are deleted.
   12
    The effects of UI on unemployment duration are well known, so we do not explicitly discuss
them here. See Meyer (2002) for references.

                                                 6
primarily by the level and duration of benefits and the distribution of possible spell lengths that

the worker believes she faces. This emphasis on expected spell length is motivated by the large

fraction of nonapplicants who indicate the they do not apply because they expect a short spell.

Table 1 in Anderson and Meyer (1997) reports that 37 percent of those who believe that they are

eligible and do not apply indicate that they do not apply because they expect to get another job

soon or be recalled. The next most common reasons (besides "other" and "don't know") are "too

much work/hassle to apply" at under 7 percent and "too much like charity/welfare" at under 6

percent.

        Formally, let the utility of income y be U(y) for a non-applicant and U(y)-c for an
applicant. For simplicity, the period is length one, the length of unemployment is 8, and the

potential duration of benefits is d. The wage is w and the unemployment benefit is b. Assume

that a potential applicant takes the cumulative distribution of unemployment spell lengths that

she could experience to be F(8). Finally, assume that the application cost varies across

individuals so that c=C+,, where , is a continuously distributed random variable, with c.d.f. L.

The expected utility of an individual who does not apply is



(3.1)



while the expected utility of an applicant is


(3.2)




An individual decides to apply if the benefits exceed the costs, i.e. if

(3.3)

                                                  7
The implied probability of applying for UI is thus

(3.4)



        The effects of changes in the key individual and program characteristics can be

determined by differentiating this probability. Higher UI benefits raise the takeup probability,

while lower application costs increase the probability of application. A marginal increase in the

potential duration of benefits increases the probability, but only if the potential applicant believes

she may be unemployed at least as long as the potential duration. An increase in the wage

decreases the application probability as long as U'' is negative. One can also show that rightward

shifts in the distribution of expected unemployment spell lengths will increase the application

probability.

        With a few simplifications, this framework can also be used to determine how a change in

the weekly benefit amount would affect the spell length composition of the pool of applicants.

This derivative is important because it determines the bias in estimates of the elasticity of mean

spell duration with respect to the weekly benefit from samples of claimants. Previous work has

often argued that endogenous takeup implies that duration elasticities are biased downward, since

non-claimants generally have shorter spells than claimants. The following example shows that

marginal non-claimants may very well have longer spells than claimants so that the sign of the

bias is indeterminate.

        For simplicity, assume that utility is linear so that U''=0. Also assume that there are two

equally common types of individuals with known spells lengths 81 and 82, both less than d, and

that benefits have no effect on the duration of claims. The mean spell length of applicants is now


(3.5)                                 where                   and                  .




                                                  8
The mean duration of spells of claimants may increase or decrease with the level of UI benefits.
Without loss of generality, assume 81 > 82. Then


                                                  where                     and                     .



The intuition for this result should be pretty clear. The outcome depends on the proportionate

change in the number of new claims among those with long spells relative to that for those with
short spells. 8iLi' is the marginal change in new claims of type i, and dividing by Li puts it in

proportionate terms. More simply, the indeterminate sign occurs because an increase in the

weekly benefit amount has a greater effect on those who expect to be unemployed a long time

and thus expect to collect the higher weekly benefit for many weeks. This tendency can offset

the fact that a larger share of those who expect long spells will have already claimed. The

implication of this result is that endogenous takeup could bias unemployment duration estimates

in either direction.13

        The model above assumed that an individual makes a one-time decision at the start of

unemployment as to whether or not to file for UI. Solon (1981), citing prior work by Ehrenberg,

Hamermesh and himself suggests a different argument. In studies that use the duration of UI

claims, it may be that higher benefits induce a person to file more quickly, but do not effect the

time out of work. Either this argument, or the one outlined above provide a reason that one may

want to obtain an estimate of duration effects of UI that is not potentially biased by an effect of
benefits on claim filing.




   13
     Since our model can be applied to durations on other social insurance program where the
generosity of the program and expected duration affect participation, the result of indeterminate
bias also applies to programs such as AFDC and workers' compensation.

                          4. Economic Conditions in New York State


       This section provides some background statistics on the New York State labor market

around the time of the benefit increase. As this paper examines data from 1988 and 1989, it is

important to describe economic conditions at the time of the increase in UI benefits. Table 1

reports monthly data on employment and unemployment for the 1988-1990 period. Throughout

this period, the unemployment rate is quite low, averaging 4.2, 5.1, and 5.2 respectively in the

three years. Employment rises by about 100,000 in each of 1988 and 1989 and then falls back to

its earlier level by the end of 1990. During the period on which we primarily focus, the first two
quarters of 1988 and 1989, unemployment is almost 1 percentage point higher in the second year,

while employment is over 1 percent higher. These patterns can be seen visually in Figure 2

which graphs the monthly employment level and the unemployment rate for 1988-1990.

       Employment patterns by industry and region are a bit more complex. Table 2 reports

employment by broad industry group. None of the industries have pronounced secular increases

or decreases in employment. Employment in Durable and Nondurable manufacturing does

decline somewhat, while the other industries tend to show increases. The bottom several lines of

the table report measures of volatility or dispersion of industry level quarterly employment. We

report the coefficient of variation of industry level employment measured in levels and

logarithms. We also report the variance of the residuals of log employment after regressing it on

a constant and a time trend. In these statistics construction sticks out as being much more

variable over time than any industry. In fact, the variance of the detrended residuals for

construction is more than fifteen times that of the closest other industry. This volatility of the

construction industry motivates our focus through much of the rest of the paper on a non-

construction sample.

        Appendix Table 1 reports average monthly employment by sub-state region within New

York.14 Due to changes in the benchmarks used in the data, the most valid comparisons can be

made between an April to October average for 1988 and 1989. Over this period, employment

rises 1-2.5 percent in all regions except Nassau-Suffolk PMSA, Poughkeepsie and Binghampton

which have stable or declining employment.




                      5. Descriptive Statistics on Incidence and Duration


        To assess the effects of the benefit increase, we begin by reporting incidence and duration

numbers by quarter and earnings group. The statistics of most interest are the first quarter

duration statistics, and the second through fourth quarter incidence statistics. The first quarter

duration numbers could not have been affected by changes in the pool of recipients, as UI

claimants did not know about the increase at the time they filed for benefits. Increases in

duration for these claimants cannot be attributed to changes in the claimant pool, and may be

attributable to the benefit increase. Almost all of the second, and all of the third and fourth

quarters of 1989 took place after the benefit increase, so these quarters should be examined for

changes in claim filing after the increase.

        Table 3 reports the incidence and duration of UI claims by quarter for the 1988 and

1989.15 We report separate estimates for the three earnings groups defined in Section 1 and

Figure 1. The three groups are the High Earnings group, whose members experienced the full

   14
    The numbers reported are for the 10 largest areas within New York state which included
88.8 percent of employment in 1988.
   15
     These tabulations exclude observations with no previous earnings, with weeks worked less
than 20 or real weekly earnings less than $80. We also exclude the .3 percent of observations
with pension reductions in benefits to avoid the complications they would add. These exclusions
eliminate 2.8 percent of observations in 1988 and 2.0 percent in 1989. We also exclude those
who worked in the construction industry, which is a further 16.2 percent of observations in 1988
and 16.8 percent of observations in 1989.

                                                 11
effect of the benefit increase after April 17, 1989, the Medium Earnings group which received on

average less than half of the increase of the High Earnings group, and the Low Earnings group

whose benefits were unchanged by the UI reform. The brackets for these earnings groups are

indexed using average weekly earnings in New York.16

        For each quarter, we report the ratio of the number of claims in the two years and the

difference in the average number of weeks of benefits received in the two years. At the bottom

of the upper panel, we also report the change in incidence for the High and Medium earnings

groups relative to the Low earnings group. At the bottom of the lower panel, we report the

differences-in-differences for duration, comparing the changes for the High and Medium
earnings groups to those for the Low earnings group in each quarter.

        Several patterns are evident in the data. First, there is a pronounced seasonality to both

the incidence and duration of claims. Incidence is lowest in the second quarter for all earnings

groups and both years. Duration is longest in the second and fourth quarters for all earnings

groups and both years. The pronounced seasonality is the reason for comparing the different

calendar quarters of 1989 to the same quarter in the previous year.

        There are only moderate changes in incidence for all of the earnings groups in the first

quarter (though the changes are significantly different from zero), but large changes in later

quarters. In the first quarter, the High and Medium Earnings groups experience a 3-5 percent fall

in the number of claims, while Low Earnings incidence rises by 1 percent. The roughly stable

pattern of incidence for the first quarter of 1989 relative to 1988 is another reason we focus on

this quarter in subsequent duration analyses. There are large changes in incidence during the

other quarters, particularly quarters three and four. In those quarters High Earnings claims rise

40 percent while Medium and Low claims rise about 20 and 15 percent, respectively. These

   16
     E1, E2 and E3 in Figure 1 have been indexed using the annual change in average weekly
earnings of employees covered by the New York State UI law over 1987-1989, which was 5.3
percent and was supplied by the New York State Department of Labor. Precisely, E1, E2 and E3
are taken to be 80, 360, and 490/1.053 in 1988, respectively, and 80*1.053, 360*1.053, and 490
in 1989.

changes are highly statistically significant as the standard errors are always less than 1.5 percent

and often smaller. These numbers are consistent with large effects of the higher benefits on the

relative incidence of claims. The implied incidence elasticities for the 3rd quarter are 0.95 and

0.86 for the High and Medium Earnings groups. For the 4th quarter they are 0.73 and -0.09,

respectively. There is a possibility that these numbers could be due to macroeconomic shocks to

industries or regions that are disproportionate employers of High and Medium Earnings workers.

We show below that such shocks are not the explanation as the above patterns hold within sub-

state region and industry.

        The durations numbers are also consistent with UI benefit effects. There is a large
increase in mean duration of UI receipt in the first quarter for all earnings groups. The changes

between 1988 and 1989 are larger for the High and Medium Earnings groups. If one subtracts

off the change for Low Earnings individuals, the High and Medium changes are 0.66 and 0.11

weeks with standard errors of 0.10 and 0.12 respectively. Thus the increase in benefits appears

to be associated with an increase in weeks of UI receipt. One can scale these increases to arrive

at elasticities after making several assumptions. High Earnings individuals in the first quarter are

affected more by the benefit increase if their spell began closer to when benefits rose. We

calculate an average benefit for someone receiving 20 weeks of continuous benefits following the

claim week. We use 20 weeks because the mean duration is about 16 weeks, but many

individuals' period of receipt is likely interrupted by periods when they do not receive UI.17

Using these assumptions, we calculate elasticities of mean duration with respect to the average

benefit of 0.41 for High Earnings individuals and 0.26 for Medium Earnings individuals.18




   17
    The total weeks of benefits received in the benefit year may come from several spells. Often
benefits are received over a longer calendar period than the number of weeks of UI receipt.
   18
     The percentage increases in benefits for the High, Medium and Low groups are 12.6, 4.2 and
1.6 percent respectively in the first quarter. They are approximately 29.1, 13.2 and 0 percent in
the other three quarters.

                                                 13
          The second quarter has patterns similar to those of the first, while a very different view of

duration effects would be obtained from looking at the third and fourth quarters. In these last

two quarters the duration of High Earnings claims falls relative to those of Low Earnings

individuals. One should note though, that the increased relative incidence of High Earnings

claims may be associated with changes in composition of the pool of claimants. The data from

the third and fourth quarter may provide a good example of the biases that can arise in duration

estimates when the effects of benefits on incidence are ignored. This possibility of bias in

duration estimates when incidence is ignored was one of the key implications of the model of

Section 3.
          Since the principal puzzle in Table 3 is the shorter durations in the third and fourth

quarters for High Earnings claims, we further investigated evidence for a change in the

composition of claims in these quarters.19 For all four quarters and three earnings groups, we

predict durations in 1989 using a linear model estimated for that earnings group and quarter in

1988. We predict durations using base year earnings, weeks worked in the base year, age,

gender, race, education, industry and region. Table 4 reports the mean predicted duration from

these models along with the mean predicted duration for 1988 (which equals the actual mean

duration). We focus on observable characteristics of claimants with the presumption that

observable and unobservable characteristics will move in the same direction (see Altonji, Elder

and Taber 2005 for a discussion of a stronger version of this assumption).

          We find that predicted durations change very little in the first quarter. High earnings

predicted durations change less than 0.05 of a week between 1988 and 1989. This result may be

expected since there was little change in the incidence of claims. On the other hand, after the

benefit increase, in the third and fourth quarters when High Earnings claims increase sharply (but

durations fall) we see that the observable characteristics of claimants have shifted sharply in the

direction of those that tend to have shorter spells. Mean predicted duration falls for the third

   19
        We thank Julie Cullen for suggesting that we pursue this idea.

                                                   14
quarter by three-quarters of a week, while fourth quarter predicted mean duration falls by more

than one-third of a week. This result is consistent with endogenous takeup and the changed

composition of claims being responsible for the counterintuitive drop in spell length for High

Earnings claimants in the third and fourth quarters.

       We should also point out that the standard errors on changes in incidence and duration are

likely understated because observations that are part of large layoffs and recalls are not truly

independent. There may also be shocks that we cannot account for which are common to all

High or Medium Earnings individuals during a quarter.

       To assess if macroeconomic shocks to particular regions or industries could have caused
the changes in incidence and duration, we also examine the same statistics within regions and

industries. For this analysis we group the 4 smallest regions together, to obtain 7 areas for which

we can obtain reasonably precise numbers. In 6 of 7 regions, the High Earnings claims have

larger increases in duration than the Low Earnings claims in the first quarter. In the third and

fourth quarters, all 7 regions experience larger increases in the incidence of claims for High

Earnings individuals than Low Earnings individuals, and 5 out of 7 do in the second quarter.

       Within industry, the patterns of Table 3 are also fairly strong. 6 of the 7 largest industries

(in terms of first quarter UI claims) had larger increases in first quarter duration for the High

Earnings group than the Low Earnings group. The incidence changes in the later quarters were

even more widespread, with all 7 showing relative increases for the High Earnings group

compared to the Low Earnings group in the third and fourth quarters. Thus, the changes in

incidence and duration by previous earnings group are widespread and not due to shocks to

particular industries or regions.

                               6. Regression Estimates of Duration


       The within region and industry analyses above suggest that changes in the composition of

the pool of UI claimants along these dimensions were not responsible for the increase in


                                                 15
duration. However, there are other characteristics of claimants that may have affected the

changes in duration such as age, education, race and previous earnings. We want to control for

all of these characteristics at once. This section reports regression equations for the duration of

UI claims which control for a large number of individual characteristics. We begin by estimating

equations that are the regression analog of differences-in-differences with controls. The

specifications that we estimate are variants of the equation:


(6.1) ln(duration) = " + $1 After Increase*High Earnings + $2 After Increase*Medium Earnings

            + $3 After Increase + $4 High Earnings + $5 Medium Earnings

           + $6 ln(previous weekly earnings) + $7 ln(previous weeks worked) + (’ X + ,


where ln(duration) is the log of duration in days,20 After Increase, High Earnings, and Medium

Earnings are indicator variables for being after the increase, in the high earnings group, and in the

medium earnings group, respectively. The vector X includes age, sex, education, race, industry

and sub-state region. Depending on the exact specification, X may also include indicator

variables for the week the spell began and additional interactions.

           Table 5 reports the results from the regression estimates. In all specifications, the sample

is the first quarter data.21 Specifications (1) and (2) are the regression analogs of differences in

differences that are variants of equation (6.1). Specification (2) replaces the After Increase, High

Earnings and Medium Earnings indicators with their interactions with a full set of indicator

variables for the week of the year a UI spell began (12 indicator variables). The coefficients on

After Increase interacted with High Earnings ($1) and Medium Earnings ($2) are very similar to


   20
        We set durations of zero equal to 0.5 for this set of analyses.
   21
    The regressions drop observations with missing age, sex, race, education, earnings or
industry. They also drop out of state claims which by itself excludes 7.2 percent of the
observations. Including the exclusions of Section 5, 20.8 percent of the 1988 observations and
12.7 percent of the 1989 observations are dropped (mostly due to missing education).

                                                    16
the estimates obtained by taking logs of the numbers in Table 3 and subtracting the Low Earnings

numbers from the Medium and High numbers. This similarity suggests that changes in

observable individual characteristics in this sample are not very important (as was also found in

Section 5). High Earnings durations rise about 8 percent, while Medium Earnings durations do

not appreciably change. The coefficient on the High Earnings group after the increase is strongly

significant.

        We also estimate specifications where the key explanatory variables are functions of the

weekly UI benefit amount. We measure the benefit increase using a variable which is the

average benefit that a claimant would receive during a 20 continuous week claim beginning after
the filing week (see Section 5 for a discussion). We can compare the coefficient on this variable

to that on a conventional benefit variable identified by the nonlinear relationship between

benefits and previous earnings. These specifications are of the form:



(6.2) ln(duration) = " + $1 [ln(average new benefit) - ln (old benefit)] + $2 ln(old benefit)

        + $3 After Increase + $4 High Earnings + $5 Medium Earnings

        + $6 ln(previous weekly earnings) + $7 ln(previous weeks worked) + (’ X + ,.


The first variable is the logarithm of the average weekly benefit a claimant would receive under

the new law during a 20 week claim minus the logarithm of the benefit under the old law. This

variable captures the change in the weekly benefit amount with the new law. The second

variable is the ln(old benefit) which is the logarithm of weekly benefits under the old UI law. It

is separately identified from previous earnings through the kink in the benefit schedule at E2 in

Figure 1. As both variables are in logarithms, their coefficients can be interpreted as elasticities.

Specifications (3) through (6) in Table 5 are variants of this equation.

        The estimates of the two benefit coefficients ($1 and $2) are fairly similar across the

different specifications and are similar to each other. The coefficient on the old benefit is always


                                                 17
0.26. The coefficient on the change in the benefit amount varies from 0.23 to 0.42. A test of the
restriction $1 = $2 fails to reject in all of the specifications. A few of the specifications are

particularly noteworthy. Specification (4) replaces the After Increase indicator with a set of

indicator variables for each of the possible weeks a spell could have begun. Specification (5)

allows interactions between the 19 region and 10 industry dummies and the dummy variable for

being after the increase. Thus, this specification allows for shocks to industries and regions after

the increase that are common to all earnings groups. The coefficient on the benefit increase

variable is very similar to that in the other specifications. Specification (6) includes interactions

between being after the increase and in the High and Medium Earnings groups as well as
including the two benefit variables. Through Specification (5), the change in benefit coefficient

is strongly significant, while in Specification (6) the coefficient falls somewhat and is no longer

significant, largely due to a doubling of the standard error. It also appears that the change in

duration for the High Earnings group in 1989 is not fully captured by the average benefit variable

as the coefficient on After Increase*High Earnings is positive and significantly different from

zero.

        Because durations are limited to be between 0 and 26 weeks, we also estimated Tobit

models which account for both this left and right censoring. These specifications are reported in

Table 6. The Tobit coefficients tend to be quite a bit larger than the linear regression estimates.

This result is not that surprising given that the Tobit coefficients can be interpreted as the effect

on underlying unemployment duration rather than the potentially censored weeks of UI receipt.

The benefit elasticities from the dummy variable coefficients are close to 0.5 while the ln(WBA)

specifications suggest higher elasticities. The change in ln(WBA) coefficients imply elasticities

of between 0.6 and 0.7, while the benefit coefficients identified through the bend in the schedule

suggest elasticities of around 0.4. A test of the restriction $1 = $2 fails to reject in most

specifications, though it does reject in the case of specification (4). The final specification in




                                                   18
Table 6 indicates that it is difficult to separate out the effect of the change in the weekly benefit

from indicators for the groups that received the benefit increase.



                             7. Hazard Model Estimates of Duration


       Hazard models provide a sensible way to account for two key features of the data. First,

durations are both left censored at zero and right censored at 26 weeks as discussed above.

Second, the level of the weekly UI benefit amount varies over the course of a spell for those who

filed shortly before the April 1989 benefit increase (and are in the Medium or High Earnings
groups). Hazard models easily incorporate these two features of the data. We estimate a series

of specifications for the hazard of leaving UI as a function of measures of time, the UI benefit,

and individual characteristics. Formally, let Ti be the length of individual i's period of UI receipt.

Then the hazard for individual i at time t, 8i(t), is defined by the equation,




                                  .




Before estimating parametric models, we plot the hazard rate of those in the High Earnings group

and that of the Low Earnings group for comparison using the weekly hazard derived from daily

data. The top panel of Figure 3 shows this pattern for 1988, while the bottom panel displays the

1989 pattern. In 1988 the High and Low Earnings groups have almost identical hazards. In

1989, after the increase in benefits in the 16th week for those in the High Earnings group, there

appears to be a fall in the hazard of those in the High Earnings group relative to that for the Low

Earnings group. This pattern accords with the expected decline in the departure rate from the UI

rolls after benefits have increased.



                                                  19
        To account for individual characteristics and economic conditions, we parameterize the
hazard using a proportional hazards form, i.e. 8i(t)= 80(t)exp[zi(t)'$]. 80(t) is called the baseline

hazard and captures how exit rates change as a spell progresses. The time varying explanatory
variables zi(t) include the weekly benefit amount, as well as indicators for the current calendar

week. Thus, we can account for the changing benefit and potentially changing conditions in the
labor market in a sensible way. The vector zi(t) also includes time constant variables such as age,

gender, education, industry, region, previous earnings and weeks worked.

        Given our parameterization and weekly data, spell continuation probabilities can be

written as


(7.1)                                                                   ,




if zi(t) is constant between t and t+1. Equation (7.1) can be rewritten as


(7.2)                                          , where                       .




A likelihood function can then be constructed from terms like (7.2) and one minus the probability
in (7.2) as in Meyer (1990).

        The first set of hazard model estimates is reported in Table 7. Appendix Table 2 provides

the means by period and earnings group for the covariates that are included in the models

(variable definitions are provided in the Data Appendix). These specifications include a dummy

variable for the week in question being after the benefit increase (After 16th week of 1989)

interacted with the High Earnings or Medium Earnings group. Controls for previous earnings,

previous weeks worked, age, gender, education, race, industry, region, as well as indicators for


                                                 20
the calendar week and the current spell length are included. All of these specifications control

for being in the High Earnings group after the benefit increase. Benefit effects are identified

through the exact timing of when the benefit increase took place.

       Specifications (1) and (2) do not include the Medium Earnings group. Specification (2)

and (4) through (6) include indicator variables for the week the spell began. Specifications (5)

and (6) include indicators for industry and region interacted with being in the year of the benefit

increase.

       These specifications indicate that the hazard of ending a UI claim falls by about 6 percent

after the weekly benefit rises for the High Earnings group. The coefficients do not differ much
across specification. As expected, there is a smaller coefficient for the Medium Earnings group,

but the coefficient is only marginally significantly different from zero. The inclusion of controls

for the week a spell began or the interaction of industry and region with the second year of data

has little effect on the coefficients. While these specifications control for being in the High

Earnings group after the increase it is a concern that the coefficient on After*High Earnings is

significantly different from zero even when we are controlling for the exact timing of the benefit

increase. These coefficients suggest that there is an independent effect of being in the

After*High Earnings group or that our After 16th week variable does not fully capture the

benefits change. Specification (6) only includes the spells beginning in the first six weeks of the

year. This sample does not seem to suffer from this problem as the coefficient on After*High

Earnings is now small and not significant. This sample is also of interest for a second reason.

This sample will disproportionately include those whose benefits change later in their spell and

will thus emphasize changes in benefits near the end of the benefit entitlement period. Some

past work has emphasized that the effect of UI on the hazard should fall with duration (see

Arulampalam and Stewart 1995). This effect is a general prediction of search models, but does

not necessarily hold in labor supply models of unemployment. We find little support for this




                                                 21
prediction here as the coefficient estimate is slightly higher in specification (6) than in the other

specifications, the opposite of what some models predict

        Our final set of duration estimates is reported in Table 8. These specifications include

functions of the weekly benefit amount rather than indicator variables. Precisely, these

specifications include the logarithm of the weekly benefit amount in the current week minus the

benefit under the old UI law as well as a variable for the weekly benefit under the old law. The

first variable captures the effect of the change in the schedule due to the benefit increase, while

the second variable identifies the effect of benefits through the bend in the schedule. The

specifications examined are those analogous to the specifications of Table 7. In addition
specification (7) is added to analyze the identification of benefit effects through the bend in the

schedule.

        These specifications suggest that a ten percent increase in the benefit lowers the hazard of

ending a UI spell by about 3 percent. The estimates are not appreciably affected by adding

controls for the week a spell began or interactions of industry and region with the year of the

increase. Specifications (5) and (6) in this table also control for being in the High (and Medium)

Earnings groups after the benefit increase as in Table 7. We are now identified through the

exact timing of when benefits increase and by the amount that they increase. The coefficient on

the change in the weekly benefit ($1) falls somewhat, but is still significantly different from zero.
In specification (6) we again restrict the sample to the first half of the quarter with the coefficient

on After*High Earnings again much smaller and not significantly different from zero, while the

change in benefit coefficient is little altered.

        In most of the specifications, the estimated effect of the benefit under the old UI law is

slightly smaller than the coefficient on the change in the weekly benefit, but still strongly

significant. We now more often reject the restriction $1 = $2 ; the evidence indicates that benefit

effect identified by the schedule nonlinearity is now statistically different from that identified by

the benefit increase, in specifications (1), (2) and (7). We should emphasize that this former


                                                   22
coefficient cannot be identified if one includes a completely flexible set of controls for prior

earnings. The last specification (7) makes this clear, as the inclusion of a spline in past earnings

drives the standard error on this coefficient sharply upward and the point estimate becomes

implausible.



Simulating Duration Elasticities
We also convert the duration coefficient estimates into elasticities. Following equation (7.2), we

can write the estimated survivor function for observation i as


(7.3)                                                               for t$1, where




The average estimated survivor function then is


(7.4)                   where




Predicted mean duration of UI receipt (compensated duration) and full duration are then




and            respectively. To calculate full duration we need to assume a value for         for



J>25. We use the average over 0 to 25. To simulate the effect of raising the level of UI benefits

by ten percent we can just multiply       in (7.3) by            for J<26, where     is the estimated



                                                 23
coefficient on ln(WBA in Current Week)-ln(WBA Under Old Law) from Table 8. We estimate

elasticities by dividing the change in estimated duration from this exercise by 0.1. For the

specifications in Table 8, using the first quarter of 1988 sample, the resulting elasticities are

reported in the last two rows. The compensated duration elasticities range from 0.09 to 0.17,

while the total duration elasticities range from 0.12 to 0.23. Overall, the benefit elasticity

estimates are smaller than many that have been found in the literature, such as those in Moffit

(1985), Meyer (1989, 1990), Classen (1979) and Solon (1985).



Subsamples
       While the elasticities that we find for the overall sample are not large, there may be

components of the population whose durations respond strongly to UI. In Table 9 we report

coefficient estimates on the logarithm of the change in benefits for four subsamples of the data:

men, women, those under 40 years of age, and those 40 and older. The specifications that we

estimate are just those reported in the first six columns of Table 8, but estimated on these

subsamples. The estimates differ sharply across the subsamples. The total duration elasticities

for males range from 0.07 to 0.22, while for females they are much larger, ranging from 0.36 to

0.47. Labor supply elasticities are generally found to be larger for women, and this finding may

be just another example of this regularity. The total duration elasticities for those under 40, are

close to zero, while those for individuals 40 and older are quite large, ranging from 0.30 to 0.46.

Since younger workers are generally thought to be more likely to be liquidity constrained, this

finding does not support the notion that liquidity constraints drive the duration response to UI

(Chetty 2006), though other factors could be behind the difference between younger and older

workers.




                                                  24
                                  8. Discussion and Conclusions


        This paper examines the effect of a 36 percent increase in the maximum UI benefit in

New York State. The benefit increase in New York had the unusual feature that it applied to

only high and medium earnings claimants and to in-progress spells. The results suggest that this

increase in UI benefits led to a large increase in the number of unemployment insurance claims.

However, we cannot exclude the possibility that shocks which disproportionately affected high

wage workers resulted in the increases in claims among high earning workers that received the
higher benefits. We are able to rule out that shocks to particular industries or regions were

responsible for this result.

        There is strong evidence of an effect of the benefit increase on the duration of claims.

We examine differences in means, regression estimates, as well as hazard model estimates that

use the exact timing and amount of the benefit increase. The estimated elasticity of claim

duration with respect to the benefit is around 0.3. This elasticty is somewhat lower that found by

Classen (1979), Solon (1985) and Meyer (1989) who also examined data around changes in

benefit generosity. The estimates are about in the middle of other previous estimates. We should

also note that the identification of the weekly benefit effect through the bend in the benefit

schedule alone yields roughly similar, though somewhat lower estimates.

        We also demonstrate how endogenous UI takeup can bias estimates of the effect of the

level of benefits on the mean duration of UI receipt. We show the theoretical ambiguity of the

bias and the conflicting forces that lead to this result. One-year comparisons of mean duration

changes in the quarters where the benefit increase was known to potential claimants and takeup

could respond yields wrong signed elasticities, illustrating that the potential for bias is real.

Comparisons of observable characteristics of claimants indicate that there was a change in the




                                                  25
composition of claims following the benefit increase that could explain this otherwise anomalous

result.

          The overall elasticities that we find tend to be low. However, for some large subsamples,

in particular those 40 and older and women, we find substantial elasticities. There are several

factors to consider when comparing the estimates in this paper to other estimates. First, it may be

that the estimates are biased because of macroeconomic shocks that disproportionately affect

High Earnings claims. We have used several identification strategies including those that rely on

the exact timing and amount of the benefit increase to reduce the likelihood of this possibility.

Second, it may be that the effect of a given benefit increase is smaller when the level of after-tax
benefits is low relative to previous earnings. Most previous work has examined UI in a period

when benefits were not taxable and thus after-tax replacement rates were high. We are also

primarily examining changes in benefits for the group with the lowest replacement rates, the

High Earnings group. Even after the increase in benefits, the average replacement rate for this

group is only 0.37, as reported in Appendix Table 2. Third, we capture a slightly different partial

derivative than usual since the benefit increase was a surprise. Changes in savings and other

responses could have not taken place. This short-run elasticity may be lower than the long-run

one.22 Fourth, it may be that UI benefits have a different impact during periods of low

unemployment such as New York in the late 1980's. Fifth, our first quarter duration estimates

will mostly capture the effects of UI towards the end of the eligibility period. One might expect a

given UI benefit increase to have a smaller impact then as suggested in Mortensen (1977) and


   22
     The effect of a surprise increase in benefits on unemployment could be either bigger or
smaller than the effect of an expected change. If workers expect a benefit increase, they might
change the type of job they take, or change the care they take to avoid being laid off (much of this
would appear in incidence but might affect duration through the types of composition changes
the paper emphasizes). These types of changes would likely make the response to an expected
increase greater than that to a surprise increase. On the other hand, if one considers savings
responses to UI, an increase in benefits that is expected will lead people to save less. Thus, the
difference in unemployment durations between the high and low benefit regimes would be
reduced because assets would be lower in the high benefit regime, implying that high benefit
durations would be shorter than they would be if assets did not change.

emphasized in Arulampalam and Stewart (1995). We have tested for this hypothesis above

(specification (6) in Tables 7 and 8) by examining the sample of spells starting in weeks 1-6 of

the first quarter. Since the coefficient estimates from these alternative specifications are very

similar to the full sample estimates, they do not support this hypothesis.

Note: Standard errors are in parentheses. The standard errors for ratios of number of claims
are calculated using the delta method applied to (sample size after)/(sample size after + sample
size before) treated as a binomial.   The sample excludes those who worked in the construction
industry prior to employment and includes some claimants who did not receive unemployment
benefits.

Notes: (1) Separate regressions are estimated for each quarter and earnings group. (2) Each
regression has duration in days as the dependent variable. All equations include a constant, base
year earnings, weeks worked in the base year, age, gender, race and education indicator
variables, industry and region indicator variables. (3) Those in construction, with missing
demographics, no previous earnings, with weeks worked less than 20, real weekly earnings less
than $80 ($84.24 in 1989), out of state observations and those with pension reductions are
deleted.
