1      Introduction

Perhaps the most puzzling feature of currency prices is the tendency for high interest
rate currencies to appreciate,      when the expectations      hypothesis suggests the opposite:
that investors will demand higher interest rates on currencies expected to fall in value,
This departure from uncovered         interest parity, which we term the ~oru)ard premium
anomaly, has been documented in dozens — and possibly hunclreds — of studies, and
has spawned a second generation of papers attempting to account for it. One of the
most influential of these is Fama (1984), who attributed            the behavior of forward and
spot exchange rates to a time-varying          risk premium.     Fama showed that the implied
risk premium must (i) be negatively correlated with the expected               rate of depreciation
and (ii) have a greater variance.

    We refer to this feature of the data as an anomaly because asset pricing theory to
date has been notably unsuccessful in producing a risk premium with the requisite
properties.     Attempts    include applications   of the capital asset pricing model to cur-
rency prices (Frankel and Engel, 1984; Mark, 1988), statistical models relating risk
premiums to changing second moments (Cumby,               1988; Domowitz        and Hakkio, 1985;
Hansen and Hodrick,         1983), and consumption-based         asset pricing theories,      includ-
ing departures from time-additive         preferences   (Backus,    Gregory,    and Tehner,        1993;
Bansal,     1991; Macklem,     1991), from expected     utility (Bekaert,      Hodrick,    and Ylar-
shall, 1992), and from frictionless      trade in goods     (Hollifield    and Uppal,     1995).    We
address more recent attempts to account for the anomaly with affine models later in
the paper.

    We study the anomaly in both a general theoretical framework and in the more
limited class of affine models. We express our general framework in terms of prici~ig
kerrlels: stochastic processes governing prices of state-contingent claims,  In this
framework,      we relate the spot exchange rate to pricing kernels in the two currencies
and describe the properties the kernels must have to account for the puzzling behavior
of forward     and spot exchange      rates.
                                          The anomaly implies, in general, an inverse
relation between differences in conditional means and differences in conditional higher
moments of pricing kernels,

    We then turn to specific models that might account for the anomaly and other
features of currency prices and interest rates. Natural candidates are affine models,
in which conditional       means and variances of logarithms        of pricing kernels are linear
functions     of state variables.   Affine models have been widely used in pricing fixecl
income securities, their linear structure makes them relatively transparent.                 Indeed,
affine models of currency pricing have become           increasingly      popular   in recent years,
with notable applications        by Ahn (1995), Amin and Jarrow ( 1931), Bakshi and Chen
(1995),    Bansal (1995),      Frachot    (1994),   Nielsen and SaA-Requejo         (1993),   and Sa4-
Requejo      (1994).    We describe,     for the Duffie-Kan     (1993)    class of affine models,   the
conditions     needed to reconcile the anomaly with strictly positive interest rates.

    We begin with a summary of the properties of dollar exchange rates and one-month
eurocurrency interest rates, which serves as an anchor to the theoretical modeling that
follows.




2      Properties              of Currency                Prices and Interest Rates

The properties         of exchange   rates and eurocurrency       interest rates have been wiclely
documented,       but a review serves to focus our attention on the issues to be addressed
and provides      a quantitative     benchmark      for theoretical      developments.    Accordingly,
we summarize the properties of spot and forward exchange rates for the LTS dollar
versus the remaining G7 currencies and interest rates for the same currencies, Here
and elsewhere, st is the logarithm of the dollar price of one unit of foreign currency
and ~~is the logarithm of the dollar price of a one-month forward contract: a contract
arranged at date t specifying          payment of exp(jt)      dollars at date t + 1 and receipt of
one unit of foreign currency.

    In Table 1 we report sample moments for depreciation                   rates of the dollar, St+l –
~$t,continuously-compounded  one-month euro currency interest rates, rt, and forward
premiums, ~t – st. Panel A is concerned with depreciation rates. For the currencies
in our sample, mean depreciation rates are smaller than their standard deviations,
typically by a factor of about eight. In this sense, volatility is one of the most striking
features of currency prices. There is also weak evidence that depreciation                rates exhibit
greater kurtosis than one would find with the normal distribution, but none of our
estimated measures of skewness or kurtosis exceeds twice its estimated standarcl error,
Earlier work — Kritzman (1994), for example — suggests that kurtosis may be more
apparent over shorter time intervals. There is little evidence of autocorrelation in
depreciation     rates for any of the six currencies          we examine.        Panels B and C are
concerned      with interest rates and interest rate differentials.           Unlike currency prices,
both interest rates and their differentials             are highly persistent.     They   also exhibit
less variability, both absolutely and relative to their means. As with currency prices,
none of the measures of skewness and kurtosis are more than twice as large as their
standard errors.




                                                    2
       One way to think about this evidence is to relate it to the expectations             hypothesis:
that forward rates are expected future spot rates, We express this in logarithmic forlm
as ~t = EtSt+I or ~t — st = Etst+l — St, where Et denotes the expectation conditional
on date-t information. Although we do not observe expected future spot rates, we can
get an indication     of the accuracy of the expectations          hypothesis    by comparing     mean
forward premiums with mean depreciation rates across currencies. We see in Figure
1 (based on entries from Table 1) that while the two means are not the same, their
differences are small relative to their cross-sectional           variation.    Currencies with large
forward premiuins, on average, are also those against which the dollar has depreciated
the most. In other words, currencies with average interest rates higher than the dollar
have typically fallen in value relative to the dollar.

       This sanguine view of the expectations        hypothesis     changes dramatically      when we
turn from cross-section      to time-series evidence       — that is, from unconditional            mo-
ments to conditional     moments.      A huge body of work has established,            for the extant
flexible exchange rate period, that forward premiums have been negatively correlated
with subsequent depreciation rates for exchange rates between most major currenc-
ies.     Canova and Marrinan (1995), Engel (1995), Hodrick (1987) provide exhaustive
references to the literature.       The most common        evidence      comes from regressions of
the form
                           St+l — st = al + a2(~~ — St) + residual.                                  (1)

The expectations       hypothesis    implies a regression     slope Qz =         1, yet most studies
estimate az to be negative.     Thus they find not only that the expectations               hypothesis
provides a poor approximation         to the data, but that its predictions of future currency
movements      are in the wrong direction.     We report similar evidence in Table 2, where
estimates of az range from –0.073          for the lira to –1.840        for the pound.       All these
estimates are at least two standard          errors from the value of one indicated by the
expectations hypothesis. Although          the R2S are small (the largest, for the Canadian
dollar, is 0.034), equation (1) can be used to construct profitable investment strategies.
One might invest, for example, in the currency with the higher interest rate. Bekaert
and Hodrick (1992) show that while such strategies are not riskless, they have positive
and statistically   significant average excess returns.

       Evidence of negative correlation between forward premiums and depreciation                 rates
has survived, so far, a number of attempts to reverse it. One issue is stability. Al-
though estimates of az vary substantially over time, they remain consistently neg-
ative.    Bekaert and Hodrick       (1993), for example,    find that estimates based on data
subsequent     to Fama’s ( 1984) sample are more strongly negative than those based on
the entire sample.      Data from the early 1990s moderates              this conclusion,     but does
not invalidate it. A second issue concerns measurement                 error and bid/ask       spreads.


                                                 3
Bossaerts and Hillion (1991) and Bekaert and Hodrick                               (1993) argue, however, that
neither of these factors has a material effect on the sign or magnitude                               of estimates
of az. A third issue concerns the exchange-rate                         regime.    Flood and Rose ( 1994) find
that negative slope parameters                are less apparent for currencies                  covered by the Ex-
change Rate Mechanism of the European                      Monetary         System.      In fact, the evidence for
exchange      rates in the ERM is mixed:                estimates of az are close to one for the Ger-
man mark and the French franc, but large and negative for the mark and the Dutch
guilder, Flood and Rose estimate a typical ERM slope parameter of 0.,58, which is
significantly    different from one but nevertheless positive.                         For floating exchange rate
regimes they estimate, as others do, negative values for az.

    The anomaly has motivated                 a large and growing number of studies suggesting ex-
planations.     Foremost among these is Fama (1984), who labels the difference between
the forward rate and the expected                future spot rate a risk premium                   and proceecls to
document       its properties.     In Fama’s interpretation,                    the forward      premium,   f~ – St,
includes a risk premium pt as well as the expected                         rate of depreciation      qt:


                              f, – St     =     (f, –   Etst+l) + (Etst+,           – St)

                                          =     pt + qt.                                                        (2)


The cross-section      evidence     (Table 1 and Figure 1) suggests that risk premiums are
small on average, but the time series evidence implies they are highly variable,                              Since
the population      regression coefficient is

                                   co~(~,P       +   q) ~      Cov(q,     p) +    Var(q)
                                                                                                                (3)
                          ~2=           Var(p   + q)                    Var(p   + q)        ‘

it is clear that a constant        risk premium p generates                     a2 = 1. To generate negative
values of a2 we need C’ov(q, p) + Var(q)                       <   0.     Fama notes that this requires          (i)
negative covariance between p and q and (ii) greater variance of p than q. W’e refer to
these requirements       as Fama’s necessary conditions.                        They serve as hurdles that any
theoretical     explanation    of the anomaly must surpass.

    In summary,       Fama interprets           the evidence            as suggesting       a highly variable risk
premium       that reverses the sign of the slope parameter                        a2 in the forward premium
regression relative to what it would be under the expectations hypothesis. We refer
to this feature of the data as an anomaly because of the large number of unsuccessful
attempts to account for it with risk-based theories. In this sense, the term “risk
premium “ is more a convenient label than an explanation.

3       A Theoretical                 Wamework

The challenge of currency       pricing is to account        simultaneously    for currency     prices
and prices of fixed income securities denominated            in both currencies.   A model of the
dollar/pound     rate, for example,     must account for the properties        of interest rates in
dollars and pounds,     as well as those of the exchange rate between the two currencies.
From a theoretical     perspective,     this challenge places demands on a model’s            internal
consistency.    It gains greater force in quantitative       applications,    when parameter val-
ues chosen to imitate (say) movements              in exchange   rates must be reconciled        with
properties of interest rates.

      Before turning to specific models, we find it useful to consider currency prices in a
fairly general theoretical   setting.    We characterize     asset prices with a pricing kernel:
a stochastic   process governing prices of state-contingent         claims.    Existence of such a
process (or equivalently,    of risk-neutral probabilities)      is guaranteed in any economic
environment     that precludes arbitrage opportunities.          The beauty of this result is its
simplicity. It requires only that market prices of traded assets not permit combina-
tions of trades that produce positive payoffs in some states with no initial investment
— a departure from covered interest rate parity, for example.            The framework encoTn-
passes, among other things, the possibility that agents trade on different information,
or that some agents harbor ‘[irrational”          beliefs.

      In the rest of this section, we adapt this approach to the pricing of currencies, relate
the volatility of currency prices to the variability of pricing kernels in two currencies,
and examine the relation between pricing kernels and the forward premium anomaly.



3.1       Pricing     Kernels

We begin with assets denominated in domestic currency ( “dollars”), then move on
to those denominated in foreign currency ( “pounds”). With respect to dollar assets,
consider the dollar value vi of a claim to the stochastic          cash flow of d~~l dollars one
period later. The price v and cash flow d satisfy the pricing relation,

                                        vt = Et   (mt+l~t+l),                                      (4)

or
                                        1 = Et    (mt+I~t+I),                                      (!5)

where Ri+l = dt+l/v~ is the gross one-period             return on the asset. We refer to m as
the dollar pricing kernel. In economies          with a representative   agent, ~~1is the nominal


                                                   5
intertempora]    marginal rate of substitution      and (5) is one of the agent’s first-order
conditions.    More generally, there exists a positive random variable nL satisfying the
pricing relation (5) for returns R on all traded assets if the economy           admits no pure
arbitrage opportunities.    When the economy        has a complete set of markets for state-
contingent claims, rn is the unique solution to (5), but otherwise there is a range of
choices of m that satisfy the pricing relation for returns on all traded assets. These
issues, and the relevant literature, are reviewed by Duffie (1992).

    The pricing kernel ?n and the pricing relation (5) are the basis of modern theories
of bond pricing: given a pricing kerne], we use (5) to compute prices and yielcls for
bonds of all maturities.  Denote by ~ the price of an n-period zero-coupon bond:
the claim to one dollar at date t + n in all states. Since the one-period return on an
(n+ 1)-period bond is b~+l/b~+l, we can compute bond prices recursively from




starting with b; = 1 (a dollar today costs a dollar).         The price of a one-period     bond,
for example, is b: = Etmt+l.     Continuously-compounded            bond yields y are related to
prices by b: - exp (–y~n).     The short rate r~ is the yield y} on a one-period         bond:

                                rt = —log   b; = — log Etm~+l.                                   (7)

We return to this equation when we examine exchange rates.

   When we consider assets with returns denominated                 in pounds,   we might adopt
an analogous     approach   and use a random variable m“ to value them.            Alternatively,
we could convert mark returns into dollars and value them using m. The equivalence
of these two procedures     gives us a connection    between exchange rate movements          and
pricing kernels in the two currencies, m and m*. If we use the first approach,             pouncl
returns ~     satisfy
                                     1 = Et (m;+lm+l
                                                         )“                                      (8)

If we use the second approach,     with S = exp(s)     denoting the dollar spot price of one
pound, then
                                1 = Et [mt+l (St+l/St)R;+l
                                                                1
If the pouncl asset and currencies are both traded, there are obvious arbitrage oppor-
tunities unless the return satisfies both conditions:




This equality ties the rate of depreciation    of the dollar to the random variables m and
m“ that govern state prices in dollars and pounds.        Certainly this relation is satisfied


                                               6
if m;+l     = m~+l St+l /St.          This choice is dictated              when the economy             has a complete
set of markets for currencies and state-contingent                         claims. With incomplete               markets,
the choices of m and m“ satisfying (5,8) are not unique, but we will see that we can
choose them to satisfy the same equation.

       We summarize the connection                   between pricing kernels and currency prices in


Proposition           1 Consider        stochastic       processes   for   the depreciation          rate,   St+l/St,     and
returns     Rt+l     and ~+1        on dollar     and pound        denominated     assets.     If these      processes     do
not admit        arbitrage    opportunities,         then    we can choose       the pricing     kernels       WL and Trt*
for    dollars   and pounds         to satisfy    both

                                                 m:+l/m,+,         = s,+,/s,                                               (9)

and the pricing         relations     (5, 8).


Proof.      Consider      dollar returns on the complete                   set of traded assets, including                the
dollar returns (St+l /St)~+l               on pound-denominated                assets.   If these returns do not
admit arbitrage opportunities,                  then there exists a positive random variable 7Tt~+lsat-
isfying (5) for dollar returns on each asset (Duffie 1992, Theorem                              1A and extensions),
For any such m, the choice rnj+l = m,+l St+l /S, automatically                               satisfies (8).                  ■


      The intuition is straightforward:                  if we know prices of state-contingent                   claims in
dollars and pounds,            we can compute               the implied      exchange        rate from their ratio.
The only ambiguity            stems from combinations                of state-contingent        claims that are not
traded.

      The proposition         tells us that of the three random                  variables — nZ~+l, nt~+l, and
S’t+l /St — one is effectively redundant and can be constructed from the other two.
Most of the existing literature uses the domestic pricing kernel ?n (or its equivalent
expressed as state prices or risk-neutral probabilities)                         and the depreciation            rate. We
start instead with the two pricing kernels, which highlights the essential symmetry of
the theory between the two currencies.

    One implication of this symmetric perspective is that pricing kernels appear to be
highly correlated. To see this, note that equation (9) implies

      Var(s,+~     – .st) =   Var(log    m~+l) + Var(logmt+~)               – 2Co~(log       mi+l,     log ~~t+l)        (10)

Estimates of Var(st+l           – St) are in the neighborhood                of 0.032 for most of the exchange
rates in Table 1, smaller for the Canadian dollar.                          Estimates of Var(log ~n) are typi-
cally larger: Backus and Zin (1994, Section 6) suggest that 0.152 is a conservative                                      esti-
mate for monthly dollar returns. Estimates from closely related Hansen- Jagannathan


                                                               7
( 1991) bouncls are similar. If pricing kernels for other currencies exhibit, comparable
variability, then equation (10) implies that the correlation between the logarithms of
the two kernels is 0,98. Larger estimates of Var(log m) and Var(log m“) and smaller
estimates of Var(st+l      — St) imply larger correlations.                 The strong correlation    between
pricing kernels is not an indication of international capital mobility — capital mo-
bility was, in fact, a premise of Proposition 1, We find it striking nevertheless, since
it implies that state prices are more highly correlated across currencies than returns.
Roughly     speaking, the two pricing kernels appear to be more highly correlated                        than
their conditional     means.



3.2       Forward        Rat es and Risk Premiums


Given pricing kernels for two currencies and equation (9) for spot exchange rates,
we can derive the forward premium and its components from the pricing relation
(4).    Consider   a forward    contract      specifying       at date t the exchange         at t + 1 of one
pound and Fi = exp(~t) dollars, with the forward rate Ft set at date t as the notation
suggests.    This contract      specifies a net dollar cash flow at date t + 1 of Ft – ,$~+1.
Since it involves no payments at date t, the pricing relation implies

                                        o=   E, [m~+,(F,       –     S,+l)]
                                                                          .

If we divide by St and apply Proposition                  1, we find

                      (~t/st)~t(~t+l)         =      Et (~t+lst+l/st)        = ~t(~:+,).

Thus the forward premium is




This equation      and the definition of the short rate, equation                    (7), give us

                                             f,–s,       =r,   –r;    ,                                   (12)


the familiar covered interest rate parity condition.

       Now consider   the components           of the forward             premium,     The expected    rate of
depreciation    is, from (9),


                         qt = ~t~t+l – St =            Etlog ~;+l – Etlog ~t+l.                           (13)




                                                          8
Thus we see that the first of Fama’s components                           is the difference in conditional      means
of the logarithms of the pricing kernels. The risk premium is, from (2,11),

                   pt = (log Etm:+l          – Et log m~+l) – (log Etmt+l           – Et log mt+l)      ,          (14)

the difference between the “log of the expectation”                           and the “expectation          of the log”
of the pricing kernels m and m*.

   With additional structure we can be more specific about the factors that affect
the risk premium. Many popular models of bond and currency prices, including the
affine models we examine later, start with conditionally                            log-normal      pricing kernels:
log mi+l and log m~+l are conditionally                       normal with (say) means (plt, p~~) ancl vari-
ances (P2~)pj~ ). With this structure, one-period                         bond prices are




and the risk premium is

                                                 Pt    =     (P;t   -   P2t)/2.                                    (15)

Fama’s conditions               require, in this case, (i) negative correlation              between differences in
conditional         means and conditional             variances of the two pricing kernels and (ii) greater
variation in one-half the difference in the conditional                         variances.    We need, in short, a
great deal of variation in conditional                     variances.

       If the conditional           distributions     of log m and log m* are not normal, the risk pre-
mium depends on higher moments.                        For an arbitrary distribution,           equation     (13) tells
us (again)         that only the means affect the expected                      rate of depreciation.         The risk
premium is given, in general, by (14), but if all of the conditional                             moments of log ?n
exist, log Etmt+l              can be expanded


                                                log Etmt+l      = ~Kjt/j!,                                         (16)
                                                                    j=l

where ~jt is the jth cumulant for the conditional                           distribution     of log m~+l.    Equation
(16) is an expansion of the cumulant generating function (the logarithm of the moment
generating         function)        evaluated    at one; see, for example,          Stuart and Ord (1987, chs
3,4).    Cumulants are closely related to moments,                         as we see from the first four: ~lt =
Pit,    ~2t   =   p2t,   ~st   =   pst,   and ~qt = pqt — 3(p2t)2. The notation is standard, with plt
denoting the conditional                  mean of log m~+l and pjt, for j > 1, denoting the jth central
conditional         moment.          For the normal distribution,            cumulants are zero after the first


                                                                9
two, so equation        (16) gives us a way of quantifying                   the impact of departures             from
normality.     If the foreign kernel has a similar representation,                     the forward premium is
                                                       m
                                         f, – s, =     ~(~;t – ~jt)/j!,
                                                       j=l

and the risk premium is
                                                 Pt = ~:l,t – ~–l,t,
where
                                         m                                    m



                                       J=2                                   j=2

We refer generically       to the sums ~-1,~ and ~ll,t as “higher moments .“

   With equations (17) and (13) describing                         risk premiums            and expected      rates of
depreciation, we have


Remark        1   If conditional     moments         of all order     exist for      the    logarithms     of thr two
pricing   kernels,    m and m“,      then Fama’s        necessary      conditions     for the forward        premium
anomaly      imply   (i) negative    correlation      between      differences     in conditional        means,   p~t —
pit, and differences  in higher-order   cumulants,   K?l,t – ~-l,t, and (zi) greater                         variation
in the latter.   A necessary   and suficient   condition   is a negative covariance                           between
qt = P;t – Plt and ft – st = p;t – Plt + ~Il,t                    – K-l,t.


    Our characterization           of the risk premium suggests an interpretation                       for the failure
of GARCH-M           models, which model the risk premium as a function of the conditional
variance of the depreciation             rate.
                                         Studies by Bekaert (1995), Bekaert and Hodrick
(1993), and Domowitz          and Hakkio (1985) document strong evidence of time-varying
conditional       variances of depreciation           rates, but little that connects              the conditional
variance to the risk premium p. One view of this failure is that GARCH-M                                       models
violate our sense of symmetry:             an increase in the conditional             variance of the deprecia-
tion rate increases risk on both sides of the market, and hence carries no presumption
in favor of one currency or the other. Our framework indicates why. The conditional
variance of the depreciation rate is

                             Vart(st+~     – st) =      Vart(log    m~+l – log ~t),

the conditional       variance of the difference between the logarithms                        of the two kernels.
The risk premium, on the other hand, is half the difference in the conditional                               variances
[equation     (15)] and possibly         higher moments             [equation      (17)],    which need bear no
specific relation      to the conditional           variance of the depreciation                rate.     GARCH-M
moclels, to put it simply, focus on the wrong conditional                          variance.

4       Affine Models                  with Independent                     Factors

Remark 1 suggests that it should be relatively easy to construct examples that re-
produce the anomaly: we simply arrange for differences in first and second moments
of pricing kernels to move in opposite          directions.     Consider a model like Engel and
Hamilton’s      (1990)    in which the conditional     distributions     of two pricing       kernels al-
ternate between two log-normal            regimes.   If the difference    in conditional       means of
the pricing kernels is higher in regime 1, and one-half the difference in conditional
variances is higher in regime 2, and varies more than the difference in lmeansl then
the model will reproduce        the anomaly.

      A greater challenge is to construct a model that mimics the properties of currency
prices and interest rates more generally. We approach this problem with affine mod-
els. Affine models have a number of clear advantages.                First, conditional    means and
variances of logarithms of pricing kernels are linear functions            of a vector of state vari-
ables. Second, we have, as a profession,         more than a decade’s        experience       with these
models in pricing fixed income securities; much of this experience                can be transferred
directly to currency pricing.      Finally, we will see that many of the moclels in this class
automatically      generate the contrary movements in the conditional             mean and variance
of pricing kernels suggested by Fama’s condition              (i) in log-normal   settings.

      In this section we consider specific examples of affine models motivated by related
work. In the next section we consider the general class of affine currency models.



4.1       A Cox,         Ingersoll,      and Ross Model              for Two        Currencies

An obvious starting point is a two-currency          version of Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross ( 1985)
like Bakshi and Chen (1995).           Our version is adapted from Sun’s (1992) discrete-time
translation.

      In discrete time, the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross       model can be expressed in two equations,
one specifying      a “square-root”      process for a state variable,      the other relating the
pricing kernel to the state. Let us say that the state variable z follows

                               z,+, = (1 – y)o + p.zt + Oz;’’ct+l,                                  (18)

with O<y<l,          d>    O,and{c~}   W. NID(O, 1). The unconditional mean of z is 0, the
auto correlation    is ~1 the conditional variance is cr2.zt,and the unconditional variance
is a20/(1   – p2). With the substitution        K = 1 – ~, we can write (18) as
a direct analog of the continuous-time              original.     The critical ingredient        of (18) is
the square-root        term in the innovation,      whose conditional        variance falls to zero as z
approaches      zero. In continuous        time, this feature and the Feller       condition.

                                          (1 - p)o = K6’ > u2/2,                                      (19)

guarantee that z remains positive.            In discrete time, z can turn negative with a large
enough      negative    realization    of &. This happens         with positive   probability,     but the
probability    approaches      zero as the time interval shrinks (Sun, 1992).

       The pricing kernel for the discrete-time         Cox-Ingersoll-Ross     model can be expressed

                               – log mt+l = (1 + A2/2)2t + A2;’2Et+1.                                 (20)

The coefficient        of z is a normalization,       chosen to make z the one-period              rate of
interest; see Appendix         A.1,     The parameter      A controls the covariance         of the kernel
with movements          in interest rates and thus governs the risk of long bonds                 and the
average slope of the yield curve. Note that equation (20) builds in an inverse relation
between the conditional         mean and variance of the logarithm of the pricing kernel.

    This structure is an example of the conditionally log-normal                       pricing kernels de-
scribed in Section 3. The conditional mean and variance,

                                       Et logm~+~   =     –(1 + A2/2)zt
                                  Vart log mt+l     =     A2z~,

are both linear in the state variable z. The short-term                rate of interest is

                                                        1
                r~ =   —
                                              (
                           log Etmt+l = — Et log mt+l + ~ Vart log mt+l
                                                                                   )
                                                                                        = Zt,         (21)

as claimed earlier.

    If nl is the dollar pricing kernel, we complete the model by considering a second
pricing kernel, m“, for pounds. If the pound pricing kernel is based on an analogous
state variable z“ following an identical but independent process, then the pound short
rate is r; = z;. The forward premium is




with expected depreciation            qt = (1 + A2/2) (zt–z~)     and risk premiumpt        = –A2/2(z~ –
z;).    Thus the linearity of the conditional           mean and variance translate into forward
premium components           that are linear functions of the differential z – z*. More impor-
tant, this structure        automatically     generates the negative correlation           between p and


                                                     12
q of Fama’s      condition    (i):   since equation    (20) implies an inverse relation between
the conditional     mean and variance of log mt+l, and the two pricing kernels are inde-
pendent,    the difference in conditional       means is inversely related to the difference in
conditional    variances.    Bakshi and Chen (199,5, eq 47) make a similar observation.

      This model cannot, however, reproduce the anomaly.           If we regress the depreciation
rate on the forward premium in this model, the slope is

                                            az = 1 + A2/2.

The slope is not only positive, and therefore inconsistent with the anomaly, it exceeds
one, and is therefore inconsistent         even with the Flood ancl Rose (1994) evidence for
the ERM.

      There is a simple solution to this problem, but it has a cost. Suppose we replace
(20) with
                             – log mt+l = (–1 + A2/2)zt + Az:’2Et+l,                            (22)

so that the coefficient      of z contains    —1 rather than +1.       Short-term     interest rates
are then rt = —zt and r; = —z; and the forward premium is —(z~ — z;).                     Expected
depreciation     is (– 1 + ~2/2) (z~ – z;).   The regression slope is therefore

                                            0!2 = 1 – A2/2,

which is always less than one, and negative for large enough values of A. We have
lost, however, the trademark positive interest rates of the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross              model.



4.2       Models       with Independent                 Factors


The two-currency      model that accounts for the anomaly has two properties that clearly
differ from the evidence: interest rates are uncorrelated across currencies and negative
with probability one. We consider a generalization in an attempt to resolve, or at
least mitigate, both problems.

      our generalization     extends the model in two directions:       we replace the indepen-
dent uuivariate Cox-Ingersoll-Ross         models for each currency with independent        general
affine models,     and we introduce       a common      state variable, independent    of currency
prices, that affects interest rates in both currencies.        The latter allows us to reproduce
the positive correlation      of interest rates across currencies.    The former offers the po-
tential to reduce or eliminate the possibility of negative interest rates. An additional


                                                  13
benefit of this class ofmodels                 is that they use factors parsimoniously.                          To model the
dollar/pound       rate, for example, we need only the dollar, pound, and common factors:
factors for other currencies are irrelevant.                          And since the exchange rate between two
currencies depends only on the factors governing the two currencies, these models are
easily extended         to additional          currencies by introducing                     additional     currency-specific.
factors.    Perhaps for this reason, Bakshi and Chen (1995) and Bansal (1995) examine
models in this class.

    Consider, then, a two-currency world based on three independent vectors of state
variables: a common state variable Z. and currency-specific state variables Z1 and 22)
say. (In an effort to streamline the notation                            we have replaced z and z* with Z1 and
22.) Our class of independent                  factor models consists of laws of motion

                             Z;t+l       =     (J -        @;)o, +    @~z,,    +   v’(z,t)’/’&,t+l                           (23)

for each state variable i and pricing kernels

        – log mt+l      =    6+       VJzot    +     V:zlt + A:vO(zot)l’2Eo,+l                  + A:v1(21t)1’2Elt+l
        – log m;+l      =    6* + ~:zot + ‘y;z’t                  + A:v”(zot)         112&I),+~
                                                                                              + ~;V2(Z~,)l/2E’,+,,           (~~)

with {Eit} independent standard normal random variables. The autoregressive matri-
ces Q, have stable roots with real parts between zero and one and positive diagonal
elements. The volatility matrices v“ have typical elements

                                                   v;(z)      =      a;+      p;Tz;   .

We define admissible values of the state variables as those for which volatility functions
are nonnegative. Readers will recognize this model as an example of the affine class
characterized by Duffie and Kan (1993), who report sufficient conditions for keeping
state variables in the admissible set (Condition                              A, described in Appendix               A.2 below).

    This model builds a lot of structure into asset prices. Since the common factor
Z. and its innovation co affect both pricing kernels the same way, they have no effect
on currency prices or interest differentials.                         They therefore have no effect on the slope
parameter      a2 that characterizes                  the forward premium                  anomaly.       We find, as result
of this structure, that these models retain one of the weaknesses of the two-currency
Cox-Ingersoll-Ross          model:


Proposition          2 Consider         the Du&e-I{an                class of afine        models    with independent        cuT-
rency    factors   summarized           by equations              (Z~,Z4).     If such a model         implies   positive   bond
yields for all admissible            values of the state            uariables,        then it cannot      generate    a Tzegative
value    of the slope    parameter            Q2 from       forward          premium       regressions.


                                                                    14
A proof is given in Appendix             A.3. The intuition is similar to the two-currency                    (~ox-
Ingersoll-Ross      model. The affine models permitted in Proposition                      2 are based on st,ate
variables that are unbounded             in one direction.      In our version of Cox-Ingersoll-Rossl
for example, the state variable z assumes all positive values with positive probability.
This state variable has two effects on the short rate, one operating                         through the mean
of the pricing kernel, the other through the variance.                   An increase in the conditional
mean tends to raise the short rate, while an increase in the conditional                            variance lowers
it. If the mean effect is larger, as it is in the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross                   model, then the short
rate is unbounded       above. The anomaly requires instead that the effect of the variance
must be larger, and thus that increases in variance be associated                             with decreases in
the short rate. But since the conditional variance is unbounded                          above, the short rate
will be negative for large enough values of the state variable.

      Proposition    2 indicates that we cannot use this class of models to reconcile                           the
anomaly     with strictly positive        interest rates, but does not, in our view, rule them
out altogether.      If a small probability      of negative interest rates led to an affine model
that was realistic in other respects,            we might view it as a small cost paid for the
convenience      of linearity.       Duffie and Singleton       (1995)        and Pearson and Sun (1994)
make a similar argument in extending              the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross             model of bond pricing.
We examine this possibility            in the next subsection.



4.3       Informal        Estimation             of an Independent                       Factor         Model

We estimate the parameters of the simplest independent factor model to see how
this structure might work in practicq. We find, for this example, that Proposition 2
understates the difficulties. Although estimated parameters imply a small probability
that short rates are negative, the model differs sharply from the data along other
dimensions.

      Our model starts with three scalar state variables following square root processes




for i = O, 1,2, and pricing kernels

               – log mt+l        =    ~ + ~(lzot + ~lzlt + ~0z;:2&0t+l + ~lz;/2&lt+l
               – log nt~+l       =    6“ + ~ozot + y2z2t   +    Aoz;{2Eot+l      +   A2z;[262t+l,


where {&it} is independent            standard   normal.       We refer to Z. as the common                  factor
and Z1 and 22 as, respectively,            the dollar and pound factors.                 We assume, as well,


                                                     15
that the parameters related to Z1 and 22 are the same: 91 = wz = y, 01 = 92 = 6,
U1 =u~=      u, 6* = 8, 71 = 72 = y, and AI = A2 = A. This presumption of
symmetry is pure convenience:   it reduces the number of parameters and, in the
process, clarifies the relation between parameter values and features of the data. We
use the normalizations

                                           70    =   1 + A:/2

                                            7=       –l+A2/2.

As in the two-currency            Cox-Ingersoll-Ross       model,   the latter allows the model         to
reproduce      the anomaly.

    Given parameter values, we can compute properties of currency prices and interest
rates in dollars and pounds.         Here we do the reverse: we use satnple moments for the
dollar/pound      exchange rate and short rates in dollars and pounds to estimate the
model’s    parameters.    We do this informally to illustrate as simply as possible the
issues that arise in formal estimation of such models.               The sample moments are those
reported in Tables 1 and 2. The model’s structure allows us to estimate its parameters
recursively:


   1. The regression slope underlying the anomaly identifies A. The depreciation                      rate
      is

                 Sf+l —St     =     (-1   + A2/2)(2,t     - 22,)+   A (Z;[’clt+,   - z;/2E2t+1) .

      Short rates are




      so the forward premium is ~t — st = —(zlt — z2t). The slope parameter                         in the
      forward premium regression is

                                                 a’ = 1 – A’/2.

      Since the estimated slope parameter in Table 2 is – 1.840, we estimate IAI = 2.3S
      (the sign is not identified).

   2, We use properties of the forward premium to estimate the parameters governing
      the currency       factors    ZI and 22, which we have assumed               are the same.      The
      autocorrelation       parameter y is the autocorrelation            of the forward premium> in
      this case 0,900.


                                                     16
3. The variance of ZI (equivalently                 Z2) is related to the variance of the forward
   premium by
                           Var(f      – s) =         Var(zl   – ZZ) = 2Var(zl).

   Since VaT-(j–s)   =    0.00272 for dollar/pound               rates, we have VaT(Zl) = 0.00272/2 =
   1.82 x 10-6. Given Var(zl),         we find 8 from the variance of the depreciation                          rate:

                               Var (st+~ – St) = 2aj Var(zl)              +     2A20.                            (25)

   Our estimates of A and Var(zl)                  imply 6 = 5.46 x 10-6,

4. We compute ISfrom our estimates of Var(zl),                        0, and p:

                                                                eu2
                                           Var(zl)         = —
                                                              1–92’

   which implies u = 0.251,

5. We identify the parameters of the common factor from properties                                   of short-ter]n
   interest rates. The mean determines 00:




  implying 60 = 6.91 x 10–3

6. The other two parameters of the common factor, VO and ao, are intertwined.
   The former is an input into the autocorrelation of Z.:

                                           Var(zo)                               Var(zl)
                Auto(r)    =    ~o                               +y
                                     Var(zo)        + Var(zl)          Var(zO)      + Var(zl)”

  We find Var(zo) from the variance of the short rate: Var(r)                           =       Va7-(zo)+   Var(zl),
  Given our earlier estimate of Var(zl),                   we compute         Var(zo)       =    2.68 x 10-6 and
  yO = 0.996. Roughly speaking, greater persistence in interest rates than interest
  differentials implies VO > y.

7. We use our estimate of Var(zo)                  to determine Oo:

                                                                         90U;
                                 Var(zo)       =    2.68 x 10-G = —
                                                                        l–y:’

  which implies U. = 1.80 x 10-3.




                                                      17
   We can now provide a quantitative assessment of Proposition 2. Since Z1 and Zz
range between zero and infinity, we see that short rates are negative with positive
probability,    as required     by the theory.      Since both 20 and ZI have approximately
gamma distributions          (see Appendix   A.4), the probability y is easily computed.       We find
that the probability      is less than 10-5.

    The difficulty     with these parameter         values is, instead,   that the unconditional
distribution    has enormous       skewness and kurtosis.    One symptom       of this is the Feller
condition:     our estimates of {0, a, ~} violate the condition by five orders of magnitude:

                                   2(1 – y)o
                                                 = 1.73 x 10-5 ~ 1.
                                        u’
Holding sample moments fixed, the Feller ratio declines as we increase az toward one,
but exceeds one for the dollar/pound             rate only when a2 > 0.98.         Even    the Flood-
Rose estimate of 0.58 for the ERM is too small to eliminate the problem.                       By one
interpretation, parameters that violate the Feller condition are infeasible: the state
variables are absorbed at zero and the model has a degenerate limiting distribution,
Another      interpretation    is that zero is a reflecting barrier, and that violation         of the
Feller condition     indicates extreme values for higher moments;          see Appendix       A.4.

    This difficulty stems directly from the anomaly.              As we see in equation       (25), the
variance of the depreciation        rate depends on both A and 0. The anomaly               dictates a
large value of A. For the model to reproduce the observed volatility of the depreciation
rate, we therefore need a small value of t?. With              small O we find that large a is
required     to reproduce      the variability   of the forward    premium,    which violates        the
Feller condition.

   Stated somewhat differently, the model is squeezed between the anomaly, on the
one hand, and the variability of the depreciation rate, on the other. The anomaly
indicates a large value of IAI. But the variance of the depreciation               rate restricts the
independent      variation    in the two kernels, and therefore        indicates   a small value of
A’@. A small value of O is the compromise,              which leads to a violation        of the Feller
condition.




5     Affine Models                    with Interdependence

We turn next to the general class of afine currency models. We show for such a model
to account     for the anomaly,      it must exhibit    asymmetric    interdependence:        common
factors must influence interest rates differently in the two currencies.


                                                   18
5.1       Two Examples

We illustrate the intuition for interdependence with two examples. One of the simplest
examples is based on a single state variable z obeying a process like (18), with pricing
kernels

                            – log mt+~         =    (1 + A’/2)zt + Az:/2&t+,

                            – log m:+l         =    (~”+ ~*2/2)z, + ~*z:/2E,+1.

The model is interdependent             in the sense that the same factor z affects both pricing
kernels and asymmetric            if its effects are different:         if (1, A) # (~”, A“). In this setting
short rates are rt = z~ and r; = ~“z~, so the forward premium is ft – St = ( 1 – -~”)zt.
Both interest rates are strictly positive if y“ >0. Depreciation is

                 St+l   —St=       [1 – ~“ + (A2 – A*2)/2] z~ + (A – A*)Z:’2E,+I,

so expected     depreciation       is q~ = [1 — ~“ + (A2 — A*2)/2]zt.            The slope of the forward
premium regression is therefore

                                                           ~2 _   ~.’
                                               a’ =1+                                                      (27)
                                                          2(1 – ~*)-

If ~“ = 1 the forward premium is zero: the model has no forward premium and thus
no forward premium anomaly.              For other values, the model implies an inverse relation
between the forward premium               and the interest differential if 2(1 – y’)            and AZ – A*2
have opposite signs and the latter is larger in absolute value. Frachot (1994) describes
a similar example in continuous                time.

   This example         is asymmetric          in two respects.         The first is that the two interest
rates follow different processes. The second is that the state variable z has different
effects on the two pricing kernels, and hence on interest rates. A second example
indicates that the latter, which we refer to as asymmetric                     interclependence,     is the key
to explaining    the anomaly.

   Consider,     then, a similar model based on two state variables, z, and 22, obeying
identical independent        square root processes (18) with pricing kernels

      – log mt+l        =   (1+     A’/2)z,,       + (V* + A*2/2)z2, + AZ:[2E,,+I       + A* Z;[2E2,+,

      –   log m;+l      =    (7* + ~*2/2)zlt         + (1 + A2/2)’z2t + A*Z;[2C,,+1 + A2;(2E2,+1.

Ahn (1995), Nielsen and SaA-Requejo                    (1993, pp 9-10), and SaA-Requejo          (1994, p 17)
describe similar models.          Our version is symmetric in the sense that the unconditional


                                                         19
distributions     of the two pricing kernels are the same, but the state variables ZI and
ZL potentially    affect the two kernels in different ways.

      Short rates in this model are

                              ft –St   = ~t   –r: = (1 –y*)(z~~–z2t).
and depreciation     rate,

      .$t+l—St=    [1 – ~“ + (A2 – A*2)/2] (Zlt – Zzt) + (A – A“)(z;{zclt+l              – z;;2E2t+l),

imply a regression slope of
                                                      ~2 _ ~*2

                                        a2=1+2(l–           7*)’

as in equation     (27). As in the first example,        appropriate     choice of parameters       allows
us to generate a negative value. The critical feature in this regard is, again, that each
state variable affects the two kernels differently.

      These two examples        highlight   the role of asymmetric           interdependence:     of state
variables that affect pricing kernels differentially.          In the second, this takes a partic-
ularly striking form.        Suppose y’ < 1 (if y* > 1 the argument is similar).                From the
short rate equations,        we might say then that Z1 is the “dollar factor,)’             since it has a
greater effect on the dollar short rate than 22. For similar reasons we might refer to Z2
as the pound factor. But the anomaly (in fact, any value of a2 less than one) implies
~*2 > J2, implying that innovations            in the “pound       factor”    have greater influence on
the dollar kernel than do innovations           in the dollar factor.        It’s as if (to use a concrete
example)    US money growth had a larger influence than British monetary                        policy on
dollar interest rates, but a smaller influence on the dollar pricing kernel.



5.2       Informal      Estimation             of the Two-Factor                   Example

Despite this unusual feature, an informal estimation exercise suggests that this model
provides a closer approximation         than the independent          factor model to the properties
of currency prices and short-term           interest rates. The model has six parameters                 and
thus requires six sample moments to estimate:


                                                    20
   1. We use the relative variance of the forward                  premium and the dollar short rate
         to identify ~’:
                                           Var(f     – s) _    2(1 –y”)’
                                             Var(r)               1 +7.2    “

         This equation     has two solutions,        but they are observation
                                                                            ally          equivalent,     We
         choose the smaller root, ~“ = 0.333.

   2. Given y“, the mean value of the dollar short rate determines 9:

                                               E(T) = (1 +y”)o.

         With a mean short rate of 0.006904, we estimate O = 0.00518.

   3. The autocorrelation        of the forward premium identifies ~ = 0.900,

   4. We use the standard deviation                 of the dollar short rate to compute           u.     The
      variance of the short rate is

                                          Var(r)    = (1 +~”2)Var(zl),

         implying   Var(zl)   = 0.002862.      Since

                                                                 020
                                               Var(zl)      = —
                                                               l–w2’

         we find o = 0.0173.      Unlike the independent            factor model, the estimates of y,
         0, and a satisfy the Feller condition.

   5. We use properties of currency prices to estimate A and A*. The difference                            in
      the squared values is determined by the anomaly: equation (27) implies

                                                   A2 – ~*2 ~ 31.0


   6. Finally, the variance of the depreciation               rate identifies (A – A*)2:

                              Var(s,+l     – s,) = 2a~Var(zl)          + 2(A – A*)20.

         Given values for az, Var(zl),       and Var(st+l        – St), we compute      (A – A*)2 = 0.108.


   On the whole this example fits the data much better than the independent                            factor
model.     The Feller condition,         for example,       is satisfied.   Outstanding    issues are the
magnitudes     of A and A“, which play an important               role in the shape of the yielcl curve,
and the unexpected         asymmetry      in the effects of each state variable on short rates and
pricing kernels noted earlier.

5.3       Affine      Models            of Currency              Pricing

The general affine currency model is characterized                    by a law of motion for a vector of
state variables,
                             Zt+l = (1 — @)@ + Ozt + v(zt)l’2&t+l                                     (28)

and pricing kernels

                        – log mt+l           =    6 + ~TZ~ + ~TV(Z~)]/2E~+I
                        – log m:+l           =    6“ + ~*Tzt + A*TV (zt)l/2ct+l,                      (29)

where {&t} = NID(O, 1), @ is stable with positive roots, and \~is diagonal with typical
element

                                             v;(z)   =      a; + plTz; .

Equations (28,29) characterize what we term the general class of affine currency mod-
els. Duffie and Kan’s (1993) Condition               A guarantees that state variables remain in the
region defined by nonnegative            volatility in the continuous-time          analog; see Appendix
A.2.

   With this structure, the depreciation                 rate is

               S~+l — St = (d — 8“) + (~ — ~*)TZ~ + (~ — ~*)Tv(Zt)l/2E~+l.

Short rates are

                                   rt    =       (6–w)+(y-T)zt
                                   r;    =       (6* –u”)     + (~” – T*) Z,,

where u = ~j A~aj/2,       w* = ~j A~2aj/2, ~ = ~j A~~j/2 z O, and ~“ = ~j A~2~3j/2 2
0. For interest rates to be positive, we need each Zi bounded                   (say) below, and therefore
(~ – ~) and (~” – ~“) must have nonnegative                     elements.

   Together these two equations imply a negative value of az in the forward premium
regression, equation     (1), if

           Cov(s,+,    – S,, f, – St) = [(7 – y“) – (T – T*)]Tvar(z)(~– Y*

We see immediately that the anomaly hinges on differences between y and ~“ and
between ~ and 7*. If Vur(z) is diagonal, as in the examples of Section 5.1, then the
ith elements of ~ —~“ — ~ + T“ and y — ~“ must have different signs for at least one i.
More generally, the covariance hinges on differences in the effects of state variables on


                                                         22
interest rates and pricing kernels in the two currencies.           In this sense, the asymmetric
effect of the state variables on the two pricing kernels in our two examples is a general
requirement of a model that accounts for the anomaly.

    This model also makes it clear why models with independent                factors in Section 4.2
cannot account for the anomaly with positive interest rates. This model is a special
case in which z can be partitioned              into independent    subvectors:     z =      (Z02Z1, Z2),
Then y = (70, y], O) and ~“ = (~0, O,72). These models can be asymmetric, but the
“exclusion restrictions” and the assumption that the common factor Z. affects both
kernels the same way limits their interdependence.             Proposition    2 is the result.




6     Final Remarks

We have examined            the implications    for models of currency     pricing of the forwarcl
premium       anomaly:      the tendency   for currencies with high interest rates to rise sub-
sequently in value.         Many regard this feature of the data anomalous              because of the
many failed attempts to build theoretical            models that account for it.

    We find, instead,        that it is relatively    easy to construct   models        consistent   with
the anomaly:      we need an inverse relation between the difference in the conditional
means of the logarithms of pricing kernels in two currencies and differences in the
conditional variances. In the class of affine models, this requires either a positive
probability     of negative interest rates or that some state variables have asymmetric
effects on the pricing kernels in the two currencies.              Examples    of each exist in the
literature. Informal estimation suggests that within the class of affine models, those
with asymmetries offer the best hope of explaining the properties of currency prices
and interest rates in general.

    We are left with two outstanding            issues. The first is whether a closer look finds
that affine models with a small number of state variables are capable of approximating
the properties     of currency     prices and fixed income securities in different currencies.
Ahn ( 1995) and SaA-Requejo           (1994) have made some progress along these lines, ex-
tending the analysis to yields on bonds with longer maturities.                   The second is the
economic      foundations     of pricing kernels that reproduce      the anomaly.         We have fol-
lowed a “reverse engineering”        strategy in which pricing kernels are simply a stochastic
processes that account for observed            asset prices, but one might reasonably          ask what
kinds of behavior        by policy   makers and private agents might lead to such pricing
kernels,   One possibility       is outlined    by Alvarez   and Atkeson      (1996),     Stulz (1987),

ancl Yaron (1995), who develop dynamic general equilibrium      models in which interest
rates and currency prices reflect monetary policies.   Perhaps further work will connect
pricing kernels in these models to properties   of interest rates, currency   prices, and
monetary   aggregates.

A. 1       Representations                  of One-Factor                       Affine        Models

We show that affine models capable of reproducing                          the anomaly can be characterized
by two equations of the form:

                                                                                1/2
                                 zt+l   =    (1 — w)6’   +    ~zt    +    uZt         Et+ I                     (18)




for a fixed positive     parameter          yO (a normalization).                 This model differs from (~ox-
Ingersoll-Ross     in two respects:     (i) the intercept 6 in the relation for the pricing kernel
and (ii) the possibility       of negative coefficient              of z in the same equation.           We assume
/3 # O, since otherwise the conditional                  variance is constant                 and the model cannot
account for the anomaly.

      Consider, as an alternative,          a more heavily parameterized                      model:

                           z,+, = (1 – p)o + ~z, + (a + pzt)l/2Et+,

and
                           – log mf+l = 6 + ~Zt + ~(a +                     ~Zt)l’2Et+I,

with a Feller-like condition guaranteeing that a+~z                        is always positive in the continuous-
time analog. This structure nests the one-factor                         models of Cox-Ingersoll-Ross         (1985)
and Pearson and Sun (1994) as special cases.

      The goal is to show that the second model can be expressed                                  in the form of the
first, equations    (18,30).     The key is that the state variable z is not observable:                          its
role is simply to help characterize the conditional distribution of ~n~+j for j 2 1. In
particular, linear transformations of z leave the distribution of future m’s unchanged.

   We proceed in steps. Consider, first, a reparametrization of the second lnoclel
based on the substitution z’ = a + ~z. In terms of this new state variable, the
equations for the state and pricing kernel are




                                                         25
and




                                                                             /1/2
                                            =      6’ +   ‘y ’z:   +   Azt          &t+l

The state equation         is now in the same form as (18), but we have an additional                              pa-
rameter ~’ in the relation for the kernel. Step two is to eliminate the extra parameter
with a normalization,        which we do by offsetting                       changes in y’ by resealing z’.        The
only subtly is that the scaling must retain the sign of the state variable,                                If ~’ > 0,
define z“ = (yO/~’)z’.          Then we can rewrite the equations                          for the state and pricing
kernel in terms of z“:

                                                               II 1/1/2
                                        =        6’ + ~oz{’ + A Zt    Et+l,

which are in the form of (18,30).                When ~’ < 0 this procedure                    does not work, since
we would be taking the square root of z“ < 0. We instead define z“ = —(yO/~’)z’                                    and
proceed analogously.        The equation for the pricing kernel in this case becomes



which is also in the form of (30).

      We use two normalizations        in the paper.               One is “+~o”            = 1 + J2/2, which results
in z being the short rate. The other is “+~o”                          = –1 + J2/2, which allows the model
to account for the anomaly.

      An alternative representation             of the one-factor             affine model is

                             z~+l = (1 — y)o         + yzi +           (a +    p2t)l’2&t+l

This effectively   loads the sign change for To into ~ and the intercept 6 into a. This
representation     has the property         that it reproduces                 the nonstochastic      volatility   case
when B = O.

A.2         Affine        Models        of Bond              Pricing

Duffie and Kan (1993) characterize a class of affine bond pricing models in continuous
time. We translate their class of models into discrete time and derive conditions under
which bond yields are strictly positive.

    Duffie and Kan’s affine models are based on a k-dimensional                                     vector of state vari-
ables z following
                             Zt+l - 2,=          (1 - Q)(6 - z,)+          V(z) ’/’et+,,                                  (31)

where {et} w NID(O, 1), @ is a stable matrix with positive diagonal elements, V(g)                                           is
a diagonal matrix with typical element




and Dz has nonnegative          elements.        State prices are governed by a pricing kernel of the
form
                               – log ??zt+~= 6 + ~Tzt + ATv(zt)l/2&t+1.                                                   (32)

The process for z requires that the volatility functions                          vi be positive.

    We define the set D of admissible                    states as those values of z for which volatility
is positive:
                                         D=       {z:     vi(z)   >0    all i}.

Duffie and Kan (1993, Section 4) show that z remains in D if the process satisfies

Condition       A      For each i:

  (a) for    all z s D satisfying        vi(z)     = O (the       boundary        of positive       volatility),    the drift
        is sufficiently    positive:    PIT(I – 0)(6’        –    Z) > ~,T~i/2; and

  (b)   if the jth     component       of ~, is nonzero           for   any j      #    i then      vi(~)     and Uj(z)    are
        proportional      to each other       (their     ratio    is a positive        constant).



We refer to models characterized              by (31 ,32) and satisfying Condition                          A as the Dufie-
f<an class of afine        models.


    Our characterization of “these models differs from Duffie and Kan’s in two respects.
First, Duffie and Kan write (31) as

                            Zt+l — Zt = (1 –            Q)(o– Zt)+ Xv(z) l’’ct+l,                                         (33)


                                                            27
which includes a matrix X that is missing in our version.                                 We show that our choice
is innocuous      by reducing their model to ours. As in Section A.1, the key is that z is
not directly observable.         Assume X is invertible (this is convenient                          but not essential)
and define z’ = X–l z. If we substitute for z, equation                         (33) becomes

                          2:+1 — z; = (1 — Q’)(O’ — z;) + v’(z’)1’2&t+1,

with u~(z’) = ai + ,fljTz’, Q’ = ~–lo~,                  d’ = X–16, and @jT = @lTX, Equation                        (32)
becomes
                            – log mt+~ = 8 + 7’T2; + ATv’(z;)l/2&i+l.

with ~’T = VT X. Thus we have effectively eliminated                            X from the model.

    Our second difference from Dufie and Kan is the assumption that the volatility
parameters ~; are nonnegative. Define the matrix ~ = (@l, . . . , p~) with ~;j denoting
the jth element of pi and the (i)j)th element of PT. Note that we can choose the
diagonal elements of ~ to be nonnegative:                    if ~zi <0     for any i, we replace Zi and –zi
and ~ii with —,fl;i and change the other parameters                        in the model accordingly.               This
produces   a matrix ~ with positive diagonal elements.                          Condition          A(b) tells us that if
~ has nonzero off-diagonal           elements, then they are proportional                      to diagonal elements
and hence positive as well.

    Given this structure, bond prices are log-linear in the state variables z. If b; is the
price at date t of a claim to one dollar in all states at date t + n, then by log-linearity
we mean that
                                        – log b; = A(n)         + ~(~)TZL

for some parameters        {A(n),      B(n)}.      Since bond yields are y: = –n-l                     log b:, they are
linear in z:
                                       – log b; = A’(n)            + ~’(n)ZL,

where A’(n)       =   n–l A(n)      and B’(n)       = n–l~(n).           We use equation               (6) to generate
parameters recursively:




                                                              ~k
           B(n+       l)T =      (7T    +   B(n)   T@)   –    j~(~j        +    B(n)j)2      p;,
                                                                 ,~=1

starting with A(0)       = O and B(O) = O. We say that a model is invertible                              if there exist
k maturities for which the matrix




                                                         28
is nonsingular.           The assumption        of invertibility      is not restrictive:         if a model is not
invertible, we can construct an equivalent invertible ~model with a smaller state vector.
Analogously,          define the vector AT = [A’(nl),            . . . . A’(nk)].


     W’e now turn to a smaller class of models in which bond yields are always positive:



Lemma          1 Consider        the Dufie-Ifalz      class   of afine      models.     If the model   is inveriiblc
and bond yields           are positive   for all admissible      states    z, then ~ is diagonal       with strictly
positive      elements.



In words: the volatility functions                 have the univariate square root form




with strictly positive ~ii, As a consequence,                   ~ has full rank. This rules out both pure
Gaussian factors like 9:             = (O, 0,. . ., O) and multivariatefactors             like ~~ = (1,1,...,    1).

     Proof.      Suppose,       in contradiction       to the lemma, that ~ has less than full rank.
Then there exists a nonzero vector h satisfying BTh = O. For any admissible z,
2{ —
   — z + ph is also admissible for any real p since it generates the same values for
the volatility functions.            Now consider bond yields. For yields to be positive we need
bond prices to be less than one. If y denotes a vector of yields for a set of maturities
for which B is invertible, then we need

                                                y=    A+      BTz>O—


for all admissible z. Since z’ = z + ph is also admissible, we have

                                              y = A + BTZ+         pBTh.


By assumption, B is invertible so BTh # O. Thus we can choose p to make yields as
negative as we like, thereby violating the premise of the lemma. We conclude that Ij
has full rank. Condition             A(b) then tells us that ~ must be diagonal.                                       ■



    Our final result is that in this environment                 (univariate volatility functions),          Var(z)
has nonnegative           elements:



Lemma         2 Consider        the Dufie-I(a~l      class of afine       models      in u]hich ~ is diagonal    with
strictly   positive       elements    ~ii.   Then Var(z)      has all positive        elements.



                                                           29
The proof hinges on Condition                   A(a),    Duffie and Kan’s multivariate       analog of the
Feller condition.        ,Since ~ is diagonal            with positive elements,    the condition    implies
that for each z
                                        k



for all admissible .z satisfying Vi(z) = 0, where 1~’= 1 — @ has elements ~;r. The new
ingredient relative to the univariate Feller condition                  is the effect of variables Zj, j # i,
on the drift of z;.        The structure         placed on ~ means that the set of admissible              z’s
includes values of Zj that are arbitrarily large. The condition therefore implies ~ij < 0
forallj     #i.      The admissible set also includes z] = Oj, so ~iz >0.                Since @ = 1 – 1{
has positive diagonal elements, by assumption,                     ~ii <1.

    We have established that the elements of @ are nonnegative. We now show that
the unconditional variance of z, which we denote by the matrix 0, has no negative
elements.         Since z is a first-order        autoregression       with stable Q, its variance is the
solution to
                                                Q = @n@T + v(o),

where V(6)         is a diagonal matrix with positive elements vi(Oi) = ai + ~diidi. Since @ is
stable, we can compute          Q iteratively using

                                        Oj+, = @nj@T             + v(o),

starting with 00 = O. We” see that at each stage the elements of Qj+l are sums of
products     of nonnegative     numbers, so we conclude that the elements of Q are nonneg-
ative.                                                                                                       ■



    We have addressed positive bond yields (Lemma                         1) and nonnegative     c.ovariances
(Lemma      2) in affine models for admissible                  values of the state, which need not be
the same as values of the state that occur with positive probability.                          Consider,   for
example, the bivariate process

                                Zlt+l       =    (1 - p)e + pz, + Z;{’,,      t+,
                                                            1/2
                                Zzt+z       =    Zlt +    Zlt &2t+l.


The admissible region for this model includes any real number for Z2, yet by design
zz cannot be negative (subject to the discrete time approximation). Nevertheless, the
covariance between Z1 and 22 is positive.




                                                           30
A.3         Proof       of Proposition               2

Proposition    2 is based on a model with three independent                  state variables or factors:
a common factor ZOand currency-specific                  factors Z1 and 22. The common factor has,
by construction,        no influence on currency prices or the forward premium.                     It therefore
has no influence on the anomaly, and we can disregard it.

    kVith this simplification,         interest rates in the two currencies are




                                  ft – St =   (7 –   T)Tzlt   – (~” – T*) Tz2t,

The depreciation         rate is

   St+, – s, = (6 – 6*) + yTz,t – 7*Tz2t + ATv’(z,t)’/2&1t+1                      – A*Tv2(z2t)’/2&2t+1.

The anomaly therefore requires

       o>   Cov(st+l      – St, ~~- st) = (7 - ~)T Var(zl)~ + (~” - 7*)T               Var(z,)~*.           (:34)


The question is whether this is consistent with interest rates that are always positive.

    The condition that interest rates are positive for all admissible states places re-
strictions on the parameters. For the “dollar” short rate r we need the elements of
~ – ~, and hence of y, to be nonnegative, since ~ > 0 and each element of Z1 is
unbounded      above.      By Lemma 2, Var(zl ) has nonnegative               elements, so the bilinear
form
                                              (~ - T)T Var(z~)7,

is nonnegative.        Similar reasoning applies to the second term in (34), so we conclude
that the model cannot reproduce               the anomaly with strictly positive interest rates.                ■



   An example          indicates that the proposition           is limited to the Duffie-Kan            class of
affine models.         Consider    a model based on an iid state variable z drawn from the
uniform distribution        on [0,1] with pricing kernel




                                                         31
with {ct} w NID(O, 1) and independent              of z. Then the short rate is




If ~ < ,B2/2 and 8 + ~ – 62/2 = O, the short rate varies between O and 6 and is
thus always positive. With a similar model for the foreign interest rate, based 011
an analogous state variable z*, the forward premium is (y – ,62/2)(2 – z“) and the
forward premium regression has slope




which is negative under the stated conditions.                  This example   is affine in the sense
that yields are linear functions of state variables, and is capable of accounting                    for the
anomaly with positive interest rates, but it is not in the Duffie-Kan                   class,



A.4         Distribution         of State Variables

Consider     a state variable z following         the square root process      ( 18).    For short time
intervals, the unconditional      distribution         of z is approximately   Gamma with density

                                   f(z)   =    [bar(a)
                                                    ]-’z“-le-Z/b,

and parameters a, b > 0. This conclusion               relies on a similar statement by Cox, Inger-
soll, and Ross (1985) for their continuous-time analog and Sun’s (1992) demonstration
that the discrete time model converges to Cox-Ingersoll-Ross.  The mean and variance
for a Gamma random variable are ab and abz, which defines the parameters as

                                                       (1 - yz)o

                                          b=—
                                                         G:2

In continous   time, the Feller condition   (19) is equivalent to a 2 1. Thus parameter
values implying   small a violate the Feller condition        and generate Iarge values of the
skewness and kurtosis measures, ~1 and TL.

An asterisk (*) indicates a sample moment at least twice its Newey-West standard
error. The letters s and ~ denote logarithms of spot and one-month forward exchange
rates, respectively,    measured in dollars per unit of foreign currency, and r denotes the
continuously-compounded         one-month   yield.   Mean is the sample mean, St Dev the
sample standard deviation,      Skewness an estimate of the skewness measure ~1, Kurtosis
an estimate of the kurtosis measure 72, and Autocorr         the first auto correlation.   The
skewness and kurtosis measures are defined, specifically, in terms of central moments
p3: “~~= p3/p;12  and TZ = pA/p~ — 3. Both are zero for normal random variables.
Our estimates replace population moments with sample moments.
