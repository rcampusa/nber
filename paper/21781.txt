                                                ABSTRACT

Socioeconomic gaps in college enrollment and attainment have widened over time, despite increasing
returns to postsecondary education and significant policy efforts to improve access. We describe the
barriers that students face during the transition to college and review the evidence on potential policy
solutions. We focus primarily on research that examines causal relationships using experimental or
quasi-experimental methods, though we draw upon descriptive evidence to provide context. Our review
is distinctive in three respects. First, in addition to the literature on financial aid, we examine the evidence
on informational and behavioral interventions, academic programs, and affirmative action policies
intended to improve college access. Second, we incorporate a wealth of recent research not included
in prior reviews. Finally, we conceptualize college access broadly, as including not just whether but
also where students attend and whether they have access to college-level courses. We conclude with
a discussion of implications for policy and research.

1. Introduction

         The United States has long ranked as the world’s most educated nation, leading the

charge for mass elementary education in the nineteenth century and mass secondary education in

the early twentieth century (Goldin & Katz, 2008). But the transition to mass postsecondary

education that began after World War II has stagnated in the twenty-first century. Between 1950

and 2000, the proportion of 25-34 year olds who had at least some college nearly quadrupled,

from 16 to 57 percent, but improvements have slowed and this figure has grown more modestly

since then to 63 percent in 2012 (Baum, Ma, & Payea, 2013). 2 This slowdown is particularly

puzzling given that the wage premium for a bachelor’s degree is near a historically high level

(Goldin & Katz, 2008). Currently, those with a bachelor’s degree earn over $800,000 more in

lifetime income, on average, than their counterparts with only high school diplomas, even after

subtracting out loans taken on to finance higher education (Daly & Bengali, 2014).

         Perhaps even more troubling than the overall slowdown in attainment growth, gaps in

college attainment by family income have actually increased over time (Bailey & Dynarski,

2011; Belley & Lochner, 2007). These gaps do not go away after controlling for other

explanatory factors such as academic background: among high school students scoring in the top

quartile on a standardized test, only 41 percent of those from the poorest families earn a

bachelor’s degree, compared to 74 percent of students from high-income families (Kena et al,

2015).

         Standard theories of human capital acquisition (e.g., Becker, 1964) suggest that the

equilibrium level of college enrollment reflects individuals’ rational assessments that weigh the


2
 Similar patterns can be seen by looking at immediate college enrollment rates of recent high school graduates,
which rose from about 50 percent in the late 1970s to 67 percent in 1997, but has remained stagnant since then
(NCES Digest of Education Statistics 2014, Table 302.30. Retrieved from
https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d14/tables/dt14_302.20.asp).

expected costs of undertaking higher education against the expected benefits. Expected costs

include tuition, fees, and other direct costs, the opportunity cost of foregone employment while

enrolled, and the psychological cost of effort; expected benefits include both monetary and non-

monetary returns to education. In a perfect market, variation in enrollment rates across

geographies, socioeconomic groups, or over time simply reflect the different costs and benefits

these groups face, and do not – on their own – provide justification for government intervention.

In a perfect market, whether the cost of college is “high” or “low” is of little concern; subsidizing

tuition would only inefficiently induce enrollments among individuals whose expected benefits

would not justify the costs.

       Legitimate concerns about imperfections in the market for college, however, arise from

the two stylized facts with which we open this review: increases in college enrollments have not

kept pace with increases in the returns to college, and, socioeconomic gaps are widening, even

after accounting for academic preparation.

       What types of market imperfections might be present to justify a policy response? One

justification is the presence of social externalities: college enrollment may generate social

benefits that exceed the private returns. For example, postsecondary education has been linked to

higher levels of volunteering and voting (Dee, 2004), better birth outcomes and higher levels of

school readiness in the next generation (Currie & Moretti, 2003), lower levels of criminal

behavior (Lochner & Moretti, 2004), and higher levels of economic growth (Aghion, Boustan,

Hoxby, & Vandenbussche, 2009). Thus, even if the market were otherwise well-functioning,

policymakers may seek to encourage a higher level of academic achievement and attainment

than individuals would choose on their own.




                                                 2
       A second justification for policy intervention is the presence of credit constraints. While

the benefits of college occur in the future, the costs occur in the present (and may extend decades

into the future). If individuals cannot safely and sufficiently borrow against their future earnings

to finance present costs, some individuals who should go to college (in the sense that their

lifetime benefits exceed lifetime costs) will not do so. While upper-income students may be able

to rely upon parental savings, lower-income students may face significant financial barriers to

attendance.

       Third, young people—particularly those from lower-income, immigrant, and/or non-

college educated families—may lack good information about the costs and benefits of

enrollment, as well as about the process of preparing for, applying to, and selecting a college.

Informational failures are arguably increasingly important as program and financing options

have multiplied over time.

       Finally, recent work in psychology and behavioral economics demonstrates how human

decision-making often departs from standard models of economic behavior, particularly when

faced with complex options, and particularly when the decision-makers are young and

inexperienced (Thaler & Mullainathan, 2008; Casey, Jones, & Somerville, 2011). Yet all along

the pathway from college consideration to matriculation, students face complicated choices and

may lack sufficient support and structure to navigate burdensome processes and institutional

bureaucracy.

       These market imperfections and behavioral realities motivate policy efforts to improve

college access. Following Long and Riley (2007), barriers to access can be grouped into three

broad categories: financial constraints, informational/behavioral constraints, and academic

constraints. Of course, these constraints are not mutually exclusive, and for students residing in



                                                 3
areas of concentrated disadvantage, these challenges may be particularly acute. Students of color

may face additional, distinct barriers, including both implicit and explicit discrimination

(Bertrand, Chugh, & Mullainathan, 2005).

       In this paper, we review the economic literature on policies to improve college access.

We emphasize research that identifies and characterizes causal relationships using experimental

or quasi-experimental methods, though we also draw on descriptive evidence to provide context.

Our review differs from prior reviews on college access in three respects. First, while prior

reviews have focused extensively on the impact of financial aid (see, e.g., Deming & Dynarski,

2009; Dynarski & Scott-Clayton, 2013), we go beyond this body of research to incorporate

evidence on informational and behavioral interventions, academic programs, and affirmative

action policies. Since these interventions overlap and interact, there is particular value in

providing a comprehensive review. Second, we incorporate a wealth of recent research not

included in prior reviews. The past few years have been particularly active in the economics of

higher education, given the new accessibility of administrative datasets and a trend towards

increasing experimentation both by policymakers and researchers. Finally, we conceptualize

college access broadly, examining constraints on students’ decisions not just of whether but also

where to attend, as well as constraints on students’ access to college-credit-bearing courses. This

broad conceptualization reflects the growing body of evidence demonstrating the influence of

institutional factors on both completion rates and later outcomes (Bowen, Chingos &

McPherson, 2009; Bound, Lovenheim & Turner, 2010; Goodman, Hurwitz & Smith, 2015;

Hoekstra, 2009; Howell & Pender, 2015 [this issue]).




                                                4
           College access and college completion, of course, are not the same thing. Only about half

of all degree-seeking, first-time college entrants complete any degree within six years. 3 And

among recent cohorts, those who do complete are taking longer to do so (Bound, Lovenheim &

Turner, 2010). Thus, attention increasingly is turning to college completion rather than college

access alone. Still, improving college access remains among the most promising strategies for

raising college degree attainment overall, particularly if we conceptualize access not as getting

students in the door of any college, but instead as getting them off to a good start at an institution

that is well aligned with their interests and capabilities. The challenges that students face during

the transition to college may influence not only whether they attend at all, but also the timing of

enrollment, choice of institution, method of finance, and the pace of progress towards a degree.

These many factors ultimately can influence students’ likelihood of graduation.

           We structure our review around four types of barriers that students face in the transition

to college and evidence on efforts to combat those barriers. Section 2 examines financial aid

policy. In Section 3, we discuss the complexity of the college-going process itself and efforts to

improve students’ navigation of information and behavioral impediments. In Section 4, we

consider policies responses to the academic barriers that students face in the transition to

postsecondary education, and in Section 5, we highlight research on affirmative action bans and

the “top X percent” admissions plans developed in response. Finally, Section 6 concludes by

discussing implications for future policy and research.



2. College costs and financial aid

           In the U.S., state and local appropriations have traditionally helped to keep tuition prices

well below the full cost of providing higher education. But states are devoting a smaller

                                                          5
proportion of their budgets to higher education in recent years, even as enrollments have

increased (Mettler, 2014). As a result, public institutions that produce the majority of bachelor’s

degree recipients are increasingly reliant on tuition as a revenue source: at public master’s and

bachelor’s degree granting institutions, the proportion of revenue coming from net tuition and

fees increased from about 30 percent in 2000 to nearly half in 2012 (Baum, Elliott & Ma, 2014).

        The result is that families increasingly face financial barriers to college access. The

average net cost of attendance (including not just tuition and fees, but also costs of books,

transportation, food and housing, and subtracting out grant aid) for a full-time student in 2014-15

was $5,960 at a community college, $12,830 at a public four-year college, and $23,550 at a

private four year institution. As family incomes have remained stagnant over the past decade and

have declined in real terms at the bottom of the income distribution, these costs represent an

increasing fraction of family resources (Baum & Ma, 2014). For a student at the 20th percentile

of family income, attending even a community college would consume more than 20 percent of

the family’s income, even after accounting for financial aid. Attending a public four-year

institution would consume 45 percent of the family budget on average. 4 Moreover, even where

affordable options exist for families, they are not necessarily “just as good” as institutions that

are less affordable. Per-student resources have become increasingly stratified across institution

type, with declines in the two-year and non-top-50 public sector. Declining resources in these

sectors is associated with declining rates of degree completion (Bound, Lovenheim, & Turner,

2010). Indeed, Howell and Pender (2015 [this issue]) highlight the tradeoff between cost and

institutional quality faced by most students.

 We calculate these percentages using the net tuition, fees, room and board estimates provided by the College Board
(2014a), on pp. 22-24, as well as family income statistics from the same report on page 33.

                                                        6
           This is not to say that students and families are on their own when it comes to paying for

college. In response to concerns about rising costs, states and institutions increasingly follow a

high-tuition, high-aid pricing strategy in which rapidly rising sticker prices are ameliorated, for

some students, by increases in the availability of financial aid. Seven out of 10 undergraduates

now receive some form of financial aid; in 2014-15, full-time undergraduates received an

average of $8,080 each in grants, $1,260 in tax credits and work-study assistance, and $4,840 in

federal loans (Baum, Elliott & Ma, 2014). 5

           While substantial amounts of financial aid are available, determining the net price a

student is going to face requires a more individualized answer than ever before. Within a given

institution, net tuition and fees can vary widely across students, even among those with similar

socioeconomic profiles (Anthony, Page & Seldin, 2015). Moreover, accessing available financial

aid is typically not automatic: students (and often their parents) need to be aware of what

programs exist and must submit a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), the

complexity of which is well documented (Dynarski & Scott-Clayton 2006; Dynarski, Scott-

Clayton & Wiederspan, 2013; Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, 2015). Misperceptions about

college costs are widespread and are most prevalent among students from the lowest-income

backgrounds, likely contributing to persistent gaps in postsecondary attainment as well as

undermatch by socioeconomic status (ACSFA, 2005; Grodsky & Jones, 2007; Horn, Chen, &

Chapman 2003; Hoxby & Avery, 2013; Hoxby & Turner, 2013; Radford, 2013).

           As a result of the challenges present in the financial aid process, many students fail to

access aid for which they would qualify. While FAFSA application rates have risen over time—

from 50 percent of undergraduates in 1999-2000 to 70 percent in 2011-12—substantial numbers

of eligible students still fail to apply. Estimates based on data from the 2011-12 National
5
    Averages are calculated over all students, not just those receiving aid.

                                                              7
Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) indicates that of the 30 percent of students who

failed to file a FAFSA, one third would have qualified for a Pell Grant. 6 In addition, many

FAFSA filers apply after important deadlines (King, 2004), in turn decreasing the likelihood of

receiving state and institutional aid for which they would otherwise be eligible.

        The efficiency and equity of the American high-tuition, high-aid model of college

financing rests heavily on the effectiveness of financial aid programs. Are these programs

successful at reaching their intended targets—students on the margin of college access—and

influencing their behavior? Or are they windfalls to individuals who would have enrolled

regardless? In the remainder of this section, we review the evidence on the causal impacts of

grants, loans, and other types of aid on college enrollment and attainment. We discuss

interventions related to reducing the complexity of the aid application and other steps in the

college transition separately in Section 3.

        2.1. Traditional aid (need-based grants and subsidized tuition)

        Standard models of human capital investment indicate that students will continue on to

higher education if the benefits of doing so outweigh the costs (e.g., Becker, 1964). Efforts that

increase grant-based financial aid directly to students may act through decreasing the cost of

attendance such that students on the margin are compelled to matriculate. As predicted by

economic theory, more than thirty years of empirical research has established that lowering the

cost of college can increase college enrollments. In 1988, Leslie and Brinkman reviewed several

dozen non-experimental studies and concluded that a $1,000 decrease in net price was associated

with a 3- to 5-percentage-point increase in college attendance. However, it is difficult to infer

causal effects based on non-experimental analyses of financial aid policy, because aid recipients

                                                     8
are often systematically selected and/or self-selected based on characteristics (e.g., need, merit,

motivation to enroll) that may have independent effects on outcomes of interest.

       While these early studies may have suffered from selection bias, subsequent research

using more rigorous empirical methods applied to data from several different time points and

several different contexts has found positive effects of a similar magnitude, increasing

confidence that these effects are truly causal and not just reflecting correlations. Several studies

have taken advantage of discrete policy changes to compare similar students who receive

dramatically different amounts of aid, including Dynarski’s (2003) analysis of the Social

Security Survivors Benefit, Abraham and Clark’s (2006) and Kane’s (2007) study of

Washington, D.C.’s Tuition Assistance Grant, and two separate studies of the mid-century G.I.

Bills (Bound & Turner, 2002; Stanley, 2003). All of these studies find that enrollment increases

when the net price faced by students is exogenously lowered. For more detailed reviews of these

studies, see Long (2008), Deming & Dynarski (2009), and Dynarski & Scott-Clayton (2013).

       More recent work on traditional financial aid (need-based grants and tuition subsidies)

has increasingly focused on college choice, persistence, and eventual degree completion.

Castleman and Long (2013) use a regression-discontinuity (RD) design to examine the effects of

a need-based program in Florida that has a strict eligibility cutoff, and find significant increases

in four-year college enrollment and subsequent bachelor’s degree completion. Goldrick-Rab,

Harris, Kelchen, and Benson (2012) provide rigorous evidence on the effects of need-based aid

on persistence conditional on initial enrollment, through their randomized evaluation of the

Wisconsin Scholars Grant (WSG). WSG provided large grants to Pell-eligible first-year students

already enrolled at Wisconsin four-year institutions. Perhaps surprisingly, they find only modest

effects on credit accumulation and persistence that fade out over time. These results may be due



                                                 9
in part to the fact that students who received the WSG saw other aid reduced; however,

providing the scholarship only after students initially enrolled may also have limited the impact

of the program.

       A set of studies exploits natural geographic variation in community college prices

resulting from community college taxing districts in Texas: students who live within a given

district face lower prices than similar students living just outside district boundaries (Denning,

2014; Martorell, McCall & McFarlin, 2014; McFarlin, 2007). All three studies confirm that

students facing lower community college prices are more likely to enroll in college. Less

evidence is available regarding effects on eventual degree receipt: McFarlin (2007) finds a

worrisome pattern of students switching from four-year to two-year institutions, but Denning

(2014) finds no evidence of such switching, and an overall positive impact on bachelor’s degree

completion.

       The research evidence regarding the impact of the nation’s single largest grant program,

the federal Pell Grant, has been somewhat more mixed. Hansen (1983) and Kane (1996) find

little effect of the introduction of the program overall. But Seftor and Turner (2002) find positive

impacts of expansions in eligibility for adult students, and Bettinger (2004) finds some evidence

of positive effects of larger Pell grants on persistence for students who are already enrolled. The

lack of consistent positive findings for Pell Grants may be due in part to complexity and

confusion surrounding the Pell eligibility and application process, which obscure its benefits and

dampen its impact among the individuals who need it most (Dynarski & Scott-Clayton, 2006;

Bettinger, Long, Oreopoulos & Sanbonmatsu, 2012).

       Recent work has also identified some new potential explanations for the mixed evidence

on Pell Grants and the WSG. Specifically, the increasingly complex interactions between aid



                                                10
programs may make it difficult to isolate the effects of any one program. For example, Turner

(2014) finds that private institutions reduce institutional aid for students who receive Pell, and

Goldrick-Rab and colleagues (2012) find that a $3,500 WSG award translated into just $1,500 in

total financial aid (including loans). Marx and Turner (2015) find that students who just miss

eligibility for Pell actually receive more in total aid from all sources on average, because students

just ineligible for Pell are much more likely to receive student loans. Scott-Clayton and Park

(2015) replicate these findings related to Pell eligibility and also find evidence that some

community colleges use state aid to disproportionately assist students who do not qualify for

Pell.

        2.2. Broad-based merit aid programs

        Since 1991, several states have instituted large-scale, merit-based grant programs to

defray the costs of higher education among their residents who meet certain merit-defined, but

not particularly elite eligibility criteria. 7 These state merit-based programs represent the most

sizeable increase in financial aid spending in the past two decades (College Board, 2012), and

they are also amenable to causal analysis—typically relying on difference-in-difference or RD

designs—that exploit variation in eligibility across states, cohorts, and test score eligibility

thresholds. The related research base indicates that such programs have led to improvements in

college readiness metrics; increases in college enrollment and performance; improved rates of

degree attainment; and decreases in the loss of talented students to other states by affecting

college choice (Bruce & Carruthers, 2014; Carruthers & Ozek, 2013; Cornwall, Mustard, &

Sridhar, 2006; Dynarski, 2004, 2008; Pallais, 2009; Scott-Clayton, 2011; Zhang & Ness, 2010).

7
 These states include Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Nevada, New
Mexico, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, and West Virginia, although Arkansas and Maryland have since
phased out their programs. Dynarski (2004) defined “broad-based” to mean that at least 30 percent of high school
seniors would quality.


                                                        11
One aspect of these programs that has proved both politically appealing and potentially

important for influencing behavior has been their simplicity (Dynarski & Scott-Clayton, 2006).

Many of these programs fully cover tuition and fees (at least initially) at in-state, public

institutions for students meeting a minimum GPA and sometimes ACT/SAT requirement, and

require minimal paperwork to claim.

        Nevertheless, attention has also been paid to unintended consequences associated with

these efforts. For example, while Georgia HOPE improved overall rates of college enrollment in

the state, it also led to a widening of college attendance gaps by race and socioeconomic status,

given the strength of response among middle-income students (Dynarski, 2000). 8 In addition, the

merit-based Adams Scholarship in Massachusetts resulted in students switching to in-state public

institutions away from higher quality alternatives, ultimately reducing students’ likelihood of

timely degree attainment (Cohodes & Goodman, 2014). Finally, a pair of recent studies using

Census data to examine a broader set of merit-aid programs has called into question whether

single-state, early estimates of the impact of merit aid may overstate the impacts experienced

more generally (Fitzpatrick & Jones, 2012; Sjoquist & Winters, 2012).

        A recent experimental evaluation of the Buffet Scholarship in Nebraska provides perhaps

the most rigorous evidence on the potential impact of programs providing free in-state college to

students on the basis of modest academic achievement (Angrist, Hudson & Pallais, 2014;

Angrist, Autor, Hudson, & Pallais, 2015). Buffet Scholars receive up to five years of free tuition

and fees, plus a $500 book credit, if they attend a public in-state institution. The eligibility

criteria include a minimum 2.5 high school GPA and maximum expected family contribution



8
 Other states’ programs, however, appear to narrow gaps in enrollment (Dynarski, 2004), perhaps because unlike
Georgia HOPE, other states allowed Pell recipients to combine awards, rather than reducing merit aid dollar-for-
dollar for students receiving larger Pell awards.

(EFC) to the cost of college corresponding to family incomes between $80,000-$100,000. 9

Applicants are also ranked (against students listing the same target institution) on the basis of

high school transcripts, essays, and letters of recommendation. For the study, a group of students

who fell in the middle of the rankings were randomly assigned to receive the award or not. The

authors find only a small, insignificant effect on initial enrollment (unsurprising given a 97

percent baseline enrollment rate even among the control group) but find substantial shifts from

two-year to four-year institutions, and substantial impacts on enrollments in the second year (a 7

percentage point increase overall and 14 percentage point increase in four-year enrollment), with

effects largest among lower achieving subgroups.

        2.3. Place-based college “promise” programs

        In addition to state-based merit programs, several urban settings have followed suit to

implement locally-based “promise” programs of their own. In some cases, the only “merit”

requirement for eligibility is to graduate from a public high school within a certain area. This

place-based approach began in 2005 with the announcement of the Kalamazoo Promise, which

offers full in-state college tuition to graduates of the Kalamazoo Public Schools in Michigan who

had been enrolled in the district for at least four years. A difference-in-difference analysis

comparing ACT score-sending behavior of students at Promise and non-Promise high schools

just before and after implementation found that eligible students were more likely to send their

scores to more selective in-state institutions (Andrews, DesJardins & Ranchhod, 2010). Results

from a separate difference-in-difference analysis (comparing students before and after the

high school credit completion, reduced suspensions, and had substantial effects on college

enrollment and graduation (Bartik & Lachowska, 2013; Bartik, Hershbein & Lachowska, 2015).

       Similarly, in 2008, local business and civic leaders provided funding to establish a free

community college program called “Knox Achieves” in Knox County, Tennessee. The program,

which was expanded to 22 counties in 2011 and became the model for a statewide “Tennessee

Promise” program expected to roll out in 2015, guarantees free community college tuition and

fees to high school seniors who sign up, apply for financial aid, and meet with a mentor.

Carruthers and Fox (2015) examine the impact of Knox Achieves using both difference-in-

difference and propensity score matching and find large impacts on high school graduation and

college enrollment, with some shift from the four-year to two-year sector. Interestingly, the

program achieves these large effects with relatively little additional financial aid ($971, on

average), since most students already receive significant tuition reductions via existing federal

and state programs. This points to the fact that the design and messaging of grant programs, not

just the dollar value of aid provided, can be a significant factor in influencing student outcomes.

       Since the launch of the Kalamazoo Promise, 31 communities (including locations such as

El Dorado, AR and Pittsburgh, PA) have implemented promise programs, although with

significant variation in details such as scholarship generosity and eligibility criteria. One recent

notable entrant is Chicago’s Star Scholarship, created in 2014, which provides free community

college to students with at least a 3.0 high school GPA who test out of remediation. While

marketed as a “free college” program, critics have noted that its eligibility requirements make it

more akin to merit-based aid given that only about 15 percent of the city’s high school graduates

would qualify (Fain, 2014). In early 2015, President Obama also announced his own free

community college plan, proposing to use federal funds to cover 75 percent of tuition and fees



                                                 14
for community college students in states that commit to cover the remainder. 10 Many details of

the proposal remain to be seen, however, making it difficult to extrapolate potential impacts

based on the existing body of research evidence.

        2.4. Tax credits and deductions

        The federal government’s tax expenditures on higher-education-related tax credits and

deductions were valued at nearly $19 billion dollars in 2014-15, making it as big a source of aid

for college as the Pell Grant program was just a few years ago (e.g., in 2008-09, just prior to a

dramatic Pell expansion during the Great Recession). The Hope Tax Credit (HTC) and Lifetime

Learning Tax Credit (LLTC) were enacted in 1997, while the more generous American

Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) has been available since 2009. For families who do not qualify

for a tax credit, tuition and fees may be deducted from income. Early work examining the

introduction of the credits using survey data and difference-in-difference analysis generated

conflicting findings regarding the HTC and LLTC, with Long (2004) finding no effects on

college enrollment and Turner (2011) finding positive effects (using the October Current

Population Survey and Survey of Income and Program Participation, respectively). Recent work

by Bulman and Hoxby (2015) and Hoxby and Bulman (2015 [this issue]) utilizing de-identified

data from the full population of tax returns provides the cleanest quasi-experimental

identification of the impact of these tax benefits, including the more generous AOTC. They make

use of non-linearities in the relationship between income and eligibility to identify effects (using

regression discontinuity, regression kink, and simulated instruments approaches) that are difficult

to pin down without administrative data. They provide compelling and precise evidence that

neither tax credits nor deductions influence college enrollment, perhaps because the tax benefits

are not realized until months after the enrollment decision has been made.

        2.5 Student loans

       Compared to the volume of research on grant aid and tuition discounts, relatively few

studies have examined how student loans affect college enrollment, performance, or completion.

There is strong evidence of the value of student loan access outside the U.S., in countries where

student loans have been the most prominent form of government aid for college. In Chile, access

to student loans is determined by both income quintile and test score. Using an RD design, Solis

(2014) finds that college enrollment is 16 percentage points higher for those who barely qualify

for loans compared to those who barely miss the test score cutoff (from a baseline college

enrollment rate around 30 percent); he also finds that the program virtually eliminates the income

gradient in college enrollment for students above the cutoff. Examining college applicants just

above and below a credit score cutoff for loan access in South Africa, Gurgand, Lorenceau, and

Mélonio (2011) find a similarly large, 20 percentage point increase in college enrollment for

students with access to loans (from a baseline enrollment rate of about 50 percent).

       It is difficult to extrapolate from these studies to the U.S., in which loans are growing, but

still only one component of a broader aid system. Heller (2008) reviews the non-experimental

literature on whether loans increase college access and concludes that college enrollments are not

as sensitive to loans as to grants, but cannot conclude whether or not they may still be cost-

effective (given they cost the government only a few cents on the dollar to provide). Dynarski

(2005) finds suggestive, but ultimately inconclusive evidence that student loan expansions in the

United States in the early 1990s led to increased college attendance. Two recent studies utilize

institution-year level variation in whether or not community colleges offer access to federal loans



                                                16
and find higher levels of enrollment intensity and persistence for students who have access to

loans (Dunlop, 2013; Wiederspan, 2015 [this issue]).



3. Navigating complexity: Informational and behavioral interventions

       Given the growing complexity of college pricing and financial aid, information and

procedural barriers present an increasingly important challenge to the effectiveness of the U.S.

system of college finance. Importantly, financial aid is not the only aspect of the college-going

process in which such barriers arise. There are many other decisions and steps that “add up” to

postsecondary access, and throughout the process from college consideration to enrollment, low-

income students fall behind their better-off peers in completing these steps (Avery & Kane,

2004). For example, although SAT / ACT taking is a key step in the college-going process,

dramatic socioeconomic differences exist in students meeting this milestone. An estimated 30

percent of students in the bottom income quartile take the SAT, while 70 percent of students in

the top income quartile do so (Goodman, 2013). Keeping students on track from early in the

process is critical, however, given the momentum that students build as they proceed (Klasik,

2012). At first blush, high rates of failure to navigate college-going processes effectively may

seem surprising, given the substantial returns to a college degree. Yet, a closer look reveals many

factors that can hinder students from realizing their college aspirations.

       While informational and procedural barriers are increasingly included in discussions of

college access (particularly as they relate to financial aid applications), recognition of their

intersection with broader behavioral barriers has begun to emerge over the past several years.

Behavioral economics provides a framework for understanding departures from standard models

of economic behavior, which do not account for facets of human behavior including limits to



                                                 17
rationality and willpower (Thaler & Mullainathan, 2008). The field is especially relevant for

studying students’ college decisions, given the need to weigh costs in the present against benefits

in the future (Lavecchia, Liu & Oreopoulos, 2014), and given that young adults are particularly

present-focused, impulsive and inexperienced in handling complex tasks (Casey, Jones, &

Somerville, 2011; Castleman, 2015; Steinberg, 2008; Steinberg, Cauffman, Woolard, Graham, &

Banich, 2009).

       To begin, students may fail to engage optimally in the process of identifying and

applying to postsecondary institutions (Avery, Howell & Page, 2014). Even among college-

aspiring students, a surprising share fails to complete an application to any college (Roderick,

Nagaoka, Coca, & Moeller, 2009), and among those who do apply to four-year institutions,

many students fail to apply to an appropriate number and range of institutions, even though it

would benefit them to do so (Smith, 2013).

       What barriers keep students from engaging optimally in the college selection and

application process? Some students may lack access to information; others may be overwhelmed

by the process of parsing information on the volume of potential postsecondary options. Either

circumstance may drive students to make important choices that are haphazard (Radford, 2013);

based on simple rules of thumb (Pallais, 2015); or based on other factors that are not a good basis

for decision making, such as the desire to avoid onerous applications or attend an institution with

certain residential amenities (Smith, Hurwitz & Howell, 2015; Thaler & Sunstein, 2008; Ross,

White, Wright & Knapp, 2013). For high-achieving, low-income students who are

geographically isolated from other high-achieving peers, college application choice sets mirror

those of peers who are socioeconomically rather than academically similar (Hoxby & Avery,

2013). Students cuing their college application choices off of the decisions of preceding cohorts



                                                18
of students from their own high school also may relate to issues of social belonging and students’

overemphasis on aspects of their own identity other than academic success (Walton & Cohen,

2007). Taken together, students can struggle with the sheer volume of options that they have, and

are more likely to make mistakes when their decision making is poorly informed (Milkman,

Beshears, Choi, Laibson, & Madrian, 2012; Ross et al, 2013).

         Decision making at the stages of college application and college selection have

contributed to postsecondary “undermatch” where students matriculate to institutions that are not

well-aligned to their academic and other credentials (Bowen, Chingos & McPherson, 2011;

Dillon & Smith, 2013; Smith, Pender & Howell, 2013). Descriptive evidence indicates college

match as important to ultimate college success, given that students are more likely to persist to

degree attainment if they attend a well-matched institution (Light & Strayer, 2000). More

generally, both descriptive (Howell & Pender, 2015 [this issue]) and quasi-experimental

evidence (Goodman, Hurwitz and Smith, 2015) suggests that attending a higher quality

institution has substantial impacts on college completion. 11

         Even among recent high school graduates who have been admitted to college and

successfully navigated the financial aid application process, the summer transition to college also

involves a number of hurdles to timely matriculation including: voluminous institutional

paperwork, sometimes exacerbated by a lack of regular internet access; delays in financial aid

packaging due to income verification requirements; challenges in financing the cost of actually

traveling to campus; and unanticipated charges and fees present on a student’s tuition bill

(Castleman & Page, 2014a,b). While navigating such tasks without institutional support poses

challenges, this summer is unique in that students are no longer members of their high school but


11
  In this study, in particular, the relevant comparison is primarily between state four-year institutions and two-year
community colleges.

                                                          19
have yet to join their college. As a result, a surprisingly large share fail to transition successfully

to college in the fall after high school graduation (Arnold, Fleming, De Anda, Castleman &

Wartman, 2009; Castleman & Page, 2014a,b; Daugherty, 2012; Matthews, Schooley & Vosler,

2011; Roderick et al, 2008; Stephan & Rosenbaum, 2013).

       In sum, the complexity of the college-going process itself may hinder students from

achieving greater rates of college access and success. Given the challenges that this context

presents, there is an opportunity to improve student postsecondary access and success by adding

structure to students’ college exploration and application processes, providing additional

guidance and support, and facilitating decision making (Ross et al., 2013). In recognition,

education practitioners and researchers have implemented and evaluated a number of potential

solutions. These efforts range in intensity from high- to low-touch initiatives and include

solutions that are comprehensive (e.g., working with students through all steps in the college-

going process) to those that are focused on providing information and/or support to address

single barriers, such as applying for financial aid or taking the SAT. We organize our summary

of related evidence along these dimensions.

       3.1 Comprehensive college-going support

       When considering who can (or should) shepherd students through the college process,

one obvious possibility is high school counselors. Indeed, Hurwitz and Howell (2014) provide

evidence on the positive impact of counselors on college-going outcomes. In reality, however,

current student-to-counselor ratios together with counselors’ many other responsibilities translate

to counselors having little time to provide high quality and personalized college-going support.

The average U.S. public school counselor today manages a caseload that is almost double the

American School Counseling Association recommended 250:1 (ASCA, 2012; Planty et al.,



                                                  20
2009), and many counselors lack training and expertise in key college-going processes, such as

applying for financial aid (Civic Enterprises, 2011). When compared to their higher-income

peers, lower income students have less access to school-based college counseling (Clinedinst &

Hawkins, 2009).

       A set of efforts have focused on reaching first-generation and low-income students with

the types of high-touch personalized supports more often enjoyed by students from higher-

income backgrounds (Avery, Howell & Page, 2014b). Programs such as College Possible and

Bottom Line deliver comprehensive advising services to students through the processes of

college search and completing college and financial aid applications. Bottom Line is unique in

that it purposefully directs students to selected institutions that have both higher graduation rates

and low levels of student debt. Experimental evidence on College Possible and quasi-

experimental evidence on Bottom Line based on an RD design reveal that support from these

organizations has led to increased enrollment in four-year institutions (Avery, 2013; Castleman

& Goodman, 2014). In the case of Bottom Line, supported students were more likely to enroll in

those institutions specifically endorsed by the program (Castleman & Goodman, 2014). Bos,

Berman, Kane, and Tseng (2012) provide experimental evidence that similar advising provided

by near-aged peers led to significant improvements in enrollment in four-year public institutions

in California, and Carrell and Sacerdote (2013) found through a randomized controlled trial that

late-stage college advising offered to students who were college-ready but behind in the

application process significantly improved college enrollment for female high school graduates

in New Hampshire. An MDRC led experimental study finds that the College MATCH program

in Chicago, which provides college-going support to students through a combination of

classroom activities and support from a young adult or near-peer advisor, is successful in



                                                 21
meeting its programmatic goal of improving the selectivity of the institutions to which college-

intending students apply (Sherwin, 2012).

       While these efforts are all geographically limited, other federally-funded programs with

broader reach have also sought to improve college counseling both in and out of school. For

example, a quasi-experimental study of Talent Search revealed positive impacts of the in-school

counseling it provided on completion of college-going tasks, such as applying for financial aid,

and direct-to-college enrollment (Constantine, Seftor, Martin, Silva & Myers, 2006). Finally, a

large-scale randomized trial of the College Advising Corps (CAC), reveals that the placement of

CAC counselors in high schools led to modest but significant improvements in SAT and AP

course taking and FAFSA filing (Bettinger, Antonio, Evans, Foster, Holzman, Santikian &

Horng, 2012; Horng et al., 2013), and led to positive effects on first-year college enrollment,

particularly for Hispanic students and student from low-income backgrounds (Bettinger &

Evans, 2015).

       3.2      Targeted support

       Other efforts have focused more narrowly on specific tasks, such as FAFSA filing.

Through a collaborative, experimental effort with H&R Block, Bettinger, Long, Oreopoulos, and

Sanbonmatsu (2012) find that coupling tax preparation with FAFSA completion together with

providing families with estimates of likely levels of financial aid and tuition costs at nearby

colleges led to substantial increases in rates of FAFSA submission as well as financial aid

receipt, college attendance, and persistence. For example, students whose parents received

FAFSA assistance were 8 percentage points more likely to have completed at least two years of

college. Notably, they did not detect any improvements among families who received aid

information but not direct FAFSA assistance. This finding highlights the potential limits of



                                              22
information-only interventions, particularly in helping students and families with complex

processes. In another intervention also focused on financial aid applications, Owen (2012)

evaluated the impact of increased school counselor outreach on FAFSA completion and college

enrollment in the Albuquerque Public Schools (Albuquerque, NM). Covariate controlled year-to-

year differences revealed a 10 percentage point increase in FAFSA completion and an associated

12 percentage point increase in on-time college enrollment.

        Another step in the college-going process that has received attention is the taking of

college entrance exams. Several states, districts and schools have implemented universal, school-

day testing policies that work to substantially mitigate many of the barriers to timely SAT or

ACT taking. 12 Such strategies help to alleviate the burdens of test taking and also help to

overcome students’ perceptions that taking these assessments is incongruent with their own

identity. Studies that capitalize on the exogenous shock of these policies being introduced in

certain geographies and at certain points in time show that, as would be expected, these policies

have a sizeable impact on rates of test taking (Goodman, 2013; Hurwitz, Smith, Howell & Niu,

2014; Hyman, 2014; Klasik, 2013).

        Further, these testing policies can have important impacts on both whether and where

students enroll in college. Analyzing data from multiple states, Klasik (2013) reports significant

impacts of universal testing on overall college enrollment in Illinois and positive although

insignificant effects in Colorado and Maine. Capitalizing on student-level data held by the

College Board, Hurwitz and colleagues (2014) find that the universal policy in Maine did

increase four-year college enrollment rates by 2 – 3 percentage points (4 – 6 percent) overall, and

12
   States implementing school-day ACT policies include: Arkansas, Colorado, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana,
Michigan, Montana, North Carolina, Tennessee, Utah and Wyoming (http://www.act.org/stateservices/) and states
implementing school-day ACT policies are States implementing school-day SAT policies are Delaware, Idaho and
Maine, as well as certain districts and schools in Florida, Indiana, Maryland, New Jersey and Texas
(http://professionals.collegeboard.com/higher-ed/recruitment/sat-test/school-day)

                                                     23
that this impact was driven particularly by changes for students from high schools in small towns

and rural areas in Maine. Further, the Maine policy increased by 10 percentage points college

enrollment among those students who would not sit for the SAT absent the policy. Of those

students induced into testing by virtue of these universal policies, large shares (many of whom

were from disadvantaged backgrounds), perform well enough on the exam to qualify for

competitive admissions schools (Goodman, 2013). While data limitations prohibit Goodman

from disaggregating impacts by salient student characteristics, she nevertheless finds that as a

result of these policies, selective college enrollment rose by approximately 20 percent, with no

effect on overall college enrollment.

        A second strategy for improving rates of SAT / ACT taking is the establishment of a

testing center on a high school campus. This allows students to take the relevant exam in their

own high schools on a given test administration day rather than having to travel to an alternate

location. Capitalizing again on geographic and time variation, Bulman (forthcoming) estimates

that in schools that establish new centers, students are 8 percent more likely to take a college

entrance exam, with particularly strong impacts at low-income schools (where the impact was

approximately a 15 percent increase in test taking). 13 Further analyses indicate that alleviating

barriers to SAT taking may be particularly beneficial for low-income, high-achieving students.

        Taken together, several mechanisms may be at play in the impacts discussed here.

SAT/ACT test taking itself is an important milestone in the college-going process (Klasik, 2012).

The school day policies and the introduction of local test centers both increase awareness of and

reduce travel and other hassle costs associated with test taking itself. Further, these policies

underscore an implicit recommendation that students should be taking college entrance exams. In


13
  Bulman defines a low-income school one where at least 30 percent of students qualify for free or reduced price
lunch.

                                                        24
addition, after taking the test and learning their own score, students may receive important

feedback regarding their own competitiveness as candidates for selective colleges and

universities and may, in turn, revise their perceptions regarding the benefits of college as well as

their own college potential. In sum, for a surprising number of students, the decision to take a

college entrance exam is sensitive to small barriers. Overcoming these barriers leads to changes

in enrollment decisions.

       3.3 Low-touch information and nudges

       Much of the evidence on SAT/ACT test taking policies find particularly strong impacts

among high-achieving, low-income students. Hoxby and Turner (2013) provide experimental

evidence on a student-outreach effort to provide this subgroup of students with semi-customized

packets of information about college net costs and application processes as well as no-paperwork

application fee waivers. The intervention – Expanding College Opportunity – was inexpensive

(approximately $6 / student) and led to increases in the rates with which the focal students

applied, were accepted to, and attended high quality colleges and universities. It did not,

however, lead to increases in college enrollment overall. The intervention did not impact

freshman year grades, implying that focal students were able to be equally competitive

academically, even at higher-quality postsecondary institutions.

       In a much less comprehensive information-based intervention, the College Board recently

collaborated in the development of a “College Is Affordable” brochure that was then distributed

to lower-income families with middle school students in North Carolina. In particular, the goal of

the brochure was to educate families about college net price. Treatment and comparison families

were then surveyed regarding their knowledge of postsecondary financing. Families receiving

the brochure were more likely to report knowing the cost of attending college in North Carolina;



                                                25
agreeing that most students pay less than colleges’ list prices; and agreeing that students from

low-income families could attend college at low to no cost (College Board, 2012). Similarly,

Oreopoulos and Dunn (2013) report that high school students are much more likely to aspire to

postsecondary education after receiving information about the costs and benefits of college.

These efforts, taken together, indicate that students and their families likely stand to benefit from

improved access to college-related information focused on college financing as well as other

aspects of the college-going process.

       Indeed, the past few years have also seen a proliferation of tools intended to provide

students and families with better information about important metrics related to college cost and

quality. These include tools such as the White House College Scorecard, the FAFSA4Caster, net

price calculators (NPCs), and the financial aid package shopping sheet. Given their recent

development, we have limited evidence on these tools’ potential for impact on college-related

decisions and outcomes. Rosinger (2014) finds through a randomized controlled trial that use of

the shopping sheet has little impact on students’ enrollment and borrowing decisions. Anthony,

Page and Seldin (2015) provide descriptive evidence that estimates provided by the federal

template NPC can vary substantially from actual financial aid awards, potentially limiting its

promise for putting meaningful information in the hands of students as they making decisions

about the postsecondary institutions to which to apply. As noted above, in their H&R Block

FAFSA experiment, Bettinger and colleagues (2012) found no impact on FAFSA or college

enrollment outcomes of simply providing information about FAFSA and financial aid at the time

of tax filing. This limited set of evidence suggests that it may be too optimistic to expect that

these tools, in isolation, will have a meaningful impact of students’ college-going outcomes. In

fact, it may be reasonable to expect that such tools aiming to making information about college



                                                 26
cost and quality more transparent will have more impact on the behavior of postsecondary

institutions compared to the behavior of individual students and families (Loewenstein, Sunstein

& Golman, 2014). This is an area of future research.

       Finally, simple reminders and well-framed encouragements or “nudges” also have been

shown to be effective in a variety of settings for improving follow-through with desirable actions

(Armstrong et al, 2009; Dale & Strauss, 2009; Karlan et al, 2010; Thaler & Sunstein, 2008). In

educational contexts, providing students with nudges can help reduce inertia and students’

tendency to procrastinate and can help students to make positive changes to their daily activities

to contribute to more success as a student (Lavecchia et al., 2014). Nudging initiatives have

shown several early successes in the educational context (Bergman, 2013; Kraft & Rogers, 2014;

York & Loeb, 2015). For example, a number of experimental interventions show that summer

outreach and the offer of support delivered by counselors, near-aged peers, or by automated text

messaging serve to significantly summer mitigate attrition from the college-going pipeline and

improve college success (Castleman, Arnold & Wartman, 2012; Arnold, Castleman, Chewning

& Page, 2015; Castleman, Owen & Page, 2015 [this issue]; Castleman, Page & Schooley, 2014;

Castleman & Page, 2014a, 2015, forthcoming).

       Nudges can help students overcome their attentional failure by providing reminders that

are well-timed to correspond to the windows of opportunity during which students would

optimally focus on particular tasks. Well-timed nudges may actually serve to capitalize on

students’ relative impulsivity, encouraging them to make progress with a particular task in the

moment rather than putting it off to an unspecified future time (Castleman & Page, 2014b). Thus,

there may be promise in low-touch nudges and reminders to support students throughout the

college-going process.



                                               27
4. Interventions aimed at easing the academic transition to college

       Not all students who successfully enroll in college enter academically ready. With

increased rates of college enrollment have come increased rates of students unprepared for

college-level coursework. Estimates suggest that among recent cohorts of high school students,

only one of every three to four students is academically prepared as defined by successfully

graduating from high schools, engaging in a college-preparatory high school curriculum and

meeting a minimum threshold of skill in basic literacy (Chen, Wu, & Tasoff, 2010; Greene &

Forster, 2003).

       Of course, academic preparation for college is a long process that starts well before the

end of high school, and a comprehensive examination of human capital production from infancy

onward is beyond the scope of this review. Nevertheless, there are academic challenges specific

to the transition to college that are distinct from concerns about student achievement more

broadly. In particular, high school graduation requirements are generally poorly aligned with

requirements for college-level coursework although students are not aware of this (Kirst &

Venezia, 2004; Rosenbaum, Deil-Amen, & Person, 2006). Moreover, access to college-

preparatory coursework and college counseling are not equally available at all high schools: low-

income and minority students have both fewer opportunities to obtain the academic preparation

required for college and less “college knowledge” regarding what is expected in the first place

(see review by Goldrick-Rab, 2010). In this section we review the evidence on interventions to

address the disconnect between high school and college academics, grouping them by whether

the intervention is primarily based at the postsecondary institution, or at the high school, though

in some interventions this distinction is intentionally blurred.

       4.1 Remedial coursework



                                                 28
       Remedial coursework is perhaps the most widespread and costly intervention aimed at

addressing perceived skill deficiencies among incoming college students. Remedial or

“developmental” courses provide basic instruction in reading, writing, and mathematics, but do

not bear college credit. Most two-year colleges and many non-selective four-year colleges

require incoming students to be screened for possible remedial placement prior to their initial

course registration. Typically, placement is based upon whether students exceed a cutoff on a

placement exam; those scoring below the college-level cutoff may be required to take and pass

one or more remedial courses before enrolling in college-level courses in the given subject. Half

of all undergraduates will take at least one remedial course; among those who take any, the

average is 2.6 remedial courses (Scott-Clayton, Crosta, & Belfield, 2014). Scott-Clayton et al.

(2014) estimate that with over three million new students entering college each year, this implies

a national cost of nearly $7 billion dollars annually. Relatively few students who enter

remediation ever even attempt college-level coursework (Bailey, Jeong, & Cho, 2010). But

because students entering remediation are disadvantaged to begin with, this fact alone is not

informative about the causal effect of remediation.

       Several studies using RD analysis to compare students just above and below remedial test

score cutoffs have generally found null to negative impacts of remediation. For example,

Martorell and McFarlin (2011) examine administrative records for over 250,000 students in

Texas public two- and four-year colleges: those just below the test score threshold had

significantly lower rates of persistence and college credit accumulation, with no impact on

degree attainment and future labor market earnings. Studies in Florida and in a large urban

community college system using analogous data and methods found similarly null to negative

effects on academic outcomes (Calcagno & Long, 2008; Scott-Clayton & Rodriguez, 2015).



                                               29
       A typical caveat in RD studies is that they identify average treatment effects local to

students scoring near the cutoff—that is, the highest scoring remediated students and the lowest

scoring non-remediated student—and thus one interpretation of the RD evidence may be that the

existing remedial cutoffs are set too high. Evidence regarding impact heterogeneity by ability

does in fact suggest that the negative effects of remediation may be largest for higher-ability or

lower-academic-risk students (Martorell & McFarlin, 2011; Scott-Clayton & Rodriguez, 2015).

Conversely, several RD studies examining very low-scoring students—who are at the margin

between higher and lower levels of remediation—have found some positive effects of being

assigned to the more intensive remedial treatment (Boatman & Long, 2010; Dadgar, 2012;

Hodara, 2012).

       Two studies take advantage of seemingly arbitrary variation in placement test cutoff

policies across public institutions within a given state, using distance to college as an instrument

for students’ probability of remediation. The first of these, by Bettinger and Long (2009), also is

one of the only studies to find positive effects of remedial (versus college-level) assignment.

Their analysis strategy requires limiting the sample to students who took the ACT, making this

one of the few studies to examine predominantly four-year enrollees. They find some important

positive impacts, including an increase in bachelor’s degree completion within four years. On the

other hand, even this study finds some negative impacts. For example, in both English and math,

remediated students completed significantly fewer total credits, while those remediated in math

were more likely to drop out in their first year. A more recent study, by Clotfelter, Ladd,

Muschkin, and Vigdor (2015) uses a similar distance-based instrument to examine community

college enrollees in North Carolina. They find strong negative effects on the likelihood of ever

passing a college-level course in the relevant subject, as well as on “college success,” broadly



                                                30
defined to include degree or diploma completion, or completion of at least 10 transferable

courses within four years of entry.

Across studies, this overall negative (or at best mixed) set of findings is consistent with possible

heterogeneity of effects across students with different characteristics and/or preparation. A

related explanation is that the tests used to determine who should be remediated appear to be

poor predictors of who would do well in college-level courses. Scott-Clayton, Crosta, and

Belfield (2014) predict, based on both test scores and detailed measures of high school course

taking and grades, that approximately one-quarter of students remediated in math and one-third

of students remediated in English could have earned a B or better in the relevant college-level

course, had they been placed there directly.

       In light of this body of evidence, policy efforts have shifted recently in two directions:

first, towards reducing remedial placement rates through the use of early awareness and

alternative placement measures; and second, towards delivering remedial course content more

efficiently to limit the diversion of students from college-level coursework. An example of the

first strategy is the Early Assessment Program (EAP) in California, in which high school juniors

took the college placement exams. This gave students time to address academic gaps during the

senior year of high school. Evidence capitalizing on changes over time in students’ exposure to

EAP indicates that this testing and feedback strategy reduced remediation rates in college

without discouraging those who were underprepared from continuing on (Howell, Kurlaender, &

Grodsky, 2010). Another example comes from Long Beach City College (LBCC), which

switched from a test-based placement tool to a high-school transcript based process in 2012.

While the policy change was not formally evaluated, LBCC reports that the percentage of

students taking and successfully completing college-level math and English courses tripled and



                                                31
quadrupled, respectively, the year the new policy was introduced (Oakley, 2014). Emerging

experimental evidence from Evans and Henry (2015) finds that use of computer-adaptive

placement testing, together with targeted feedback and the opportunity to retest resulted in a 7 –

9 percentage point increase in college-level math placement, without leading to a reduction in

college course success.

       Rigorous causal evidence on the impact of alternative remedial instruction is more

limited. Descriptive evidence suggests the potential promise of technology-based strategies,

including online and other self-directed learning tools (Edgecombe, 2011; Epper & Baker, 2009;

Jenkins, Speroni, Belfield, Jaggars, & Edgecombe, 2010; Zachry & Schneider, 2008). Boatman

(2012) utilizes an RD design to evaluate such strategies and finds positive impacts of revised

remedial programs, at least on short-run outcomes such as early college persistence and credits

attempted.

       4.2 Dual enrollment and other high-school based interventions

       While remediation may be conceptualized as bringing high school work into college,

another approach to smoothing the academic transition from high school to college is to expose

students to college-level work while they are still in high school. Importantly, some of the

interventions in this domain are crafted not only to address academic barriers, but also to

mitigate informational and financial barriers as well. The oldest initiatives in this vein are the

Advanced Placement (AP) and International Baccalaureate (IB) programs. Both programs offer

rigorous courses in various subjects, are taught by high school teachers, and culminate in

external exams through which (depending upon the score received) students may earn college

credit at some institutions. Non-experimental evaluations of these programs have consistently

found that participation is positively correlated with academic outcomes including high school



                                               32
graduation, college enrollment, and college performance (e.g., Chajewski, Mattern & Shaw,

2011; Saavedra, 2011).

       Of course, even careful non-experimental analyses with rich observable control variables

may overstate effects if the students who participate in these programs are unobservably more

motivated or more interested in college. The most rigorous available evidence also finds positive

effects, albeit of a somewhat more modest magnitude. Jackson (2010) uses administrative data

from Texas to examine the expansion of the AP Incentive Program (APIP), which provided

monetary incentives to students (and their teachers) for passing scores on AP exams. Using a

difference-in-difference design that exploited variation in the timing of schools’ entry into the

program, Jackson finds that school-level participation in the program led to more AP test taking,

higher scores on college entrance exams (SAT and ACT), and a five percent increase in the share

of students enrolling in college. Capitalizing on millions of student records and a continuous raw

score that underlies reported integer AP scores, Smith, Hurwitz and Avery (2015) utilize an RD

design to examine the impact of just passing Advanced Placement exams. Local to the passing

threshold, students who earn a college-credit bearing score are one to two percentage points (per

exam) more likely to earn a bachelor’s degree within four years, with more modest impacts on

six-year degree attainment rates. Together, these results suggest that at the margin of passing,

earning AP credit primarily influences time to degree but not ultimate degree attainment.


       Dual enrollment programs are similar to AP or IB in that they enable students to earn

both college and high school credit simultaneously, but unlike AP or IB the credit comes from

the course itself rather than from an external exam. A further important distinction, highlighted

by Karp (2015) is that beyond simply offering more rigorous courses, dual enrollment creates a

mechanism for better collaboration and coordination between the secondary and postsecondary


                                               33
sectors. As with AP and IB, rigorous research on dual enrollment is limited. Non-experimental

analyses have found some positive effects on postsecondary enrollment, persistence, and

completion (CCRC, 2012). While the validity of results from non-experimental comparisons

may be threatened by unobserved confounding variables, a careful propensity score analysis by

An (2013) finds that the strong positive relationship between dual enrollment and BA completion

is robust to the omission of even large potential confounders. The most rigorous quasi-

experimental study compares high school students in Florida just above and below a test score

cutoff for program eligibility (Speroni, 2011). Using a regression-discontinuity design, the author

finds no effect of dual enrollment on high school or college outcomes in general. However,

students just barely eligible for college algebra were substantially more likely to enroll and

graduate from college than those just below the cutoff.

       Perhaps the most intensive strategy to “bring the college experience into high schools” is

to restructure the high school as an “early college.” Indeed, about 280 early and middle college

high schools (E-MCHSs) exist across the country, often located on college campuses, enabling

students to take college courses and, in some cases, to earn an associate’s degree during high

school. These high schools offer college exposure to a wider range of students than either

traditional dual enrollment or AP/IB programs, which are more academically selective (Barnett,

Maclutsky, & Wagonlander, 2015).

       Berger, Turk-Bicakci, Garet, Knudson, & Hoshen (2014) use a randomized-lottery design

to evaluate student outcomes at 10 early colleges across the country that had more applicants

than they had seats. Students randomly offered ECHS admission were significantly more likely

to earn college credits and complete a two-year college degree than those who lost the lottery.

While these differences emerged before the end of high school, they persisted to the end of the



                                                34
follow-up period (with a 17 percentage point difference in associate’s degree completion seven

years after students entered 9th grade). A second study in progress uses a similar research design

with oversubscribed schools in North Carolina (Edmunds, 2010). Results to date indicate that

enrollment in an ECHS had significant, positive effects on several student outcomes, including

student attendance and suspension rates, remaining academically on-track for college,

accumulation of college credit while in high school, and academic performance and persistence

in college (Edmunds et al, 2012; Unlu, Yamaguchi, Bernstein & Edmunds, 2010). While highly

compelling, the effects for oversubscribed schools may not generalize to early colleges more

broadly.



5. Affirmative action and “Top X%” plans

          The barriers to college access that we discuss above—financial, informational and

behavioral, and academic—are obviously not mutually exclusive. For low-income, minority, and

first-generation college students—often concentrated in under-resourced high schools—these

barriers may compound. It is also important to acknowledge that underrepresented minorities

face additional, distinct barriers—including highly segregated schools and neighborhoods

(Rothstein, 2015) as well as both implicit and explicit discrimination (Bertrand, Chugh, &

Mullainathan, 2005). 14 While we do not survey the full depth of research on affirmative action in

college admissions, we highlight key findings from this literature below. For more detailed

reviews, see Arcidiacono and Lovenheim (2015), Hinrichs (2012, 2014), or Holzer and Neumark

(2006).




14
  See Arcidiacano & Lovenheim (2015) for a recent review of the justifications for and empirical evidence on
affirmative action policies and “percent plans.”

                                                       35
       Early studies document sharp declines in minority enrollment at selective public

institutions after affirmative action bans are enacted (Tienda, Leicht, Sullivan, Maltese, & Lloyd,

2003; Kain, O’Brien, & Jargowsky, 2005). But one key finding from the subsequent literature is

that such bans primarily affect where students enroll and complete degrees, rather than whether

they do so at all (an important caveat however, is that there are many more studies of the

application/enrollment margins than the completion margin). Several recent studies have

identified the effects of affirmative action by comparing changes in minority student enrollment

(or other outcomes) within states that implemented affirmative action bans (California, Texas,

Washington, and Florida) to changes in states that did not implement such bans. For example,

Hinrichs (2012, 2014) utilizes a difference-in-difference approach with data from a national,

institution-level database (IPEDS) as well as data from the Current Population Survey and

American Community Survey. His results suggest that such bans have little effect on minority

enrollments or bachelor’s degree completions overall, but substantially reduce the likelihood that

minorities enroll in or complete a bachelor’s degree at a selective four-year institution. Other

studies with similar findings include Backes (2012), who examines enrollment and completion

using IPEDS with a difference-in-difference approach; Long (2004), who uses a triple-difference

to examine SAT score-sending behavior in California and Texas among those who took the test

(over time, across states, and across minority status); and Dickson (2006), who examines SAT

test-taking in Texas within the same high schools, before and after the ban.

       A complication faced by many of these studies is that states and institutions in many

cases actively developed new policies and programs intended to counter the effects of the

affirmative action bans, so difference-in-difference estimates will capture the combined effect of

eliminating affirmative action and implementing new programs in response, rather than the



                                                36
isolated effect of instituting a ban. Texas’s “Top 10%” plan, which guarantees admission to any

in-state public institution to students who rank in the top 10% of their high school class, is the

most notable example of an alternative policy. 15 If high schools were fully segregated by race,

such a policy would ensure admission for 10% of students within each racial group. But as

Hinrichs (2012) notes, the reality is that high schools are not completely segregated, and “fewer

than x% of minorities are in the top x% of their high school class” (p. 715). This may explain

why such alternatives do not appear to completely undo the effects of affirmative action bans for

minorities. Cortes (2010) examines how the switch from affirmative action to the top 10% policy

in Texas affected the post-enrollment outcomes of minority students differentially by high school

class ranking. 16 She finds that persistence and graduation were flat or declining for minority

students below the top decile, while the same outcomes were increasing for minority students in

the top 10% (as well as for non-minority students throughout the distribution). Daugherty,

Martorell, & McFarlin (2014) use a regression discontinuity strategy around school-level

eligibility cutoffs and find that students who just barely qualified were much more likely to

attend a state flagship institution. But this came at the expense of private college enrollments,

such that there were no effects on enrollment in general or on quality of college attended.

         One critique of both affirmative action and top X% plans—and possible explanation of

limited effects on enrollment—is that they may be of limited use to students facing additional

barriers like the ones described elsewhere in this review. To counter these multiple barriers, the

University of Texas at Austin implemented the Longhorn Opportunity Scholarship program. The

15
   In 2009, UT-Austin was allowed to limit the proportion of students admitted under the Top 10% plan to 75
percent of the incoming class, meaning that students who just barely make the top 10% still may not meet the
effective cutoff for UT-Austin. Florida and California also have so called “percent plans” but they only guarantee
admission to some public four year institution, not to the institution of the student’s choice as in Texas (Cortes,
2010).
16
   Her analysis uses administrative data from the Texas Higher Education Opportunity Project (THEOP) and as such
is conditional on enrolling in some public institution in the state; however, given other evidence that the enrollment
margin is unaffected, this is a reasonable limitation.

                                                         37
program targeted low-income, underrepresented high schools (which serve disproportionately

minority student populations) for additional outreach, and provided generous financial assistance

and enhanced academic supports to graduates of these high schools if admitted to UT-Austin

(Andrews, Ranchhod, & Sathy, 2010). The first cohort eligible for the program completed high

school in in 1999, one year after the Top 10% plan went into effect and two years after Texas’s

affirmative action ban. Dickson (2006), using a high school fixed-effects approach, finds

evidence that the program significantly increased SAT-taking at targeted high schools. Andrews

et al. (2010) use a difference-in-difference approach with matched comparison schools and find

that the program substantially increased applications to UT-Austin. They additionally find the

largest effects for students in the top decile of class rank, who were guaranteed admission,

consistent with the notion that for low-income or underrepresented populations, college

application decisions “are subject to multiple constraints” (p. 113). 17



6. Discussion

        In this review we have isolated and discussed various barriers to college access. Yet these

barriers can interact, and successful transition to college requires navigating all or at least some

combination of them. Indeed, from this rich and growing literature on barriers to college access

and prospective solutions, a dominant theme that emerges is the overall complexity of the

college transition. Given this complexity, policy solutions that focus on just one type of barrier—

such as college affordability—may lead to improved access, but may not be the most effective

use of resources if other challenges still stand in students’ way. For example, additional grants

funds that allow students to enroll in college may not be well invested if students use these funds

17
  Andrews et al. (2010) perform the same analysis for the Century Scholars program, a similar program operated by
Texas A&M, and also find positive results, although the magnitudes are smaller and not statistically significant for
as many deciles.

                                                        38
to attend institutions that do not maximize their chances of persistence and success. Similarly,

the potential benefits to helping students select and apply to a set of well-matched colleges may

not be fully realized if students and families have actual or perceived financial barriers that keep

them from investing in higher education. Thus, the most effective solutions may be ones that

seek to address multiple barriers to college access together, rather than in isolation.

       Finally, we have set aside, with limited exceptions, the question of what happens with

students once they get through the door of college. While many of the policy interventions that

we examined may support both access and completion, it is also possible for these two goals to

come into conflict, particularly in the context of limited resources. When institutional resources

are constrained, higher education systems may face a tradeoff: serve more students with lower

quality, or fewer students with higher quality academic opportunities and other services (Barr,

2010). At the extreme, if resources are spread too thin, it is conceivable that an institution could

increase its number of graduates by decreasing the number of students admitted.

       Consider the implications, for example, of a comprehensive community college

intervention established by the City University of New York, called ASAP (Accelerated Study in

Associate Programs). The program not only waives tuition and fees, but also requires full-time

enrollment, provides free transportation, intensive advising, career services, special seminars and

other supports. After three years, students randomly assigned to the program were nearly twice

as likely to have earned an associate’s degree compared to the control group (40 percent versus

22 percent (Scrivener et al., 2015). But the program is not cheap: at least in its initial

implementation, ASAP represented a 60 percent increase in per-student expenditure.

Importantly, however, it cost less per graduate than business-as-usual (Levin & Garcia, 2013). A

social cost-benefit analysis easily justifies spending the resources needed to expand the number



                                                 39
of students served, if those resources exist. On the other hand, if resources are held fixed, the

results suggest the system would produce more graduates by serving fewer students with ASAP-

like intensity. 18

         Unfortunately, in the U.S., resources for higher education have not expanded as fast as

enrollments. In fact, at the state level, expenditures are falling in real terms. In the face of

competing priorities, the share of state budgets devoted to higher education fell from 8 percent in

1980 to 4 percent in 2010 (Mettler, 2014). On a per-student basis, state funding has fallen 30

percent since its peak in 1987-88, from $10,176 to $7,161 per student (Baum & Ma, 2014). Thus,

the tension between quantity served and quality of service is not a hypothetical one. A key

implication is that improving college access is not, on its own, likely to be sufficient to eliminate

socioeconomic gaps in educational attainment: the “marginal” students induced into college by

virtue of the programs and policies discussed above disproportionately enter the public

institutions at which resource constraints are most acute. Given current trends in per-student

funding, the tension between promoting access and maintaining quality is likely only to increase

in the coming years.
