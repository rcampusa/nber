                                          ABSTRACT

We use information from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79) and
supplementary data sources to examine how cognitive performance, measured at approximately
the end of secondary schooling, is related to the labor market outcomes of 20 through 50 year
olds. Our estimates control for a wide array of individual and family background characteristics, a
limited set of non-cognitive attributes, survey year dummy variables and, sometimes, geographic
place effects. The analysis reveals five main findings. First, cognitive performance is positively
associated with future labor market outcomes at all ages. The relationship is attenuated but not
eliminated by the addition of controls for non-cognitive characteristics, while the inclusion of
place effects does not change the estimated associations. Second, the returns to cognitive skill
increase with age. Third, the effect on total incomes reflects a combination of positive impacts of
cognitive performance for both hourly wages and annual work hours. Fourth, the returns to
cognitive skill are greater for women than men and for blacks and Hispanics than for non-
Hispanic whites, with differential effects on work hours being more important than corresponding
changes in hourly wages. Fifth, the average gains in lifetime incomes predicted to result from
greater levels of cognitive performance are only slightly above those reported in prior studies but
the effects are heterogeneous, with larger relative and absolute increases, in most models, for
nonwhites or Hispanics than for non-Hispanic whites, and higher relative but not absolute returns
for women than men.

       We investigate how cognitive performance affects labor market outcomes over the lifecycle.

Cognitive skills may be influenced by endowments of what is sometimes termed “intelligence”

or IQ (see, e.g., the influential but controversial work of Herrnstein and Murray 1994) but

realized cognitive and non-cognitive skills result from a lengthy production process that includes

as inputs the aforementioned endowments but also environmental conditions that begin in utero

(e.g., Currie 2011; Persico, Figlio and Roth 2016) and continue in childhood through at least

secondary school (e.g., Heckman 2000; Heckman 2007). Differences in cognitive performance

are important. For example, Neal and Johnson (1996) found that heterogeneity in pre-labor

market cognitive skills explains all of the subsequent wage gap between black and white women

and around three-quarters of the corresponding differential between black and white men. 1 To

the extent that cognitive performance is affected by environmental conditions that are malleable,

policies that change such conditions may yield large benefits.

       Multiple difficulties arise when attempting to determine how improved cognitive

performance affects future labor market outcomes. First, when should cognitive skills be

measured? For some early interventions (e.g., policies affecting breastfeeding, infant nutrition, or

early childcare), it may be appropriate to evaluate cognitive performance at the time of school

entry, or even earlier. Such assessments may be incomplete or otherwise flawed, however, if

some of the initial benefits “fade away”, or if there are dynamic complementarities, such that

initial gains increase the marginal productivity of later investments (Cunha and Heckman, 2007).

Our strategy is to examine effects of cognitive performance measured between the ages of 16

and 23, reflecting skills before or shortly after labor market entry.

       Second, when should one assess labor market outcomes? Prior investigations have

frequently focused on the late twenties or early thirties (e.g., Salkever 1995; Neal and Johnson
1
    However, Lang and Manove (2011) raise concerns about this interpretation.


                                                        Page 1
1996), largely because of data availability. The age when labor market outcomes are evaluated

would not matter if returns to cognitive performance were constant across the lifecycle. However,

there are theoretical reasons why this is unlikely and our empirical analysis demonstrates that

cognitive skill premia increase with age. We therefore analyze effects from approximately

twenty to fifty years of age, and make additional assumptions to estimate returns through age 65.

     Third, the best measure of labor market performance is not obvious. Investigators have

previously focused on weekly earnings (e.g., Griliches and Mason 1972), annual incomes (e.g.,

Salkever 1995), and hourly wages (e.g., Neal and Johnson 1996). Wage rates are appealing to the

extent they indicate marginal labor productivity, although this requires strong assumptions (i.e.,

perfectly competitive spot labor markets). Work hours could reflect preferences for leisure

versus income that might be influenced by human capital investments that increase cognitive

performance. However, differences could also occur if institutional factors (e.g., wage floors or

involuntary unemployment), introduce divergences between desired and actual work hours. With

this in mind, we separately analyze cognitive performance effects on annual labor incomes and

work hours and hourly wage rates, as well as a measure of total (discounted) lifetime labor

income. 2

     Lifetime income is of special interest to the extent it provides relatively comprehensive

information about the benefits of cognitive skill investments and since it appears in a broad class

of policy discussions. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) considered

estimates of the changes in lifetime earnings in developing regulations of lead in drinking water

(Levin 1986) and emissions of lead and mercury (Environmental Protection Agency 1997; 2008;

2011). Academic researchers have similarly evaluated the health effects of fish consumption

2
  Throughout the paper, we use “annual income” to mean the sum of income from wage/salary/tips and income from
farm/own business. We also examine effects on “annual earnings”, defined as annual income less farm/own business
income. Details are provided below.


                                                     Page 2
using estimates of the effects of IQ on lifetime earnings (Rheinberger and Hammitt 2014;

Shimshack and Ward 2010). Lutter and Lutter (2012) argued that the present value of lifetime

earnings is the appropriate measure to value cognitive improvements related to breastfeeding.

     A well-known challenge in any effort to estimate the returns to cognitive performance is that

observed relationships need not reflect causal effects, since a constellation of other factors could

have independent confounding effects on labor market outcomes. Our analysis specifically

considers the role of two categories of variables that have received considerable attention since

most prior research examining the returns to cognitive skill was conducted: 1) non-cognitive

traits 3 (especially self-reported perceptions of control and self-esteem), which have been shown

to influence later life outcomes; and 2) geographic “place effects”, which play a role in

determining labor market performance and other measures of adult success.

     It is also important to emphasize what we are not attempting to do in this paper. First, it is

well beyond our scope to provide a full evaluation of the benefits of early life human capital

investments. As mentioned, a substantial literature emphasizes the role of non-cognitive traits in

determining adult outcomes. To the extent that policies improve both cognitive and non-

cognitive skills, analyses focusing only on cognitive performance are likely to underestimate

total benefits. Second, we do not investigate whether there are heterogeneous returns across

types of cognitive skills, although such differences may well exist and a full understanding of

them may be important for policy design.

     Our main data source is the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 cohort (NLSY79).

We also use information from the later 1997 cohort of the NLSY (NLSY97) and other data

sources. We measure cognitive performance at the ages of 16 to 23, from scores on the Armed


3
 We call these traits skills when the context implies that they are abilities that come, in part, from training or
practice.

Forces Qualification Test (AFQT). For labor market outcomes, we examine total labor market

incomes or earnings, annual work hours, and hourly wages at ages ranging between 20 and 50.

We also calculate lifetime-discounted labor incomes based on earnings reported through ages 48-

49 and estimated to age 65. Most of models control for a wide array of individual and family

background factors, a limited set of non-cognitive characteristics, as well as survey year fixed-

effects. Some models also include controls for geographic place effects or provide estimates for

population subgroups.

    The analysis reveals five main findings. First, cognitive performance is positively associated

with future labor market outcomes at all ages. The relationship is attenuated but not eliminated

by adding controls for non-cognitive traits, while the inclusion of place effects has no effect on

the estimates. Second, the return to cognitive skills rises with age. Third, the effect on labor

incomes reflects a combination of positive impacts on both hourly wages and annual work hours.

Fourth, the returns to cognitive performance are greater for females than males, and for blacks or

Hispanics than non-Hispanic whites, with differential effects on work hours being more

important than corresponding changes in hourly wage rates. Fifth, the average gains in lifetime

labor incomes predicted to result from higher levels of cognitive performance slightly higher

those obtained by prior studies, and reflect offsetting adjustments. Specifically, previous

estimates will tend to be understated because the effects of cognitive performance grow over the

lifecycle and prior research has typically focused on relatively younger individuals. On the other

hand, controlling for non-cognitive traits reduces the overall effect. In addition, previous

research has not emphasized the important heterogeneity of results by sex and race/ethnicity,

whereby the returns to cognitive performance are higher for nonwhites than whites and, in

percentage terms, for females than males.



                                                Page 4
I.      Conceptual Framework

      Annual labor incomes, hours worked and hourly wages at age t, Yt, are assumed to depend

on the stock of human capital, θt, according to:

(1)                                     𝑌𝑡 = 𝑔(𝜃𝑡 )

where 𝜕𝑔/𝜕𝜃 ≥ 0. The assumption that wages increase with human capital is straightforward, as

long as employees capture any of the gains to higher marginal labor products. For work hours,

and by inference annual earnings, the relationship is less automatic, but we assume and the

empirical analysis confirms that there is a positive effect. In principle, 𝜃 refers to all types of

human capital; however, we hereafter consider only one component—performance on cognitive

tests. This restriction is not problematic as long as the factors influencing cognitive performance

are similar to those affecting other types of human capital, like non-cognitive skills.

      Cunha and Heckman (2007) provide a simple model of skill formation:

(2)                             𝜃𝑡 = 𝑓(𝐼𝑡−1 , 𝜃𝑡−1 , 𝜅) + (1 − 𝜌)𝜃𝑡−1,

where I represents human capital investments during the previous period, κ are time-invariant

individual characteristics (e.g., endowments), and 𝜌 is the rate of human capital depreciation.

Recursively substituting into earlier ages yields:

(3)                                     𝜃𝑡 = 𝐹(𝑰, 𝜃0 , 𝜅, 𝜌, 𝑡),

where 𝜃0 is the “baseline” stock of human capital and 𝑰 = 𝐼0 , 𝐼1 , … 𝐼𝑡−1 represents the stream of

investments occurring since the baseline period. We do not observe these investments in our data

but assume that they are non-negatively related to baseline cognitive performance.

      Cunha and Heckman note that self-productivity arises if:

(4)                     𝜕𝜃𝑡 /𝜕𝜃𝑡−1 = 𝜕𝑓(𝐼𝑡−1 , 𝜃𝑡−1 , 𝜅)/𝜕𝜃𝑡−1 + (1 − 𝜌)𝜃𝑡−1 > 0,

and that there is dynamic complementarity if:



                                                  Page 5
(5)                             𝜕 2 𝑓(𝐼𝑡−1 , 𝜃𝑡−1 , 𝜅)/𝜕𝜃𝑡−1 𝜕𝐼𝑡−1 > 0.

Self-productivity implies that human capital grows with age and dynamic complementarity

means that the productivity of subsequent investments rises with the baseline stock of human

capital. Cunha and Heckman, focusing on skill development during childhood, show that these

imply that initial differences in human capital grow with age. We postulate that an analogous

process exists for adult workers.

      Substituting (3) into (1) gives:

(6)                             𝑌𝑡 = 𝑔(𝜃𝑡 ) = 𝑔(𝐹(𝑰, 𝜃0 , 𝜅, 𝜌, 𝑡)),

which shows how the dependent variables at age t are related to baseline human capital, 𝜃0 , as

well as (unobserved) endowments, subsequent investments and depreciation. A key point is that

self-productivity and dynamic complementarity imply that, ceteris paribus, initial productivity

differences (i.e., differences in baseline human capital) grow with age.

      Consider the most straightforward case of hourly wages. With competitive labor markets

and symmetric and complete information, employers will pay workers their marginal revenue

product. Normalizing human capital to be measured according to the labor market productivity it

produces, (6) can be simplified to:

(7)                             𝑌𝑡 = 𝜃𝑡 = 𝐹(𝑰, 𝜃0 , 𝜅, 𝜌, 𝑡).

However, when labor markets are not perfectly competitive or employers do not have perfect

information about worker productivity, the situation is more complicated.

      Altonji and Pierret (2001) and Lange (2007) emphasize that employers gradually learn about

worker productivity. In this case, the correlation between cognitive performance and wages (the

outcome they examine) is likely initially to be quite low. However, as individuals gain

experience, employers learn about their true productivity, so that the association between



                                                  Page 6
productivity and wages strengthens. In the context of the model described above, this provides an

additional reason, beyond self-productivity or dynamic complementarity, why the labor market

consequences of baseline differences in cognitive performance are likely to increase with age.

     The situation for work hours is more complicated. With a completely flexible labor market,

it is not clear why baseline or subsequent levels of cognitive performance should be related to

hours worked, although a positive association might occur if, for instance, persons with high

marginal utilities of income (relative to leisure) tend also to invest heavily in human capital.

Holding underlying preferences constant, institutional factors may cause individuals with lower

levels of cognitive performance to work relatively few hours. For example, minimum wages and

other rigidities might prevent wages from falling to the level where labor supply and demand

clear for such individuals. Similarly, the availability of transfer payments or alternative sources

of financial support (including from other household members) might raise the reservation wages

of less skilled workers, resulting in relatively low work hours. More generally, a substantial

literature (e.g., Kahn and Lang 1992), suggests that many workers face constraints on hours

worked, most commonly resulting in actual work hours being less than preferred levels. For all

of these reasons, we hypothesize that high cognitive skill individuals will work more hours than

their less skilled counterparts at any point in time, and that differential is likely to increase with

age. Notice, also, that this implies that cognitive performance related differences in labor market

experience (i.e. total lifetime work hours) are also likely to rise with age, providing another

reason why the effects of initial differences in cognitive skills may grow over the lifecycle. 4




4 The relationship between baseline cognitive performance and total experience is actually more complicated. If
highly skilled individuals also obtain relatively high levels of education (i.e. stay in school until later ages) they may
initially have lower levels of total labor market experience but will gradually make up for this through their higher
annual work hours and, at older ages, are likely to have worked more lifetime hours.

II.      Lessons from Prior Research

      For a decade or so after the publication of Herrnstein and Murray’s (1994) influential book

The Bell Curve, there was a flurry of research examining how cognitive performance, often

referred to as IQ, influences a variety of labor market (and sometimes other) outcomes

(Heckman 1995; Murnane, Willett and Levy 1995; Neal and Johnson 1996; Ceci and Williams

1997; Murnane, et al. 2001). 5 There are many controversies surrounding this work, including the

heritability of genetic endowments and the extent to which “intelligence” can be characterized by

a single measure. 6 We largely sidestep these issues, noting that cognitive performance as

measured by test scores almost certainly reflects a combination of endowments and

environmental influences, and instead focus on the relationship between cognitive performance

at 16-23 years of age and adult labor market outcomes. 7

      As mentioned, assessments of the effects of cognitive skills on economic outcomes over the

lifecycle are valuable in a variety of contexts, perhaps most importantly, for the evaluation of the

benefits of government policies and interventions (e.g., Levin 1986; Schwartz 1994; Salkever

1995; Environmental Protection Agency 1997; 2008; 2011; Karoly, Kilburn and Cannon 2005).

Most of the prior research has, however, at least three shortcomings. First, as highlighted above,

the returns to cognitive skill are likely to increase with age, implying that estimates obtained

from investigations focusing on relatively young individuals (such as Salkever 1995; and Neal


5
  More limited related earlier research predated Herrnstein and Murray (e.g., Kiker and Condon 1981; Bound,
Griliches and Hall 1986).
6
  For instance, Heckman (1995), in his detailed review of Herrnstein and Murray’s book noted that “by no means is
there agreement in the psychometric literature that one [latent ability] factor is sufficient to ‘explain’ the data, or that
there is just one type of intelligence” (p. 1095). He also notes that measures of IQ indeed predict productivity but
with R2 values much less than one, and that heritability explains 40-80 percent of within-group variability in
measures of IQ. For further discussion and evidence, see Cawley et al. (1997).
7 Neal and Johnson (1996) similarly interpret the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) scores, which we also
use, as a measure of basic “skills” rather than innate intelligence. As further evidence of the malleability of cognitive
test scores, Flynn (1987, 2000), highlighted the importance of environmental determinants of IQ by noting gains of
roughly three IQ points per decade in different populations around the world.


                                                           Page 8
and Johnson 1996) are likely to understate lifetime benefits. Specifically, Altonji and Pierret

(2001), as well as Lange (2007), show that the wage gains associated with higher AFQT scores

increase with experience, and Ganzach (2011) similarly uncovers a substantial positive age-wage

gradient in the effects of cognitive performance. 8 However, the upper age in all of these studies

is fairly low (the middle to late thirties), limiting generalizability of the results and, with the

exception of Ganzach (2011), estimating the effects of cognitive skill was not the primary

research question. 9

     Zax and Rees (2002) provide a rare counterexample of research focusing on changes over

lifecycle in the returns to cognitive skill. They use data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study

to examine how scores on the Henmon-Nelson Test of Mental Ability at age 17 are related to

earnings at the 35 and 53, after controlling for individual factors and characteristics of

respondents’ communities, schools, peers and friends. They find that cognitive skill effects are

overstated when potential confounding factors are insufficiently controlled for and that the

estimated impact is almost twice as large at age 53 as at 35. However, their sample is not

representative, being restricted to around 3,000 (disproportionately white) males who were

seniors in Wisconsin high schools in 1957, and this cohort faced a very different labor market

than people born later. A more general limitation of all of these studies is that it is not possible to

separately identify age, time and cohort effects (e.g., Hall, Mairesse and Turner 2007), since only

single cohorts were examined.

     A second issue is that the earlier work does not account for non-cognitive characteristics,

which have demonstrated importance in determining labor market outcomes. For example, using


8 Ganzach’s analysis is restricted to persons with exactly 12 years of schooling, which is likely to omit that portion
of the cognitive performance effect that operates through increases in educational attainment.
9 Altonji and Pierret (2001) and Lange (2007) are primarily interested in understanding the process by which
employers learn about the productivity of their employees.


                                                         Page 9
NLSY79 data (but with outcomes measured only to around age 30), Heckman, Stixrud and

Urzua (2006) indicate that non-cognitive traits are at least as important as cognitive skills in

determining measures of economic success, such as wages, education and choice of

occupation. 10 Analyzing three different data sets, Cunha, Karahan and Soares (2011) emphasize

the importance of both cognitive and non-cognitive skills. Interestingly, they find that the returns

to non-cognitive characteristics remained fairly constant across time periods, while returns to

cognitive skills vary in ways consistent with patterns of education-related wage premia. 11 To the

extent that the same processes affecting cognitive performance determine non-cognitive

characteristics, estimated effects of the former are likely to be overestimated in models

containing inadequate controls for the latter. 12

     Third, there is increasing evidence that a wide variety of adult outcomes are partially

determined by geographic “place effects”. In this vein, Chetty, Hendren and Katz (2016) show

that moving to lower poverty areas at young ages (13 or earlier) is associated with increased

college education and earnings, along with reductions in rates of single parenthood. Chetty et al.

(2016) find that the deleterious effect of low incomes on life expectancy varies substantially

across geographic areas. Zax and Rees (2002), indicate that the estimated earnings effects of

cognitive skill are attenuated by around one-third with the additional of controls for community,

school and peer characteristics.

     Our investigation attempts to make progress along all of these dimensions. We examine

three types of outcomes – annual labor incomes, annual work hours and hourly wages –


10 Non-cognitive traits are proxied by scores on the Rotter Locus of Control and Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scales.
11 Using one of their data sets, the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, Cunha et al., follow individuals through age
55; however, the sample is quite restricted – being limited to white males with exactly 12 years of education or who
are college graduates.
12 Borghans et al. (2008) discuss how personality traits and related issues in psychology can be incorporated into
economic models.


                                                       Page 10
providing important information on the sources of cognitive performance differentials in labor

market outcomes. By using NLSY79 data through 2012, we have (in the absence of attrition or

nonresponse), data for all respondents from 22 through 48 years of age, supplying information on

the evolution of cognitive performance effects over much of the lifecycle. We include an

unusually comprehensive set of controls for individual and family characteristics, as well as

several non-cognitive traits. We also provide a limited comparison of the age-AFQT gradients

using data for the NLSY97 cohort, which surveyed individuals born approximately 20 years after

our main sample. The results suggest that our primary findings reflect true age variations in the

returns to cognitive skill, rather than a confounding of age with period effects. We use two

methods to control for place effects, and determine that these are not of key importance for our

analysis. Finally, we split the entire NLSY79 cohort into younger and older individuals and find

that effects for persons for whom the AFQT tests were administered before age 19 (and so where

scores are less likely to be determined by subsequent labor market or educational experiences),

are modestly larger than for the full sample.



III.      Empirical Methods

       We use straightforward econometric methods. The basic regression specification is:

(8)                             𝑌𝑖𝑡 = 𝛼 + 𝛽1 𝑋𝑖 + 𝛽2 𝑍𝑖𝑡 + 𝛾𝐴𝐹𝑄𝑇𝑖 + 𝜇𝑖𝑡 ,

where Yit is the labor market for individual i at age t, X is a vector of age-invariant covariates, Z

are age-varying regressors, AFQT is our measure of cognitive performance, and µ is an error

term. The estimated return on cognitive performance is 𝛾� . One condition required for this to be

an unbiased estimate is that AFQT scores are uncorrelated with the error term, after conditioning

on the other regressors. More extensive controls reduce the potential for omitted variables bias,



                                                Page 11
but the regression will be “over-conditioned” if these covariates are caused by cognitive

performance. Thus, for example, we will not include the completed level of education in most of

specifications, since this is likely to be strongly influenced by prior cognitive performance.

However, we briefly discuss how the results change when schooling is controlled for. All

specifications with supplementary covariates (other than AFQT scores) also include survey year

dummy variables, to account for year-specific effects. Some models also contain vectors of

county characteristics or fixed-effects. Robust standard errors are shown in parentheses in the

tables.

     When the outcomes are annual incomes, earnings or work hours, we include observations

with zero values in our sample and convert the estimated effects to percentage changes as

𝛾�⁄𝑌� × 100, where 𝑌� is the mean value of the dependent variable. 13 For hourly wages, we

estimate log-linear models, using positive wage observations only and interpret the coefficients

directly as percentage changes. 14 We also estimate wage models corresponding to those used for

incomes, earnings and work hours to make sure that differences in estimated cognitive skill

effects are not sensitive to this choice. We then use the age-specific estimates to examine how

cognitive performance affects the net present value of discounted lifetime earnings. The

procedures for doing so are detailed below.




13
   Alternatives include estimating two-part or Tobit models; however, the interpretation of the age profiles of effects
would be less transparent.
14 Since the estimates of the AFQT effects on wages are small, coefficients from the log wage regressions can
directly be interpreted as percentage changes with little loss of accuracy.

IV.      Data and Measures

      Our primary data source, the NLSY79, sampled individuals born between 1957 and 1964,

who were between the ages of 14 and 21 on December 31, 1978. 15 Interviews were conducted

annually through 1994 and biennially since then, with data used here through 2012. The initial

survey contained a nationally representative sample of 6,111 respondents and supplemental

samples of 2,172 blacks, 1,480 Hispanics/Latinos, 1,643 poor whites (non-black/non-Hispanics)

and 1,280 military respondents. Most of the military sample was dropped in 1984, as was the

entire economically disadvantaged white sample in 1990. We restrict our analysis to the

representative sample, except for our investigation of race/ethnicity disparities, where we include

the black and Hispanic oversamples.

      Surveys were not conducted in odd years after 1993. Therefore, to maintain consistency over

time, we analyze data for even numbered survey years between 1980 and 2012, and evaluate

effects at two-year age intervals, with the lower of the two years referred to for brevity. Thus, for

example, references to “28” year olds actually refer to 28 and 29 year-old respondents. We use

data from multiple survey waves to obtain values of age-specific variables. For instance, data on

28 year olds comes from the 1986, 1988, 1990 and 1992 surveys.

      In the absence of sample attrition, we would have information available for all 22 through

48 year olds, as well as for some (but not all) 16-20 and 50-54 year olds. 16 Wave-to-wave

attrition or nonresponse rates were modest but the lengthy time period does imply a non-trivial

loss of respondents. For example, 4,580 (74.9%) of the 6,111 individuals in the original

representative sample provided information at age 48. We examine below whether selective

attrition raises concern.
15
  Information on the NLSY79 is available at http://www.bls.gov/nls/nlsy79.htm).
16
  In 1980, the oldest respondents were 23 years old – and so placed into the 22-23 year old age group – while the
youngest were 16. In 2012, these individuals were 48 and 55 years old, respectively.


                                                      Page 13
     Our measure of cognitive performance is based on the 2006 renormed version of the Armed

Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) score. AFQT scores are calculated using information from

four of the ten Armed Services Vocation Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) of tests – word knowledge,

paragraph comprehension, math knowledge and arithmetic reasoning – which were completed by

94% of the original (1979) sample in 1980. 17 The 2006 version renormed the scores to control

for age (in three-month groups) and expressed them in percentiles. 18 We convert these to

standardized Z-scores by assuming that the underlying test score distribution was standard

normal. 19 For convenience, we multiply the Z-scores by 10, so that a one unit change

corresponds to a 0.1 standard deviation change in AFQT. A potential issue is that respondents

could be as old as 23 at the time the AFQT test was taken, raising the possibility that scores

reflect early labor market as well as pre-labor market experiences. As a robustness check, we

estimated models for a “young sample” where all respondents were born after 1961 (and so were

18 or younger when taking the test). The results obtained when doing are similar but slightly

larger to the main estimates that included individuals born slightly earlier, as detailed below.

     We evaluate five outcomes: annual labor incomes, earnings or work hours, hourly wages,

and “lifetime” discounted labor incomes through age 65. We express amounts throughout in

2014 dollars, using the Consumer Price Index to adjust for price changes. Annual earnings

include wages, salaries and tips; annual labor income adds in farm and self-employment



17
   The other ASVAB tests measure knowledge and skill related to general science, numerical operations, coding
speed, auto and shop information, mechanical comprehension and electronics information.
18 NLSY79 has three versions of AFQT scores. The earliest used numerical operations instead of mathematical
knowledge to compute the final score. The second, used widely in previous literature (e.g., Neal and Johnson 1996),
was not age-adjusted. However, Neal and Johnson show that an additional year of schooling increases a
respondent’s AFQT raw score by 2 to 4 percentage points. For this reason, we use the age-normed third version of
the AFQT score. Information on construction of age-adjusted AFQT percentile scores is available at:
https://www.nlsinfo.org/content/cohorts/nlsy79/topical-guide/education/aptitude-achievement-intelligence-scores.
19
   AFQT percentile scores range between 0 and 100. For the conversion to Z-scores we winsorize percentile values
less than 0.25% and greater than 99.75%.


                                                      Page 14
income. 20 We construct annual hours worked using the NLSY79’s weekly work history data. An

issue is that some respondents do not report hours worked in some weeks. If data were missing

for no more than 10 percent of weeks, we extrapolate using information for weeks that hours

were available. If hours were missing in more than 10 percent of weeks, we treat hours as a

missing variable. We also do so if reported annual hours worked exceeded 5,200, assuming that

these values were erroneous.

     Our primary wage variable uses information provided in the NLSY for the main job held in

the week prior to the survey, sometimes referred to as the “CPS job”, with reported wage rates

below $1 or above than $1,000 per hour treated as missing values. We test the robustness of the

results to a different hourly wage variable calculated as total earnings for the specified year

divided by annual hours worked. 21

     Finally, we calculate lifetime incomes starting at age 20 and continuing through 65. We use

data through the 2012 wave, at which point the youngest respondents are 48 years old. For older

ages, we use average of incomes at ages 46-47 and 48-49 as the projected income received up

through age 65. We then discount the net present value, in 2014 dollars, to the year of the

respondent’s birth, using a three percent annual real discount rate in our main estimates, but

sometimes also using five and seven percent discount rates. We assume that incomes in odd

numbered years are in the same as in the preceding even numbered year and interpolated values

for up to three missing survey waves. When income information is missing for more than three

waves, or at either age 22 or 48, we do not calculate lifetime earnings.
20
   We do not include in these measures transfer payments, such as the earned income tax credit, unemployment
insurance benefits, or the federal Temporary Assistance to Needy Families.
21
   Wages based on the work history data cover the entire year, rather than just a single week, but are more likely to
be measured with error because of long recall period. Difficulties are also introduced where there are missing data
for some weeks or if there are errors in reports of either annual earnings or work hours. Previous research (Duncan
and Hill, 1985; Ruhm 1997) provides some indication that work hours may be overstated using the work history data,
which should be noted in our evaluation of annual hours, and will also cause hourly wages calculated using the work
history data, to be understated.


                                                      Page 15
      These estimates of lifetime incomes refer to NLSY respondents born in the late 1950s or

early 1960s. To provide calculations of the hypothetical lifetime incomes for persons born more

recently, in 2014, we inflate the aforementioned estimates by 65 percent, which represents the

growth in average annual real labor incomes of 20-65 year olds occurring between 1961 (the

median year of birth for NLSY79 respondents) and 2014, as measured using data from the 1962

and 2015 March Current Population Surveys. 22

      Table 1 provides summary information on the dependent variables at two ages, 28 and 48, as

well as the net present value of lifetime incomes through 48 (the last age for which we directly

observe income data) and 65 (the lifetime income variable examined below), calculated using a

three percent real discount rate. Annual incomes are just shy of $32,000 for 28 year olds and rise

to over $51,000 20 years later, with almost all (between 96% and 97%) income derived from

earnings. Hourly wages rise more than 30 percent over the two decades; annual work hours grow

by a much smaller 4 percent. 23 Discounted lifetime incomes average over $550,000 through age

65.

      In addition to AFQT scores, most models include three types of supplementary covariates.

The first are individual or family characteristics measured in early in life (and age-invariant in

our data) that may cause or be correlated with cognitive performance. These include: gender,

race/ethnicity (black or Hispanic versus non-black non-Hispanic), magazines, library cards and

newspapers in home at age 14 (3 dummy variables), urban residence at 14, whether or not the

respondent and respondent’s mother and father are foreign born (3 variables), mother and

father’s education (< high school graduate, some college, college graduate vs. high school

22  Mean annual incomes, in 2014 dollars, grew from $22,999 in 1961 to $37,920 in 2014. These estimates are
illustrative only rather than precise since they make several assumptions including that AFQT effects on earnings
have not changed over time and that a common inflation factor is correct for all race-sex groups.
23
   The table shows wages based on the CPS job which are higher than those obtained using the work history data, as
expected given previously discussed evidence that annual hours may be overstated.


                                                      Page 16
graduate), number of siblings (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ≥5, missing), and number older siblings (0, 1, 2, 3, ≥4,

missing). 24 We sometimes refer to these as “cross-round” variables.

     The second set of regressors includes age-varying characteristics such as: marital status

(currently married, divorced/separated widowed vs. never married), urban residence, census

region (north central, south, west vs. northeast), and survey-year dummy variables. Although

many of these covariates are potentially endogenous (i.e., affected by prior cognitive

performance) we include them in our preferred models under the belief that they are likely to

strongly influence labor market outcomes while being only weakly determined by AFQT scores.

However, we also provide evidence that our main results are robust to excluding these variables.

     Third, we control for non-cognitive characteristics, reflecting prior evidence (e.g., Heckman

and Rubinstein 2001; Heckman et al. 2006; Borghans et al. 2008) that they affect future

outcomes and could be correlated with cognitive performance. Specifically, we include scores

from the Rotter Locus of Control scale, designed to measure perceived control over one’s own

life, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem scale, indicating self-assessed self-esteem, and a sociability

variable measuring self-assessments of the degree to which the respondent is shy or outgoing.

The Rotter and Rosenberg scales were measured in 1979 and 1980. Sociability was assessed in

1985 but refers to personality at age 6. 25 Summary statistics for the cross-round and non-

cognitive variables are provided in Appendix Table A.1; those on the age-varying characteristics,


24
   Where the number of siblings or older siblings is missing, we put in the mean values for these variables and then
create a missing value dummy variable. We also estimated models that controlled for mother’s age at birth but do
not include them in our primary specifications because the quality of this variable is low and its inclusion did not
affect our results. In addition, we estimated models with height (in inches) included, without changes in our
estimates.
25
   The Rotter score was reverse coded so that higher scores indicate greater self-control. The Rotter and Rosenberg
scores were age-adjusted by regressing the raw scores on age in months and its square and then normalizing the
residuals to have mean of zero and standard deviation of one. Values on the sociability scale ranged between one
(extremely shy) and four (extremely outgoing). Since the sociability score could have non-monotonic effects on
labor market outcomes, we include a full set of categorical variables in our regression models. For missing values of
the Rotter or Rosenberg scores, we code a value of zero and then create a missing value dummy variable.


                                                       Page 17
at ages 28 and 48, are displayed in Appendix Table A.2. Appendix Table B.1 provides additional

details on the construction of some variables.

     Fourth, we use two strategies to examine whether the estimated effects of cognitive

performance change when controlling for geographic factors. The first includes county-level

characteristics similar to those documented to be important by Chetty and Hendren (2015).

Specifically, we collect county measures for: population density, fraction of black residents,

share of families in poverty, income per capita, fraction of children living with two parents,

educational attainment among adults, Gini coefficient, and violent (murder, rape, robbery and

assault) and property (burglary, larceny and auto-theft) crime rates. In principle, we would like

these variables to cover the period of the respondents’ childhood. In practice, we are somewhat

constrained by data availability and so use information from the decade of the 1970s, when the

NLSY79 individuals were in their teens or younger. These data come from various sources and

years (see Appendix Table A.3). For some respondents, the full set of county level statistics is

not available. Missing data are mainly related to county crime statistics. We drop these

observations from the models that include county characteristics, resulting in a sample size

decrease of around five percent. 26 Our results do not appear to be sensitive to these exclusions.

     As an alternative, we estimated specifications with county fixed-effects. This generally

provides a more comprehensive method of controlling for geographic factors, but with a loss of

precision for counties with few sample members. For purposes of identification, we restrict this

portion of the analysis to persons residing in counties containing five or more survey respondents,




26 For example, in the lifetime income specifications, restricting the sample to respondents with a full set of county
level measures reduces the sample size from 3,950 to 3,740.


                                                        Page 18
reducing sample sizes by about twelve percent. 27 We only observe respondents’ county at age 14

and treat this as the county of residence during childhood.

     A final set of estimates compares results for the NLSY79 cohort to those obtained using the

more recent NLSY97 data, which sampled persons aged 12-16 in 1996. 28 Doing so introduces

several complications. Most importantly, since the information collected for the two cohorts is

not identical, we select a somewhat restricted set of control variables that are consistent across

surveys. These include: sex, race/ethnicity (black, Hispanic, non-black, non-Hispanic), foreign

born, urban residence (at age 14 for the NLSY79 and 12 for NSLY97), foreign language spoken

at home, parents’ education (<high school, high school, some college, college, missing), parents’

foreign born, number of siblings (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5+, missing). We also include age-varying

controls for: residence (urban, rural, missing), region (northeast, north-central, south, west,

missing), and marital status (never married, married and spouse present, other, missing). The

non-cognitive variables are unavailable for the NLSY97 cohort and so are excluded from these

estimates. The age range of the NLSY97 is also obviously more restricted. We have data through

2013, with the youngest respondents being 29 years old at that time. Therefore, we compare

AFQT effects of the two cohorts for the age range 20 through 29, using annual (rather than

biennial) surveys. 29 Table A.3 provides descriptive statistics for the cross-round variables

included when comparing NLSY79 and NLSY97 results.




27 For example, in the lifetime income specifications, the sample size falls from 3,950 to 3,475.
28 See http://www.bls.gov/nls/nlsy97.htm for further information on the NLSY97 survey.
29 This is feasible because the NLSY79 did not switch to biennial surveys until after 1994, at which point all
respondents were older than 29.


                                                       Page 19
V.      Annual Labor Income

     We begin our empirical examination by investigating how cognitive performance is related

to annual labor income at specific ages. We start with parsimonious specifications and then add

more comprehensive sets of controls. We use figures to show the full age-profile of estimated

cognitive performance effects and provide additional details for specified ages (generally 28, 38

and 48) in tables. The first model includes only AFQT scores. The second adds the cross-round

family and individual background characteristics, as well as survey year fixed-effects. The third

also incorporates age-varying covariates and the last includes controls for non-cognitive traits.

Figure 1 shows point estimates for all ages between 20 and 50. Table 2 supplies point estimates

and robust standard errors at 10-year age intervals beginning at 28.

     Two patterns are noteworthy. First, in all specifications, the income effects predicted by

higher cognitive performance are positive and grow with age, rapidly during the early 20’s and

more slowly but almost monotonically thereafter, with no evidence of any reversal before at least

age 50. Second, the estimated AFQT premia decline with more comprehensive controls,

confirming the expectations that: 1) cognitive performance is related to and probably at least

partially caused by environmental characteristics at young ages; and 2) both cognitive

performance and non-cognitive traits are likely to have substantial effects on future incomes. In

our preferred specification, which includes the most comprehensive set of controls, a 0.1

standard deviation increase in cognitive performance is estimated to raise annual incomes by

1.7%, 2.4% and 2.6% at ages 28, 38 and 48, with standard errors of 0.1% to 0.2%. These

predicted effects are approximately one-third smaller than when AFQT is the only independent

variable and with an attenuation of 10% or more occurring when the non-cognitive variables are




                                               Page 20
added (model 4 versus model 3). This suggests that the payoff to cognitive performance

increases with age but is overestimated when confounding factors are inadequately controlled for.

     Next we test the robustness of these results to changes in the choice of samples. Figure 2

repeats the findings for the nationally representative sample and adds estimates for a “balanced”

sample, consisting of respondents for whom income data are available at age 48, as for a “full

sample” that includes the supplemental oversamples of blacks and Hispanics. 30 The “balanced”

sample estimates are virtually identical to those obtained from our main specification, indicating

that selective attrition is not an issue. Conversely, the returns to cognitive performance increase

with the inclusion of the minority oversamples, providing a first indication of greater gains from

cognitive skill for blacks or Hispanics than for non-Hispanic whites: a one tenth of a standard

deviation increase in AFQT scores raises predicted incomes of the full sample by 2.0%, 2.7%

and 3.1% at ages 28, 38 and 48, compared to 1.7%, 2.4% and 2.6% for the nationally

representative sample.

     The inclusion of place effects has essentially no impact on the estimates. This is shown in

Table 3, where columns (1a) and (1b) limit the sample to observations where the full set of data

on county characteristics are available and models (2a) and (2b) to persons in counties with at

least five observations, permitting the inclusion of county fixed-effects. The estimates with place

effects, (1b) and (2b), are virtually the same as those without, (1a) and (2a), and very similar to

the main results containing slightly larger samples. For this reason, we exclude geographic place

characteristics from the remainder of the analysis.




30
  A true balanced sample would include respondents providing income data in all survey waves. What we refer to a
balanced sample is more actually one with information provided in at least some (but possibly not all) surveys
waves through that age. We choose 48 because this is the oldest at which all respondents are age-eligible to provide
data.


                                                      Page 21
    We next estimate models for 20-29 year olds using common specifications and controls

using data from the NLSY79 and NLSY97 cohorts. The results, summarized in Figure 3, suggest

that the returns to cognitive performance are extremely similar across the two cohorts across all

of the ages studied, with some possibility of a (statistically insignificantly) higher return for

NLSY97 respondents. For example, at age 28, the point estimate (standard error) of the increased

income associated with a 0.1 standard deviation rise in AFQT scores was 2.0 (0.2) percent for

the later cohort versus 1.7 (0.1) percent for the earlier one.

    Substantially larger increases over time in age-specific AFQT effects would have suggested

either that: 1) the returns to cognitive performance had risen for all workers (e.g., because of

general effects of the computer use in the labor market) or 2) that the returns to cognitive

achievement may have increased more for the later than the earlier cohort (e.g., because

computers raised the returns to cognitive skill for current younger but not older workers). The

first possibility would have suggested that our main specifications (for the NLSY79 cohort) may

have overstated age gradients in AFQT effects– because some of what was attributed to age

would actually have been due to secular changes in the returns to cognitive skill. However, the

similarity of results obtained for common ages across the two cohorts suggest that the age-

profiles in our main analysis are unlikely to be seriously biased by either cohort or time effects.

    AFQT scores are measured in 1980, at which point NLSY79 respondents were between 16

and 23 years old. Since many of the older sample members are likely to have entered the labor

market or post-secondary schooling by this point, measured cognitive performance could reflect

the combined influences of pre-labor market and these later experiences. We examine the

potential importance of this by estimating separate models for subsamples stratified by whether

individuals were born in 1961 or earlier (and so >18 at the time of testing) or 1962 or later (and



                                                Page 22
so ≤18 when tested). Results of these estimates, summarized on Appendix Table B.2, suggest

that there were marginally (and statistically insignificantly) higher returns for those tested at

younger ages. To the extent this group provides the more conceptually appropriate estimates, our

main results may slightly understate the returns to cognitive skill.



VI.     Other Labor Market Outcomes

      We next examine cognitive performance effects on annual earnings (which exclude income

from farming or self-employment), hourly wages and annual work hours. The results of our

preferred specification, which includes background, age-varying and non-cognitive skill

covariates are summarized in Table 4 and Figure 4, with estimates for total labor market incomes

also repeated for purposes of comparison.

      Cognitive performance has virtually identical predicted effects on future annual incomes and

earnings, which is unsurprising since the latter account for over 95% of the former. At most ages,

between two-thirds and three-quarters of the estimated AFQT impact on income operates

through hourly wages, with the remainder reflecting differences in annual work hours. We do not

know the reasons for these relative contributions, although wages are often taken as an indication

of labor productivity and hours as a reflection of tastes for leisure or of labor market constraints.

The age-related AFQT gradient is much flatter for work hours, where there is essentially no trend

after age 32, than for wages, where the returns to cognitive skill rise at least through the mid-40s.

      Our main specifications include log hourly wages on the CPS reference week job. We also

separately estimate models with hourly wages calculated as annual earnings divided by annual

hours worked. These provided similar predicted cognitive performance effects, although possibly




                                                Page 23
with slightly lower returns at older ages (see Appendix Figure B.2a). 31 We estimate the main

wage effects directly from the semi-log equations, with zero values excluded. Conversely, for

annual incomes and work hours, percent changes were predicted from linear models that

included zeros, with the regression coefficient then divided by the dependent variable mean (and

converted to percentages). To insure that the results were not driven by this difference in

procedures, wage effects were also estimated using the same method as for incomes and work

hours, which yielded very similar patterns to the main models (see Appendix Figure B.2b). 32



VII.     Subgroup Differences

       The effects of cognitive performance on adult labor market outcomes vary by sex and

race/ethnicity, with larger relative (and often absolute) effects for females than males and

minorities than non-Hispanic whites.

       Gender effects are summarized in Figure 5 and Table 5. The predicted cognitive skill effect

on income is universally larger for women than men, although the differences are not always

statistically significant, with particularly pronounced gaps at young ages. For example, a 0.1

standard deviation increase in AFQT scores raises predicted male incomes by 1.0% at age 28

versus 2.9% for women, both with a standard error of 0.2%. By 38 the differential is half as large

(1.9% vs. 2.8%) and by 48 it has narrowed further (2.2% vs. 2.9%).



31
   The estimated AFQT effects are very similar using either method prior to age 38 and possibly slightly (but
insignificantly) higher between 38 and 48 when based on reference week wages (see Appendix Figure B.2a). The
largest disparity occurred at age 42, where the estimated cognitive skill effect was 1.40 percent using the alternative
wage variable and 1.85 percent based on CPS job wages, with standard errors of 0.14 percent and 0.13 percent.
32
   The AFQT wage effects may be marginally but insignificantly higher when using the alternative estimation
strategy. The largest difference was at age 46, where direct estimates from the log wage equations indicate that a 0.1
standard deviation increase in AFQT scores raised hourly wages by 1.82 percent, with a standard error of 0.13
percent while, using the alternative method, the estimated wage increase was 2.17 percent, with a standard error of
0.23 percent. We also obtain very robust results for wages and work hours in models that added controls for county
characteristics or county fixed-effects.


                                                        Page 24
     These gender differences in income effects are largely not driven by differences in impacts

on predicted hourly wages, where the predicted impact of cognitive performance is marginally

(insignificantly) higher for women than men, except at older ages where there is no difference

(Figure 5b). For instance, a 0.1 standard deviation rise in AFQT scores predicts 1.1 percent, 1.4

percent and 1.7 percent wage increases for 28, 38 and 48 year old men, compared to 1.5 percent,

1.8 percent and 1.9 percent wage premia for corresponding women.

     Instead, the larger returns of cognitive performance for women than men largely operate

through work hours, particularly during the middle twenties through middle thirties (Figure 5c).

The largest gender gap occurs at age 24, where the 0.1 standard deviation rise in AFQT predicts

a 1.3 percent increase women’s annual hours versus a 0.1 percent reduction for men. The

differences remain statistically significant through age 40, but fall considerably in size (e.g., to

0.8 percent versus 0.4 percent for 44 year olds) beginning in the early thirties.

     Larger AFQT effects on work hours but not wages could reflect greater overall wage

elasticities of labor supply for women than men; however, this would not explain why gender

differences in the effects on hours are particularly concentrated during the middle 20s through

late 30s. This might occur because women with high levels of cognitive skill are more likely to

delay childbearing, and the associated reductions in labor supply, into these ages. We found

some support in the data for this possibility. Specifically, we constructed age-profiles of

estimated AFQT effects on the probability that women had infants or young (less than 3 or 6

year old) children in the household, using specifications similar to those above. These indicated

that the likelihood of having infants or young children at home decreased with AFQT scores

prior to age 30 but with no difference at later ages (Figure A.1). 33


33
  For example, at age 26, a 0.1 standard deviation increase in AFQT reduced the likelihood of have a child younger
than three (six) by 0.4 (0.7) percentage points. We also estimate work hours models with the inclusion of additional


                                                       Page 25
     We present race/ethnicity differences in Figure 6 and Table 6. For these specifications, we

use the full NLSY79, including the supplemental samples of non-Hispanic blacks (hereafter

simply referred to as blacks) and Hispanics, to increase the sample sizes. Effects of cognitive

performance on total labor market incomes are largest for blacks and smallest for non-Hispanic

whites (hereafter just whites), as shown in Figure 6a. At age 28, a 0.1 standard deviation rise in

AFQT predicts a 1.4 percent increase in white labor market incomes, compared to 2.4 percent for

Hispanics and 3.0 percent for blacks. These differences remain pronounced throughout the

lifecycle, except that the gap for blacks versus Hispanics falls at older ages.

     The overall race/ethnicity differences are again dominated by heterogeneity in effects on

work hours, rather than hourly wages, which peak in the early thirties (Figures 6b and 6c). For

example, a 0.1 standard deviation increase in cognitive skill predicts a 0.5 percent increase in

annual work hours for 32-year-old whites versus 1.5 percent and 1.8 percent for Hispanics and

blacks. We suspect this occurs because minorities are more constrained (than whites) in being

able to work their desired number of hours, particularly at relatively low levels of cognitive

performance. It is not clear why these differences should peak around the early thirties, although

a possibility is that hours constraints become less binding after this age for all workers.



VIII.    Lifetime Income

     Finally, we estimate how cognitive performance affects “lifetime” labor incomes, from ages

20 through age 65, expressed in 2014 dollars. Our main calculations assume a three percent real

discount rate, are expressed in 2014 dollars, and are discounted to the birth year. Table 7

summarizes the results, again showing estimated effects of a 0.1 standard deviation increase in


controls for the number of children in the household and an indicator for presence of a child under the age of three.
Doing so reduces but does not completely eliminate the gender gap in predicted AFQT score effects (Figure B.3).


                                                        Page 26
AFQT scores, with robust standard errors displayed in parentheses. We also show the lifetime

effects predicted for individuals born in 2014 (rather than for births involving the 1979 cohort),

estimated by accounting for the growth in real labor incomes occurring between the median birth

year of birth for NLSY79 respondents (1961) and 2014.

     A 0.1 standard deviation increase in AFQT is associated with a rise of 2.15 percent, or

$11,846, in lifetime income through 65 for the average NLSY79 respondent, which translates

into an increase of $19,545 for an infant born in 2014. The predicted effect is somewhat larger in

absolute terms for men than women ($20,724 versus $16,778 for 2014 births) but since women

earn less than men, the percentage growth is substantially larger for females (2.62 percent versus

1.71 percent).

     Strikingly, the income gains associated with cognitive skill are higher in both relative and

absolute terms for blacks and Hispanics than for whites in most specifications. A 0.1 standard

deviation increase in AFQT scores is predicted to raise the lifetime earnings of blacks and

Hispanics by 3.59 percent and 3.13 percent, compared to 1.92 percent for whites, which

translates into dollar increases of $21,626, $23,117 and $18,635 for 2014 births. 34

     We also estimate effects on lifetime earnings using five and seven percent (rather than three

percent) real discount rates (see Appendix Tables A.5 and A.6). Higher discount rates imply

lower returns to cognitive skill, given that the positive income effects occur in future years.

However, the results in percentage terms are not particularly sensitive to the discount rate. For

example, the 0.1 standard deviation increase in AFQT scores increases average lifetime incomes

by 2.15, 2.03 and 1.89 percent using a three, five and seven percent annual real discount rates.


34
  Two caveats should be noted. First, the race/ethnicity differences in dollar amounts are not always statistically
significantly different. Second, when limiting the sample to respondents born after 1961, the percentage gains are
larger for blacks than whites (3.23 percent versus 2.28 percent) but the absolute amounts are somewhat smaller
($11,588 versus $13,664).


                                                       Page 27
Conversely, the absolute dollar amounts are much lower with a five or seven than three percent

discount rate ($8,436 and $3,842 versus $19,545), as expected since incomes first occur twenty

years after the birth. However, the relative and absolute returns to cognitive performance for

blacks or Hispanics continue to exceed those for whites when using our main specifications and

any of these discount rates. 35



IX.      Discussion

      Cognitive performance, as measured by AFQT scores at ages 16-23, yields substantial

returns in terms of future labor market performance. While such a finding is not new to us, we

improve on prior research in four ways. First, we provide the most comprehensive investigation

to date of the role that confounding factors may play in influencing the estimated relationships.

Even our “basic” set of individual and family background controls are more comprehensive than

those contained in most prior studies. The inclusion of these plus a restricted set of time-varying

characteristics attenuates the raw correlation of cognitive skills on future incomes by 25 percent

to 30 percent. Non-cognitive characteristics have received considerable attention recently as

determinants of adult outcomes, and our estimates indicate that controlling for these results in an

additional 5 percent to 10 percent reduction of the predicted AFQT effect. However, our non-

cognitive controls are limited, raising the possibility that a fuller accounting for them would

further diminish the estimated influence of cognitive performance. Conversely, we obtain no

evidence that geographic place effects explain any of the returns to cognitive skill. This may be

because our other regressors are sufficiently comprehensive to account for any impacts of the



35
  The results are also robust to a variety of alternative specifications including those that: add geographic place
effects; allow for nonlinear effects by controlling for a quadratic in AFQT scores; or exclude extreme values by
deleting the top and bottom five or ten percent of lifetime incomes from the analysis.


                                                        Page 28
county characteristics or fixed-effects that we sometimes control for or because we do not

control for other more localized geographic determinants (e.g., neighborhood characteristics).

    Second, the labor market returns to cognitive performance rise rapidly with age for

individuals in their early twenties and with slower growth thereafter. This has several

implications. Most prior analyses, because they have focused on relatively young adults, have

likely understated the lifetime returns to cognitive skill. Our investigation may continue to

underestimate these benefits, although by less than earlier work, since we only observe

individuals until around fifty years old. However, it is unclear what the AFQT-income

relationship will look like at later ages. For instance, it could flatten since wage growth tends to

slow as retirement approaches, or steepen if higher cognitive performance is associated with

delayed retirement. The age profiles we do observe are consistent with models emphasizing self-

productivity or dynamic complementarity, whereby initial skills beget future skills.

    Third, whereas most earlier studies have focused on income or hourly wages, we show that

AFQT impacts on work hours are also important. They explain one-quarter to one-third of the

income effect and contribute to the greater returns experienced by females, Hispanics or blacks

compared to males or whites. Although these results presumably reflect some combination of

preferences and constraints, we suspect that the latter may be of particular importance, with

higher cognitive performance providing women and minorities with additional protection against

the possibility of being unable to work the desired number of hours.

    Fourth, we develop estimates that incorporate alternative discount rates. A one-tenth

standard deviation gain in AFQT scores boosts predicted discounted lifetime earnings by 2.15

percent, 2.03 percent, and 1.89 percent at discount rates of 3 percent, 5 percent and 7 percent.

These roughly correspond to effects per IQ point of 1.43 percent, 1.35 percent, and 1.26



                                                Page 29
percent. 36 We express our estimates in dollar terms for a 2014 birth cohort by adjusting for real

growth in earnings per worker between the average birth year for our respondents and 2014. It is

useful to compare the resulting estimates to those used for policy implementation. For example,

in its analysis of possible revisions to national standards for airborne lead levels the EPA

estimated the lifetime income effects of one increase in IQ point to be between $8,760 and

$12,512 (Environmental Protection Agency 2008). 37 Converting these figures to 2014 dollars,

using the CPI-U, and discounting them from age 3 to birth (at 3 percent) gives $9,456 and

$13,506, respectively. Thus our preferred estimate of $13,030 per IQ point is slightly less than

the greater of EPA’s previous estimates, using a three percent discount rate. 38 Our estimates are

also applicable to a broad variety of policy interventions that may improve cognitive

performance, such as interventions to reduce exposure to lead or other neurotoxicants, to

improve children’s nutrition (e.g., Black 2003), increase breastfeeding (e.g. Victora et al. 2016),

or to promote early childhood development (e.g., Stoltzfus 2015, and Karoly et al. 2005).

     The estimated returns to cognitive skill are larger for non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics

than for non-Hispanic whites, in both percent and absolute terms, in almost all specifications.

This matters in multiple policy arenas including interventions to improve cognitive performance

such as early childhood education (e.g., the U.S. Department of Education’s program Race to the

Top—Early Learning Challenge) or programs to promote breastfeeding (e.g., Victora et al. 2016).

Advocates for focusing such interventions on disadvantaged populations often argue that such

targeting will improve equity by reducing disparities. Our results suggest an additional efficiency

36
   Since the standard deviation of IQ is 15 points, we convert our AFQT estimates to effects per IQ point by
multiplying by 10/15.
37
   The lower estimate was derived from Schwartz (1994) and the higher one from Salkever (1995). Both estimates
use a 3 percent discount rate to discount earnings back to age 3.
38
   EPA’s estimate also accounts for additional schooling cost savings that accrue if reductions in lead exposure
reduce the need for special education classes, which are beyond the scope of our project. EPA also applied estimates
of the percentage effects of IQ to the present value of lifetime earnings derived (largely) from data from the Current
Population Survey (CPS). We do not use CPS data here but Hafstead and Lutter (2016) pursue such an approach.


                                                       Page 30
argument. Specifically, if the rewards to increased cognitive skills are greater for minorities than

whites, and the incremental costs of improving such skills are similar across groups, the net

benefits from interventions targeted toward disadvantaged groups will exceed those from more

general interventions.

      Our findings may also matter for environmental policy because of continuing concerns

about environmental lead, a legacy of lead-based paint and leaded gasoline, which have both

been federally banned for decades, and lead in drinking water distribution systems. 39 Our work

generally updates and improves on prior estimates of the value of IQ gains from reducing

exposure to lead but may also be relevant for federal programs promoting environmental justice

(e.g., President Obama 2014), because of concerns about disparate impacts of pollution. In

particularly, our research suggests that reducing exposure to environmental toxins among

African American and Hispanic children may bring about gains in cognitive performance that

have larger effects on future earnings than would equivalent comparable gains in cognitive skill

for non-Hispanic whites, again providing a potential efficiency argument for focusing

environmental interventions on these groups.

      Although cognitive performance is an important determinant of labor incomes, we note that

it is not the primary source of earnings inequality, which has received a great deal of recent

attention (e.g. Freedman, 2016). To demonstrate this, we calculate the variance as well as the

10th, 25th, 75th and 90th percentiles of both actual discounted lifetime incomes and an adjusted

measure of counterfactual incomes predicted to occur if all individuals had average (rather than

their actual) AFQT scores. Specifically, the adjusted lifetime incomes are:

(9)                                𝑌′𝑖 = 𝛼� + 𝛽̂1 𝑋𝑖 + 𝛽̂2 𝑍𝑖 + 𝛾�𝐴𝐹𝑄𝑇
                                                                  �������� + 𝜇̂ 𝑖 ,

39
  Problems with drinking water containing elevated levels of lead from older lead pipes are well-known, following
reports from Flint, Michigan, but Olson and Fedinick (2016) show that such problems may affect millions of
Americans beyond Flint.


                                                      Page 31
where 𝛼�, 𝛽̂1 , and 𝛽̂2 are regression coefficients, and 𝜇̂ the regression residual, obtained from

                              �������� representing the sample mean cognitive test score.40 The
estimating equation (8), with 𝐴𝐹𝑄𝑇

adjustment has the effect of lowering (raising) the predicted lifetime labor incomes of persons

with high (low) cognitive skill because 𝛾� > 0.

     The variance of adjusted income is 86.5% of the variance of the unadjusted measure,

indicating that differences in AFQT scores explain around 14% of the total variation in lifetime

labor incomes. The adjusted 75-25 and 90-10 income ratios are 84.8% and 64.4% as large as the

unadjusted ratios, with most of the change occurring because the adjustments substantially

increase incomes at the bottom of the distribution. 41 In combination, these results suggest that

differences in cognitive performance around the time of labor market entry are likely to explain

somewhere between one-seventh and one-third of the heterogeneity in discounted lifetime labor

incomes. 42

     We conclude by noting two related areas where we perform a preliminary investigation, but

where additional research would be worthwhile. First, we examine the extent to which the

observed AFQT effects operate through educational attainment, whereby more cognitively

skilled individuals obtain more schooling which, in turn, leads to increases in adult wages and

work hours. 43 To do so, we estimate our preferred specifications with and without covariates for

education (<12, 12-15, 16 and >16 years). Controlling for years of schooling attenuates the




40
   Although the mean AFQT z-score has been normalized to zero, for the slightly restricted sample containing the
data needed to calculate lifetime labor income, the average is 0.02 standard deviations above zero.
41
   The unadjusted 10th, 25th, 75th and 90th percentiles of lifetime income are $109,019, $235,015, $710,373 and
$1,056,191. Adjusted incomes at these same percentiles are: $160,718, $270,701, $694,248 and $1,002,334.
42
   We emphasize that these results are illustrative only, rather than definitive because, for example, we have not
examined differentials at other income percentiles and since cognitive performance may influence some variables
(e.g. marital status) included in our prediction equation.
43
   In specifications with controls for cross-round and time-varying effects, as well as non-cognitive test scores, a 0.1
standard deviation increase in AFQT scores predicts a 0.12 year increase in schooling.

estimated AFQT effect on incomes by around 50 percent at most ages (see Appendix Figure B.4),

suggesting that this is a mechanism for approximately half of the cognitive performance effect.

    Second, our analysis treats cognitive performance as a unified measure, whereas different

components may yield disparate returns, as noted, for example, by Cawley et al. (1997) and

Murnane et al. (2001). To provide some indication of this heterogeneity, we conduct a

preliminary analysis that divides cognitive scores into math and verbal performance measures.

The estimates suggest larger returns to math than verbal skills, as well as steeper age-gradients in

these returns. We plan to investigate this issue in future research.

   Estimates are obtained from the coefficient on the computed AFQT Z-score regressed on
   annual incomes (including zeros). These estimates are then divided by the dependent variable
   mean at the specified age. Multiplying these estimates by 100% gives percentage changes.
   Supplementary characteristics (other than AFQT) are shown at the bottom of the table.
   Models (2) through (4) also include survey year fixed-effects.

Note: See note on Table 2. Table shows estimated effects of a 0.1 standard deviation increase in
AFQT score for the representative NLSY79 sample, at different ages, with robust standard errors
in parentheses. In addition to AFQT scores, models control for background, age-varying, and
non-cognitive characteristics and survey year fixed-effects. Dependent variables are average
annual values of incomes, earnings, and work hours, as well as the log of hourly wages on the
reference week job. For the annual outcomes, estimates are obtained from the coefficient on the
computed AFQT Z-score regressed on annual incomes (including zeros). These estimates are
then converted to percentage changes by dividing the estimated effect by the dependent variable
mean at the specified age.

Note: See notes on Tables 2, 5 and 6. Table shows estimated effects of a 0.1 standard deviation increase
in AFQT score for the representative NLSY79 sample as a percentage or dollar amount change on the net
present value of the sum of annual labor income from age 20 through age 65 for the specified population
group. Incomes are discounted to the birth year using an annual real discount rate of three percent and are
expressed in 2014-year dollars. For Americans born in 2014, the estimates are inflated by the growth in
real earnings occurring from 1961 to 2014. For all individuals, men and women, data are from the
nationally representative NLSY79 sample. The race/ethnicity estimates use the full sample, including the
supplementary samples of blacks and Hispanics. “Whites” refer to non-black non-Hispanics. In addition
to AFQT scores, the models control for background, age-varying, and non-cognitive characteristics and
survey year fixed-effects. Robust standard errors are shown in parentheses.

                     Fig 1: Estimated AFQT “Effects” on Annual Labor Income




Note: Figure shows estimated effects of 0.1 standard deviation change in AFQT score for representative
NLSY79 sample. Horizontal axis shows results for two-year age groupings beginning with age listed (e.g.,
30 refers to 30-31 year olds). Estimates are obtained from the coefficient on the computed AFQT Z-score
regressed on annual labor incomes (including zeros). These are converted to percentage changes by
dividing the estimated effect by the dependent variable mean at the specified age. Background covariates
include: gender, race/ethnicity (black, Hispanic vs. Non-Black Non-Hispanics), magazines, library cards
and newspapers in home at age 14 (3 variables), urban residence at 14, respondent and respondent’s
parents foreign born (3 variables), mother and father’s education (< high school graduate, some college,
college graduate vs. high school graduate), number of siblings (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ≥5), older siblings (0, 1, 2, 3,
≥4) and survey year dummy variables. Time-varying covariates include values of: marital status
(currently married, divorced/separated widowed vs. never married), urban residence, census region (north
central, south, west vs. northeast). Non-cognitive variables refer to Rotter, and Rosenberg scales
measured in 1979 and 1980, and self-assessed sociability personality (extremely shy to extremely
outgoing) at age 6, collected in 1985.

Note: See note on Figure 1. Base specification includes background and time-varying covariates as well
as non-cognitive test scores. “Balanced” sample is restricted to respondents with income information
provided at age 48. The analysis including oversamples is for all NLSY respondents, including the
supplementary samples of nonwhites.

non-cognitive test scores. Data are for the NLSY79 nationally representative sample and refer to annual
values, except for log hourly wages based on the main (reference) job in the week prior to the survey.
Wages are restricted to the range $1 to $1,000 per hour and work hours to ≤5200/year.

Geographic Information System (NGIS), except for per capita incomes, which are shown in 1970
dollars and were obtained from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and Gini coefficients, which
were from Nielsen and Alderson (1977). Education attainment refers to persons 25 and older in
1970, and data were also obtained from the NGIS. Crime rates are per 100,000 residents in 1977
and were obtained from Aneja, Donhue and Zhang (2011).

Note: See notes on Tables 2 and 4. Table shows estimated effects of an increase of 0.1 standard
deviation in AFQT scores for the representative NLSY79 sample, as a percentage change or
dollar amount change on the net present value of the sum of annual incomes from age 20 through
age 65 for the specified population group. Lifetime income results are based on incomes
discounted to the birth year using an annual discount rate of three percent and expressed in 2014
dollars. For all individuals, men and women, data are from the nationally representative NLSY79
sample. The race/ethnicity estimates use the full sample, including the supplementary samples of
blacks and Hispanics. “Whites” refer to non-black non-Hispanics. In addition to AFQT scores,
models control for background, age-varying, and non-cognitive characteristics and year fixed-
effects. Robust standard errors are shown in parentheses.
