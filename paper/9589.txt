Market Evaluations of Banking Fragility in Japan:
Japan Premium, Stock Prices, and Credit Derivatives

                                           ABSTRACT

This paper investigates movements of market indicators of banking fragility, namely, Japan
premium, stock prices, and credit derivative spreads of Japanese banks. Although the Japan premium
in the euro-dollar market seemed to have virtually disappeared since April 1999, credit and default

risks of Japanese banks has not necessarily disappeared. Other indicators show varying degrees of
fragility among Japanese banks in 1998-2001. Banking stock prices continue to slide compared to

the market-wide stock price index. From pricing of credit derivatives, default probabilitie of banks
can be etracted. Correlations among indicators were high both in the first period and in the second
period; Credit default swap (CDS) premium explains Japan premium with a significant, positive
coefficient. The higher the CDS is, lower go the stock prices. Before the capital injection of 1999,

the markets were more sensitive to bank vulnerability and higher premiums were required.

１．Introduction
１．Introduction

The Japanese banking system has been in turmoil since the mid-1990s. Several mid-size


banks failed in 1995, and three major banks failed in 1997-1998. These failures prompted a


major overhaul in bank supervision: The government blanket guarantee was given to all


types of deposits, capital injections to large banks were carried out, and a financial supervisory


agency was established and reorganized, in 1998-1999. After some tranquility from April 1999


to late 2001, the bank vulnerability became apparent in 2002. This paper will investigate how


different market indicators, Japan premium, stock prices, and credit derivative spread, have


been warning vulnerability of Japanese banks from 1998 to 2002. An analysis of credit


derivative spread will be shown to be a most reliable indicator of credit risk of banks.


         Japanese banks have been plagued by several problems since the early 1990s.1 First,


the sharp declines of asset prices made many borrowers in the real estate and construction


sectors insolvent. In the beginning stage of the problem, banks continued to lend to these


companies so that they can make interest payments. Even after problems became so large,


banks were quite reluctant to force nonperforming customers to fail. Second, the prolonged


recession, with the growth rate being one percent, produced many more nonperforming


borrowers in many sectors of the economy.            Third, overextended businesses of banks




1  Previous studies of the bad loan problems, the financial fragility and crisis in the Japanese
financial system in 1990s are vast. See for example Horiuchi (1999a) Cargill (2000), Ueda (2000) and
Posen (2001).



                                                 2
themselves became costly. Many banks had to retreat from overseas operations. Fourth,


Japanese banks traditionally hold equities of their customers and group companies. When the


Nikkei 225 index peaked in 1989 just shy of 40,000 yen, the banks were sitting on large


unrealized capital gains, that helped to boost the capital adequacy ratio standard. During the


first half of the 1990s, the stock prices were hovering at around 20,000 yen, and unrealized


capital gains shrank, but still positive. However, when the stock prices further went down


below 10,000 in 2001, equity portfolio started to carry unrealized capital losses, lowering the


capital adequacy ratio.


         As the bank balance sheets have become damaged, the market started to discriminate


against Japanese banks as a whole. Japan premium is a well-known phenomenon. The


premium is the extra basis points that Japanese banks had to pay in the offshore interbank


market to borrow the US dollar market, and to lesser extent in the yen market. The premium


has varied across Japanese banks, and they have also fluctuated over time. Whenever the


Japanese banks were judged to be vulnerable, the market charged the Japanese banks an extra


premium. Japan premium became a topic of conversation in 1997, after Hokkaido Takushoku


Bank failed. Since the government had said that it would not allow any of the major twenty


banks to fail, the Hokkaido Takushoku Banks's failure was greeted by a surprise. The market


realized that some other Japanese bank could fail without much warning.             Peek and


Rosengren (2001), Ito and Harada (2000), Horiuchi (1999) and Hanajiri (1999) regard the


Japan premium as market indicator of investors’ anxiety about the soundness of Japanese



                                              3
banks to show how the markets responded.


         Then, two banks became in trouble in 1998. The Long-term Credit Bank (LTCB)


became rumored to be very weak in the market, due to large nonperforming loans. The new


law had to be drafted and passed before the bank was nationalized on (DATE), 1998. Then,


the Nippon Credit Bank (NCB) was declared in December 1998 by the regulatory authority to


be nationalized.


         In order to help calm the situation, and strengthen the capital base of banks, the


government decided to inject public funds into banks. In March 1999, 7459 billion yen was


injected as preferred shares and subordinated debts to strengthen capital base of banks. The


Japan premium all but disappeared and many thought that Japanese banks were on the track


to recover. Increasing stock prices in 1999-2000, later known as an IT bubble helped the


banks' balance sheets. But, in 2001-2002, the bank fragility has become the issue again.


First, When one department store, Mycal, applied for rehabilitation, the bank had to increase


its provisioning, because the company was classified only as doubtful. This raised a concern on


the banks' lax standard for classifying loans. Second, deferred tax credit have been counted


toward capital. Provisioning by banks have been made from taxable income, and tax credit will


be given in the following five years if banks earn enough profits to be taxable. Deferred tax


credits now occupy one half of the capital that is counted toward capital adequacy ratio. (See for




                                                4
example Kashyap (2002) 2). Third, stock prices have been declining, and affecting banks'


balance sheet where many equities are held.3


            The increase in Japan premium is limited. One theory is that Japanese banks are


now required to post cash collateral for interbank borrowings. Collaterals can be offset against


any losses that may be incurred if a bank defaulted on loan for any reason. Another theory is


that counterparties to Japanese bank interbank borrowings are now confident that even when


a Japanese bank is declared to be failed, the regulators will quickly take over and honor any


liabilities to avoid a cascade of defaults.


            In general stock prices reflect also the possibilities of default, as well as discounted


future cash flows. Since stock prices also reflect general conditions of the macro economy, an


appropriate measure of bank vulnerability would be the difference between the change in the


bank stock price and the change in the market-wide stock price index. Our approach of using


stock prices is different from those that used stock prices as one of the indicators to show the


possibilities of default. Sato et al. (1990) was the first that utilized option model to examine


default risk of Japanese banks.4




2   Kashyap (2002) provides a description of the issue, bank capital permitting to include tax.

3 When middle-size brokerage Sanyo Securities went bankrupt in the beginning of November 1997,
it was the first firm ever to default on the interbank market and brought a crisis. Since then,
gavernment protected all interbank liabilities to avoild such a crisis.

4 The intention of Sato et al. (1990) is not to evaluate default risk itself but the Japanese deposit
insurance scheme and discussion of safety net as an insurance system.



                                                   5
         Another measure of bank vulnerability has attracted attention recently. The credit


derivatives are the instruments for possible default of credits.     The credit derivatives of


Japanese banks have been traded, mainly by non-Japanese financial institutions, and their


spreads over sovereign Japan is a meaningful measure for possible bank failure. Even if


interbank liabilities may be honored, either by collateral or regulator, credit derivative


payments will be triggered. Since default or failure is the triggering event, credit derivative


spread seems to represent the credit risk most accurately among the three indicators.


         Credit risk is the probability that a borrower will default on a commitment to repay


debt or bank loans. It is influenced by bank-specific events and economy-wide events. Any


news that affect market and banks will influence perceptions on credit risk. A broad measure


of a bank's credit risk is its credit ratings (see appendix table1). However, credit ratings are


not observable in the daily basis. A more frequent quantitative measure of credit risk is the


credit risk premium. The credit premium measured in this paper is the difference between


the credit default swap of individual banks and that of Japanese sovereign credit.


         The contribution of this paper is as follows: This paper examines the relationship


among three indicators that are relevant to measuring health of the banks: Japan premium,


stock prices, and credit derivative spread. To our best knowledge, this paper is the first to


analyze systematically behavior of credit derivative spread for individual banks.


         Japan premium represents default risk in the interbank market. It is closely related


to risk of bank failure, but a failure may not necessarily result in non-payment of interbank



                                               6
obligation. Either by having collateral or by regulator’s intervention, interbank obligations


may be carried out even in the event of bank failure. This possibility is more likely in


2000-2001 than 1998-1999. Therefore analysis of Japan premium after 2000 is structurally


not comparable to that of 1998-1999, the highest period of Japan premium. Stock prices are


another indicator for bank soundness and profitability. However, unless it becomes too low,


ups and downs of stock prices reflect more of changes in profitability forecasts rather than


changes in perception of default risk. In terms of the reasons described the above, examining


the relationship between the Japan premium and stock price movements that Ito and Harada


(2000) are looking is not useful methodology in recent years.


         In contrast, credit derivatives directly measures credit risk. Credit derivative spread is


a best measure of market assessment on how likely a bank is going to fail in a specified time


horizon. Therefore, this paper is unique in its exploiting a good data set in looking at changing


vulnerability of Japanese banks from 1998-2002.5


         To anticipate conclusion, we will find in this paper the following results.


(1) Correlation between indicators were much higher than expected not only in the first period,


even in the second period;


(2) Credit default swap (CDS) premium in the JP (Japan premium) equation has a positive




5 Neal (1996) is the first in explaining the credit derivatives market’s development in the early
1990s in the U.S. In it, it is explained how credit derivatives as new financial instruments for
controlling credit risks is available.



                                                7
and significant impact;


(3) The sensitivity of JP (Japan premium) with respect to CDS became much smaller in the


second period, confirming that there was some changes in the LIBOR market perception about


the liability protection in the event of bank default;


(4) CDS premium in the stock equation also has a negative and significant impact;


(5) Before the capital injection of March 1999, in the first period, the markets were more


skeptical and increased premiums.




2. Data Description

2.1. Three indicators


Default risks of Japanese banks appear in the three indicators: (1) Japan Premium (interbank


borrowing); (2) Credit derivative (credit default swap); and (3) Bank stock price. However,


each indicator may show different (combinations) of risk. Increased risk of default will raise


(1) and (2) and decrease (3).


         Credit derivative is the most direct way to measure credit risk, since it is pricing the


default event. Stock prices reflect the residual values of company assets as well as future


discounted cash flows. Even if the event of failure is remote, stock prices fluctuate due to


changing prospects of profitability, reflecting both market - and economy-wide shocks as well as


individual bank shocks.         LIBOR premium reflect the probability of interbank default.


Interbank default may occur to a solvent bank, if, for some reasons, a bank cannot obtain



                                                 8
(dollar or yen) liquidity. On the other hand, interbank liability may be protected even in the


event of bank failure. Interbank credits may have higher priority in repayments than equity


stake holders.


         Japan premium became highlighted as an indicator of Japanese banks’ vulnerability


in 1997-1998. Western banks required higher interest rates when Japanese banks wanted to


borrow in the offshore interbank market. The premium was much higher in the US dollar


interbank market. This was thought to reflect the risk that Japanese banks would not be able


to obtain enough dollars to repay the interbank loans, as their bank soundness was questioned


as well as the outright possibility of bank failure. In 1997 and 1998, Japanese banks had to


pay nearly 100bps more than US and European banks to borrow dollar.


         When vulnerability of Japanese banks reappeared in 2001-2002, there was no


significant increase in LIBOR rate for Japanese banks. The magnitude of Japanese premium


in 2001-2002 was less than most 10 basis point. However, the low Japan premium does not


necessarily prove that the markets are less pessimistic about Japanese banks this time


compared to in 1997-98. First, weaker banks disappeared from data or exited form the market,


either by withdrawing from the market or by being merged with other healthier banks.


Second, even for the remaining banks, they are required to put up cash collaterals to obtain


interbank funds. Collaterals protect creditors from losses even in the event of counterparty


(Japanese bank) failure. Third, even in the three cases of the Japanese banks failure in


1997-98, interbank obligations were repaid promptly. The western banks may be optimistic



                                              9
about Japanese regulators’ competence and willingness to carry out interbank obligations


promptly.




2.2. Japan Premium


The Japan premium is a premium imposed on Japanese banks' borrowing rate by U.S. and


European banks in the Eurodollar and euroyen market. It reflected counter-party risk based


on the western banks' belief that Japanese banks had higher risk of default. In Ito and


Harada (2000), the Japan premium is defined as the difference between the Eurodollar TIBOR


(the Tokyo interbank offered rate, or the Eurodollar interbank borrowing rate in Tokyo) and the


Eurodollar LIBOR (the London interbank offered rate, or the Eurodollar interbank borrowing


rate in London) since it is viewed that the Japan premium emerged in the Eurodollar market


the most.


         It reflects counter-party risk based on the western banks' belief that Japanese banks


had higher risk of default, especially in the dollar market. In particular, the dollar liquidity


was a concern at the time of the 1997-98 crisis. In this paper, Japan premium is defined as the


difference between the interbank euroyen rate quoted by Japanese banks and the average of


the rate quoted by the non-Japanese banks in the euroyen LIBOR samples. The reason we


used Euroyen rate rather than Eurodollar rate is availability of samples. Sample banks are


very limited if Eurodollar market is examined.


         Japanese banks use cash collaterals in interbank transactions since 1999 Spring. It



                                              10
is said that default risk might not appear in the Japan premium since then. We define the


Japan premium as the following form;


          JPit = LIBOR3M it − LIBOR3M t


where JPit is the Japan premium of bank i , LIBOR3M it is the euroyen 3 month interbank


rate quoted by bank i and LIBOR3M t is the euroyen 3 month market rate at time t .6




2.3. Credit Derivatives   7 8




Credit derivatives are over-the-counter financial contracts that have payoffs contingent on


charges in the credit of a firm. It also reflects default risk. Credit default swap (CDS) are


financial contracts that provides insurance against credit-related losses.


          Credit derivatives, the US dollar denominated default swap, are the average of offer


and bid rates posted by brokers at the close of the Tokyo market.9       10   When both bid and offer




6 The euroyen LIBOR is calculated by the British Bankers’ Association as the average of the yen
interbank offered rates. Although the premium in the dollar market was serious rather than that
in the euroyen market as described in Saito and Shiratsuka (2001), euroyen LIBOR is used in this
paper since the sample Japanese banks in the euro dollar is very limited.

7We wish to acknowledge kind help by Mr. SAEKI Nobukazu of Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial and Ms.
KAWAI Yuko of RP Tech for their answering our questions on the structure of the credit derivatives
market.

8 The market size is based on the officially surveyed statistics, the so-called Yoshikuni Statistics, of
the Bank of International Settlements, presented in Appendix Table 4.

9 Japanese credit derivatives market has started around the beginning of 1998. This was a relatively
late start, however the market has been growing very fast. Most products traded in the market are
credit default swaps. The default swap premium is the cost of a credit risk. The investor who
wants to avoid the risk is called “protection buyer “(risk seller) and pay a premium to be protected in
case of credit event affecting the reference entity. While the protection seller (risk buyer) receives
the premium. Protection seller (risk buyer) has to pay obligations to the seller if a credit event


                                                  11
are missing for day t, then data of day t-1 is substituted in. When one of a bid or an offer is


missing, the value is substituted between observation days so that the bid and offer would not


be reversed. When missing days continue for a couple of days, we eliminated the period form


our samples. However, these days were not observed often since June 1998. The original


data are taken for all days when both offer and bid are shown by brokers. Samples are for the


Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi (later Mitsubishi-Tokyo Holding), Fuji Bank, Daiichi Kangyo Bank,


Industrial Bank of Japan (later those three becoming Mizuho Holding), Sanwa Bank (later UFJ


Holding), Sumitomo Bank (later Sumitomo-Mitsui Bank), and Sovereign Japan.              11




          Credit derivative spread extracting Japanese bank’s provabilities of default risk is;


          CDS it = BANK it − JAPAN sovereign t


where CDS it is the credit derivative spread of bank i , BANK it is credit default premium of


bank i and JAPAN sovereignt is sovereign premium at time t .




2.4. Bank Stock Prices


Bank stock price movements relative to market index, the difference between the two, are




occurs.

10 There are several specificities in the credit derivatives market in Japan. One is the definition of
credit events. ISDA Credit Derivatives Definitions in 1999 clarify credit events, however
“nationalization” of a Japanese bank is not confirmed.

11Our sample period reflects the availability of the CDS data since the market has started in the
beginning of 1998.



                                                 12
defined as to express bank's risk of default. The difference would be that;


         STOCK it = log( stock ) it − log(TOPIX ) t


where STOCK it is the log difference of bank i ’s stock price and market index TOPIX t at


time t . The movement of specific bank stock price relative to other sectors can be examined.

We construct specific bank stock price excluding other sectors by subtracting TOPIX from


individual bank stock. That is, excluding general movements in the stock market, TOPIX, we


can construct bank stock price movements.




3. Correlation among Three Indicators

3.1. Bank Mergers and Sample Break

Although we cover the period from June 1998 to September 2002, there was a major change in


the scenery of Japanese banking. After mergers of several banks and trust banks, the four


major banking groups emerged. Due to the mergers, some banks are not comparable before


and after these mergers. Therefore we break the sample into two, the First half: from June


1998 to September 1999, and the second half: from April 2001 to September 2002. The big


four financial groups were formed in the aftermath of the 1997-98 banking crisis.


         In September 2000, the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Fuji Bank and Industrial Bank of


Japan established the bank holding company, "Mizuho Holdings, Inc." There are three banks


under the holding company in 2002, the Mizuho Corporate Bank, the Mizuho Bank and the


Mizuho trust and banking.



                                                13
         In April 2001, the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Mitsubishi Trust and Banking, Nippon


Trust Bank and Tokyo Trust Bank established the bank holding company, "Mitsubishi Tokyo


Financial Group,Inc." Three trust banks merged in October 2001. The group is dominated by


the commercial bank, and since it did no involve a merger of commercial banks, there is


continuity in the commercial banking part.


         In April 2001, "UFJ (United Financial of Japan) Group" was established by the Sanwa


Bank, Tokai Bank and Toyo Trust and Banking. The two commercial banks, Sanwa and Tokai,


merged into UFJ Bank and Toyo Trust and Banking changed its name to UFJ Trust Bank in


January 2002. Sanwa is a nation-wide commercial bank, with emphasis in Kansai region,


plus some international businesses, while Tokai is a bank based in Nagoya region.


         In April 2001, "Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. (SMBC)," was established by a


merger between the Sakura Bank and Sumitomo Bank. This was straight-forward merger of


two competing banks with similar nation-wide branch networks. The two banks were at the


core or respective corporate groups, which have roots in pre-war zaibatsu. In this sense, the


merger of the two banks put pressure on mergers of non-financial corporations in the two


corporate groups too.


         These mergers and reorganizations are summarized in Table 1.

3.2. Three Indicators for each bank


                                             14
Three indicators for each bank are shown in Figure 1 (Panels 1-1 to 1-6) for the first period and


Figure 2 (Panels 2-1 to 2-2) for the second period. Stock represents level of bank stock price,


LIBOR (In the figures, LIBOR is denoted by LIBOR 3.) is the Japan premium described in 2.2,


the difference between individual bank’s euroyen 3 month interbank rate and market rate, and

CDS is representing credit derivative spread, credit default premium of bank i minus

sovereign premium as in 2.3. LIBOR in the figures is ten times larger than original level for


convenience.


         Insert Figures 1-1 to 1-6 about here


         In the first period, three indicators of all six banks show a similar time-series pattern.


(1) Japan premium (LIBOR) shows quite dramatic increase from June to November 1998, and


then decreased gradually April 1999. (2) Credit derivative spreads show a similar pattern, but


peaking slightly earlier than LIBOR and decreased more gradually than LIBOR. (3) Stock


prices had a sharp decline from June to September/October 1998, and then started to recover.


After April 1999, all indicators are more or less calm. (4) Japan premium and CDS basically


disappeared after April 1999, when the second capital injection was completed, except Fuji, IBJ,


DKB seemed have return of high LIBOR in the summer and fall of 1999. The correlations


among the three indicators seem to be fairly high between June 1998 and April 1999.


         An examination of these three indicators reveals that the market had discriminated


quality of these banks. The indicators tend to agree on the health of banks.


(1) In the first period, Fuji Bank was regarded by the market as the riskiest among the six. It



                                                15
had highest LIBOR, highest CDS, and most stock price decline. In the second period, Mizuho


was the worst in terms of the stock price change, the peak level of LIBOR (tie with UFJ), and in


the peak level of CDS. (2) The market regarded the Tokyo Mitsubishi as strongest among the


six in the first period and among the four in the second period. In all of the three indicators in


both periods (except in stock price decline in the first period), the Tokyo Mitsubishi Bank is the


best. (3) Timing of the peak in LIBOR and CDS, and also the trough in stock prices tend to


coincide for all banks.    This indicates that a shock to the banking sector was common, but


vulnerability or sensitivity to the shock was different among different banks.


         Insert Figures 2-1 to 2-4 about here


In the second period, CDS has increased markedly in December 2001 for all four financial


institutions, Mizuho (spread of up to 204.5), Mitsubishi Tokyo (120), UFJ (192), and Mitsui


Sumitomo (145.5). Stock prices had declined steadily from the spring of 2001 to February


2002. The degree of decline was the most for the Mizuho (72.8%) and UFJ (70.1%), and the


least for Mitsubishi-Tokyo (43.5%).

         The soundness evaluated by the markets did not change even after most major banks


consolidated and formed four financial groups. The Tokyo Mitsubishi Bank has been the best


and Fuji, current Mizuho, has been the riskiest, according to the market.12

3.3. Correlation Analysis

Table 3 presents statistical summary of the levels of stock prices, LIBOR, and CDS. The table


reveals the following characteristics of these market indicator movements. Those banks that


had high CDS values (max and average) in either first or second period tended to have higher


LIBOR (average and max) levels and a sharpest drop in stock prices ((max – min)/average).


The averages of LIBOR and CDS were smaller in the second period except CDS of DKB and


IBJ. The averages of CDS for DKB and IBJ were smaller before their merger, but those of two


banks become larger in the second period. The ranges for LIBOR and CDS were much smaller


in the second period than those in the first period. The standard deviations (“s,d.” in Table 3)


of LIBOR became smaller in the second period, but standard deviations of CDS did not change


over time.


          The worst bank in terms of CDS average was Fuji Bank in the first period, and


Mizuho Bank in the second period. The Mizuho is a product of a three way merger of Fuji, IBJ


and DKB. The three banks were the weaker three of the six in the first period. A merger of


three weaker banks turned out to be one large weak bank, at least in the eyes of the market.




numbers. The number included differed tax credit and capital injected by the government in
1998-1999. The adjusted capital ratios were widely circulated by research publications of
investment banks and securities firms as well as academic work. Appendix 2 and appendix 3 of this
paper show that Tier1 capital adjusted for the deferred tax assets (the equity equivalent in excess of
differed tax assets) and preferred shares. Excluding deferred tax assets in Tier 1 capital reduces the
banks’ regulatory capital ratios substantially, especially in 2002.

         Next, correlation coefficients among the three indicators are examined. The stock


prices and credit derivative spread are expected to be negative. This is confirmed in the time


of bank turmoil. However, during the period of IT bubble, from 1999 to spring of 2000, stock


prices of banks rose more than the market average, because banks hold a wide-range of stocks


including IT-related stocks. The CDS, representing credit risk, behaved differently from stock


price movements. The market participants of the credit derivatives were not impressed by the


stock price increases.


         Insert Table 4 about here


         The correlation of the LIBOR and CDS are shown in Table 5. The correlation is


expected to be positive, as both represent the vulnerability of bank financial health. This


prediction is confirmed in the data.


         The correlation coefficient in the first period is uniformly higher than those in the


second and third periods, suggesting that LIBOR3 represented credit risk more in the first


period. As suggested earlier in the paper, LIBOR3 lost direct relationship to credit risk after


April 1999, because either collaterals are used or counter-parties believe interbank liabilities


would be honored even in the case of a bank failure.    13




13 This information is obtained from the hearings we had with market participants. “Collaterals ” do
not mean those under CSA (Collateral Support Annex, which is official transaction based on the
regulation of ISDA), but collaterals here are part of the swap arrangement where the Japanese yen
is used in the swap transactions in order for Japanese banks to obtain the U.S. dollar for a certain
period. The “Japanese premium” is hidden in the interest rates used in this swap arrangement.

Banks that are rated to be weak tended to have higher correlation in the second half period,


especially in the relations of stock prices and credit derivative spread (-0.807 for Mizuho, -0.903


for UFJ, -0.821 for Sumitomo Mitsui and -0.283 for BTM. Long-term credit ratings for Mizuho,


UFJ and Sumitomo Mitsui were single “A” that of BTM was “A+” at the end of March 2001.).




4. Panel Analysis

The panel regression is conducted in the following form. Dependent variable is either one of the


following:


             JPit = LIBOR3M it − LIBOR3M t


          STOCK it = log( stock ) it − log(TOPIX ) t


As an independent variables, we use the following variables; CDS, Call rate and a dummy


variable, where they are defined as follows: CDS it = BANK it − JAPANsovereignt , Call = Call


rate, uncollateralized overnight.14 For the interest rate, we use daily observations of the


overnight uncollateral call rate, data being taken from the Toyo Keizai Monthly Statistics.




14 We have examined panel regressions with a dummy variable that takes 1 before the second
capital injection, March 1999, and 0 after April 1999. The regression results were almost the same
as the results presented in this paper. The dummy variable was included to control for a possible
regime change in bank financial soundness however the regression results are not shown because of
the following econometric reason.
     As long as a dummy variable is used in the panel regression, fixed effect model has a bias. For
the level data we use in our regression, fixed effect model is preferable since it brings us the same
effect as the panel regressions in differenced form.



                                                 19
Both CDS and Call are expected to correlate positively with the Japan Premium and negatively


with the STOCK. Call rate is proxy for monetary policy so that an increase in call rate implies


the tighter monetary policy and liquidity in the market, and it may lead to a higher possibility


of bank failures.


          Tables 6-1, 6-2 and 6-3 report results of a panel analysis. The regression results of


OLS, with the fixed effect estimators, are reported in Table 6-1. Stock prices are affected


negatively by CDS, and the coefficient is statistically significant. The Japan premium tends to


be higher when the CDS is higher, and the coefficient is also statistically significant for both of


the periods. In equations (1) and (2), that examine whether CDS, as the fundamental default


indicator, influences stock prices and the Japan premium. The impact of CDS on the Japan


premium in the second period is about one eighth of that in the first period (0.101 for the first


half and 0.013 for the second half). This evidence is consistent with our conjecture that the


Japan premium became very small in the second period, because collateral is used or because


market participants believe that a failure does not imply default in the interbank market. The


impact of CDS on STOCK has increased (larger coefficient in magnitude) in the second period


(-0.0003 for the first half and -0.001 for the second half). In fact, the size effect of coefficients of


CDS in the second period is about four times larger than that of the first period. Stock prices,


representing profitability, is more sensitive to the default risk in the second period. Therefore,


unlike the Japan Premium, the default factor in stock prices has increased in the second period


compared to the first period. The signs of call rate sometimes are not consistent with our



                                                  20
priors.


          Insert Table 6-1 about here


          Table 6-2 and Table 6-3 present the results of the OLS, pooled and the random effect


estimators respectively. Most of the results of Table 6-1 carry over to Tables 6-2 and 6-3. The


sensitivity of stock prices to CDS is similar for the first sample period, and they are negative


and significant, and smaller in the first period. That of the Japan premium to CDS is also the


same. It is positive and significant for the first and second period, and much smaller in the


second half.


          An important finding of the Japan premium becoming insensitive to CDS is robust


against different methods of panel regression. A conventional wisdom in the market, that is,


the Japan premium lost a value as an indicator of default probability of Japanese banks, is


basically confirmed. However, it is important to stress that the Japan premium and stock


prices do react to changes in CDS that is a direct measure of default probability of Japanese


banks. Although the magnitude of CDS as well as that of the Japan premium has been lower


in 2001-2002, compared to in 1998, this does not necessarily mean that reputations of Japanese


banks have been recovered. The stock and the interbank markets do react to the changes in


the pricing of default risk of Japanese banks, although with lower sensitivity.

5. Concluding Remarks


                                                 21
In this paper we have exploited a newly collected data of credit derivative spread. Since it is


suspected that the Japan Premium no longer represents default risk of Japanese banks, credit


derivative spread, CDS, is a more direct, better measure. Examining the correlation between


CDS and stock prices and the correlation between CDS and the Japan premium, it is found


that the relationship between the three indicators are consistent with theoretical prediction.


Higher CDS tends to be associated with lower stock prices and higher Japan premium. This


relationship seems to hold both in time-series, with the magnitude of impact changing overtime,


and in cross-section.     This result is robust with respect to different methods of panel


regressions or the sample period.


         One of the salient results of this paper is that the sensitivity of the Japan premium to


credit risk is much lower in 2001-2002, compared to in 1998. This should be an alarm to any


research economist who may want to use the Japan premium data for the period after 2000.


The LIBOR market seems to believe that even in the event of a bank failure in Japan, the


interbank liability will be paid off either by collaterals or by the regulator.

Ratings history data are obtained from the FITCH Ratings, that contains International long- and short term ratings, individual and support ratings.
The below is based on the definition given by FITCH. Long- and short-term ratings assess its general creditworthiness on a senior basis.
The difference between long- and short- is the maturity of obligations. A short-term rating has a horizon of less than 12 months.
Therefore short-term ratings place emphasis on the liquidity necessary.
The individual ratings assess how a bank would be viered if it were entirely independent and could not rely on ecternal support.
Individual ratings therefore are for management of risk, and the likelihood that it would run into significant difficulties.
Support ratings are not about the quality of a bank, but they are the assessment of whether the bank would receive support.
