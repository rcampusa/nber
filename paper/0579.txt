          Social Security, Induced Retirement, and Aggregate
           Capital Accumulation: A Correction and Updating

                               ABSTRACT


     In a 1974 paper in the Journal of Political Economy I discussed the

theoretical ambiguity of the effect of social security on private saving

and presented statistical evidence that social security does on balance

depress saving. Recently, an error was detected in the computer program

that was used to construct the "social security wealth" variable. I have

now corrected that error and reestimated the original consumer expenditure

equation. I have also updated the analysis by including the five years of

additional data that have become available since the original study was

completed. The new estimates, presented in the current note, continue to

indicate that social security substantially depresses private saving. The

point estimates of this effect are somewhat lower than before but nevertheless

imply that social security depresses saving by about fifty percent of its

current value. The estimated reduction in saving is more than two—thirds

of the concurrent "contributions" of employees and employers to the social

security retirement and survivors fund.

1. Social Security Wealth

          Social security reduces private saving because individuals substitute

the social security benefits that they expect to receive for the private wealth

that they would otherwise accumulate —     directly   as well as through private pen-

sions and life insurance —   to   finance their consumption after they are retired.

However the social security program not only replaces ordinary saving as a means

of financing retirement consumption but also induces earlier retirement and

therefore increases the amount of retirement consumption to be financed.1 1he

net impact of social security on saving depends on the balance between the

wealth replacement effect and the induced retirement effect and can therefore

only be determined empirically.

          The principal difficulty in any econometric study of the effect of

social security on private saving is measuring the level of benefits that indi-

viduals expect to receive in the future. The actual benefits are revised

periodically by Congress and, until 1972, were subject to the uncertainties of

inflation. Moreover, individuals differ in their understanding of the social

security program and in their confidence or optimism about Congress' willingness

to maintain or increase future real benefit levels. In ur 19714 paper, I used

the actuarial present value of the future benefits to which the current working—

Feldstein (1977). Additional aspects of ambiguity are discussed by Barro (1978)
and Feldstein and Pellechio (1979).

age population was entitled, a variable that I called "social security

wealth. "i


             The constructed annual time series of this "social security wealth"

for the years since the inception of the social security program reflected every

change in coverage and in the rules used to compute the benefits of retirees and

dependents. Each annual value of social security wealth also reflected the

demographic structure of the population, the employment pattern, and the age—sex

specific mortality rates. The calculation assumed that Congress would maintain

a constant ratio of benefits to average earnings and that real earnings would

grow at 2 percent a year for the indefinite future.

             This complicated actuarial calculation of social security wealth was

both too complex and not complex enough. It was too complex to be a realistic

description of the way that individuals actually think about future benefits.

It is an overly precise way of estimating the intuitive judgements about the

levels of benefits on which individuals make decisions about saving and

retirement.2      And at the same time, the algorithm used to calculate social




  Social security wealth is, of course, not a perfect substitute for ordinary
wealth for several reasons: social security wealth is in the form of an
annuity; it cannot be used as collateral for a loan; its value depends on future
Congressional action; etc. These issues are discussed in Feldstein arid
Pellechio (1979) and Feldstein (1979b).

2 o  course, to the extent that these decisions are part of the process of pri-
vate pension planning, the complex actuarial evaluation may be a reasonable
approximation.

    security wealth was   not   complex enough because it did not take into account such

 things as the variation of individual wages around the general growth trend, the

 remarriage of surviving spouses, the presence of dependent children, etc.

Although a more precise variable could have been defined, such extra precision

would not necessarily correspond to a more realistic approximation of individual

expectations 1

             The social security wealth variable defined in this way was added to a

conventional consumer expenditure ftnction of the type that had previously been

estimated by Ando and Modigliani (1963). The estimated coefficient of the

social security wealth variable was 0.021 (with a standard error of 0.006),

implying    that each dollar of social security wealth reduced personal saving by
approximately 2.1 cents.
             I   recently discovered that an error was made by the programmer who

converted the specification of social security wealth into Fortran. The error

occurs in the section of the program that incorporates the 1951 change in the

benefits paid to surviving spouses. Because the program failed to reset

the initial value in a "do loop" operation each year, the calculated value

of social security grew faster that        the   correct specification implied. It is
worth stressing that this was a pure programming         error and did not reflect a

  The initial specification of social security wealth in my 19714 paper and in
subsequent analysis was not the result of a search procedure. I defined one set
of assumptions before any regressions were estimated and they have remained
unchanged. Alternative discount rates were tried but this variation did not
alter the estimated effect of social security on aggregate saving.

misunderstanding of the law or a xnisspecification of social security wealth.
         Section 2 of the present paper examines the implications of correcting

the error and reestimating the original equation. Updates of the sample period

to 197)4 and 1916 are also presented. A final section comments on some extension

of the basic specification and on the relation of the time series estimate to

other evidence.


2. Reestimating the Basic Specification

          The basic specification in my 197)4 paper relates consumer expenditure

to disposable income (YD), lagged disposable income (YD_1), corporate retained

earnings (RE), the value of wealth at the end of the previous year (w_1), social

security wealth (ssw), and a constant term. All variables are real per capita

values and the equation was estimated with annual data from 1929 through 1971

with 19)41 —)46 excluded.1 The estimated coefficients of that equation are repro-

duced as equation 1.1 of Table 1.2 Standard errors are shown in parentheses.

The key social security wealth variable has a coefficient of 0.021. The other

coefficients are a plausible size and all are significantly different from zero.

The sum of squared residuals and Durbin—Watson statistic are presented in the




1 Since the official national income account data are only available since 1929,
the value for 1929 corresponds to the one year lag of YD_1. All other variables
begin in 1930.

2 To facilitate comparison with the other equations in this paper, the original
variables in equation 1.1 are rescaled by 1000; this changes only the constant
term and the sum of squared residuals.

final column; since all of the equations reported in this paper have i2 values

of nre than 0.99, this statistic is not reported.

          After the original research was completed, the Department of Commerce

released its major revision of the national income accounts. This changed all

of the annual data for consumer expenditure and for income. An even nre

substantial revision of the retained earnings variable was made by using econo-

mic depreciation instead of historic cost tax depreciation. Equation 1.2 pre-

sents the estimates based on these new data but retaining the original social

security wealth variable. These changes cause the coefficient of the social

security wealth variable to rise slightly (from 0.021 to 0.02I) and its standard

error to increase (from 0.006 to 0.009).

          Correcting the computer programming error and reestimating with the

new national income and wealth data yields equation 1.3. The coefficient of the

social security wealth variable is reduced to 0.015 with a standard error of

0.0095. The corresponding t—statistic implies that the probability of observing

such a large value if the true value were not positive is less than 0.08. The

point estimate of 0.015 and the 1971 value of social security wealth1 of $i,66)i

billion imply that social security reduced 1971 personal saving   by $25 billion.




1 Social security wealth, like all of the other variables, is measured in 1972
dollars. The 1971 value of SSW is $1,73 billion; using the consumer expen-
diture deflator implies that the corresponding value in 1971 dollars is $1,664
billion.
                                          —8—


By comparison, the actual 1971 value of personal saving was $57 billion and

total private saving was $74 billion. The implied reduction in saving is thus

44 percent of personal saving and 34 percent of private saving. In short,

correcting the programming error (as well as accepting the Department of

Commerce's corrections in the national income data) reduces the coefficient of

social security wealth from the original published value but implies an effect

that is both statistically significant and economically very large.

          In a short note published after my 1974 paper (Feldstein, l979a), I

used the updated national income data and extended the old social security

wealth calculation for an additional three years to 1974. Those results, pre-

sented in equation i.4, were generally consistent with my earlier estimates,

indicating in fact a slightly larger social security wealth coefficient (0.025

with a standard error of 0.009). Dean Leimer and Selig Lesnoy (1980) used the

corrected social security wealth variable through 1974 and reestimated this

equation. They found a much smaller regression coefficient that was barely

larger than its standard error and concluded that the evidence is consistent

with the hypothesis that social security does not depress saving. Equation 1.5

presents the equation with the corrected SSW for the period until 1974. Two

things should be noted. First, even if the low coefficient of 0.011 were

correct, it would still imply a quite substantial effect on saving. Since the

corrected 1974 value of SSW was $2,342 billion, the implied reduction in

saving would   be   $26 billion; by comparison, private saving was $72 billion.

Second, the standard error implies that the probability of observing such a
                                            —9—

coefficient if the true coefficient were not positive is less than 0.15;

while   this is greater than the usual level of significance, it still represents
substantial odds that there is a positive effect of social security wealth on
con sumpt   ion.

             There is however good reason to be skeptical about the estimate in

equation 1.5. Beginning        in 1912, there was   a major change in social security

benefits.      The level of benefits was raised 20 percent and benefits were indexed

to rise automatically with the price level. This increase in benefits implies a

corresponding increase in social security wealth that is not reflected in the

"corrected" social security wealth variable. Making this change for the years

1972 through 197I (as well as correcting the programming error) produces the

coefficients       in equation 1.6. Taking this major legislative change into account
makes the results through 197k similar to the results through 1971 (before the
legislative        change) that were presented in equation 1.3. The coefficient of SSW

rises slightly to 0.017; the addition of three years' data no longer produces a

large and otherwise unexplained reduction. The standard error of 0.0066 implies

a t—statistic of 2.3, indicating that the effect of social security wealth is

statistically significant at any conventional level. A comparison of the sum of

squared residuals in equations 1.5 and 1.6 shows that taking the legislative

revision into account significantly improves the explanatory power of the nde1.

             Extending the analysis to 1916 confirms the importance of taking the

legislative        revision into account.1 Equation 1.7 is based on the corrected

1 At present, 1976 is the most recent year for which all of the social security
information that is needed to construct SSW is available.
                                       —10—


series while equation 1.8 uses the revised series that differs for the five year

interval beginning in 1972. With the revised series, the parameter estimates

are quite similar to the values for the samples ending in 1971 and 197)4. By

contrast, when the 1eislative change is ignored, the addition of two extra

years causes the social security wealth coefficient to drop virtually to zero.

The sum of squared residuals also indicates that the revised series explains the

variation substantially better than the series that ignores the legislative

change.

           The best estimate of the effect of social security wealth, based on

evidence for all of the available years, is therefore approximately 0.017. The

variations in the coefficient from sample to sample and the standard error of

0.008 indicate that it would be inappropriate to give too much weight to the

precise value of this coefficient. It is nevertheless interesting to consider

the implication of this parameter value. In 1976, the value of social security

wealth (in 1976 dollars) was $3,238 billion. The coefficient of 0.017 implies

that social security reduced personal saving in 1976 by $55 billion. For

comparison, in 1976 personal saving was $69 billion and total private saving was

$95 billion. The implied reduction of $55 billion is thus 58 percent of the

actual total private saving and 37 percent of the potential total private saving

of $150 billion (the sum of $55 billion and $95 billion). Since the 1976 GNP

was $1,702 billion, the implied reduction in saving is equivalent to 3.2 percent

of GNP; by comparison, total private saving in the 1970's averaged 5.9 percent

of GNP    Finally, it is interesting to compare the reduction in saving to the
                                     —11—



$63 billion in taxes that employers and employees paid in 1916 in social

security taxes for the Old Age and Survivors Insurance program; each dollar of

contribution corresponds to an 87 cent reduction in private saving.

          To conclude this section, it is useful to note how rapidly social

security wealth has grown since the inception of the program. Table 2 shows the

ratio of real social security wealth to GNP since 194O. In 19b0, social

security wealth was 77 percent of GNP. This ratio has grown continually,

reaching 100 percent in 1950 and nearly 200 percent in 1975.1

 3. Futher Evidence

           In addition to the basic equation, I have also estimated a more

 general specification that tries to separate the wealth replacement effect from

 the induced retirement effect by explicitly including the current labor force

 participation rate of men aged 65 and older as an additional variable.1    In the
 context of the extended life cycle model of my 1971t paper, this variable should

 have a positive coefficient (reflecting the fact that a lower planned retirement

 rate means that less saving is needed to finance retirement consumption) and its

presence should increase the coefficient of social security wealth (which then

reflects only the wealth replacement effect). That in fact does happen with the

new data and with all three sample periods.

          In an alternative specification, I have also allowed changes in the

unemployment rate to alter the marginal propensity to consume. The coefficient

of the additional variable varies in size and statistical significance,

depending on the full specification and time period. With the sample ending in

1971, the coefficient of the unemployment variable is less than its standard

error. With the full sample (through 1916) the unemployment variable is posi-

tive and statistically significant and its presence reduces the coefficient of

the social security wealth variable to 0.012 if the labor force participation of

older men is excluded and to 0.015 if that variable is included.

          In the original 197L paper, I also tried to estimate the effect of

social security wealth in a much smaller sample restricted to the postwar

period.    There is much less variation in all the variables in this truncated

sample    and therefore much more difficulty in estimating any of the coefficients
precisely. The coefficient of the social security wealth variable was somewhat
lower (0.O14    instead of   0.021) but its standard error was also so much larger
(0.030    instead of 0.006) that   no inference could be made with any   confidence.

With   the corrected social security wealth series, the postwar estimates, like

the earlier results, show a positive but insignificant coefficient of social

security wealth, 0.009 with a standard error of 0.013.1

             In conclusion, it is worth emphasizing that the difficulties of

measuring expected social security benefits and of separating the effect of

social security from the effects of other variables that influence saving will

always leave a substantial margin of uncertainty about       the precise magnitude of
social    security's effects. But the new time—series estimates, like the old

ones, are all consistent with nj      other   research based on large samples of indi-

vidual household data and on cross—country evidence.2 All of these studies sup-

port the conclusion that the level of social security benefits has a major

influence on individual saving behavior.

1Failure to reflect the 1972 legislative change has the anomalous effect of
making the coefficient of social wealth negative.
2 See Feldstein (1976, 1980b) and Feldstein and Pellechio (1979)        for studies
based on individual household data and Feldstein (1977, 1980a) for cross—country
evidence. None of those studies was affected by the computer program error in
the household time series.
