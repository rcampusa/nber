Access to Health Insurance and the Use of Inpatient Medical Care: Evidence from the Affordable
Care Act Young Adult Mandate

                                            ABSTRACT

The Affordable Care Act of 2010 expanded coverage to young adults by allowing them to remain
on their parent’s private health insurance until they turn 26 years old. While there is evidence on
insuranceeffects, we know very little about use of general or specific forms of medical care. We
study the implications of the expansion for the use of inpatient hospitalizations. Given the prevalence
of mental health needs for young adults, we also specifically study mental health related inpatient
care. We find evidence that compared to those aged 27-29 years, treated young adults aged 19-25
years increased their inpatient visits by 3.5 percent. Visits related to mental illness increased 9.0
percent. The prevalence of uninsurance among hospitalized young adults decreased by 12.5 percent;
however, it does not appear that the intensity of inpatient treatment changed despite the change in
reimbursement composition of patients.

I. Introduction

           In the United States, the transition from adolescence to young adulthood is associated

with the loss of health insurance coverage (Anderson, Dobkin, and Gross, 2012). Prior to the

Affordable Care Act (ACA), uninsurance among the non-elderly peaked at around ages 21 to 23

at close to 40 percent.1 The precarious health insurance status of young adults motivated the

early ACA provision that starting in September 2010 has allowed young adults to remain as

dependents on their parents’ private health insurance plans until they turn 26 years old. The

mandate has substantially reduced uninsurance in this population (Cantor et al., 2012; Sommers

and Kronick, 2012; Sommers et al., 2013; and Akosa Antwi, Moriya, and Simon, 2013).

However, there is as yet sparse evidence on the effect of this health insurance expansion on

young adults’ use of health care.


           Young adults are a key population targeted under the ACA even beyond the specific

mandate we study. On the one hand, because young adults are comparatively healthy, high

young-adult enrollment is seen as an important goal for the success of health insurance

exchanges (Weaver and Radnofsky, 2013). On the other hand, young adults tend to have high

mental health care needs (Grant and Potenza, 2010). Estimating the effect of this ACA young

adult insurance expansion on health care use in general as well as mental health care use in

particular is crucial for understanding the law fully, as well as for anticipating the effects of later

expansions on this population. Empirical evidence of the impact of this provision is of high

                                                          1
interest to policymakers, who will likely continue to fine-tune the details of the ACA for some

time; it also contributes to the growing academic literature on the effect of health insurance on

medical care use.

           We use the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), a nationally-representative database of

inpatient admissions, to evaluate the early effect of the ACA young adult insurance expansion on

the use of inpatient medical care in general and mental healthcare specifically, on treatment

intensity, and on insurance status of inpatient visits. Inpatient visits are rare but expensive

medical events and are a vital component of any effort to “bend the health care cost curve”. For

instance, for 19-to-25-year age group targeted by the ACA dependent care mandate, inpatient

visits represented about 31 percent of total health care expenditures even though only 5.4 percent

of individuals in this age group had an inpatient visit in 2008.2 We identify the effects of policy

on the targeted age group using a differences-in-differences (DD) method that compares the

treatment group of 19-to-25-year-olds to 27-to-29-year-olds, the latter being a comparison group

that is close to but excluded from the expansion. We also conduct extensive robustness checks

regarding the assumptions underlying this identification strategy and find them to be viable.

           We first examine the impact of the ACA young adult mandate on the total number of

non-birth hospitalizations. The transition from adolescence to adulthood often involves many life

changes that can trigger mental distress, making services related to mental illness an important

component of young adult medical care (Patel et al., 2007; and Yu et al., 2008). Not surprisingly,

                                                         2
mental disorder is the most frequent reason why young adults seek hospital-based care, aside

from visits related to childbirth.3 Thus, the second aspect we consider is the effect of the

mandate on mental illness admissions. For both types of utilization, we analyze the impact of the

mandate separately on admissions that originate from the emergency room (ER) and those that

are direct admissions. To shed light on the changes that hospitals will likely face in

reimbursement for young adult care as a result of reform, we estimate the change in insurance

composition as well. We end by evaluating the impact of the law on treatment intensity as

measured by length of stay, number of procedures, and hospital charges.

           We find that compared to slightly older young adults, those targeted by the law increased

their overall non-birth inpatient visits by 3.5 percent after the law’s implementation. This is

driven by direct inpatient admissions which tend to be more discretionary than admissions that

result from the ER, and might be more responsive to changes in health insurance coverage.

Consistent with evidence that mental illness treatment is more responsive to health insurance

coverage than general medical care, mental-illness-related inpatient visits increase by 9.0

percent, driven mainly by visits that originate through the ER. Corresponding to these changes in

service utilization, we find that the fraction of hospitalized young adults without insurance

decreased by 12.5 percent compared to other adults who did not benefit from the expansion. In

examining whether treatment intensity of hospital usage is affected, we find no robust evidence

of the impact of the law on length of stay, number of procedures, and total charges.

II. Prior Literature

The Effect of Health Insurance Expansion on Inpatient Care

       A large body of empirical research studies the effect of health insurance expansions on

the use of inpatient care. Studies on Medicaid and Medicare, for instance, find that they lead to

an increase in the consumption of inpatient medical care (Dafny and Gruber, 2005; Card,

Dobkin, and Maestas, 2008; and Finkelstein et al., 2012). But research on the impact of a near-

universal health insurance coverage expansion in Massachusetts finds no change in

hospitalizations (Kolstad and Kowalski, 2012).

       Research especially relevant for our work studies the impact of health insurance on

medical-care use by young adults. Anderson, Dobkin, and Gross (2012 and 2014) estimate the

effect of health insurance coverage on inpatient and ER visits by exploiting the sharp change in

insurance coverage rates that result from young adults “aging out” of their parent’s health

insurance plans at ages 19 and 23. They find significant reductions in inpatient and ER visits at

both age cutoffs. Losing health insurance at 23 decreases the probability of an inpatient visit by

77 percent. The same statistic at age 19 is 61 percent.



Effect of Insurance Expansion on Inpatient Mental Health Care

       Evidence from the RAND health insurance experiment shows that mental health care is

almost three times as responsive to insurance generosity as other forms of health care, (Manning


                                                 4
et al. 1989). While this evidence pertains to outpatient care only, it might have implications for

inpatient care as well. Research from the 2007 Massachusetts health insurance expansion in

Meara et al (2014) shows that there was little to no change in inpatient admissions for mental

health among young adults (consistent with Kolstad and Kowalski ( 2012)’s result for inpatient

care in general), and a small but statistically significant reduction in admissions for substance use

disorders. The authors caution that the generalizability of evidence from Massachusetts is not

straightforward since the availability of behavioral health outpatient providers is much higher in

Massachusetts than in other states.4



Effect of ACA Dependent Coverage on Use of Medical Care

         Although there is no prior work on the effect of the young adult mandate on inpatient

care, Sommers et al. (2013) find evidence that the mandate increased self-reported access to care

but had no statistically significant effect on self-reported usual source of care. Mulcahy et al.

(2013) find that the expansion led to a 3.1-percentage-point increase in the share of non-

discretionary emergency care that is paid by private insurance.

         Taken together, prior literature on the impact of health insurance on all and mental health

inpatient admissions is rather mixed. Some studies find a sizeable increase in use while others

find small or no effects. There is no literature on the impact of the ACA young adult mandate

  Meara et al. (2014) report that Massachusetts has 32.4 psychiatrists per 100,000 residents compared with 14.5 for
the United States.

inpatient admissions, but evidence suggests an increase in access to healthcare in general, but not

necessarily an increase in a usual source of care.

       Our research makes several distinct contributions. In addition to providing the first

evidence on the impact of the ACA dependent coverage expansion on inpatient use, we

contribute to the literature on the effect of insurance on use of care among young adults by

evaluating the effect of gaining rather than losing health insurance on medical use. Evidence

provided by Anderson, Dobkin, and Gross (2012 and 2013) measure the effect of anticipated loss

of health insurance on medical-care use. The effect of gaining and losing health insurance may

not be symmetric. Third, we examine the national impact of providing coverage to young adults

on their use of inpatient mental health care, a particularly high need in this age group. Fourth, we

examine the effect of the law on prevalence of insurance coverage among young adults using

inpatient services, and its implications for intensity of treatments provided.



III: Mechanisms

       The mechanisms by which the availability of health insurance is expected to affect

medical-care use have been well covered in prior literature (Finkelstein et al., 2012; Kolstad and

Kowalski, 2012; and Miller, 2012), thus our discussion of the hypotheses remains brief.

       Access to health insurance reduces the cost of medical care for the newly insured, and

moral hazard suggests that newly insured young adults would increase their consumption of

medical care. The effect of health insurance on how newly insured young adults enter the


                                                  6
medical system is not clear. If inpatient and outpatient care are substitutes for some conditions,

then having health insurance could reduce hospital admissions through better outpatient care.

Several studies reviewed above find inpatient care increases after insurance expansions,

suggesting hospital care could be on net a complement rather than a substitute for other forms of

care.

        The moral hazard of insurance is stronger in mental healthcare than other types of

healthcare (Horgan, 1986; Taube et. al, 1986; Frank and McGuire, 2000, Manning et. al 1989),

leading to an expectation that the ACA will likely increase mental health care use especially in

light of recent reductions in social stigma associated with seeking treatment (Mojtabai, 2007).

Garfield et al. (2011) predict that full implementation of the ACA will increase mental health

care use (including inpatient forms) by 4.5 percent. This increase will most likely not be uniform

across all US states given evidence from Massachusetts suggesting that inpatient mental health

care use may not increase in response to an expansion of health insurance coverage if there is

capacity for improved outpatient care (Meara et al. 2014). In addition, in response to the

perceived higher moral hazard of mental health care, insurers have traditionally placed greater

limitations on coverage for mental health services than other forms of care. These restrictions

gave rise to a movement of state mandates aimed at parity. Although a federal parity statute

passed in 1996, that law is relatively weak compared to state and federal laws passed since 2000

(Buchmueller et al., 2007). The 2008 Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act

(MHPAEA) was effective January 2010, and required closer parity between mental and medical


                                                 7
care coverage. It is unclear whether strong parity laws will lead to an increase in use of services

(HCCI 2014), partly because insurers have been adopting aggressive forms of management for

mental health care delivery. Providers could constrain the use of expensive forms of care which

is usually inpatient based by contracting with specialized managers to carve out mental health

care benefits (Goldman et al.1998 and Sturm, 1997). Barry and Ridgely (2008) find evidence

that insurance plans intensified their use of utilization management techniques in response to the

increased likelihood of moral hazard due to parity legislation.

       There are competing hypotheses about the likely effect of the mandate on overall

treatment intensity, conditional on hospitalization. The law is expected to change the health

insurance composition of hospitalized young adults by reducing the proportion of uninsured

visits and increasing the proportion covered by private insurance. If private health insurance

status leads to more treatment by health care providers (Doyle, 2005), then we would expect an

increase in treatment intensity after the law. Intensity of care may decrease, if the marginal

young adults seeking care after the expansion are healthier than others, especially since young

adults whose parents have private insurance tend to be from higher socio-economic status

families. Thus, the direction of predicted change in intensity is ambiguous, and we explore this

point using analyses that do and do not control for the case-mix of admissions.



IV. Data




                                                 8
         The main data we use for our analysis is from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS),

Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. .

The NIS data contains all discharges from a 20% stratified sample of community hospitals in the

United States. On average the NIS has information on about eight million hospital stays a year

from about 40 states in the U.S.5

         We use the NIS data from 2007 to 2011 (the latest year for which data is available) to

allow a sufficient look-back period to test for differences in trends between treatment and control

groups. Each observation in the NIS is a patient discharge abstract, which includes detailed

clinical information, such as primary and secondary diagnoses, and demographic information,

such as age, gender, and race/ethnicity. We restrict our attention to discharges for ages 19 to 29.

We follow prior literature by using non-birth visits.6 Our final sample is composed of 794,392

hospital visits. In our secondary analysis of mental illness visits, we restrict our sample 128,310

visits that belong to Major Diagnostic Category (MDC) 19: Mental Diseases and Disorders.7

Henceforth we refer to non-birth admissions as “all” admissions to distinguish them from our

secondary analysis which singles out mental health related admissions. Our data also includes


5
  Data from Alabama, Delaware, the District of Columbia, and Idaho are not in our sample because they do not
contribute data to the NIS in any year of our sample. We exclude data from California, Maine, and Texas because
precise information on age, which is crucial for our study design, is not available and thus prevents us from
separating the control and treatment groups. However, we note that results are qualitatively the same when we
include these states and estimate models with less than ideal control and treatment group age definitions.

  Non-birth visits here denote all inpatient visits except those classified as major diagnostic category 14: pregnancy,
childbirth and puerperium.
7
  The majority of mental health hospitalizations occur in community hospitals (Meara et al, 2014), but we note here
that specialty psychiatric hospitals and prison hospitals, which do not report data to AHRQ, are also a major source
of care.

                                                           9
information on health insurance status such as private insurance, Medicaid, Medicare, other

insurance, and no insurance. We cannot separately identify treated young adults who are

dependents on their parent’s health insurance from those who have their own ESI or non-group

insurance. To calculate our dependent variables measuring number of inpatient visits, we

aggregate hospital discharges by age and year-quarter for each hospital.



V. Method

       To estimate the effect of the federal young adult coverage expansion on inpatient medical

care, one must isolate the policy’s impact from contemporaneous national changes. We use a

difference-in-difference (DD) method that compares all targeted young adults, 19-25-year-olds

and a control group of 27-29-year-olds, who are as similar as possible in age but excluded from

the insurance expansion. We also conduct sensitivity checks comparing separately those who are

19-22 years and 23-25 years as alternate treatment subgroups to those 27-29 years (control

group). We also compare young adults on either side of the age cutoff, that is, 25 year-olds vs.

age 27 year-olds. We exclude 26-year-olds since we cannot accurately classify them as part of

either group. Our empirical strategy rests on the strong assumption that the control group will

account for other time-varying factors that would have led the treatment group to experience

different rates of medical care access and use after reform. We start our empirical work by

testing the validity of the DD estimator assumptions including common trends and also conduct

placebo tests using data prior to the ACA.


                                                10
       Our main analysis examines how the reform affected the use of inpatient medical care.

Using aggregated discharge data, we estimate a model similar to that of Kolstad and Kolwalski

(2012), who use the NIS to evaluate health reform in Massachusetts. Our estimating equation is:




       where Yhsgt represents our outcome variables of interest for ageg in hospital h, state s, and

quarter t. Implementt represents a dummy for the period after the law was implemented in

September 2010. Since our analysis is at the quarterly level, our implementation phase starts

from the fourth quarter of 2010 and runs through the latest period of available data , the fourth

quarter of 2011. The variable Treatg is a binary variable for membership in the 19-25 age range

(relative to the 27-29 range); in the non-interacted term Ageg we include a full set of age

indicators. The interaction of Implementt and Treatg captures the average impact after the law

was implemented in September 2010 by comparing hospital visits during this period to visits

before the enactment of the law among the treatment group relative to the control group.

       To examine possible anticipatory changes, we add a dummy variable,              , to capture

the period between enactment and implementation of the law, from April 2010 to September

2010, and its interaction with the treatment dummy variable. The Xst vector represents quarterly

linear state-specific time trends. The recession and the subsequent slow recover span our sample

period. These national macroeconomic conditions could differentially affect the use of hospital-

based medical care by our treatment and control groups. Although we conduct tests of

                                                 11
differential time trends prior to reform to validate our study design, we account for the possibility

that the macroeconomy could also influence age trends after reform by including two variables:

the quarterly unemployment rate, and its interaction with age dummies. We also include dummy

variables for year and quarter in τt, to control for seasonality and year fixed effects that are

common to the treatment and control groups. We include hospital fixed effects in ζhs to account

for time-invariant hospital characteristics. We use ordinary least squares to estimate all of our

continuous outcomes and the linear probability models for our binary outcomes. To account for

correlation of hospital-level errors over time due to common forces, we cluster standard errors by

hospital. However, inference drawn from this model may be incorrect as the policy variation

occurs only at the age by time level. We are not able to block-bootstrap the standard errors as

suggested by Bertrand et al. (2004) because we have an extremely small number of “groups”

(two). Thus, we follow Cameron, Gelbach, and Miller (2008) by estimating our main model

alternatively by aggregating data to the national age by year-quarter level, and implement the

Wild cluster bootstrap method using time as the grouping variable. Our results from this

estimation, which we report in the appendix, reinforce the results stemming from our models that

cluster at the hospital level. We also estimate all reported models by aggregating data to the age

by time level and clustering at the age level, and find qualitatively similar results [results

available upon request].



VI. Results


                                                  12
Summary Statistics

           We present sample means of our treatment and control groups, before and after ACA

implementation, in Table 1. Other than for the expected age differences between the older and

younger cohorts, the means of most demographic and clinical variables appear similar across

groups and over time. Targeted young adults have a higher likelihood of a mental health

admission (17.7 percent) compared to slightly older adults (15.2 percent) in the period prior to

ACA enactment. The spread increases in the post implementation period, with the likelihood

rising to 19.2 percent for the targeted group relative to 15.7 percent for the slightly older group.

There is very little other evidence in the descriptive statistics of differential changes in clinical

characteristics or utilization measures.

           When we consider health insurance status as our outcome, we see some stark differences

in the mean changes experienced by the two groups. Conditional on seeking inpatient care, older

adults are less likely to have private health insurance over time (37.9 percent vs. 32.4 percent)

while private coverage increases slightly among targeted young adults (38.9 percent vs 39.5

percent). There is corresponding evidence of reductions in uninsurance among targeted young

adults relative to slightly older adults.8

       Estimating the impact of policies by comparisons between national treatment and control

groups involve especially strong assumptions. For example, when we identify the impact of the

mandate on hospitalizations by comparing the count of admissions by our treatment and control

groups before and after the law, we assume the control group and treatment group would have

similar trends absent the law. Given the fact that our sample coincides with the most recent

recession, this assumption is even stronger if there is a differential impact of the recession on

younger vs older adults. Roberts and Terrell (2014) find evidence that job market prospects

deteriorated furthest for new job market entrants during the past recession. A volatile

macroeconomy is linked to greater indications of depressive symptoms (Tefft, 2011), increased

suicide (Luo et al., 2011), and losses of health insurance (Cawley, Moriya and Simon, 2013)

which likely further exacerbate health conditions. Maclean (2013) finds that leaving school in a

bad economy has a persistent negative impact on the health outcomes of men and Kuhn, Lalive

and Zweimüller (2009) find that job loss increases the use of mental health care, including

inpatient care. Our treatment group of 19 to 25 year-olds contain ages when young adults leave

school and are new workers, thus we turn next to testing the time trends of outcomes by age prior

to the law.

       Following Akosa Antwi, Moriya, and Simon (2013), one approach to increasing

confidence in our ability to use those older than 26 to capture trends in hospitalizations that

would have affected younger adults had the policy not occurred would be to examine the trends

of our outcomes of interest prior to the law’s implementation. If we were to find that


                                                 14
hospitalization rates increased for the treatment group relative to the control group even prior to

the policy, this would suggest that the impact we estimate could be a continuation of prior trends.

       We first present visual pre-trends of main analysis in Figures 1- 4. In Figure 1, we show

trends for number of visits for our treatment and control groups. The vertical lines represent the

passage of the law, the implementation of the law in September 2010 and the start of 2011, when

most new health insurance plans start respectively. We plot graphs for overall visits, visits

through an ER, and visits not through an ER for our main sample and sample with mental illness

diagnosis. The plots are quarterly unconditional means of the aforementioned variables. For all

visits, visits that originated from the ER, and visits not originating from the ER (top row), we

observe differences between the treatment and control groups in levels, but no visible differences

in trends. There is some evidence of differential trends after the implementation of the law,

especially in the bottom row graph for mental illness admissions through an ER.

       In Figure 2, we examine trends by health insurance status. In the first row of plots, visual

inspection of the first graph shows that the two groups follow a similar trend before the law, with

a sharp increase in the share of treatment group visits paid by private insurance after the

implementation. The second plot shows the trend for the uninsured. Again, the two groups

follow a similar trend before the law, with a sharp post-law decrease in the share of visits

accounted for by uninsured young adults who are targeted by the law. In Figures 3 and 4, we

show trends for our treatment intensity variables for all visits and mental illness visits. These

plots show no strong pre-trends and no sharp changes post-law either.


                                                 15
       We formalize our trend tests in Table 2 by estimating regressions with our outcomes of

interest as left-hand-side variables. We only use data prior to the enactment of the law. The right-

hand-side variables for this regression include the same control variables as our main model,

described above, except that the key variable of interest is an interaction between the linear time

trend and the treatment group dummy instead of the usual difference-in-difference variables. In

the first panel of Table 2, which covers all admissions and mental illness admissions, we show

that none of the trends are statistically significantly different between the treatment and control

groups in the period prior to the ACA. In the second and third panels, we report our pre-reform

trend test for insurance results and intensity of treatment for both types of care. For all health

insurance outcomes, our treatment and control groups follow similar pre-trends. In the intensity

of treatment trends, we see one marginally statistically significantly different trend for log length

of stay (LOS) when risk adjustment variables are included, and four statistically significantly

different trends in terms of charges (both levels and logs), when risk adjustment variables are

excluded. Overall, these pre-trend tests are reassuring, especially for admissions volume, and

health insurance composition of the admissions. As additional checks on the validity of our study

design, we also conduct placebo tests, and estimate models that compare between 25 and 27

year olds, who are very close in age, and thus less likely to be differentially affected by other

forces such as recession. All analyses provide reassuring evidence that the assumptions behind

the DD study design are valid.

Impact of the ACA Young Adult Mandate on Use of Medical Care and Source of Admission

       Table 3 contains regression results from Equation [1], where the dependent variable is the

number of admissions at the quarter, hospital, and age level. The results indicate that the

implementation of the law had a statistically significant impact on overall inpatient visits.

Relative to a mean average quarterly visits per hospital per age of 7.27 prior to the passage of the

law, the coefficient of 0.253 in the second set of rows of column 1 of Table 3 indicates that the

overall number of visits increased by 3.5 percent. Our result on the impact of the ACA dependent

coverage expansion on overall visits is comparable in direction with Anderson, Dobkin, and

Gross (2012), who find that young adults decrease their visits for non-birth inpatient visits when

they age out of insurance.

       In considering the possible substitution away from ER care to outpatient care, we

investigate the effect of the health insurance expansion on the source of inpatient admission by

estimating the impact of the law on ER and non-ER admissions. In columns 2 and 3 of Table 3,

we find that our overall result is driven by direct hospital admissions that bypass the ER. Direct

hospital admissions tend to be scheduled visits and are likely more sensitive to health insurance

access, hence the larger percent increase is not surprising.



Impact of the ACA Young Adult Mandate on Mental Illness Visits

       We study mental health admissions separately because they may be especially impacted

by the ACA young adult mandate given the particular health needs of this population. We


                                                 17
present our analysis of the impact of the mandate on the total number of mental health

admissions in the last three columns of Table 3. We find a statistically significant 9 percent

increase in the number of visits after implementation. These results differ from Meara et al.

(2014) finding for Massachusetts that shows no or small decreases in mental health inpatient

visits after reform. Parsing our results by the source of admission, we find that visits originating

from the ER comprise a significant portion of our overall mental health results. Our estimate for

non-ER admissions after the law, while positive and marginally statistically significant, is

smaller in magnitude.



Impact of the ACA Young Adult Mandate on the Health Insurance Status of Inpatient Visits

       In Table 4, we evaluate the impact of the mandate on the health insurance composition of

young adults who sought inpatient care after the reform using the same sample and regression

framework we describe above. The dependent variable here is the fraction of the hospital-age-

quarter-level inpatient population with private insurance, no insurance, Medicaid, Medicare, and

other insurance. These health insurance categories are mutually exclusive, so the horizontal sum

of all the coefficients presented in Table 4 is zero. Our DD estimate presented in the first column

of the top panel of Table 4 shows that the proportion of young adults in our treatment group with

private insurance increased by 2.1 and 6 percentage points, respectively, as a result of the

enactment and the implementation of the law. Relative to the mean baseline quarterly fraction of

privately insured visits, these represent 5.3 and 15.3 percent increases in private coverage of all


                                                 18
visits among our treatment group. This result is not surprising as mandate expanded health

insurance coverage to young adults whose parents have private health insurance. Our next set of

results shows that the fraction of young adults in our treatment group without health insurance

decreased by a marginally statistically significant 1 percentage point (4.4 percent) and

statistically significant 2.9 percentage points (12.5 percent) as a result of the law’s enactment and

implementation respectively. There is a statistically significant negative coefficient associated

with reform implementation for Medicaid and other insurance coverage.


        The bottom panel of Table 4 shows the impact of the law on the health insurance status

of hospitalized young adults with a mental illness diagnosis. In the first column, we estimate a

5.8 percentage-point (17.7 percent) increase in the fraction of young adult mental-health-related

inpatient visits paid through private health insurance. There is also suggestive evidence of a

small decrease in the prevalence of uninsurance among mental-illness-related inpatient care. We

also find evidence of a large decline, 3.1 percentage points (9.1 percent), in mental illness visits

reimbursed by the Medicaid program. We find no meaningful impact of the law on Medicare or

on other forms of insurance payment (last two columns).



Impact of the ACA Young Adult Mandate on the Treatment Intensity of Inpatient Visits

       We study treatment intensity using a DD regression model that is similar to Equation [1]

except that the unit of observation for this model is at the individual level rather than the

hospital-quarter level. In the Massachusetts context, Kolstad and Kowlaski (2012) argue that if

                                                  19
health insurance expansion alters the observable characteristics of patients who seek care, then

including these characteristics in a regression framework would blunt any estimated impact of

the reform. As a result they estimate models with and without controlling for patient

demographics and clinical characteristics and consider the model without patient characteristics

as the preferred specification. We do the same in our evaluation of the impact of the mandate on

treatment intensity. For models in which we include patient characteristics, we include a new

vector Zighst not present in Equation [1]. This vector contains patient demographics and clinical

indicators such as age, gender, race/ethnicity, whether the patient was admitted on the weekend,

Charlson Index, the number of diagnosis codes (up to nine codes), an indicator for each of 27

comorbidity measures calculated using the HCUP Comorbidity Software, and indicator variables

for Major Diagnostic Categories (MDCs).

        As with our study of the number of hospitalizations, we consider all non-birth inpatient

visits (Table 5) and visits related to mental illness (Table 6). Starting in columns 1 and 2 of Table

5, we find that there is no statistically significant effect of the law on the levels or log

transformation of length of stay. There is also no effect on the number of procedures. We find

marginally statistically significant effect on total charges (but not log charges), with the

enactment and implementation showing opposite signed and small changes. Thus, our results for

total charges are sensitive to the inclusion of patient characteristics and functional form

assumption, but overall suggest minimal change.




                                                   20
       In Table 6, we present the impact of the ACA mandate on intensity of mental-health-

related inpatient visits. Across the different specifications, there are only two coefficients that are

statistically significant, and they are both significant at the 10 percent level only. Moreover, both

results are small and are sensitive to functional form (in one case the log specification is

significant while the level is not, and vice versa in the other case). Overall we find a small and

mainly statistically insignificant effect of the young adult mandate on the treatment intensity of

young adults.



VII. Heterogeneous Effect of the Mandate

       Given prior research findings from Massachusetts that mental health results can vary by

exact type, and that substance use is a closely related disorder that is also highly relevant to the

young adult population, we explore this heterogeneity in analysis presented in Table 7. We

separated the MDC 19 mental health category into subcategories of depression, psychoses and

other mental illness, using the relevant International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 9 codes.

       In Table 7, we see that for depression, there are sizable and statistically significant

increases in all inpatient admissions and visits through the ER. Using unreported baseline means,

the coefficient magnitudes are on the order of 8.5 percent and 11.3 percent increases. There are

also sizable insurance shifts in this category of hospitalizations, with private insurance

increasing, and uninsurance and Medicaid decreasing by similar magnitudes; other insurance

also decreases. We also observe sizable increases in psychoses admissions after implementation,


                                                  21
stemming mostly from visits through the ER. There is no statistically significant increase in other

mental illness admissions, although insurance composition shifts towards private coverage and

away from Medicaid. The health insurance shifts are not surprising given the strong negative link

between mental health and employment that prior to the law, young adults who suffer from

mental illness are likely to participate in the Medicaid program. In Table 7, we also examine

another category of admission that is of high relevance for young adults: substance abuse

admissions (Frank and McGuire, 2000; Meara et al. 2014). Somewhat surprisingly, there is no

indication of increases in inpatient admissions, although consistent with all our other findings,

we document evidence of strong private insurance gains. The lack of increase in substance use

admissions could indicate that becoming insured allows better management of care outside the

hospital for this disorder, as this is the category of care for which inpatient admissions decreased

the most in Meara et al (2014).

       Another dimension of heterogeneity we explore is at the age level. Although our main

analysis uses treatment and control groups that are relatively close in age (19-25-year-olds vs.

27-29-year-olds), a closer comparison would use those just below and above the age cutoff of 26.

Specifically, we evaluate the impact of the mandate by comparing 25-year-olds to 27-year-olds.

These two age groups are likely the most similar on observable characteristics and the influence

of macroeconomic factors. We re-estimate our analysis reported in Table 3 (inpatient admissions

volume) in Table 8, and find estimates that are consistent with but larger than our main results in

Table 3. Compared to 27-year-olds and relative to the period before the law, among 25-year-


                                                 22
olds, the number of admissions increased by 5.9 percent; admissions through the ER increased

by 5.3 percent, and admissions that did not originate from the ER increased by 7.1 percent. The

corresponding numbers in Table 3 are 3.5 percent, 6 percent and 9 percent.



VIII. Further Robustness Checks

       An implicit assumption we make in comparing the change in volume of inpatient

admissions for the treatment versus control group is that the relative cohort size of the two

groups does not change during our sample period. However, an alternative explanation for the

3.5-percent increase in the number of visits we estimate could be that the population of 19-to-25-

year-olds increased faster than the population of 25-to-29-year-olds. We verify that population

trends do not drive our results by aggregating our data to the national level (by age and time) and

dividing by population estimates available from U.S. Census Bureau from 2007 to 2011. We also

use this specification to implement the standard error solution suggested by Cameron, Gelbach,

and Miller (2008) in the presence of a small number of groups across which variation occurs. We

present these results in Appendix Table 1, along with a test of the common trends assumption for

this model. We see that the results are qualitatively very similar to those in Table 3. Statistical

significance of results in Appendix Table 1 is slightly higher in one case, but the same in all

other cases, relative to Table 3. Inpatient admissions now increase by 2.75 percent (relative to

3.5 percent earlier), and mental health admissions increase by 7.25 percent (relative to 9 percent

earlier); results for other specifications are also similar. The common trends tests also remains


                                                  23
fairly plausible, but there is now one statistic (for admissions not through the ER) that is

marginally statistically significantly different.

        While in Table 8 we showed results for the 25 year old subset of the treatment group, in

Appendix Table 2 and 3, we show results for further subsets. In Appendix Table 2 we find that

among 19-22 year olds (relative to 27-29 year olds), there is a 3.9 percent increase in inpatient

admissions and a 11.3 percent increase in mental health visits. Appendix Table 3 shows that

among 23-25 year olds, relative to 27-29 year olds, there is a 2.9 percent increase in inpatient

visits and 5.8 percent increase in mental health, suggesting that there are statistically significant

effects among both younger and older segments of the treatment group. There is evidence of

common trends between treatment and control groups for all relevant statistics except one.

        Last, we conduct a set of placebo tests where we estimate several additional models

falsely assuming that the reform took place in quarters prior to March 2010. For each of the 11

quarters between January 2007 and March 2010 and using data from this time period, we re-

estimate Equation [1] assuming a placebo date for the ACA law and create a distribution of the

results from the replications. We perform this test for both all and mental illness admissions, as

well as for our subsample analysis of 25- vs. 27-year-olds and report results in Appendix Table

4.

        We first examine the mean and standard deviation of the estimates reported in Appendix

Table 4 relative to the values obtained in Tables 2, and 3 for our sample of all and mental-health-

related admissions, for quantity of visits as well as the insurance composition of visits. When we


                                                    24
consider our sample of all admissions, only one specification out of eight has two or more

placebo results that are statistically significant at the 10-percent-or-smaller level. One

specification contains one placebo result that is statistically significant at the 10% percent level.

We note that the coefficients of placebo laws are smaller than those we obtain in Tables 3 and 4.

Among the mental health illness categories, only four out of 88 possible estimates are

statistically significantly different from zero: one at the 1-percent level, and three at the 10-

percent level. Since significance at the 10 percent level contains zero, we interpret our placebo

analysis as suggesting that the impact of the law that we estimate is not due to chance.

       As with our trends tests, even though of estimates of the impact of the law on treatment

intensity are sensitive to functional form assumptions and are mainly not statistically significant,

we find instances of statistically significant tests for our treatment intensity variables in our

placebo analysis. In Appendix Tables 6, we show that in total there are 19 placebo results that

are statistically significant at the 5% or lower level, out of a possible 132 cases. In Appendix

Table 7, we present placebo tests for the treatment intensity of mental illness admissions. We see

here that there are 17 placebo tests that show statistically significant effects, out of a possible

132. In summary, the validity tests in this section confirm that our study design is reasonable and

that our estimates likely capture the effects of the mandate rather than the difference in trends

between the treatment and control groups. Even though the number of estimates that are

significant for our treatment intensity variables is not very far from what would be expected by




                                                  25
chance alone, we note that these are also the outcomes that show the least consistent effects due

to reform.

IX. Discussion and Conclusion

        We present the first estimates of the impact of the ACA health insurance expansion on

inpatient medical care received by young adults using a nationally representative database of

inpatient hospital visits. We estimate the impact of the law on 19-25-year-olds, for whom access

to parental insurance coverage was especially poor prior to the ACA. We find evidence of

greater demand response to health insurance coverage for mental health care than for medical

care. Compared to another group of individuals who are close in age but excluded from the law

(27-29-year-olds), young adults who benefitted from the mandate increased their overall number

of non-birth inpatient visits by 3.5 percent. This result is driven mainly by admissions not

through the ER. In our exploration of the impact of the mandate on mental health visits, an

important component of inpatient care use by young adults, we find that young adults increased

their visits by 9 percent. Unlike general admissions, the increase in mental health admissions

arises mainly through the ER. We also find strong evidence that the law achieved its intended

purpose of decreasing uninsurance among young adults who use hospital-based care. The

fraction of young adult hospitalizations that is uninsured decreased by 2.9 percentage points

(12.5 percent) due to the law. Our analysis of the impact of the mandate on the intensity of

medical care shows no consistent or significant change in how long young adults stay in a

hospital, the number of procedures that are performed on them, or on hospital charges.


                                                26
       Our findings contribute to the literature on the effect of health insurance coverage on

access and medical care utilization. The general consensus in the literature is that health

insurance increases the use of medical services, including inpatient care. Our findings are

consistent with this hypothesis as we find that young adults increased their overall use of

inpatient services in response to gaining access to health insurance.

       However, our results differ from the experience of Massachusetts which saw no change

in general inpatient admissions (Kolstad and Kowalski, 2012) and no change or small decreases

in use of mental health care by young adults (Meara et al 2014). We note that the health

insurance expansion we study here is much smaller than other large-scale efforts such as the

near-universal health insurance expansion in Massachusetts. In addition, we study the short-run

effect of the ACA health insurance expansion on young adults, leaving for future work the

examination of the long-run effects. The findings by Meara et al.(2014) of no change or

decreases in the use of hospital-based mental health care by young adults after the Massachusetts

health insurance reform could reflect the availability of outpatient mental health care providers in

Massachusetts that might be absent in other states. This means that the interaction of demand

and supply-side constraints could determine the long and short run impact of health insurance

expansions. Cunningham (2009) finds that shortage of mental health care providers is as much a

barrier to mental health care access as lack of health insurance coverage.

       There are several other limitations to our work. Since we use hospital discharge data that

do not contain individual identifiers, we are unable to distinguish whether the increase in


                                                27
inpatient visits we document is the result of increased frequency of visits by the same patients or

an increase in visits by new patients. We also do not observe visits to private mental health

hospitals. Future work using household- or individual-level surveys as well as more

comprehensive hospital data sets will help us better understand the mechanism behind the

increase in inpatient care use found in this study, as well as shed light on the effects of the law on

the use of care in other settings.

Note: Sample estimates from the NIS data, 2007-2011, using data of non-birth related admissions of young adults aged from 19-29,
except for the removal of 26 year olds who are in neither control nor treatment. Means of the variables are obtained for treatment and
control groups before ACA enactment (2007 Q1- 2010 Q1) and after ACA implementation (2010 Q4 and onward). The data from
California, Maine and Texas are excluded because precise information on age was not available. Observations in which length of stay
exceeds 90 days are excluded. The mean for the race categories is calculated using observations in which race\ethnicity variable is
available in the data. Not all states provide information on race\ethnicity for all years in the NIS dataset.

admissions covered by other insurance. Third panel - column 1: length of stay; column 2: log of the sum of length of stay and one; column 3:
number of procedure codes (up to six codes); column 4: total charges; and column 5: log of the sum of total charges and one. (5) Cells of the table
contain: coefficients, and standard errors in parentheses. Coefficients are from the interaction of a dummy variable for treatment group and a
linear measure for time trend (number of quarters since the first quarter of 2007), which shows whether there was a different time trend for the
control vs. the treatment group in the period prior to policy enactment. (6) Other regressors are a linear time trend, a dummy variable for the
treatment group, and all other explanatory variables included in our main specification. (7) Standard errors are clustered at the hospital level.

Notes: (1) Number of observations is 158,740 in the first three columns and 57,930 in the last three columns. (2) Quarterly hospital-age level variables are calculated using the non-birth related admissions
(for columns 1-3) and mental illness admissions (for columns 4-6) of young adults aged from 19-29, except for the removal of 26 year olds who are in neither control nor treatment. (3) Cells of the table
contain: coefficients and standard errors in parentheses. Coefficients in the first row are from the interaction of a dummy variable for treatment group (19-25 years old) and a dummy variable for the period
after ACA enactment but before implementation (the second and third quarters of 2010); coefficients in the second row are from the interaction of a dummy variable for treatment group and a dummy
variable for the period after ACA implementation (the fourth quarter of 2010 and onwards). (4) Data: The NIS data from 2007 to 2011. The data from California, Maine and Texas are excluded because
precise information on age was not available. Observations in which length of stay exceeds 90 days are excluded. (5) Dependent variables— column 1: number of all non-birth related admissions; column 2:
number of non-birth related admissions originated from the ER; column 3: number of non-birth-related admissions that did not originate from the ER; column 4: number of total mental illness admissions;
column 5: number of mental illness admissions originated from the ER; and column 6: number of mental illness admissions that did not originate from the ER. (6) Other regressors are an indicator for each
age, year fixed effects, quarterly fixed effects, state-specific linear time trend, hospital-specific fixed effects, quarterly national-level unemployment rate, interaction of unemployment and an indicator for
each age. (7) Means of dependent variables are obtained for treatment and control groups before ACA enactment (2007 Q1- 2010 Q1) and after ACA implementation (2010 Q4 and onward). See Note (7)
under Table 2. *** Significant at the 1 percent level. ** Significant at the 5 percent level. * Significant at the 10 percent level.

Notes: (1) Number of observations is 1,246,517 in the first four columns and 1,242,770 in the last two columns. (2) Observations are non-birth-related admissions of young adults aged from 19-29, except for
the removal of 26 year olds who are in neither control nor treatment. Observations in which length of stay exceeds 90 days are excluded. (3) Dependent variables—column 1: length of stay; column 2: log of
the sum of length of stay and one; column 3: number of procedure codes (up to six codes); column 4: total charges; and column 5: log of the sum of total charges and one. (4) Other regressors - an indicator
for the period after ACA enactment but before implementation, an indicator for the period after ACA implementation, an indicator for treatment group, year-specific fixed effects, quarter-specific fixed
effects, quarterly state-specific linear time trends, hospital-specific fixed effects, quarterly national unemployment rate, and interaction of unemployment rate and an indicator for each age are included in the
both sets of regressions. Risk-adjusted variables that are included in the second set of the regressions are an indicator for each year of age, gender, race/ethnicity, an indicator for admission occurred on the
weekend, Charlson Index, the number of diagnosis codes (up to nine codes), an indicator for each of 27 comorbidity measures obtained by the HCUP Comorbidity Software, and indicator variables for major
diagnostic categories. (5) See Note (7) under Table 2 and Notes (3), (4), (5) and (7) under Table 3. *** Significant at the 1 percent level. ** Significant at the 5 percent level. * Significant at the 10 percent

 Notes: (1) Number of observations is 111,118 in the first three columns and 40,551 in the last three columns. (2) Quarterly hospital-age level variables are calculated using the non-birth
 related admissions (for columns 1-3) and mental illness admissions (for columns 4-6) of young adults aged from 19-22, and 27-29 year olds. (3) Cells of the table contain: coefficients
 and standard errors in parentheses. Coefficients in the first row are from the interaction of a dummy variable for treatment group (19-22 years old) and a dummy variable for the period
 after ACA enactment but before implementation (the second and third quarters of 2010); coefficients in the second row are from the interaction of a dummy variable for treatment group
 and a dummy variable for the period after ACA implementation (the fourth quarter of 2010 and onwards). (4) See Note (7) under Table 2 and Notes (4) –(7) under Table 3.

 Notes: (1) Number of observations is 95,244 in the first three columns and 34,758 in the last three columns. (2) Quarterly hospital-age level variables are calculated using the non-
 birth related admissions (for columns 1-3) and mental illness admissions (for columns 4-6) of young adults aged from 23-29, except for the removal of 26 year olds who are in
 neither control nor treatment. (3) Cells of the table contain: coefficients and standard errors in parentheses. Coefficients in the first row are from the interaction of a dummy variable
 for treatment group (23-25 years old) and a dummy variable for the period after ACA enactment but before implementation (the second and third quarters of 2010); coefficients in
 the second row are from the interaction of a dummy variable for treatment group and a dummy variable for the period after ACA implementation (the fourth quarter of 2010 and
 onwards). (4) See Note (7) under Table 2 and Notes (4) – (7) under Table 3.

Note: (1) Data: The NIS data for the period from the first quarter of 2007 to the fourth quarter of 2009, which is prior to the passage of the ACA in March 2010. The data from California, Maine and Texas
are excluded because precise information on age was not available. (2) We select each possible quarter between the second quarter of 2007 and the fourth quarter of 2009 one at a time. We then estimate the
main model using each separate placebo date for defining the “Implement” variable. We show here the means and standard deviations of the coefficients we obtain. (3) The last two columns repeat estimates
from Tables 3 and 4 for comparison.
