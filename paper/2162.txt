              The Liberalization of the Current Capital
                 Accounts and the Real Exchange Rate

                               ABSTRACT



In this paper a general equilibrium intertemporal model with
optimizing consumers and producers is developed to analyze how
different policies geared at liberalizing the current and capital
accounts of the balance of payments affect the equilibrium real
exchange rate (RER). In particular, the effects of a reduction in
the level of import tariffs and of a change in the tax on foreign
borrowing on the equilibrium RER are investigated. In the case of

import tariffs, both a temporary and an anticipated liberalization
are considered. It is shown that in the case of tariffs reduction
it is not possible to know a priori whether the equilibrium RER
will appreciate or depreciate. However, a liberalization of the

capital account will always result in an equilibrium real
appreciation in the current period. It is then argued that analyses
of this type are essential to evaluate whether observed movements
in the RER represent a inisalignement situation or if they are an

equilibrium phenomenon. The case of the recent liberalization
attempts in the Southern Cone are also discussed.

I. Introduction

       The disappointing outcome of the liberalization attempts undertaken in

the Southern Cone during the late 1970s has generated a large interpretative

literatureJ Most analyses on these experiences have pointed out that the

real exchange rate appreciation observed in Argentina, Chile and Uruguay

during the late 1970s and early 1980s was one of the most -   - if not the most
--
     important   cause behind the frustration of these experiments.2 Surpris-

ingly, however, the great majority of these studies have only noted the fact

that the real exchange rate appreciated, without embarking on serious

discussions on the extent to which these real exchange rate movements were

indeed disecjuilibriurn movements, that led to an unsustainable real exchange

rate overvaluation. Most studies, in fact, have simply resorted to some

type of simple PPP type calculation to compute the magnitude of the real

exchange rate "overvaluation".3

      A major shortcoming of that approach is that it completely ignores the

effects of the major structural changes to which these economies were

subject (including the liberalizations) on the equilibrium value of the RER.

Since real exchange rate overvaluation is defined as a substantial and

sustained departure of the actual RER from its equilibrium value, it is

absolutely necessary to have at least an approximate idea on how the

equilibrium RER has moved during the period under study.

       In environments like that of the Southern Cone, where major structural

changes take place in a short period of time, it is meaningless to talk


     1See, for example, Calvo (1986), Corbo (1985), Edwards (1985), Edwards
and Cox-Edwards (1987), Harberger (1983), Foxley (1984).

about exchange rate overvaluation without first seriously analyzing the

movements of the equilibrium RER. This is perhaps best illustrated in the

case of Chile. Figure 1 depicts the evolution of Chile's effective real

exchange rate. This index was constructed as REER = (EbP*b)/P   where Eb

is a weighted average of Chile's bilateral nominal exchange rates relative

to its 10 major trading partners,       is a weighted average of these part-

ners WPIs and P is Chile's CPI. As can be seen from this figure, between

1965 and 1970 there was a slow and steady real depreciation which broadly

corresponds to the mild trade liberalization undertaken by the Frei

administration. During this period a crawling peg nominal exchange rate

helped to achieve and maintain this depreciating real exchange rate. The

period 1970-73 corresponds to the socialist government of Dr. Salvador

Allende, where expansive macropolicies and the massive imposition of

exchange controls resulted in forces that appreciated the real rate by

almost 50%. In terms of other "fundamentals", during this period the terms

of trade fluctuated without exhibiting a definitive trend.

     The years 1974-84 correspond to the first decade of the Pinochet

regime. The first thing that stands out from the diagram is that between

the period 1965-73 and 1974-84 there is a clear structural break in the real

exchange rate behavior. Throughout 1974-84, in spite of broad fluctuations,

the real exchange rate was at all times significantly higher than at any

time during the previous ten years. Between mid-1979 and mid-1982 the by-

now much discussed real appreciation of the Chilean peso took place.4 What

is fascinating is to notice that although during this period (mid-1979-


     4This appreciation was the result of two interrelated factors:
(1) the opening of the capital account, which resulted in a flooding of the
economy with foreign funds; and (2) the fixing of the nominal exchange
rate as a way to bring down inflation. Edwards and Cox-Edwards (1987).

mid-1982) the RER declined by 30%, it was still almost 70% higher than its

peak during 1965-73! This, of course, provides a vivid illustration of how

changes in fundamentals can greatly change the equilibrium value of the real

exchange rate. A RER that would have been excessively "high" in the 1970s,

before the tariff liberalization and structural worsening of the terms of

trade, was fatally low in the early l980s.

     Surprisingly, the theoretical literature on economic liberalization has

treated in an extremely sketchy and even superficial form the crucial ques-

tion on how the equilibrium RER is affected by the reforms themselves.5

Most of the existing literature that has focused on the effects of tariff

changes on RER has either been partial equilibrium in nature or has ignored

intertemporal issues.

     The purpose of the present paper is to develop a general equilibrium

intertemporal model to analyze formally the effect of different economic

liberalization policies on equilibrium RER. The understanding of the

economics of equilibrium RER adjustments during a liberalization reform is a

fundamental first step in any attempt to analyze whether in a particular

country the RER becomes overvalued following a liberalization reform. The

rest of the paper concentrates exclusively on the theoretical model, without

making an actual attempt to compute the path followed by the equilibrium RER

in these countries.6 The paper is organized as follows: in Section II a

very general intertemporal equilibrium model of a small open economy that


     5There are, of course, a few exceptions. Balassa (1982) discusses
rather informally the connection between import tariffs reform and the
equilibrium RER. McKinnon (1973) discusses informally the impact of both
trade and capital account liberalization on the real exchange rate.

     6Harberger (1986b) develops a simulation model to deal with some of
these issues.

produces three goods (exportables, importables and nontradables) is

presented. Here the concept of equilibrium RER in an intertemporal setting

is discussed, and the modeling strategy is set forward. Section III deals

with tariff liberalization and the equilibrium RER. Here a distinction

between temporary and anticipated reduction in import tariffs is made. In

Section IV the effects of a capital account liberalization on the equilib-

rium RER are analyzed. Finally, Section V includes the concluding remarks

and some further reflections regarding the case of the Southern Cone.


II. The Ceneral Model

     In order to keep the exposition at the simplest possible level a number

of simplifying assumptions are made. Although the framework used is general

enough as to accommodate many goods and factors, it is useful to think of

this economy as producing three goods --      exportables   (X), importables (M)
and nontradables (N)    -   - using   standard technology, under perfect competi-

tion. Capital is sector specific, while labor can move freely across all

three sectors. There is no investment, capital accumulation or growth.

(See, however, Section IV.) We consider two periods only --       periods   1 and

2. In the general case international borrowing is subject to a tax. The

intertemporal constraint is that at the end of period 2 the country has paid

its foreign debts. The importation of M is subject to specific import

tariffs both in periods 1 and 2.      Since there is no investment, the current

account is exactly equal to savings in each period. If the residents of the

country dis-save in period 1, their expenditure will exceed their income,

and the corresponding current account deficit will be financed through

borrowing from abroad. On the preferences side, it is assumed that the

utility function is weakly separable, with preferences in each period being
                                                  6




identically homothetical. This assumption turns out to be very convenient,

since it permits the use of within-period exact price indexes, as suggested

by Svensson and Razin (1983). The nominal exchange rate is fixed and equal

to one. The price of X is taken as the numeraire. The model is complet-

ely real; all monetary considerations are ignored.

     The model is worked out using duality and is given by equations (1)

through (5).     (On the use of duality in international economics see Dixit

and Norman, 1980.) Superscripts refer to periods (i.e., R2 is the revenue

function in period 2); subscripts refer to partial derivatives with respect

to that variable (i.e., Rj is the partial derivative of period l's

                                         Eqi)


11.1 The Concept of Equilibrium Real Exchange Rates

     In models with importables and exportabies the definition of "the" real

exchange rate becomes "tricky", since the by-now traditional concept of

relative price of tradables to nontradables loses some meaning. The reason,

of course, is that if there are shocks that affect the price of X relative

to M, it is not possible to talk about the Hicks ian composite "tradables"

anymore. For this reason, and in order to simplify the exposition, in the

first part of this paper where we discuss the trade reform, we will focus on

the relative price of nontradables to exports q.               In Section IV, however,

where we analyze the liberalization of the capital account (i.e., an

increase in .5)   with no changes in tariffs, we concentrate on the more

traditional relative price of tradables to nontradables.

     In the intertemporal model presented above there is not                 equilibrium

value of the real exchange rate, but rather a vector of equilibrium RERs:

one for each period. Within this intertemporal framework the equilibrium

RER in a particular period is defined as the (inverse of the) value of q

that, for given values of other variables, such as world prices, technology

and tariffs, equilibrates simultaneously the external and internal (i.e.

nontradables) sectors. In terms of the model the vector of equilibrium

relative prices       (l2) is composed of those q1s that satisfy

equations (1) through (5), for given values of the other fundamental
                                     9




variables. In that regard, since the system given by equations (l)-(5)

depicts a full equilibrium, both intertemporal for the external sector and

period-by-period for the nontradables market, the initial q's are the

initial equilibrium relatice prices for periods 1 and 2. An important

question, which is tackled in the rest of this paper, refers to the way in

which the equilibrium RERs react to different ,shocks, including changes in

tariffs, the tax on foreign borrowing and to transfers.

     From the inspection of equations (l)-(5) it is apparent that exogenous

shocks in, say, the international terms of trade, will affect the vector of

equilibrium RERs through two interrelated channels. The first one is

related to intratemyoral effects on resource allocation and consumption

decisions. For example, as a result of a worsening of the terms of trade in

period 1, there will be a tendency to produce more and consume less of M

in that period. This, plus the income effect resulting from the worsening

of the terms of trade will generate an incipient disequilibrium in the

nontradables market which will have to be resolved by a change in        or

equilibrium RER vector. In fact, if we assume that there is an absence of

foreign borrowing these intratemporal effects will be the only relevant

ones. However, with capital mobility, as in the current model, there is an

additional intertemporal channel through which changes in exogenous vari-

ables will affect the vector of equilibrium RERs. For example, in the case

of a worsening of the terms of trade, the consumption discount factor

         will be affected, altering the intertemporal allocation of

consumption.

11.2 The Modeling Strategy

     Since the manipulation of the model in equations (l)-(S) can be quite

cumbersome, in the rest of this paper the liberalization of trade and of the
                                            10




capital account will be analyzed sequentially, making some simplifying

assumptions. In particular, the following strategy will be used. First in

Section III the effect of a commercial policy reform (i.e., reduction in

tariffs) will be analyzed under the assumption that there are no taxes on

foreign borrowing. That is, it will be assumed that b — 0                   and 8 — 6*.

In Section IV the effects of capital account liberalization on the equilib-

rium path of the real exchange rate are analyzed assuming that the relative

price of X and M do not change; consequently in this section a composite

tradables good is used. Moreover, in order to further simplify the discus-

sion in that section it is assumed that the initial tariffs are equal to

zero. While this modeling strategy greatly simplifies the exposition, it

does not affect the main results. Moreover in Sections III and IV we

discuss the directions in which the relaxation of these simplifying

assumptions affect the results.


III. Trade Liberalization and the Equilibrium Real Exchange Rate
       In this section we investigate how tariff changes affect the
equilibrium path of the real exchange rate in an intertemporal model with
foreign borrowing. In order to simplify the exposition we assume that there
are no impediments to international trade and that 8                   6*. Differentiating

     Notice that given the fact that there actually are six goods - -                          X, M

and N in periods 1 and 2 --                  there     is room for numerous combinations of

substitution effects --        both         intratemporal and intertemporal --         that   make

the signing of some of the terms in (8) impossible without making further

assumptions.

     The term E12 is the channel through which intertemporal

substitution takes place; it is the response of (real) consumption on all

goods in period 1 to changes in period 2's (exact) price index. Given the

two periods nature of this model there is gross substitutability of (all)

goods across both periods, so that E12 > 0.                       Likewise, by property of the

expenditure function we know that E 1 1 < 0,                     E
                                                                     2 2

/33 can also be signed since they ar: equal to minus imports in period 1 and
                                                      13




minus the discounted value of imports in 2; consequently they are both

negative. The terms                    E        and it2        E         capture the income effects

and are positive.


        Since the price indexes ,1 and it2                         are unit expenditure functions,

their derivatives with respect to the different prices are positive and are

interpreted as consumption shares. Without imposing additional structure to

the model, we know the following sign for the relevant terms: E                                                     < 0,

in the intratemporal sense (that is signing it111                                or          it222);

111.1. Temporary Changes in Tariffs

        In this section we investigate the effects of a temporary change in

period l's tariff on the vector of equilibrium real exchange rates. In

order to simplify the notation assume that initially tariffs in period 1 and
                     1

where             is the determinant of the LI-IS matrix in (8), which under usual

stability conditions is negative (see Appendix.)

          Equations (9) and (10) are quite interesting. First, they show that,

contrary to the more traditional literature on trade reform, in the present

general equilibrium intertemporal setting (temporal) reductions in import

tariffs don't necessarily result in a real depreciation. Depending on the

direction of the substitution effects and of the importance of the income

effects dq1/dr1 and dq2/dr1                   can be positive or negative. Second, it is

possible to see that a temporary change in r                      in period 1 (only) will

affect the equilibrium real exchange rate in future periods. This, of
                                           15




course, is only possible in an intertemporal model with borrowing where

agents can use the international capital market to smooth through time the

effect of exogenous shocks.

          It is interesting to notice that contrary to some of the more recent

static general equilibrium analyses (Dornbusch 1980, Corden 1985, Edwards

1986) the signs of (8) and (10) cannot be deteymined by resorting to the

assumption of intratemporal gross substitutability (i.e., lrll > 0,          1122
>   0).     We now have two additional sources of indeterminacy. First due to

intertemporal substitution, even if goods are gross substitutes intratempo—

rally, irk.        >   0,   E     can be negative due to the intertemporal effect
              pq             pq
operating via E12. Second, in the current model there are income effects

which can, and generally will, operate in the opposite direction than the

substitution effect. The importance of the income effects will depend on

the initial levels of the distortions            and        and on E, E2 and

E1.
 IIW
          Another important property of (9) and (10) is that as a result of a

temporary tariff the equilibrium RERs can move in opposite directions in

periods 1 and 2. For example, it is possible that as a result of a tempo-

rary hike in r the equilibrium RER will increase in the first period, and

will decline in the second. This, of course, makes the evaluation of actual

movements of RER's, and the determination of whether they represent equilib-

rium or disequilibrium movement, particularly difficult.

      One way to get a more definite result is by evaluating the effects of

tariffs around a very small initial tariff (l —         2     0). In this case

there are only substitution effects.8 In this case equation (9) becomes:


                      -                                                                       (11)

     If,         in addition, it is assumed that importables and nontradables are

gross substitutes in period 1 (E 1 1 > 0)                         we obtain:
                                                     pq

in this case, then, we obtain the more traditional result that suggests that

higher tariffs induce an equilibrium real depreciation hold.

     Assuming no first order income effect, equation (10) becomes:


                           =                                                                  (12)

which under the assumption of gross substitutability everywhere is also

positive.

     In sum, then, in this general equilibrium intertemporal setting with

foreign borrowing it is not possible to determine a priori whether temporary

tariff hikes will appreciate or depreciate the equilibrium real exchange


     8under very small (or zero) initial tariffs there is no first order
income effect. This is, in fact, what Dornbusch (1980) and Corden (1985) do
in their static models.

     9The negative sign of                          follows from stability. See Appendix.

rate. This result is in contradiction to the more traditional, and

generally accepted, policy oriented literature on tariff reforms and shadow

pricing. The sources of ambiguity in the present model are two: first, the

intra- and intertemporal substitution effects can move the q's in any

direction, and second, the income effects associated to the tariff changes,

can operate in the opposite direction than the substitution effect.


111.2 Anticipated Future Tariff Changes

      We now consider the case of an anticipated change in future import

tariffs. In order to focus the discussion we assume, (as we will do for the

rest of the section, unless otherwise indicated), that initial tariff levels

are close to zero, and that there is gross substitutability in consumption

everywhere.


               = -                                                            0    (13)

      According to equation (13) a future expected tariff increase will

appreciate the equilibrium real exchange rate in the current period, Of

course, the mechanism via which this takes place is the intertemporal

substitution in consumption, captured in equation (14) by terms E 1 2               and
                                                                              qp

sustainability of the reforms, with people expecting a reversal of the trade

liberalization (Edwards and Cox-Edwards 1987, Frankel et al. 1986).

     Equation (14) states that under our assumptions the equilibrium real

exchange rate will also go up in period 2. From an inspection of (13) and

(14) it is apparent that it is not possible to know whether q will go up

by more in period 1 or 2.10


IV. Capital Account Liberalization and the Equilibrium Real Exchange Rate

     In this section we analyze the way in which a liberalization of the

capital account restrictions affect the equilibrium real exchange rate. In

order to simplify the exposition we first assume that there are no initial

import tariffs, and that international prices of X and M don't change.

These two goods can then be aggregated into a composite tradable good (T).

(See below, however, for a discussion on what happens if r       0.)   We now

denote the relative price of nontradables to tradables in period i as f1.

That is,   f1,f2 are the inverse of the more traditional definition of real

exchange rate. The model in (1)-(5) is now rewritten in the following way:

     R1(l,f1;K,L) +     8R2(l,f2;K,L) +b(NCA) = E[(1,f1),62(1,f2),W]        (15)


               b       (5* -         6) >   0                               (16)

                       = E                                                  (17)
                                 2
                   f         f


               R22 = E 2                                                    (18)
                   f         f

where a notation consistent with Section III has been used. As noted, the

term b(NCA) is the discounted value of the proceeds from the taxation of




     10For the case of a permanent tariff change (dr1 =   dr2)    and of
international terms of trade shocks see Edwards (1986).

foreign borrowing. b is the discounted value of the tax per unit

borrowed.11 Since it is assumed that international borrowing is taxed,     6


          A capital account liberalization, then, is depicted by an increase in

& towards its world value 5*

     Totally differentiating (lS)-(l8) we can find out how the equilibrium

RER reacts to a liberalization of the capital account:

                                  2
                  df1 —
                              - [ J F11 E2 R222 -      E2 E2     R22J

where A" is the determinant of the system (lS)-(18) and is negative (see

Appendix). This expression is positive indicating that a liberalization of

the current account (i.e., a reduction in the tax on foreign borrowing) will

result in an increase in the relative price of nontradables, or in a real

appreciation in period 1. This real appreciation takes place through two

channels. The first, which is captured by the first term on the RIIS of

equation (19), is an intertemporal substitution effect, which operates via

movements in the consumption rate of interest. The reduction of the tax on

foreign borrowing (i.e., the increase in 6) makes future consumption

relatively more expensive. As a result, people substitute intertemporally,

consuming more of everything in period 1. This, of course, exercises


     11See, for example, Edwards and van Wijnbergen (1986) and van Wijnbergen
(1985).

     121n this model the tax on borrowing is a policy variable.
Alternatively one can assume, as in Edwards and van Wijnbergen (1986) that
there is a quantitative limit to foreign borrowing. In that case 8
becomes an endogenous variable.
                                         20




pressure on the price of nontradables in period 1, generating the real

appreciation. Notice that if there is no intertemporal substitution (i.e.,

      — 0)   the first term on the RHS of (19) vanishes.

     The second channel through which the liberalization of the capital

account affects the real exchange rate is the income effect captured by the

second term on the RIIS of equation (19). An increase in £ towards its

world level 5* reduces the only distortion in this economy, generating a

positive welfare effect, Consequently people increase consumption exercis-

ing a positive pressure on       f1. The magnitude of this income effect

basically depends on two factors:        (1) the initial level of the distortion

b.   In fact, if initially the tax is very low b : 0,             the second term on

the RIIS of (19) will tend to disappear. (2) The propensity to consume in

periods E 1        and E   2

     While in this model the effect of the capital account liberalization on

the equilibrium real exchange rate is unambiguous, its effect on               f2 cannot

be signed a priori:

 IV.l Investment and Initial Import Tariffs

      The model developed in this section has assumed, for expositionai

 convenience, that import tariffs are initially equal to zero. The relaxa-

 tion of this assumption will have an impact on the income effect term in

 equation (19) .    The reason is that once tariffs are allowed, the tax on

 foreign borrowing ceases to be the only distortion and we now enter the

 world of second best. It is now possible that the relaxation of one
                                         21




distortion (b) may have a negative overall impact on welfare, inducing a

reduction in expenditure in all periods.'3 Notice, however, that in order

to reverse the result in equation (19) it will be necessary that the overall

income effect is negative,        that   it exceeds the substitution effect.

     The model discussed in this paper has also assumed that there is no

investment. This simplifying assumption can bp relaxed quite easily.

Possibly the most convenient way of introducing investment is by assuming

that investment decisions are governed by the condition that in equilibrium

Tobin's "q" equals 1. Assuming, without loss of generality that all

investment goods are tradable goods, the investment equation is:


                  54-1.
     The incorporation of investment may have an effect on the way capital

liberalization affects the equilibrium real exchange rate in period 2. This

is because the liberalization of the capital account --     that   is the increase

of 5 --   will   encourage capital accumulation. Depending on whether nontrad-

ables are capital or labor intensive, total production of nontradables may

increase. If nontradables are capital intensive, output of this type of

goods will increase in period 2, generating downward pressures on f2.


V. Concluding Remarks

     Much of the discussion on the recent liberalizations attempts in the

Southern Cone have focused on the role of exchange rates behavior in those

countries. In fact a large number of analysts -- and especially popular

interpretations - -   have argued that the real appreciation of these countries

     13The negative welfare effect will result because a lower b induces
higher expenditure in 1, including higher imports in that period. This
negative welfare effect, however, should be compared with the positive
effects on welfare of lower b.

currencies represented an unsustainable real overvaluation, which was

responsible for the disappointing outcome of the reforms. These conten-

tions, however have been sustained by extremely simplistic PPP type

calculations, that don't make any attempt to evaluate the evolution of the

equilibrium RER in these countries.

     Surprisingly, both the historical and theoretical literature on

economic liberalization has been extremely informal regarding the reaction

of the equilibrium RER after a liberalization reform that relaxes restric-

tions on commodities and assets trade. Moreover, the recent literature on

real exchange rate misalignment has been equally informal. This is a

serious gap, since it is only possible to talk about exchange rate

misalignment after comparing actual and equilibrium real exchange rates.

     In this paper an intertemporal general equilibrium model of a small

open economy was developed to analyze formally the way in which economic

liberalization reforms affect the equilibrium vector of real exchange rates.

Several important results were obtained.     (1) Contrary to traditional

static partial equilibrium models a tariff reduction will not necessarily

generate an equilibrium real depreciation. (2) Assuming that all goods are

gross substitutes in consumption, both intra and intertemporally, and that

the substitution effect dominates the income effect, a temporary tariff

reduction will result in an equilibrium real depreciation in both periods.

(3) Expected future tariff changes will generally affect the current

equilibrium real exchange rate. More specifically, under the conditions

described in (2) an expected future hike in tariffs will appreciate the

equilibrium real exchange rate today.      (4) Assuming no (or very low) init-

ial tariffs, a capital account liberalization will generate an equilibrium

real appreciation.

a.   Stability Conditions

      In order to simplify the analysis of the stability conditions, and to

sign of the determinant, we work with the tradables nontradable model of

Section III.

     The dynamic behavior of nontradable prices are depicted by equations

(A.l) and (A.2):

                       A1[E1

Using Taylor expansions of (A.l) and (A.2) and dropping second and higher

order terms, we obtain
