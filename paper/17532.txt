                                            ABSTRACT

We explore the impact of a tax reform in some provinces of China which eliminated the value-added
tax on some investment goods. While the goal of the experiment was to encourage upgrading of
technology, our results suggest that there was no evident increase overall in fixed investment, and
employment fell significantly in the treated provinces and sectors. The reform reduced the total number
of employees for all types of firms. For domestic firms, it reduced employment by almost 8%. Our
results are robust to a variety of approaches, and suggest that the primary impact of the policy has
been to induce labor-saving growth. This experiment has since been extended to the rest of China.

    1. Introduction

      Much of the literature in public finance focuses on the role of tax reforms in affecting

firm behavior. Policy makers in many countries use tax incentives to encourage firm

investment, and China is no different. In China, the value-added tax is the major source

of fiscal revenue for the government, generating much more revenues than any other

types of tax. In 2002, the revenue from value-added taxes was 814.4 billion RMB,

accounting for around 48% of the state total tax revenue in that year. In 2009, the

Chinese Ministry of Finance estimated that VAT revenue accounted for approximately 31

percent of China’s overall revenue. 3

      Beginning in 2004, the Chinese government implemented a value-added tax reform

in three northeastern provinces, which removes fixed asset investment from the value-

added tax base. The reform has since been extended to the whole country, beginning in

2009. The objective of the 2004 reform was to encourage firms to raise investment

spending on fixed assets for production (excluding structures) and to upgrade their

machinery and equipment. The goals of the 2009 reform were similar, but in addition the

government expressed the need to provide additional assistance to domestic enterprises to

help them weather the adverse effects of the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, as well as

to encourage fixed asset investments to promote an industrial policy now focused on

more technologically advanced sectors. 4

  According to the People’s Daily Online, December 9, 2008, quoting Zheng Jianxin, deputy director general of the
taxation department of China’s Ministry of Finance, “The VAT reform would encourage investment and technological
upgrading at Chinese companies, boost domestic demand, improve companies’ competitive strength and play a positive
role in helping companies tackle the financial crisis”. The article also states that “The reform was aimed at a shift from
the existing production-based to a consumption-based VAT regime, which would enable companies to get tax
deductions on spending on fixed assets, Zheng said, adding that this would reduce the tax burden on companies by
more than 123 billion Yuan.”

                                                            2
     In this paper, we use a firm-level panel dataset ranging from 1998 to 2007 to identify

the effect of the selective 2004 reform, which selectively reduced value-added taxes on

fixed investment. We explore a number of firm level outcomes, including investment,

new product introductions, productivity, employment, and exports. The advantage of the

reform is that we know exactly which provinces and sectors were sequentially targeted,

and consequently we have a clean treatment group as well as controls. We begin the

paper by simply regressing a variety of outcomes on a treatment dummy, and add a large

set of controls including province dummies, industry dummies, year effects and firm

fixed effects. We then augment this difference-in-difference specification with an

instrumental variable estimation using treatment as the instrument for VAT payments as

the endogenous policy variable. Both approaches yield similar results.

         The government’s choice of tax reduction in areas or sectors could be non-

random, and may depend on sector or firm attributes such as size, productivity, capital

intensity, ownership, etc. This creates a potential selection bias in policy treatment.

Consider the value-added tax reform of China in 2004: the three northeast provinces were

chosen as the first pilot group because while many coastal cities had undergone rapid

modernization of capital and technology after the opening-up of the Chinese economy,

the northeast regions with their traditional industrial base were left behind. Encouraging

firms in these provinces to invest more on fixed productive assets to upgrade their

technology and to revitalize their old industrial base was the main reason to implement

the value-added tax reform in these provinces first. 5

  According to the Xinhua News Agency on December 22, 2005, “The experiment, which moves the tax from
production to tax on consumer spending has encouraged northeast China to increase investment in machinery and
equipment and phase out outdated equipment”.

                                                        3
       Our concerns about the non-random nature of the reform lead us to adopt a third

approach, in addition to the OLS and IV approaches, which also yields comparable

results. We use a nonparametric technique, propensity score matching combined with

difference-in-difference estimation, to confirm the causal effect of value-added tax

reduction. This method has two advantages. First, it emphasizes the comparability of the

treated and control firms by excluding firms that are not comparable. Second, it relaxes

the parametric assumptions associated with regression-based techniques such as the linear

regression framework. We assess the credibility of the matching procedure using an

absolute standardized bias measure and formal paired t-tests. Moreover, we combine the

matching technique with difference-in-difference estimation to deal with concerns about

possible unobservable firm characteristics that share the same time dynamics for both

treatment and control firms.

    All three estimation approaches suggest that the reform was effective in reducing the

value-added tax paid by firms, with value-added taxes falling 1 to 2 percentage points in

the treatment areas relative to the statutory rate of 17 percent of value-added. However,

the impact of the tax reduction on physical investment was limited. There is no

improvement in overall investment and no differential increase in new product

introductions in the treated regions after the reform. The reform had no significant impact

on firm productivity, while it decreased export intensity for most types of firms. The

primary impact of the reform was to encourage firms to substitute physical capital for

labor: the policy significantly reduced firms’ total number of employees across all

ownership types. The net impact of the reform was to increase the capital intensity of




                                            4
production, as physical investment remained level but employment fell, without

improving technology levels as measured by TFP or new product introductions.

    Our results build on but diverge in significant ways from Nie et al (2010), who also

explore the impact of the value-added tax reform in China. They find smaller, but still

negative effects on employment and positive, significant effects on fixed asset

investment. Our results differ in large part from Nie et al (2010) for two reasons. First,

they look at the short run effects of the reform, focusing on data of one year following the

2004 reform. In this paper, using more extensive time series and examining three years

following the reforms allows us to examine the longer term effects. In addition, we

explicitly address the potential endogeneity of the reform targets through an IV as well as

nonparametric propensity score matching techniques. Using their approach, we show that

the beneficial effects of the reform on investment had a short-run positive impact on

investment, but were restricted to the state owned enterprises (SOEs). Over a three-year

horizon, the short run positive effects on investment disappear. One way to interpret the

two sets of results is that Nie et al (2010) document the short run effects of the VAT

reform , while we identify the effects on firm behavior over the longer term.

    Our evidence suggests that the primary effects of the tax reform over the three-year

period following the policy changes were to reduce value-added tax payments and

encourage firms to shift to more capital-intensive or labor-saving technologies. One

puzzle is why, in light of these limited gains, the policy was extended to the rest of China.

One possible explanation is that the tax reform was part of a package of measures for

fiscal stimulus during the 2008-2009 financial crisis. Another possible explanation is that

Chinese policy makers expect a longer term labor shortage and a shift away from their



                                             5
traditional comparative advantage in labor-intensive techniques, and these reforms

accelerated the shift towards capital-intensity in production.

     The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we discuss the

value-added tax system and the tax reform in China. Section 3 discusses the identification

strategy. Section 4 presents estimation results for the OLS and IV results, while Section 5

presents the propensity score matching. Section 6 concludes.



2. Background

      A value-added tax (VAT) is a tax on the difference between total sales and

purchases of inputs from other firms. The most common type of VAT is the

consumption-based type VAT, where both costs such as purchases of production

materials, wage payments, and the purchase of fixed assets are deducted from sales when

calculating a firm’s VAT liability. For example, suppose the VAT rate is 10%. If a firm

A purchased capital inputs from other firms at a price of 100 RMB, and if its total sales

equals 400RMB, then the VAT base is 300, and firm A pays 30 RMB VAT.

      Mainland China introduced the value-added tax as part of a major general tax

reform initiative in 1994. The standard rate is 17% (of value-added), and the reduced rate

is 13% for sectors such as agricultural production. Export enterprises receive value-added

tax refunds as an export incentive, with refund rates ranging from 9% to 17%.

       The VAT is an important source of government tax revenue. For example, from

2001 to 2008, on average, VAT receipts accounted for 36% of total tax revenue.

However, the VAT system in China is different from the commonly used consumption-

based VAT. China’s system is a production-based VAT, and purchases of fixed

                                              6
investment cannot be deducted from sales when calculating VAT liabilities. In this case,

if we consider the example above, firm A needs to pay 40 RMB VAT. In consequence,

investment goods are twice subject to the VAT, first as final products of their producers

and second as intermediate inputs for their users. One concern is that such a policy could

lead firms to operate with old equipment and out-of-date technology, leading to less

productivity growth.

     Starting in 2004, China began its VAT reform by transforming the current

production-based VAT to a consumption-type VAT. The main objective of the reform

was to promote a more equitable market environment, allowing domestic and foreign

firms to compete more easily, and to give firms more incentives to upgrade machinery

and technology.    In July 2004, the Chinese government selected three northeastern

provinces as a pilot area to implement the consumption-type of value-added tax. In these

provinces, value-added tax payers in six selected industries, including agricultural

product processing, equipment manufacturing, petrochemicals, metallurgy, ship building

and automobile manufacturing, were allowed to deduct expenditure on fixed assets from

the value-added tax base.

     This reform was expected to eliminate double taxation and alleviate firms’ tax

burden, leading to lower prices for consumers and more investment in fixed assets. At the

end of that year, the government further included military products and high-tech

products as pilot sectors and extended the scope of the tax deduction from incremental

quantity to the full amount of fixed assets. In 2007, the reform was extended to six

provinces in the central area, including 26 cities. In 2008, eastern Inner Mongolia was




                                            7
further included, and finally in January 2009, the consumption-based value-added tax

policy was implemented in all sectors and provinces of China.



3. Data, Variable Definitions and Summary Statistics

3.1 Dataset

     The data we use for analyses in this paper comes from a large dataset developed and

maintained by the National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBS). The NBS dataset

contains annual firm-level unbalanced survey data of all “above scale” industrial firms

with annual sales of more than 5 million RMB. On average, around 220,000 firms per

year from 1998 to 2007 are included in the dataset, spanning 37 two-digit manufacturing

industries and 31 provinces or province-equivalent municipal cities. Firms included in

this survey account for almost 50% of China’s industrial value-added, and 22% of

China’s urban employment in 2005.

     The combined dataset contains detailed information about each firm’s identity,

address, industry classification, incorporation year, ownership types, new products and

total value of output, total fixed assets, fixed assets for production, sales revenue, profit,

total workforce, export sales, total industrial sales, employee education, income and value

added tax payable. These are the key variables based on which we estimate firm level

total factor productivity and impacts of the VAT reform.

     The original dataset includes 2,226,104 firm-year observations. Since the paper

focuses on manufacturing firms, we eliminate non-manufacturing observations. To

further clean the sample, we delete observations whose information on variables such as

firm identifiers, county code, sector id, year established are missing, or observations with


                                              8
negative or zero values for key variables such as output, total workforce, capital, input,

and total wages. In addition, observations are dropped if total assets are less than liquid

assets or total fixed assets, or if inputs are larger than output. After implementing these

data cleaning procedures, we obtain a sample of 1,543,000 observations for analysis.

3.2 Variable Definitions and Summary Statistics

     In Table 1, we provide summary statistics for key variables. The main outcome

variables we consider are investment, the share of new products in total sales, total factor

productivity (TFP), employment, the capital-labor ratio, and export intensity. We use

three measures of investment: first, we define the level of investment by the growth of

fixed assets for production plus depreciation; second, we calculate the investment ratio,

defined as the ratio between current-year gross fixed investment and beginning of year

net fixed asset; third, we look at the composition of fixed asset by calculating the share of

fixed assets for production in total assets. Our third measure is indicative of the

composition of investment, and in particular the share of machinery and equipment in the

total stock of capital The value of total fixed assets and fixed assets for production is

deflated by the fixed assets investment index. Since the data on R&D expenditure is only

available for the year 2004, we use the share of new product output in total industrial

output as a proxy. Employment is defined as total number of employees. TFP is firm

level total factor productivity estimated using two methods, OLS with firm fixed effects

and the Olley-Pakes method (OP). In our OP approach, we use the standard two-step

approach to estimate input share coefficients for each 2 digit subsector. To avoid omitted

variable bias in estimating input share coefficients, we also include relevant policy

variables—in this case the VAT reform and tariffs—as state variables in the first stage.


                                             9
      Export intensity is calculated as the ratio of export procurement to total industrial

sales. Our key controls include firm size, age, HKTM share, foreign share and state

shares. Firm size is measured by total values of output, which are deflated by the sector-

specific ex-factory price index of industrial products. HKTM share, foreign share, and

state share are defined as the share of the firm’s total equity owned by Hong Kong-

Taiwan-Macau investors, investors from other countries, and the state, respectively.

These three firm level controls are continuous variables ranging from 0 to 1.

     In Figures 1.1 to 1.4, we illustrate the evolution of the value added tax in treated

and control groups from 1998 to 2007, for the whole sample and by ownership type. The

value-added tax is defined as the value-added tax paid divided by value-added at the firm

level. Consider Figure 1.1: First, over the sample period, the value added tax for firms in

treated sectors in control provinces does not change much, decreasing slightly from an

average of 14 to 12 percent. Second, we compare the evolution of the value added tax

between firms in treated sectors in treated provinces and firms in treated sectors in

control provinces. We can see that before 2004, the value added tax for treated firms was

consistently higher than than for control firms in treated sectors. However, one year after

the value added tax reform was implemented in 2004, there is a significant decrease in

the value added tax paid by treated firms, and the tax paid by treated firms continued to

fall until 2007. While treated sectors in treated regions paid an average of 16 percent

VAT in 2000 (nearly the full statutory rate of 17 percent), by 2007 these same firms paid

an average VAT of nine percent.

     In Figures 1.2 to 1.4, we report the evolution of the value added tax from 1998 to

2007 for different ownership types. For all types of firms, there was a decline in the


                                            10
value-added tax in treated sectors and provinces relative to eligible sectors in control

provinces. However, we see in Figure 1.2 that SOEs paid on average more than other

types of firms, with treated firms paying an average of 17 percent VAT prior to the

reform and paying an average of 12 percent post-reform. This is much higher than for

foreign owned enterprises, where treated sectors paid on average a 13 % VAT in 2001

and only 8 percent in 2007. Given these significant differences in payments across

ownership types, we would expect the largest effects for SOEs and more attenuated

effects for foreign owned enterprises.

        In Figure 2, we plot the annual growth of sales for treated and control firms. Before

the policy was introduced in 2004, the growth of firms in treated sectors in treated

provinces was initially faster than in control provinces but then reversed after the reform

was introduced. The same pattern holds when comparing firms in control sectors in

treated provinces and those in control provinces. There is no evidence from Figure 2 that

the reform was targeted at sectors that had grown slowly prior to the introduction of the

reforms. However, there is evidence that the treated sectors grew more slowly after

2004.




4. Identification of the Policy Impact: Using OLS and IV Estimation



         The VAT reform is well documented, and consequently the simplest approach is

an OLS difference-in-difference estimation that allows us to compare outcomes for firms




                                              11
in the treated regions and sectors relative to control firms. For a particular outcome for

firm i in year t, region r and sector j, we have the following specification:

      𝑂𝑢𝑡𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒𝑖𝑗𝑡 = 𝑎0 + 𝑎1 𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑗𝑟𝑡 + 𝑎2 𝑌𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑡 + 𝑎3 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑣𝑖𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑟 + 𝑎4 𝑆𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑗 + 𝑓𝑖 + 𝜖𝑖𝑗 (1)

       We explore a variety of outcomes at the firm level, including employment, capital

investment, the composition of investment, capital-labor ratios, labor-output ratios,

exports, and productivity. We first begin by examining whether the regression results

show consistent magnitudes for reduction in VAT payments, which is expected given the

trends observed in Figure 1.

       The results from estimating equation (1) are reported in Table 2. Column (1) of

Table 2 reports the impact of the treatment dummy on VAT payments. Consistent with

the evidence in Figure 1, firms subject to treatment reduced VAT payments on average

by 1.6 percentage points relative to control firms. The reduction is greatest for SOEs and

smallest for foreign owned enterprises, also consistent with the visual evidence presented

in Figure 1.

       The next three columns measure the impact of treatment on the log of firm

employment, the capital-labor ratio, and output per worker. Treatment was associated

with a large decline in log employment, indicating a fall in employment overall of 12.7

percent across all firms. The largest decline was for domestic enterprises, where

employment fell by 13.1 percent, and the smallest decline was exhibited by foreign

enterprises, where treatment was associated with a 9.3 percent decline in employment.

Across all firms, treatment was associated with an increase in the capital-labor ratio and

an increase in output per worker.




                                                12
       Columns (5) through (7) explore the impact of the reform on fixed investment.

Investment is measured in column (5) as the log of total investment, in column (6)as the

ratio of investment to fixed capital, and in column (7) as the share of machinery

investment in total fixed investment.       There is no evidence that either the log of

investment or the ratio of investment to the capital stock increased. However, the share of

machinery investment in total investment did increase significantly for SOEs, and

marginally significantly for foreign owned enterprises. These three columns indicate that

while the composition of investment changed and shifted towards machinery, the actual

volume of investment did not increase. Since employment fell significantly, but physical

capital did not, these differential trends explain the resulting increases in the capital-labor

ratio and in output per worker.

       The last three columns explore the impact on the export ratio, the share of new

products in total sales, and total factor productivity, measured using the Olley-Pakes

(2003) approach. Consistent with the lack of increase in total investment, the reform did

not increase the technology levels of participating establishments. TFP did not increase,

nor did the share of new products in total sales. While it might seem puzzling that TFP

did not increase when employment fell so dramatically, it is also important to remember

that output stagnated (see Figure 2) and capital substituted for falling employment. These

offsetting effects explain the lack of movement in TFP. Exports as a share of sales fell

significantly, which is plausible if the reform shifted firm investments away from China’s

comparative advantage, which at that time was still in more labor-intensive products.

       An alternative approach would be to restrict the OLS DID estimation to only

treated sectors. Appendix Table A.1 reports the DID results when we restrict the sample



                                              13
to only treated sectors and define treatment using the province dummy. The results are

very close to the results reported in Table 2, indicating that much of the variation is

coming from differences within sectors across the treated and untreated regions. The

treated sectors are sufficiently broad to cover almost all sectors—this is why the

restricted sample in Appendix Table A1 is only reduced by 20 percent of the original full

sample.   The fact that most sectors were included in the treatment also explains why

restricting the sample to only the treated provinces and defining treatment based on

sectors yields insufficient variation both in terms of numbers of observations and in terms

of heterogeneity across sectors.

     An alternative approach to the simple OLS difference-in-difference estimation

would be to use an instrumental variable strategy with VAT payments instrumented using

the VAT reform dummy. In Table 3, we report results using this alternative approach.

We now use the treatment dummy as the first stage instrument for VAT payments which

are the main independent variable of interest. This approach allows us to directly estimate

the impact of VAT payments on outcomes at the firm level, but we only use shifts in

VAT payments stemming from the reform for identification.

     The results are consistent with the OLS estimates presented in Table 2. In the first

column, we see that lower VAT payments are significantly associated with lower log

employment. The point estimates, which range from 5.4 to 8.6, indicate that a VAT

reduction of 2 percentage points would be associated with a reduction in employment of

more than 10 percent. Columns (2) and (3) indicate that a reduction in VAT payments

would be associated with an increase in both the capital-labor ratio and the output to

employment ratio, consistent with the OLS results in Table 2. Columns (4) through (6)


                                            14
report a positive and significant association between VAT payments and the ratio of

investment to capital stock, but a negative association between VAT payments and the

share of machinery in total investment. The negative association with machinery

indicates that as VAT payments fell, the share of machinery equipment in total

investment rose. The point estimates, which range from -0.23 to -1.4, indicate that a 2

percentage point decline in VAT payments is associated with an increase in machinery’s

share of almost 3 percent for state-owned enterprises.

     The last three columns use the same IV approach to measure reform-induced impact

of VAT payment reductions on export shares, new product introductions, and TFP.

Consistent with Table 2, the positive coefficient on new product introductions and TFP

suggests that reductions in VAT payments were associated with a reduction in new

product introductions and a reduction in TFP. The only firms with a slightly different

outcome are firms with foreign ownership. For foreign owned enterprises, the VAT

payment reduction associated with the reform is associated with falling employment,

rising investment, and increasing TFP.

     The results in Tables 2 and 3 suggest a consistent story across specifications. The

VAT reform led to a reduction in VAT payments of 1 to 2 percentage points. The fall in

VAT payments led firms to increase the share of machinery in total investment, but not

the aggregate level of investment. In turn, the shifting composition of investment was

associated with a fall in employment, and an increase in both the capital-labor ratio and

the output to employment ratio. Consistent with the fact that labor was replaced with

machinery but aggregate investment did not increase, neither TFP nor the share of new

products in aggregate sales increased. The reform encouraged firms to replace people


                                            15
with machinery, but had no evident impact on either aggregate investment or long run

productivity growth.




5. Robustness: Estimation using Propensity Score Matching

        Although the value-added tax reform policy was only implemented on certain

sectors in certain provinces, the assignment may not have been random. The three

northeast provinces were chosen as the first pilot group because while many coastal cities

had undergone rapid changes and upgrades in both capital assets and technology after the

opening-up of the Chinese economy to the world, the traditional industrial base in

northeast regions were left behind in the race for technological advancement and

prosperity. Encouraging firms in these provinces to invest more on fixed productive

assets to upgrade their technology, and to revitalize these old industrial bases was the

main reason to implement the value-added tax reform in these provinces first. It is

possible that these sectors or provinces were chosen because they were in decline, or

because they are more capital intensive and reducing the value added tax is more

important for these types of enterprises. As a result, the key difficulty with identifying the

causal effect of value added tax reform could be endogenous selection. 6

     To address this potential problem, we adopt a two-stage identification approach.

First, we use nonlinear propensity score matching techniques to construct a control group

of firms that match most closely firms that have been treated based on observable

characteristics; second, we estimate the program impact using difference-in-difference



6
 According to appendix Table A3, the common trend assumption for the difference-in-difference
estimation does not hold for most outcome variables, suggesting potential placement bias.

                                                  16
estimation to remove all unobservable effects that have the same time dynamics in the

treatment and matched control group.

5.1 Propensity Score Matching

     We adopt a procedure using Gaussian kernel matching introduced by Becker and

Ichino (2002). To identify the most appropriate control group, we need to specify a list of

covariates as key determinants of policy assignment. Here we use sector, foreign share,

state share, export share, firm size, age, capital, and productivity as matching covariates,

so firms in the control group are matched to the treatment group on the basis of the pre-

treatment (1998-2003) mean of these observables.

     There are two steps to test whether the propensity score matching method works

well. First, we need to estimate whether the covariates we chose are actually important

determinants of policy treatment. For this, we estimate a probit model for the likelihood

of the value added tax reform treatment:

 𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑗 = 𝑎0 + 𝑎1 𝐹𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑖𝑗 + 𝑎2 𝐻𝐾𝑇𝑀𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑖𝑗 + 𝑎3 𝑆𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑖𝑗 + 𝑎4 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑖𝑗
                 + 𝑎5 𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑂𝑢𝑡𝑝𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑗 + 𝑎6 𝐶𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑗 + 𝑎7 𝐴𝑔𝑒𝑖𝑗 + 𝑎8 𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑇𝐹𝑃𝑖𝑗 + 𝑎9 𝑆𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑗 + 𝜖𝑖𝑗 (2)


Where                 is a dummy variable which equals 1 if firm i in sector j was exposed

to the tax reform in 2004 and 0 otherwise, and Sectorij includes a set of two-digit sector

dummies. Second, we perform a formal pairwise t-test comparison between treated and

matched control firms to see whether there are any significant differences. We impose the

common support condition and confine our attention to the matched firms falling within

the support of the propensity score distribution of the treated group.

5.2 Difference-in-Difference Estimation



                                                17
     Using difference-in-difference estimation helps remove the time-invariant

unobserved heterogeneity across firms, such as sector specific effects and managerial

behavior. Here we define the first difference of outcome variables, including investment,

new product introduction, TFP, total number of employees, capital-labor ratio, and export

intensity by calculating the difference between post-treatment (2005-2007) and pre-

treatment (1998-2003) means of outcome variables, which means we only keep a

balanced sample of firms that existed in the sample both before and after the policy

treatment. The estimator is as follows:


             𝛽̂𝐷𝐷𝑀 = 𝑛 � �(𝑌𝑖𝑡 − 𝑌𝑖𝑡−1 ) − � 𝑊(𝑃𝑖𝑡 , 𝑃𝑗𝑡 )(𝑌𝑗𝑡 − 𝑌𝑗𝑡−1 )�
                     1

                       𝑖∈𝐼1 ∩𝑆𝑃                 𝑗∈𝐼0 ∩𝑆𝑃


Where          is the set of treated firms that falls within the common support 𝑆𝑝 , 𝐼0 is the

set of control firms, and n is the number of treated firms in the common support set. Y is

outcome variables and P measures the probability of receiving treatment based on the

vector of firm characteristics 𝑋𝑖𝑡−1 :

                                   𝑃𝑖𝑡 = 𝐸(𝐷𝑖𝑡 = 1|𝑋𝑖𝑡−1 )

W(.) is a Gaussian kernel weighting function that depends on the propensity score

distance between the treated and control firms. 𝛽̂𝐷𝐷𝑀 is the estimator of the causal effect

of the value added tax reform, and we obtain standard error using a bootstrapping

procedure.

5.3 Propensity Score Matching Estimation Results

     In this section, we analyze the estimation result of the probit model for the policy

treatment and the matching balance test. First, in Table 4, we show the results of the

probit regression equation (2). The dependent variable is a dummy variable which takes a

                                             18
value of 1 if a firm was in the value added tax reform treatment group and 0 otherwise.

The objective is to check whether the covariates we chose are important determinants of

policy treatment. All covariates are measured by the mean before the policy treatment.

    We find that most covariates are significant determinants of policy treatment.

Specifically, firms are more likely to receive policy treatment if they have lower foreign

shares or HKTM shares, or higher state shares. Firms with more output or slower labor

growth are more likely to be included. Younger firms or firms with higher productivity

have a higher probability of being selected. The results confirm that the focus of the

reform was on regions with less foreign investment, a larger state enterprise presence,

and bigger firms. These results are consistent with the anecdotal and press reports that

the goal of the initial 2004 reform was to encourage upgrading in the more backward

northeastern provinces.

      Based on the above determinants of policy treatment, we construct a matched

control group to compare with treated firms. In Table 5, we compare the pre-treatment

mean of policy determinants between these treated and matched groups. The absolute

standard bias measures reported in Column (3) are all below 5% in absolute value in the

matched sample. Moreover, there is no significant difference in the covariates we chose

between treated and matched samples. To provide a visual sense of the quality of the

matching procedure, we present density plots of the propensity score for the treatment

group and the control firms before and after matching in Figure 3. There is no significant

difference in the density plot between the treatment group and their matched

counterparts. Overall, the quality of the matching procedure is good and provides a solid

foundation for the difference-in-difference estimation.



                                            19
5.4 Difference-in-Difference Estimation Results

     Having demonstrated the quality of the matching procedure, we then present the

difference-in-difference matching estimation results. Results are listed in Tables 6 and 7.

We present results for the overall sample, domestic (state-owned and non-state-owned),

and foreign firms separately.

     In Table 6, we report the impact of VAT reform on firm investment and

employment. We begin by looking at the effect of the tax reform on value-added taxes

paid by firms. The estimates show that overall, the reported value-added tax paid

(rescaled by value added) by treated firms becomes 1.5 percentage points less than that

paid by control firms, consistent with the OLS and IV estimation results. This suggests

that the value-added tax reform effectively decreased taxes paid by treated firms. The

magnitude of the effect varies by firm ownership. The effect is largest for domestic state-

owned firms: the reform reduced the value-added tax ratio by 3.1% for treated firms. For

domestic non-state-owned firms, the reform also reduced tax paid by around 1.3%. These

numbers indicate that the tax reform reduced the tax burden for SOEs three times more

than for non-SOEs. Taxes paid by treated foreign firms also decreased by 1.5. This is

consistent with the fact that the reform itself focused on domestic and particularly state

owned enterprises.

     We then turn to the impact of the tax reduction on firm behavior. First, we estimate

the impact of tax reform on firm investment. According to results in panels B,C, and D of

Table 6, we see that overall the tax reform did not change the investment behavior

significantly. Turning to results on employment as shown in Panel E, the reform is

associated with a fall in the total number of employees for all types of firms. For


                                            20
domestic firms, the VAT reform reduced employment by more than 13%, but it has a

smaller effect on employment of foreign firms: they reduced employment by around 7%.

Because the tax reform did not affect investment but reduced labor, we see a positive

impact of the reform on the capital-labor ratio as shown in Panel F.

     Although the overall investment did not change significantly, it is still possible that

investment on certain types of activities has been significantly influenced by the reform.

As a result, in Table 7, we estimate the impact of VAT reform on firms’ upgrading

behavior, by looking at the effect on new product introductions as a share of sales,

productivity as measured by the two-stage OP approach, and export intensity. In Panel A,

we look at the impact of tax reform on new product introduction, to see whether treated

firms increased innovative activity after the tax incentive was provided. Consistent with

our OLS and IV results, the matching estimation reveals that across all types of firms,

new product introduction decreased after the reform. We then consider the impact on

productivity in Panel B. Similar to the results on investment, there is no positive effect of

tax reform on firm productivity. Finally, we consider export activity. According to Panel

C, firms’ export intensity, which is measured by the share of export procurement in

industrial sales, significantly fell after the tax reform policy. The effect holds for all firms

except for state-owned firms.

        Our results differ in large part from Nie, Fang, and Lie (2010). Nie, Fang and Lie

(2010) found positive effects of the reform on firm specific investment. Our results differ

from theirs for two reasons. First, because they had access to a shorter time series, they

are able only to examine the short run effects of the reform, focusing on one year of data

following the 2004 reform. Using our more extensive time series and examining three



                                              21
years following the reforms allows us to examine the longer term effects. In addition, we

explicitly address the potential endogeneity of the reform targets through nonparametric

propensity score matching techniques.

       In Appendix Tables A4 through A6, we reproduce Nie, Fang, and Lie’s approach

to show that the beneficial effects of the reform on investment was a short run effect

restricted to the state owned enterprises (SOEs). Even without the use of propensity score

matching and difference-in-difference estimation, the positive impact on fixed investment

disappears if we include 2006 and 2007. As a longer time series has become available,

we are able to identify heterogeneous effects of the reform over time.

       Table A4 replicates the Nie et al (2010) results and shows a positive effect for all

firms in the short run on investment. Using just 2005 as the post-reform year shows that

the VAT policy increased fixed asset growth in nominal and real terms. However, in the

last three columns in Table A1 we see that the impact disappears if we include 2006 and

2007. Appendix Tables A5 and A6 distinguish between SOEs and privately-owned

firms. The results show that all the positive effects on investment were concentrated in

the SOEs. Contrasting the first three columns and the last three columns of Table A2, we

see that even for the SOEs the positive effects of the reform on fixed assets were

restricted to 2005 and are not sustained over a longer time period.

   In summary, the value-added tax reform reduced firm tax burdens significantly.

While the reform failed to increase investment, new product introduction, or productivity,

it is associated with a significant fall in employment. Firms shifted the composition of

fixed investment towards machinery and equipment, which allowed them to replace labor

inputs with capital. This could be described as a process innovation, which possibly



                                            22
delayed product innovation as reflected in the falling share of new products in total sales.

These results are robust to other estimation strategies including OLS and IV.



6. Conclusions

     This paper analyzes the impact of the value-added tax reform in China on firm

investment, new product introductions, total factor productivity, employment, and export

shares. We use three different approaches to ensure the robustness of our results: a

treatment dummy for treated regions and sectors using OLS estimation and an exhaustive

set of fixed effects, instrumental variable estimation using treatment as an instrument for

VAT payments, and a difference-in-difference propensity score matching approach. Our

results are consistent across all three approaches.

    While the goal of the experiment was to encourage upgrading of technology, our

results suggest that there was no significant increase in fixed investment, new product

introductions, or total factor productivity. However, we do find that firms shifted the

composition of investment towards machinery, and increased the capital intensity of

production, which is consistent with a fall in the price of capital relative to labor. As a

result, employment fell significantly in the treated provinces and sectors.

    For the propensity score matching, we construct a matched group and compare the

outcomes with the treated group. We find that the reform significantly reduced firms’ tax

burden. The tax reduction is also associated with falling employment for both domestic

and foreign firms, while its effect on firm investment, new product introduction, and

productivity was limited. For most firms, their exports fell in conjunction with the value-

added tax reform.

                                             23
    The insignificant effects that we find on productive investment, new product

introduction, and total factor productivity, combined with the fall in employment across

the board, suggest that the VAT reform was primarily associated with increasing capital

intensity and labor shedding. While the VAT reform may have prevented declines in

investment, it appears that those investments were primarily associated with labor-saving

techniques, rather than new product introductions or increasing process efficiency, which

would have been captured by TFP.

    Our most robust finding is the significant reduction in employment among treated

firms. Treated firms reduced employment by more than 10 percentage points. One policy

problem that should be considered for future research is whether encouraging such labor-

saving changes are optimal. Policy changes in both developed and developing countries

appear to be encouraging manufacturing growth which leads to small increases in

employment. For the US, for example, Ebenstein, Harrison, McMillan and Phillips

(2011) show that falling prices of investment goods led to a reduction in domestic

manufacturing employment.

    Since the benefits from the reform in terms of increasing aggregate investment and

even productive investment seem limited to labor-saving process innovation and targeted

at SOEs, one question is why the reform was extended to the rest of China. One likely

explanation is that extending the reform to the rest of China was part of a comprehensive

stimulus package in response to the 2008-2009 financial crisis.
