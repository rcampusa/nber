Differences in Quarterly Utilization-Adjusted TFP by Vintage, with an Application to News
Shocks

                                          ABSTRACT

This paper documents large differences across vintages in the properties of the widely-used
quarterly utilization-adjusted TFP series produced by Fernald (2014), who provides updated data
each quarter on his website. The most recent vintage of the adjusted TFP series has correlations
with earlier vintages of the series that are less than 0.6. Compared to earlier vintages, the most
recent vintage of the adjusted TFP data is more weakly correlated with output and more strongly
negatively correlated with hours worked. I revisit the empirical analysis from Barsky and Sims
(2011), who use an earlier vintage of Fernald's adjusted TFP data to identify impulse responses to
news shocks about future productivity in a structural VAR. The vintage of adjusted TFP data
matters for their estimated impulse responses, and in some specifications the differences using the
most recent vintage of the adjusted TFP data are qualitatively large in a way that is more
favorable to theories of news-driven business cycles.

1       Introduction
    Identifying the shocks which drive business cycles is one of the central tasks of macroeco-
nomic research. Ever since the contributions of Kydland and Prescott (1982) and Long and
Plosser (1983), economists have studied and debated the role of productivity shocks in driving
short run fluctuations. One of the principal difficulties in understanding the role of produc-
tivity shocks concerns the measurement of productivity in the data. While early approaches
typically used growth accounting techniques to measure total factor productivity (TFP) as
the residual component of aggregate output not explained by capital and labor, economists
quickly realized that measured TFP may be a poor measure of aggregate productivity due to
unobserved utilization of factors of production.1
    Partly in response to criticisms of traditional TFP series as a measure of productivity, Basu,
Fernald, and Kimball (2006) use restrictions derived from economic theory and disaggregated
industry-level data to construct an aggregate measure of TFP which is adjusted for unobserved
factor utilization, as well as imperfect competition and sectoral heterogeneity, at an annual
frequency. Fernald (2014) applies the basic analysis in Basu et al. (2006) to produce
a measure of TFP which controls for unobserved utilization at a quarterly, rather than
annual, frequency. He makes these data available for download on his personal website
(http://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/economists/john-fernald/). These data
are updated each quarter. Because of the higher frequency, not all of the corrections in
the original Basu et al. (2006) series are captured in the quarterly series, but perhaps the
most important one – the correction for variable factor utilization – is.2 The quarterly,
utilization-adjusted TFP series provided by Fernald has proven highly influential. As of
March 21, 2016, the working paper describing the construction of the adjusted TFP series
has been cited 211 times on Google Scholar.
    The purpose of this paper is to document that there are large and qualitatively important
differences in the time series properties among different vintages of the adjusted TFP series
provided on Fernald’s website. It is important that practitioners be aware of these differences
and how they might affect substantive conclusions in applied work making use of these data.
In the course of my own research, I have made use of three different vintages of Fernald’s
    1
       The idea that observed TFP fluctuations might in fact be driven by an endogenous response of factor
utilization to non-productivity shocks is mentioned by Summers (1986) in his early critique of real business
cycle models. Burnside, Eichenbaum, and Rebelo (1993) construct a structural model with labor hoarding
(another term for labor utilization) and conclude that much of the variation in TFP is not due to exogenous
productivity shocks.
     2
       In particular, the Basu et al. (2006) methodology allows for non-constant returns to scale, markups of
price over marginal cost, and observed factor shares not equaling output elasticities. These corrections are
only available at an annual frequency and are therefore not part of Fernald’s quarterly series, which only
adjusts TFP for variable utilization.


                                                     1
utilization-adjusted TFP series. These different vintages of data were created on December 1,
2007, September 16, 2011, and May 7, 2015. While none of the three vintages of adjusted
TFP data are identical, the differences are most striking comparing the 2015 vintage of data
to the two earlier vintages. In the text of Fernald (2014) and the accompanying notes on the
Excel spreadsheet available for download, Fernald is completely transparent in noting how
the construction of the series has varied over time. He does not, however, make a point to
note that the time series properties of the adjusted TFP series have changed in important
ways which might affect conclusions from empirical analyses using these data. My paper is
intended to fill this gap.
    Section 2 begins by presenting some simple descriptive statistics on the growth rates of
the adjusted TFP series by vintage.3 While all three vintages have fairly similar means and
standard deviations, the correlations of the 2015 vintage with either the 2007 or 2011 vintages
are quite low. In particular, while the correlation between the 2007 and 2011 vintage series
is 0.95, the correlations between the 2007 or 2011 vintages with the 2015 vintage are both
smaller than 0.6. These correlations are not driven by behavior during particular subsamples.
There are economically important differences in correlations of the different vintages of the
adjusted TFP series with key macroeconomic variables. While the 2007 and 2011 vintages of
adjusted TFP data are positively correlated with aggregate output and mildly negatively
correlated with total hours worked, the 2015 vintage of adjusted TFP data is uncorrelated
with output and strongly negatively correlated with total hours worked.
    Changes in the construction of the quarterly utilization series used to adjust the conven-
tional TFP series seem to be the principal driving force behind the differences in the time
series properties of the utilization adjusted TFP series by vintage. The correlations of the
utilization series used in the 2015 vintage with the utilization series used in the 2007 or 2011
vintages are only about 0.65. Constructing a synthetic 2015 vintage of adjusted TFP using
earlier vintages of the utilization series results in an adjusted TFP series that is much more
strongly correlated with either the 2007 or 2011 vintages of the data. Fernald (2014) notes
that two changes were made to the utilization series in 2014. First, he switches to using
updated utilization estimates from Basu, Fernald, Fisher, and Kimball (2013), which uses
the same methodology as Basu et al. (2006) but on more recent data. Second, he uses new
industry-level data to compute the aggregate utilization series. My own email exchanges with
Fernald indicate that the switch to the Basu et al. (2013) methodology likely explains the
disparate properties among newer and older vintages of the data – a vintage of the adjusted
TFP series from immediately prior to the switch in measurement of utilization (December of

     All statistics are based on a fixed sample size of 1947q3-2007q3, the end data of which is constrained by
data availability in the 2007 vintage of the data.


                                                      2
2013) looks very much like the 2007 and 2011 vintages, while a vintage from right after the
switch (May 2014) has properties similar to the 2015 vintage of the data.
    Having documented that different vintages of the utilization-adjusted TFP data might
produce very different unconditional correlations with aggregate variables of interest, I then
investigate whether the different vintages of adjusted TFP data might matter for conditional
moments. Fernald’s utilization-adjusted TFP series has been used extensively in the empirical
literature on news shocks about future productivity. In Section 3, I re-do the empirical
analysis from Barsky and Sims (2011) using different vintages of adjusted TFP data. These
authors estimate vector autoregression (VAR) models using the 2007 vintage of the adjusted
TFP series and other aggregate variables. They identify a news shock as the structural shock
uncorrelated with the reduced form innovation in adjusted TFP which maximally accounts
for the variance share of adjusted TFP over a ten year forecast horizon.
    Using the 2007 or 2011 vintages of the adjusted TFP data, I identify impulse responses to
a news shock that are very similar to those reported in Barsky and Sims (2011). In particular,
output and hours decline immediately in response to good news about future productivity.
Furthermore, the news shock accounts for a small fraction of the forecast error variance
of output at horizons before adjusted TFP begins to change. The results are potentially
different in an economically important way when using the 2015 vintage of adjusted TFP
data. In one of the VAR specifications in Barsky and Sims (2011), a positive news shock
results in a large and immediate output expansion and accounts for a healthy share of the
variance of output when the most recent vintage of adjusted TFP is used in the VAR. This
result is more favorable to the news-driven business cycle hypothesis than what obtains using
older vintages of the adjusted TFP data.


2    Data and Unconditional Moments
    This section begins by briefly describing the construction of the utilization-adjusted
total factor productivity series produced in Fernald (2014). I then proceed to present some
summary statistics on the adjusted TFP series which vary by vintage of when the data were
created, and show that different vintages of data display substantively different co-movements
with a number of other aggregate series. I then provide some investigation into what accounts
for the differences in the adjusted TFP series by vintage.
    The theory underlying the construction of the adjusted TFP series is as follows. Suppose
that there exists an aggregate production function of the form:

                                                    α      1−αt
                                 Yt = At (zt Kt ) t (et Lt )                              (1)

                                                3
Here Yt is output, Kt is physical capital, and Lt is labor input. The variables zt and et
represent capital utilization and labor effort, respectively. The parameter αt is a potentially
time-varying capital share parameter. I have imposed constant returns to scale in the
production function, so that the labor share is 1 − αt . The variable At is an exogenous
productivity variable.
   A traditional measure of TFP is defined as log output less share-weighted log observable
inputs (capital and labor). It is assumed that αt can be measured from aggregate data on
labor’s share of income. Taking logs of (1) and first differencing:


                       ∆ ln T F Pt = ∆ ln Yt − αt ∆ ln Kt − (1 − αt )∆ ln Lt
                                                                                           (2)
                                   = ∆ ln At + αt ∆ ln zt + (1 − αt )∆ ln et

From (2), it is straightforward to see that the traditional TFP series corresponds to the
exogenous productivity variable in the model only if capital utilization and labor effort are
constant.
    Define ut as total utilization, the share-weighted sum of capital utilization and labor
effort:

                              ∆ ln ut = αt ∆ ln zt + (1 − αt )∆ ln et                      (3)

If one could measure ∆ ln ut , one could define a new series, what I will label ∆ ln A ̂t and
refer to as “adjusted TFP,” by subtracting the growth rate of the total utilization series
from the growth rate of the traditional TFP series. To the extent to which the aggregate
production function is properly specified, this series ought to measure the the growth rate of
the exogenous productivity variable in (1):

                                 ∆ ln A
                                      ̂t = ∆ ln T F Pt − ∆ ln ut                           (4)

    Based on the underlying assumptions about the aggregate production function, Fernald
(2014) creates both a traditional TFP series and a utilization adjusted TFP series. The
construction of the traditional TFP series is based on the following aggregate data. Output
is measured as real output in the business sector. In earlier versions of the data, real output
is measured from the expenditure side of the NIPA accounts. In more recent vintages of
the data, he uses an average of the expenditure and income measures of business output.
Observed labor input is measured as the product of hours worked and labor quality. In
particular, let Lt = Ht Qt , where Ht is hours worked and Qt is labor quality. Ht is measured
from the BLS series on hours worked in the business sector. The labor quality series is based

                                                 4
on measurements in Aaronson and Sullivan (2001). The aggregate capital stock is based
on weighted growth in fifteen disaggregated types of capital, where NIPA investment data
are used to create perpetual inventory series. The share parameter αt is constructed using
interpolated annual NIPA data on payments to labor. These series are sufficient to construct
a quarterly measure of ∆ ln T F Pt .
    To create a quarterly measure of adjusted TFP, ∆ ln A     ̂t , it is necessary to have a data
series on ∆ ln ut . Fernald (2014) follows Basu et al. (2006) to construct an aggregate
quarterly utilization series from disaggregated industry-level data. The basic idea behind
this utilization series is that a cost-minimizing firm ought to want to vary inputs along all
margins simultaneously. Basu et al. (2006) estimate a series of industry-level regressions where
observed hours per worker is used as a proxy for unobserved input variation. The resulting
industry utilization series are then aggregated to a quarterly frequency using average industry
weights. Since March of 2014, the utilization series is constructed from updated utilization
estimates from Basu et al. (2013), which extends the Basu et al. (2006) methodology to more
recent data. Since August 2014, the utilization series have been based on updated hours per
worker data at the industry level, which potentially affects the resulting utilization series.
    I have data on adjusted TFP which were created on December 1, 2007, September 16,
2011, and May 7, 2015. I label the adjusted TFP series by vintage as ∆ ln A     ̂07 , ∆ ln A
                                                                                           ̂11 , and
                                                                                  t          t

∆ ln At . Table 1 presents some summary statistics for these series. For these statistics, the
      ̂
sample period runs from 1947q3 through 2007q3, the last period available in the 2007 data.
Data subsequent to 2007 are dropped from the 2011 and 2015 vintages for the purposes of
comparison. The statistics are based on annualized percentage values. The means of each
vintage of data are all close to 1.5 (i.e. the average annualized growth rate is about 1.5
percent). The mean value is highest for the 2007 series and lowest for the 2011 series. The
standard deviations of the different vintages of adjusted TFP growth are in the neighborhood
of 3.5, with the 2011 vintage data slightly more volatile than either the 2007 or 2015 vintages.
The differences in means and volatilities are fairly small, and could be largely explained by
data revisions near the end of the sample.
    The Table also presents simple correlation coefficients for the different vintages of data on
adjusted TFP growth. The correlation between the 2007 and 2011 vintages is very high at
0.95. The correlations between the 2007 and 2011 vintages with the 2015 vintage adjusted
TFP growth are much smaller. In particular, the correlation between the 2007 and 2015
vintage data is 0.58, while the correlation between the the 2011 and 2015 vintages is 0.59. In
other words, there are substantial differences in the time series properties of the early and
late vintages of the adjusted TFP growth series.
    The differences between the adjusted TFP series by vintage are not driven by particular


                                                 5
parts of the sample. Table 2 presents correlations among different vintages of the adjusted TFP
series over different samples. I consider the sample periods 1960q1-2007q3, 1960q1-1979q4,
and 1984q1-2007q3. The first sample period is meant to exclude some large movements
occurring in the immediate wake of World War II and some events surrounding the Korean
War. The final sample, 1984q1-2007q3, focuses on the so-called “Great Moderation” period
when the volatility of output and other aggregate variables fell. The 1960q1-1979q4 excludes
data from the immediate post-war period as well as the Great Moderation period. The
correlations among different vintages of the adjusted TFP data are very similar across different
samples. In particular, the correlations between the 2007 and 2011 vintages with the 2015
vintages are always about 0.6 (or smaller), while the correlation between the 2007 and 2011
vintages are always 0.9 or higher.


2.1     Business Cycle Moments
    Given the apparent large differences between the early (2007 and 2011) and late (2015)
vintages of the adjusted TFP growth series, it is natural to ask how the different vintages of
data co-move with different aggregate variables of interest. Tables 3 and 4 present correlations
of the different vintages of adjusted TFP data with several aggregate variables, the former for
log first differences, and the latter for HP filtered (smoothing parameter 1600) log levels of
the data. The aggregate variables considered include real GDP, consumption, and investment;
inflation (defined as the log first difference of the GDP deflator); hours (as measured from
both the non-farm business sector and the business sector); and real output (as measured
both in the non-farm business sector and the business sector).4 The aggregate data series
were downloaded in March of 2016. The sample period for all correlations is fixed across
vintages of TFP data from 1947q3 to 2007q3.
    I focus first on correlations based on log first differences of data, as presented in Table
3. The 2007 and 2011 vintages of adjusted TFP growth are strongly positively correlated
with real GDP growth, with correlations of 0.53 and 0.44, respectively. The 2015 vintage
adjusted TFP growth rate is close to uncorrelated with GDP at 0.07. One sees very similar
patterns when output is measured using real output in the non-farm business or business
sectors – adjusted TFP is most positively correlated with output using the 2007 vintage
adjusted TFP data, somewhat less positively correlated using the 2011 vintage data, and
is close to uncorrelated with output in the 2015 vintage data. The correlation of adjusted
   4
     The real GDP series is the headline NIPA number. Consumption is defined as real consumption of
non-durables and services. Investment is defined as the sum of durable consumption expenditures and private
fixed investment. Both of these series are constructed by using nominal share-weighted real growth rates
using individual price indexes. The inflation series is the log first difference of the GDP deflator. Hours and
real output in both the non-farm business and business sectors are directly available from the BLS.


                                                      6
TFP growth with consumption growth is small and positive and does not vary much by
vintage of TFP data. The correlation between adjusted TFP growth and the growth rate
of aggregate investment is positive across vintages of TFP data, but is substantially weaker
with the 2015 vintage of adjusted TFP data (0.07) than with the 2007 (0.29) or 2011 vintages
(0.23). Growth rates in adjusted TFP are mildly negatively correlated with inflation, with
similar correlations across vintages. As with data on output, there are large differences in the
correlations of the TFP growth rates by vintage with measures of aggregate hours growth.
The 2007 vintage of adjusted TFP data is mildly negatively correlated with hours growth, as
measured either using the non-farm business sector or the business sector. These correlations
are slightly more negative using the 2011 vintage of adjusted TFP data, but are qualitatively
similar to the correlations using the 2007 vintage data. The correlation of adjusted TFP
growth with hours growth using the 2015 vintage of adjusted TFP data is substantially more
negative (at about -0.4).
    I next consider correlations between HP filtered log levels of the different vintages of
adjusted TFP data with HP filtered log levels of different aggregate series. One observes
much the same pattern as when focusing on correlations in growth rates. Adjusted TFP
goes from mildly positively correlated with different measures of output in the 2007 vintage
data (correlation close to 0.15), to weakly negatively correlated with output measures in the
2011 data (correlation of -0.05), to more strongly negatively correlated with different output
measures in the 2015 vintage of adjusted TFP data (correlation of -0.2). Similar patterns
are evident for the correlations with consumption and investment, where the correlations of
adjusted TFP with these variables decrease going from early to later vintages of adjusted
TFP data. There is little difference in the correlations of HP filtered adjusted TFP with
inflation across vintages. As with output, there are large declines in the correlations between
adjusted TFP and HP filtered hours across vintages. In the 2007 vintage data, adjusted TFP
is weakly negatively correlated with either measure of hours (correlation of -0.1). In the 2015
vintage data, the correlation is much more negative (-0.4).
    In summary, the large differences evident in the adjusted TFP series by vintage translate
into substantive differences in correlations of the adjusted TFP series with different aggregate
variables. While the correlations for the 2007 and 2011 vintages of the adjusted TFP series
are qualitatively similar, there are important differences when using the 2015 vintage of the
data. Adjusted TFP goes from procyclical to acyclical or countercyclical, and there is a large
and quantitatively important decline in the correlations of the adjusted TFP series with
hours worked when moving from 2007 or 2011 vintage data to the 2015 vintage data.




                                               7
2.2     What Drives the Differences by Vintage?
    Given the large differences in the 2015 vintage of adjusted TFP data from earlier vintages,
a next natural question to ask is what drives these differences. Fernald (2014) makes available
on his website not only the adjusted TFP series itself, but also the series for the variables
that go into the construction of this series. These variables are the aggregate capital stock,
Kt ; aggregate labor hours, Ht ; aggregate labor quality, Qt ; and aggregate utilization, ut .5
    Table 5 presents descriptive statistics on the log first differences of the component series
that go into the construction of the adjusted TFP series. These statistics are based on
correlations of the data for the components series provided on Fernald’s website, and are
computed over a fixed sample period of 1947q3-2007q3. The output series used in the
construction of the 2007 and 2011 vintages of data are virtually identical, with a correlation
of 0.996. The 2015 vintage of output data is less correlated with the 2007 or 2011 data,
but the correlations are nevertheless still quite high at 0.96. These differences are likely
driven by the movement to measuring output as the average of expenditure and income
based output, as opposed to only using expenditure-based measures in the 2007 and 2011
vintages of data. The correlations of the growth rates of the capital stock by vintage are all
above 0.90. The 2011 and 2015 vintages of capital stock data appear almost identical. The
correlations between the 2007 vintage of capital stock data and the 2011 and 2015 vintages
are 0.94 and 0.91, respectively. There is virtually no difference in the hours series by vintage;
the correlations between the growth rates of hours are all above 0.999 across the different
vintages.
    In summary, there are some small differences in the output and capital stock series by
vintage, but these correlations are still fairly close to one, and it therefore seems unlikely that
these differences could account for the large differences in the final adjusted TFP series by
vintage. I next turn to a discussion of the labor quality series, Qt , and the total utilization
series, ut . The labor quality series in the 2011 and 2015 vintages of data are virtually identical,
with a correlation of 0.999. There is a large difference in the labor quality series used in
the 2007 vintage compared to the other two vintages. Not only is the 2007 quality series
about half as volatile as the 2011 and 2015 vintages (standard deviation of 0.4 compared to
standard deviations of about 0.7 for the two later vintages), but the 2007 labor quality series
is weakly correlated with either of the two later vintages of data (these correlations are both
about 0.4). In spite of the large differences between the 2007 and 2015 labor quality series,

    5
     On his website Fernald does not distinguish between capital utilization and labor effort, instead only
reporting the total utilization series, ut , defined in (3). Furthermore, there are some small differences in the
variable αt across vintages, but these are not important for differences in the final adjusted TFP series by
vintage.

it seems unlikely that different measures of the labor quality series are the primary driving
force behind the differences in the final adjusted TFP series. This is because the correlation
between growth rates of adjusted TFP in the 2011 and 2015 vintages of data is less than 0.6,
in spite of the fact that the labor quality series are virtually identical.
    The 2007 and 2011 vintages of the total utilization series are quite similar. In spite of the
fact the 2011 vintage utilization series is a good bit more volatile than the 2007 series, the
correlation between the utilization series across these two vintages is 0.96. In contrast, there
are large differences between the 2015 vintage utilization data and either the 2007 or 2011
vintages. The correlation between the 2007 and 2015 vintage utilization series is 0.66, and
the correlation between the 2011 and 2015 vintages is 0.64.
    To investigate the possibility that differences in the utilization and/or labor quality series
are driving the differences in the adjusted TFP series by vintage, I compute synthetic measures
of adjusted TFP in 2011 and 2015 using 2007 vintage utilization and/or labor quality data.
That is, I re-construct the 2011 or 2015 adjusted TFP series using component series from
that same vintage, with the exception of utilization and/or labor quality, for which I use the
2007 vintage series. I then look at correlations between the synthetic 2011 or 2015 series with
the actual 2007 vintage data. Table 6 presents these correlations.
    The correlation between the synthetic 2011 adjusted TFP series using 2007 vintage
utilization data and the actual 2007 vintage data is 0.98, slightly higher than the correlations
between the actual series (0.95). The correlation between the synthetic 2015 adjusted TFP
series using 2007 vintage utilization data and the actual 2007 vintage of data is 0.91. This
is substantially higher than the correlation between the actual vintages of data, which is
only 0.59. As the middle panel of the Table suggests, using the 2007 vintage labor quality
series makes almost no difference for the correlations between the synthetic adjusted TFP
series and the actual 2007 vintage of data. Finally, the last panel of the table constructs
synthetic 2011 and 2015 vintages of the data using both the 2007 vintage utilization series as
well as the 2007 vintage labor quality series. The correlations of these synthetic series with
the actual 2007 vintage adjusted TFP data are slightly higher than when the synthetic series
are constructed using just the 2007 vintage utilization series, but these differences are small.
    The above analysis suggests that the principal factor driving the differences between
the 2015 vintage of adjusted TFP data and the 2007 and 2011 vintages are differences in
the utilization series. While there are large differences in the labor quality series across
vintages, these differences do not seem very important for the final adjusted TFP series.
These findings align with notes available on the data for download that two changes were
made to the utilization series in 2014 – an update to using the Basu et al. (2013) methodology
for producing the utilization series in March of 2014, and an update in August of 2014 making


                                                9
use of new data on hours per worker in the industry-level regressions underlying the final
utilization series.
    An email exchange with Fernald confirms that the switch to the Basu et al. (2013)
methodology for computing the utilization series is the principal driving force for changes
in the adjusted TFP series by vintage. He provided me with vintages of the data both
immediately prior (December 2013) and immediately after (May 2014) the switch to using
Basu et al. (2013), which occurred in March of 2014. I label these vintages of adjusted TFP
and utilization as ∆ ln A  ̂13 , ∆ ln A
                                      ̂14 , ∆ ln u13 , and ∆ ln u14 . Table 7 shows correlations of
                             t          t         t              t
these two vintages of the data with the other vintages which I previously had in my possession.
The December 2013 vintage of adjusted TFP data is strongly positively correlated with the
2007 and 2011 vintages of the data. It is weakly correlated with the vintage from five months
later, with a correlation of only 0.63. One observes a similar pattern for the utilization data.
The December 2013 vintage of the utilization data is very strongly correlated with the 2007
and 2011 vintages, with correlation coefficients of 0.94 and 0.97, respectively. The correlation
drops dramatically after the switch the Basu et al. (2013) methodology, with the correlation
between the December 2013 vintage utilization series and the May 2014 vintage only 0.59.
    It is interesting to examine how Fernald’s reported utilization series compares to another
popular measure of utilization, the Federal Reserve Board’s capacity utilization series. This
series is available at a monthly frequency beginning in 1967. I convert it to a quarterly
frequency by averaging observations within quarter, and then compute correlations of this
series with Fernald’s reported utilization series by vintages over the period 1967q1 through
2007q3. The correlation between the 2007 vintage utilization data and the FRB’s series
is 0.65. The correlation between the 2011 vintage utilization series and the FRB capacity
utilization series is virtually identical. The 2015 vintage utilization data is much more weakly
correlated with the FRB capacity utilization series, however. In particular, the correlation
between the 2015 vintage utilization series and the FRB capacity utilization series is 0.48.


3     Application to News Shocks
    Section 2 documents significant differences in the adjusted TFP series by vintage provided
by Fernald (2014). It also shows that these differences have substantive effects on unconditional
correlations of the adjusted TFP series by vintage with several aggregate variables. This
section considers how different vintages of the adjusted TFP data might affect conditional
moments. In particular, I examine how different vintages of the adjusted TFP data might
affect conclusions about the macroeconomic effects of “news shocks” about future productivity.
The utilization adjusted TFP data provided by Fernald (2014) have been extensively used in

                                                10
this literature.6
    I follow the empirical strategy outlined in Barsky and Sims (2011). They seek to identify
the macroeconomic effects of news shocks about future productivity, where the news shock is
defined as a shock to future productivity which is observed by agents in advance. In their
empirical analysis they make use of the 2007 vintage of adjusted TFP data provided by
Fernald (2014). Their substantive conclusion is that while news shocks are an important
driver of output movements in the medium run, in the short run a favorable news shock
causes output and hours worked to decline, while consumption rises. That is, not only
does a positive news shock lead to a contraction in economic activity, it induces negative
co-movement between consumption and output. This co-movement makes news shocks a poor
candidate source of business cycle fluctuations. These responses are qualitatively consistent
with the implications of flexible price, real business cycle models.
    The interested reader is referred to Barsky and Sims (2011) for technical details of the
empirical approach. The basic identification strategy can be summarized briefly as follows.
First, a reduced form finite-order vector autoregression (VAR) is estimated on a set of data
which includes a measure of adjusted TFP. A surprise productivity shock is identified as the
reduced form innovation in adjusted TFP (i.e. this is equivalent to ordering adjusted TFP
first in a Choleski decomposition). The news shock is then identified as the linear combination
of reduced form innovations in the VAR, restricted to be orthogonal to the surprise adjusted
TFP innovation, which maximally explains the remaining variance share of adjusted TFP
over some specified forecast horizon. The approach can be applied to a VAR in levels, a VAR
in first differences with imposed cointegrating relationships, or to a vector error correction
model (VECM) where cointegrating relationships are formally estimated.


3.1     A Four Variable VAR
    Barsky and Sims (2011) begin by estimating a four variable VAR. The variables included in
the VAR are the 2007 vintage of adjusted TFP, real consumption of non-durables and services
(the construction of which is explained in Footnote 4), real output in the non-farm business
sector, and total hours worked in the non-farm business sector. The consumption, output, and
hours series are expressed in per capita units by dividing by the civilian non-institutionalized
population aged sixteen and over. The VAR is estimated in log-levels of the variables, with
four lags. The sample period is 1960q1-2007q3. The news shock is identified by maximizing

   6
     In addition Barsky and Sims (2011), other prominent examples of papers which seek to identify news
shocks using Fernald’s quarterly adjusted TFP series include Kurmann and Otrok (2013), Beaudry and
Portier (2014), Kurmann and Mertens (2014), Barsky, Basu, and Lee (2015), Levchenko and Pandalai-Nayar
(2015), and Ben-Zeev and Kahn (2015).


                                                  11
its contribution to the variance share of adjusted TFP over a forty quarter horizon.
    I re-estimate this four variable VAR using the aforementioned three different vintages
of adjusted TFP data – the 2007 vintage as in Barsky and Sims (2011), as well as the 2011
and 2015 vintages. The same consumption, output, and hours data are used in each VAR.
Impulse responses to the identified news shock are shown in Figure 1. Solid lines depict the
responses estimated using the 2007 vintage adjusted TFP data, dashed lines correspond to
responses estimated from the 2011 vintage of data, and dotted lines are from estimation with
the 2015 vintage adjusted TFP data.
    The impulse responses estimated from the 2007 vintage data are virtually identical to the
responses reported in Barsky and Sims (2011). Adjusted TFP increases rather quickly and
continues to grow for an extended period of time. Consumption jumps up on impact, while
output and hours decline. The impact decline in hours is particularly strong. Subsequent to
impact, output, consumption, and hours all grow with adjusted TFP. The output response
quickly turns positive, while it takes about four quarters for the hours response to turn
positive. After turning positive, hours worked grows for a while before reverting back to
its pre-shock value. In the long run, consumption and output are about 0.5 percent higher,
while adjusted TFP is higher by about 0.3 percent. These long run responses are roughly
consistent with balanced growth implications with a labor’s share parameter of two-thirds.
    The impulse responses estimated with the 2011 vintage of adjusted TFP are very similar
to those estimated from the 2007 vintage data. Relative to the 2007 vintage data, the adjusted
TFP response to the news shock is a bit slower, consumption increases by less on impact,
hours worked fall substantially on impact but by a little less than with the 2007 data, and
output actually rises slightly on impact. Nevertheless, these differences are quantitatively
small, and qualitatively the impulse responses look quite similar to those estimated with the
2007 vintage data.
    There are large and substantive differences with the impulse responses estimated using
the 2015 vintage of adjusted TFP data relative to either the 2007 or 2011 vintages. Most
notably, output is estimated to rise significantly on impact, with an increase of about 0.5
percent, close to its estimated long run response. Hours worked essentially does not respond
on impact, before turning significantly positive after about four quarters. These responses
appear much more favorable to the news-driven business cycle story than the responses
estimated using either the 2007 or 2011 vintages of adjusted TFP data.
    The large differences in the estimated impulse response functions are also evident in a
forecast error variance decomposition. Table 8 presents the forecast error variance decom-
position of output, hours, and consumption for the three different vintages of the adjusted
TFP data under consideration. The numbers in the table show the percentage of the forecast


                                             12
error variance share of each variable attributable to the identified news shock at different
forecast horizons (h = 0 (impact), h = 4, h = 8, and h = 16). Using either the 2007 or 2011
vintages of adjusted TFP data, the news shock explains essentially none of the variance share
of output on impact and a large share of the hours variance. At longer forecast horizons, the
news shock accounts for somewhat more of the output variance but substantially less of the
variance of hours worked. The long run variance share of output and consumption accounted
for by the news shock is between forty and fifty percent, in line with the estimates in Barsky
and Sims (2011). The variance decomposition using the 2015 vintage of data is quite different.
The news shock accounts for more than a quarter of the impact variance share of output and
virtually none of the impact variance share of hours worked. The variance share due to the
news shock grows for output as the forecast horizon is longer, and the news shock accounts
for a larger share of medium horizon fluctuations in hours worked than with either the 2007
or 2011 data.
    Barsky and Sims (2011) also show impulse responses to a surprise productivity shock,
identified as the reduced form innovation in adjusted TFP ordered first. Figure 2 plots the
responses of adjusted TFP and hours worked to the surprise productivity shock identified
using the three different vintages of adjusted TFP. Regardless of vintage of data, the surprise
productivity shock is persistent but clearly transitory. With the 2007 or 2011 vintages of
adjusted TFP data, hours worked increases (albeit not by much) in response to a positive
surprise productivity shock. This is in line with the results in Barsky and Sims (2011). Using
the 2015 data, in contrast, hours worked declines after a positive productivity shock, both on
impact and even more so at longer forecast horizons. These differences are important when
thinking about mapping the results back into a model. Hours worked increasing following a
positive productivity shock is consistent with a flexible price, real business cycle model, while
hours worked declining when productivity increases is potentially consistent with a sticky
price, New Keynesian model.


3.2     A Seven Variable VAR
    Barsky and Sims (2011) also identify a news shock in a seven variable VAR. In addition
to the adjusted TFP series, output, consumption, and hours worked, their seven variable
VAR also includes a measure of inflation, a measure of consumer confidence, and a measure
of stock prices.7 There are tradeoffs at play when considering how many variables to include
   7
     The measure of consumer confidence is a qualitative index of five year ahead business condition
expectations available from the Michigan Survey of Consumers. The inflation measure is the log first difference
of the GDP deflator. The real stock price series is the nominal S&P 500 index, aggregated to a quarterly
frequency by averaging over months, deflated by the GDP deflator. The stock price series is downloaded from
Robert Shiller’s website: http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data.htm. The definitions of inflation and


                                                      13
in a VAR. On the one hand, including extraneous variables reduces statistical precision
and could potentially induce spurious results. On the other hand, it is important that the
variables included in the VAR span the information set of agents in an economy. News
shocks are known to potentially induce non-invertibility into a VAR model, which means that
structural shocks cannot be recovered from reduced form innovations. Sims (2012) shows
that non-invertibility is essentially a problem of missing information. Adding more variables
to a VAR, particularly forward-looking variables like stock prices or consumer confidence,
can solve or alleviate an invertibility problem.
    Figure 3 plots impulse responses to identified news shocks in the seven variable VAR
system. As in the four variable system, the VARs are estimated in log levels with four lags.
The solid lines show responses using the 2007 vintage of adjusted TFP data, the dashed lines
the 2011 vintage of adjusted TFP data, and the dotted lines the 2015 vintage. Interestingly,
the differences in impulse responses across VARs estimated with different vintages of adjusted
TFP data are smaller than in the four variable VAR. In particular, regardless of vintage, a
positive news shock leads to an impact reduction in hours and output, and an impact increase
in consumption. After impact, all of these variables grow along with adjusted TFP. Inflation
falls on impact, stock prices rise, and consumer confidence rises significantly.8 Comparing
responses across vintages, it is the case that the impact declines in both hours and output are
smaller with the 2015 vintage of adjusted TFP data, but the impact responses are nevertheless
both negative.
    Figure 4 plots impulse responses of adjusted TFP and hours worked to the surprise
productivity shock identified as the reduced form innovation in the seven variable VAR.
Similarly to the four variable VAR, the impact response of hours is positive using either the
2007 or 2011 vintages of adjusted TFP. In contrast, the impact response of hours is negative
when the VAR is estimated using the 2015 vintage of adjusted TFP data.
    In summary, the vintage of adjusted TFP data from Fernald (2014) is potentially important
when drawing inference about the macroeconomic consequences of news shocks about future
productivity. Using the most recent vintage of data, in a four variable VAR the news shock
is estimated to lead to a large increase in output in advance of changes in productivity,
potentially leading credence to the news-driven business cycle hypothesis. The results in the
seven variable VAR are more consistent across vintages and in line with the conclusions in

the real stock price differ slightly from those used in Barsky and Sims (2011). They measure inflation via the
percentage change in the CPI, and deflate the nominal stock price via the CPI. Furthermore, they use end of
quarter observations to transform the underlying monthly series to a quarterly frequency, whereas here I take
within-quarter averages.
    8
      The inflation response is much less persistent than reported in Barsky and Sims (2011), which arises due
to the different price deflator used in the present paper. The responses of the other variables are very close to
what is reported in Barsky and Sims (2011).


                                                       14
Barsky and Sims (2011), though it is the case that impact declines in output and hours are
smaller using the 2015 vintage of adjusted TFP data compared to earlier vintages. In either
VAR, hours worked decline on impact, rather than rise in earlier vintages of the data, to a
surprise productivity shock.


4    Conclusion
    This paper documents quantitatively large and qualitatively meaningful differences across
vintages in the properties of the quarterly utilization-adjusted TFP series developed by
Fernald (2014). The most recent vintage of the adjusted TFP series is much less procyclical,
and more negatively correlated with labor market indicators, than earlier vintages of the
series. The differences across vintage seem to be driven primarily by changes in 2014 in the
way that factor utilization series is computed.
    The quarterly utilization-adjusted TFP series provided on Fernald’s website has proven
highly influential in applied work. There are many papers which have made use of these data
whose empirical results may differ in important ways when using the most recent vintage
of the data. As an illustration of this, I revisit the literature on the effects of news shocks
about future productivity. Fernald’s data have been used extensively in this literature. I
re-estimate both the four and seven variable VARs in Barsky and Sims (2011) using three
different vintages of the adjusted TFP series. In the seven variable VAR, their results are
qualitatively robust to using the most recent vintage of the adjusted TFP data, though with
the most recent vintage output and hours fall less in response to favorable news than with
older vintages of the adjusted TFP data. In their four variable VAR, the results with the
most recent vintage of the adjusted TFP data are qualitatively different in way that is much
more favorable to the news-driven business cycle hypothesis.

Notes: This table shows correlations of the growth rates of the adjusted TFP series with the log first differences of several
different aggregate variables (with the exception of the inflation rate, πt , which appears in levels). Yt is the headline real GDP
series from the NIPA tables. Ytnf and Ytb are the real output series in the non-farm business and business sectors, respectively.
Ct is real consumption of non-durables and services, constructed using nominal share weights to sum the growth rates of real
nondurable and real services consumption. It is real investment, defined as the sum of expenditure on durable goods and private
fixed investment. The real series is constructed in the same way as the consumption series. πt is the log first difference of the
GDP price deflator. Ht is hours worked in the non-farm business sector, and Htb is hours worked in the business sector. These
correlations are computed over the sample period 1947q3-2007q3.

Notes: This table shows correlations of the December 2013 and May 2014 vintages of the adjusted TFP and utilizaton data
with other vintages of the same data. These vintages are immediately before and after the switch to the Basu et al. (2013)
methodology for measuring factor utilization, which occurred in March 2014.

Notes: This table presents a forecast error variance decomposition of output, consumption, and hours based on the four variable
VARs estimated in Section 3.1. The left column corresponds to the forecast horizon, where h = 0 is impact. The numbers in
the table are the fraction of the forecast error variance of each variable attributable to the identified news shock.
