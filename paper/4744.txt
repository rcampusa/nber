       This paper develops a model of regional production networks based on localization

economies. I consider an industry with two activities: one with location-specific external

economies, the other with constant returns. Under autarky, localization economies imply the

formation of an industry center. Agglomeration drives up wages in the center, causing the

constant returns activity to disperse to outlying regions. Trade recreates the regional production

network on a global scale. I apply the model to data from the Mexican apparel industry.

Estimation results on Mexico's pre- and post-trade regional apparel wage structure are consistent

with localization economies. Implications for the North American Free Trade Agreement

(NAFTA) are discussed.

1. IntroductIon

       The past decade has witnessed an unprecedented move towards free trade in the
developing world. As expected, trade has led to a sectoral reallocation of reurces towards

labor-intensive activities (Michaely, Papageorgious, and Choksi 1991). Somewhat less expected,

trade has also led to a vertical reorganization of production: labor-intensive industries, such as

apparel, footwear, and electronics, are shifting from vertically-integrated production for the

domestic market to the specialized task of product assembly for foreign firms (Grunwald and

Flaxnm 1985). In this arrangement, which I term a regional production network, developed-

country firms supply product designs, process technology, and marketing services and subcontract

assembly services to branch plants in developing countries. Regional production networks

account for a large portion of developing-country trade. In Mexico, for instance, assembly plants

accounted for 40 percent of 1992 total exports and 53 percent of 1992 manufacturing exports.

       In this paper, I develop a model of regional production networks and apply it to a study

of the Mexican apparel industry. The distinguishing feature of an regional production network

is that the services developed-country firms provide — design, engineering, and marketing — are

skill-intensive. The model is based on the idea there are external economies in these activities

which account for the observed pattern of industry location. Consider a small country (where

size proxies for development) with an industry that has two production stages: design, which has

location-specific external economies, and assembly, which has constant returns to scale.

Localization economies arise endogenously from the fact design involves many specialized

subsidiary services, each produced under increasing returns to scale. By agglomerating in an

industry center, firms share design capacity and expand the range of services available to them.


                                                1
Agglomeration, however, drives up wages in the industry center, pushing assembly into outlying

regions. Now suppose the small country opens to trade with a large country. Trade recreates

the regional production network on a global scale: the large country, by virtue of its size,

captures the industry center the small country, given low relative wages, specializes in assembly.

        The model extends the vertical-production framework in Rivera-Bath (1988) and Krugman

and Venables (1993) to one in which labor is mobile regionally and internationally. Regional

production networks resemble multinational enterprises in that trade may take the form of

intraflnn transactions (Helpman and Krugman 1985 and Markusen and Rutherford 1993).

Regional production networks, however, are not restricted to intrafirm trade. Indeed, the semi-

durable good industries in which regional production networks predominate contain many firms

and involve substantial interfirm trade. The tension between agglomeration and congestion costs

draws on models of city formation due to increasing returns (Fujita 1988 and Krugman 1991).

        Mexico provides a unique opportunity to study the effects of trade on industry location.

In 1985, Mexico decided to join the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATfl, bringing

a sudden end to four decades of import-substitution industrialization. For Mexico, the proximity

and size of the U.S. economy makes trade liberalization tantamount to economic integration with

its northern neighbor. The recent passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement

(NAFTA) only formalizes a de facto process of integration already under way.

       What makes apparel an interesting case is the variation in reurce intensity across

production stages. Some activities, such as design and finishing, are specialized tasks that require

skilled labor. In the global apparel industry, specialized input suppliers are agglomerated in a

few locations, such as New York, Los Angeles, and Hong Kong. (The simple fact New York


                                                2
City remains a major apparel producer is perhaps the most persuasive evidence one can find of

localization economies.) Assembly, the other major production task, requires relatively few skills.

Firms in global apparel centers subcontract assembly to firms in low-wage regions.

       The data are consistent with the hypothesis of localization economies. Under the closed

economy, high-skill apparel tasks clustered in Mexico City, while assembly took place in outlying

regions. With the opening to trade, Mexican apparel producers are shifting from production for

the domestic market to product assembly for U.S. firms. Econometric estimation of Mexico's pie

and post-trade regional wage structure supports the theoretical results. This suggests NAFI'A will

not only shift apparel assembly jobs from the United States to Mexico, as many studies have

predicted, but also lead to a substantial relocation of production within Mexico, reducing wages

in Mexico City relative to those along the Mexico-U.S. border.

       The body of the paper contains three sections. Section two develops a model of a

regional production network. Section three presents data on the location and organization of the

Mexican apparel industry. Section four presents empirical results. A final section concludes.



IL Theory

A. The Model

        Consider two countries, Foreign, which has a single region and represents the United

States, and Home, which has two regions, North and South, and represents Mexico. Each country

has landowners, who own one unit of land, and workers, who own one unit of labor. Foreign

has L workers and X landlords; Home has L workers and X landlords. I assume C L and X'

 X. Labor is mobile across regions and may be mobile across countries; land is completely


                                                 3
immobile. Endowments are supplied inelastically; landowners receive rental income and workers

receive wage income. Tastes and technology are identical in each country. There are two

consumption goods, housing, X, and apparel, Y. Each country spends a share a of its income

on housing and a share 1-ct on apparel, as would arise with identical Cobb-Douglas preferences.

         I use apparel production to motivate the model, but the basic technology — a production

process that has both specialized high-skill tasks and routine low-skill tasks -- is general to many

semi-durable consumer goods. High-skill activities occur in the initial and final stages of apparel

production. Before making a garment, a firm must create a design and turn the design into a

workable pattern. The finishing stage includes detail activities such as pleating, beitmaking, and

embroidering. I capture skill intensity by assuming design and finishing services have increasing

returns to scaie. The intermediate stage of apparel production is product assembly, in which

workers sew together cut pieces of fabric. Unlike design and finishing, assembly is a basic

activity that requires few skills. It accounts for three-fourths of apparel employment.

         Production of apparel, Y, is given by

        (1) r — VsZ1-I

Z is an intermediate input that represents assembly, for which production is given by

        (2) Z •


where L, is labor used in Z. V is an aggregate of many differentiated producer services,


                  ,
       (3) W—(s1)

s,   is output of service 1, N is the number of services provided (both of which are endogenous),


                                                 4
and a measures the substitutability of services in production (as a goes to I services become

perfect substitutes). Each service is produced under an identical increasing-returns technology

     (4) L • a + b31

where L, is labor used in producing service S. The symmetry of producer services implies


      (5)    —       —




which, following Rivera-Batiz (1988), allows me to rewrite (1) as


      (6) Y— (N)Z'
Equation (6) shows the source of external economies: output of Y is increasing in N. As more

services become available, the production process becomes smoother and final-good output

increases, holding constant total service output.

       A crucial assumption is that Z is traded across regions but services are not. What makes

services non-traded is that relative to transport costs the value added of an individual service is

smafl. The same is not true for assembly, which makes it feasible to subcontract the activity to

distant locations. To produce Y a firm needs to be in a region where S production occurs. With

increasing returns, not all services can be produced. The arrival of an additional Y producer

expands the range of services provided, conferring an externality on firms already in the region.



B. Autarky

Foreign. First consider autarky in Foreign. Suppose there are a large number of service firms,

each producing a single product. Given the service aggregate (3), I can apply the standard result


                                                5
 that the price-elasticity of demand facing any individual firm is (l-a)' (Helpman and Krugrnan

 1985). The profit-maximizing behavior of a representative service firm is to price according to

       (7) p•, —

where P is the price of service i. With free entry into services, profits will be driven to zero,

which implies

       (8)            — v(a + b8)

             0.   _________
                   b(1—c)
      (10) L —


Symmetry implies all service firms choose the same price and output levels.

        Profit maximization in Y production implies


      (ii) .-.. — (1—O)z4(s?)
      (12)        —




Combining (7), (9), (10), and the above first-order conditions yields

                3 10 - Z
      (13) N-1-———.0_.


Using (2) and the full-employment condition in Foreign, L + NL = L', I derive that

      (14) ir — L.O(10)
     (15) L, — L(1—O)


Due to increasing returns, N is increasing in the labor supply. As a goes to I (services become

more substitutable) N becomes small. From (14) and (15) it is trivial to solve for relative prices.


                                                6
Borne. Autarky in Home has three possible configurations of production: (i) regional autarky,

(ii) agglomeration of S and Y in one region, with Z divided between the regions, and (iii)

regional specialization, in which one region specializes in Z and the other in S and y.

Depending on parameter values, either (i) and (ii) or (i) and (iii) are both equilibria. Regional

autarky, however, is unlikely to be a stable equilibrium. Given external economies are localized,

Y producers want to be near S producers and vice-versa. If one region gains a slight advantage

in the number of service firms, it will atact all of the Y producers. For this reason, I focus on

agglomeration equilibria. Without loss of generality, I assume S is produced in South and Z is

divided between the two regions and then derive the conditions consistent with this outcome.

       To make distance matter, I assume there are nansport costs between production stages.

Think of these costs as resulting from coordinating production in different locations. Transport

costs take an "iceberg form: of each unit of Z shipped between regions, a fraction 3 <1 arrives.

       Service output in Home is the same as in Foreign, given in (9), and service prices are

again a fixed markup over cost, as in (7). The number of services produced is not necessarily

the same. Let n denote North and s denote South. Profit maximization implies

which implies that N and Z are related as in (13) and that

Nominal wages are lower in North due to ansport costs in delivering Z to the industry center.

        Land rents work against agglomeration, ensuring production occurs in North. Assume the

X landowners are equally divided between North and South. Market clearing in X implies

The formation of an industry center in South gives South a larger share of labor force than North.

Using (13) and the fact that V = V + NL,, L' = L, and Z = V, + 6L, I derive


     (27) N — O(1—)           (8+6) z

                                                       8
The condition that Z production occurs in South, the industry center, is that 1-8 > 95a, which

is more likely to hold the larger the Z share in output and the higher transport costs.

       Under autarky, the interaction of localization economies and transport costs creates a

regional production network: high-skill activities concentrate in an industry center, low-skill

activities disperse to low-wage regions. Agglomeration bids up the price of land in the center,

driving workers into the non-agglomerated region. Positive transport costs counteract migratory

pressures, as firms pay lower wages in regions distant from the industry center.



C. Trade
       Consider trade between Home and Foreign where labor is immobile between countries.

To retain regional symmetry in Home, I assume there are iceberg transport costs of y on each

unit of Z shipped from North or South to Foreign.

       Given L > L, we expect Foreign to be the low-cost producer of Y. This will be the case

if wIP,, the Foreign relative price of Z and Y, exceeds w/(yP,), the Home relative price of Z
and Y, which, applying the autarky equilibrium solutions to (11) and (17), requires

               I—1

     '29' L> 6  • +6
          L
                  6' +1
A sufficient condition for (29) to hold is that Foreign has a larger labor force than Home.

       Autarky relative prices do not uniquely determine the trading equilibrium. External

economies imply one country will capture Y production. Even if Foreign is the larger country,

Home could become the industry center. If finns in both countries believe S and Y production

wifi concentrate in Home, no individual Foreign firm will have an incentive to enter either

                                                9
industry. Autarky relative prices, however, are likely to be a strong guide. If in adjusting to

trade firms respond to autarky relative prices, then in the equilibrium that obtains Home will

specialize in Z and Foreign will specialize in S and Y. It is this equilibrium I study.

       If Foreign captures the entire Y market, all home labor is dedicated to Z production and

Foreign labor is divided between S and Z. Since the output of each service is given by (10), the

trading equilibrium can be summarized by solving for L, the amount of Foreign labor dedicated

to Z production, and N, the number of foreign service finns. Profit maximization implies

           7


     (32) f —

     (33)      -

Trade recreates the regional production network on a global scale: Foreign becomes the global

industty center and subcontracts input production to Home. Equations (32) and (33) show that

w' = w, which implies L' =       = L/2 or that trade causes a spatial redistribution of labor in

Home. Home specialization in Z means firms in South have no basis for paying high relative

wages; regional wage equalization in Home causes migration from South to North. Let the Home

wage be w. Equating (32) and (31), w/w = 1/y> I.     If z production occurs in both Home and
Foreign, nominal wages are equalized in the two countries, adjusting for transport costs.

       The condition for factor-price equalization (FPE) is the same as that for Z production to

occur in Foreign. Equating (30) and (31) and using the fact that L + NL =C


                                              10

                                   OyL


The condition for FPE, then, is that LIC > (l-8)f&y, which is more likely to hold the smaller is

Home relative to Foreign, the smaller is the share of Z in Y production, and the smaller are

transport costs (i.e., the larger is ).

        Since the motivating example for the model is Mexico-U.S. trade, it may seem odd to

focus on the FPE case. Wages in the United States clearly exceed those in Mexico. Some

portion of the difference is surely due to productivity differences. If we think of L and C as

efficiency units, FPE is the equalization of wages per efficiency unit. Still, massive Mexican

immigration into the United States is evidence wages per efficiency unit are not equalized in the

two countries. Appendix A considers the case where FPE does not obtain and there is migration

from Home to Foreign. The results are qualitatively the same as those with immobile labor.



[H. The Data
         This section presents evidence on the organization and location of apparel production in

Mexico before and after trade liberalization. I employ data from the Mexico Industrial Census

and from 95 firm-level interviews I conducted in the Mexican apparel industry during 1990-1991

(appendix B describes interview methods and the sample of firms). Firm-level interviews are the

only urce of information on the internal organization of firms. Interview material suggest

 patterns of industrial organization that in most cases can be corroborated by Census data.'



       Interview material are used lely to determine the nature of subcontracting activities. All data for
 estimation and summasy statistics are from the In4ust,id Census or another cited urce.

                                                       11
        The simple model presented above captures the essential features of apparel production

and trade in Mexico. Under the closed economy, high-skill apparel tasks concentrated in Mexico

City; low-skill tasks located in nearby communities. With the opening to trade, Mexico is

shifting from vertically-integrated production for the domestic market to product assembly for

foreign manufacturers. The shift involves industry relocation to the Mexico-U.S border region.



A. Trade Policy in Mexico

        Mexico began to construct a trade regime based on import substitution in the 1940's.

Trade restrictions took the form of import licenses, tariffs, and export controls (King 1970). In

1985, Mexico reversed its inward-oriented policy and began to liberalize trade. Between July

1985 and December 1987, import-license requirements fell from 92.2 percent of national

production to 23.2 percent. and the production-weighted-average tariff fell from 27 percent to

11.0 percent. with a 20 percent maximum. In apparel, the weighted-average tariff fell from 49.8

percent to 20 percent and import licenses fell from 100.0 percent to zero (Hanson 1994).

        Trade liberalization was not the apparel industry's first exposure to world markets. In the

1960's, the govermnent began to allow off-shore assembly in free-trade zones along the Mexico-

U.S. border (Grunwald and Flamm 1985). Off-shore assembly is one component of regional

production networks. A foreign firm, typically from the United States, establishes an assembly

plant. known as a maquiladora, in Mexico. The maquiladora imports all inputs from the foreign

firm, assembles the inputs in Mexico, and exports the final product back to the foreign firm.2

Off-shore assembly plants are exempt from import duties as long as they export all output


     Item 807 of the u.S. tariff schedule allows finns that engage in off-shore assemb'y of U.S. manufactured
components to only pay import duties on the value-added abroad.

                                                      12
        Figure 1 shows the value of imports and exports for domestic and off-shore apparel

industries from 1982 to 1990 (Secretariat of Trade and Industrial Promotion, unpublished data).

Trade has increased dramatically since liberalization. The United States is Mexico's major

trading partner in apparel. In 1990, 66.2 percent of non-maquiladora apparel exports went to the

United States, and 52.9 percent of Mexican apparel imports caine from the United States.4



B. The Vertical Organization of Apparel Production

        Apparel production is organized around assembly subcontracting. Manufacturers control

product design, finishing, and marketing, and divide assembly between their own shops and

independent subcontractors. Under the closed economy, most domestic apparel manufacturers

located in Mexico City and subcontracted assembly to shops in nearby communities. The Mexico

Industrial Census provides indirect evidence of subcontracting. Table 1 reports the size

distribution of apparel establishments in 1980. At one end of the distribution are a small number

of large establishments — the manufacturers: 250 shops, about 2 percent of establishments, with

100 or more workers accounted for 43.0 percent of total apparel employment. At the other end

of the distribution are a large number of small establishments -- the subcontractors 9,233 shops,

about 75 percent of establishments, employed five or fewer workers.5

        Domestic manufacturers were not the only source of assembly subcontracting in the closed

economy. Through maquiladoras, foreign manufacturers also subcontracted assembly activities


      Value added in off-shore apparel exports is off-shore exports less imported inputs.

      VIrtually all maquiladora exports go the United States. Mexico remains a suall player in the U.S. market.
In 1987. only 23 percent of US. imports of apparel and finished textile products (SIC 23) came fromMexico.
    ' Establishments without paid labor include the self-employed and shops that hire only family labor.
                                                       13
to Mexican firms. Despite the similarities in domestic and off-shore subcontracting, the two

industries remain entirely separate. Apparel mauiladoras have virtualiy no linkages with

domestic industry. Foreign firms provide all inputs, including fabric, and the maquiladoras, as

the law stipulates, export virtually all of their output.'

C. The Geography of Pmductlon and Wages in the Closed Economy

        Figure 2 shows the location of apparel and overall manufacturing employment in Mexico

from 1970 to 1988 (Censo Industrial, various years). In 1970, 55.4 percent of national apparel

employment was located in the Federal District, the federal entity which contains Mexico City.

In the 1970's manufacturers began to leave the capital; the share of apparel employment located

in the Federal District declined to 33.2 percent in 1985. During the same period, the share of

apparel jobs located in central states, which neighbor the capital, increased from 13.5 percent to




      Between 1981 and 1988, domestic inputs accounted for an average of 0.25 percent of inputs consumed by
apparel maquiIadora on the Mexico-U.S. border (INEGI, 1989a).

                                                    14
24.3 percent, and the share in north-central states increased from 12.5 percent to 21.6 percent.7

Interview material suggest the activities that left the capital were those related to assembly, and

that design, finishing, and marketing remained concentrated in Mexico City;' in 1980, 69.8

percent of wholesale trade in apparel and textiles was still conducted in the Federal District

        The relocation of apparel production followed the emergence of wage differentials

between Mexico City and outlying states. Figure 3 shows the ratio of average nominal regional

wages to average nominal national wages in apparel and all manufacturing from 1970 to 1988

(Censo Industrial, various years).' In 1970, average apparel wages in the Federal District ranged

from 1.11 times those in central states to 2.97 times those in southern states. Apparel jobs did

not move to regions with the lowest relative wages, but to regions nearest the capital.



D. Industrial Organization and Trade Liberalization

        Since the opening to trade in 1985, there has been a substantial relocation of Mexican

apparel production. Figure 2 shows that between 1980 and 1988 the share of apparel
employment in border states increased from 15.0 percent to 21.8 percent, while the share of

apparel employment in the Federal District and Central states declined. There has also been a

shift from domestic production towards off-shore apparel assembly. Table 2 shows total



       Central states adjoin the Federal District (Hidalgo. Mexico, Morelos, Puebla, Thxcala. Veracrnz); North-
Central states are non-border gate, north of the capital (Aguascalientes. Baja California Sur, Durango.
Guanajuato. Jalisco, Nayarft, Quer&ero. San Lals Potosf, Sinalos, Zacatecas); border states idjoin theU.S. (Baja
California. Coahuila, Chihuahua. Nuevo Lcdn, Sonora. Tamaulipas); and South states are those ruth of the
capital (Campeche, Colinia, Chiapas, Guerrero. Mlchoaodn.. Oaxaca. Quintana Roo. Tabasco. Yucathi).

     Five of the six apparel-producing regions I visited were founded by manufacturers who had relocated their
assembly operations from Mexico City.

employment in apparel, employment in off-shore apparel assembly (assembly for foreign firms),

and a breakdown of off-shore assembly between border and interior states. Between 1981 and

1988, the share of national apparel employment in off-shore assembly increased from 12.9 percent

to 20.0 percent Most job growth in off-shore assembly has taken place in interior Mexico, as

firms that used to produce for the domestic market have shifted to assembly for foreign firms.

       Figure 4 shows quarterly employment indices for domestic apparel production, off-shore

apparel assembly, and all manufacturing (Bank of Mexico, unpublished data). Between 1987 and

1990, employment in the domestic apparel industry (firms that are not maquiladoras) increased

by only 0.16 percent, while employment in off-shore apparel assembly increased by 39.5 percent

Figure 1 shows off-shore assembly exports have boomed since liberalization, increasing from USS

300.0 million in 1987 to USS 496.3 million in 1989. By contrast, domestic apparel exports rose

from USS 52.7 million in 1987 to USS 683 million in 1989.

                                                16
        Some observers attribute the tremendous export success of off-shore apparel assembly

relative to the domestic apparel industry to trade barriers in the United States. Before NAFTA,

the United States maintained quotas on Mexican apparel exports under the Multi-Fiber

Arrangement. Mexico-U.S. trade agreements did give maquiladora exports first access to quotas,

but quotas were binding in only a few product categories. Between 1988 and 1990, average

quota utilization rates were over 60 percent in four product categories out of 61: overalls

(112.9%). pants (102.1%). pajamas (88.6%), and shirts and blouses (80.9%).b0

        NAFTA will further integrate Mexico into the U.S. economy by eliminating apparel

quotas in the U.S. and tariffs on both sides of the border. Adjustment to trade liberalization

provides a preview of the changes to come. For Mexico, NAFTA implies the continued

conversion to apparel assembly and the continued relocation of production activities to the north.

The further reduction of trade barriers is only likely to reinforce the emerging structure of

production and bilateral trade flows, holding constant changes in other industries.



IV. Empirical Results

        The model predicts that under the closed economy regional wages are decreasing in

transport costs to the industry center in Mexico City. Full estimation of the model is complicated

by interactions between apparel and other activities and by the role of agriculture in labor supply.

I estimate the regional wage structure as given by equation (19), which in general form is

        W/W =

where w. is the apparel wage in region i, w is the apparel wage in the industry center, and S, is


    °  The pre-NAPTA bilateral trade agreement allowed Mexico to obtain quota increases for most goods on
request (Convenlo Bilojeroj Mexico-Estados Unidos 1988).

                                                    17
unit transport costs between region I and the industry center. In the open economy, this structure

breaks down and regional relative wages are instead determined by access to foreign markets.

I assume transport costs are an increasing function of distance, d. The regression equation is

         log(w,/w,) =           + 13,,log(dj +

where t specifies the year and ja is an error term whose structure I discuss below. Let T be the

unanticipated date of trade liberalization. Theory predicts

         for     :<T,
                                  ft=o
The existence of free-trade zones along the Mexico-U.S. border in effect liberalized trade for the

border before the rest of the country. This provides an additional testable hypothesis: given the

access of border apparel producers to foreign industry centers, border apparel wages should be

unrelated to distance from Mexico City. I test this hypothesis by allowing distance effects for

border states to differ from those for interior states that is, I expect j3, = 0 for border states.

         Table 3 lists variable means and standard deviations. Wages are constructed from the

Mexico Industrial Census. Mexico contains 32 states, including the Federal District The wage

variable I use, w, is average aimual remuneration per employee in the apparel industry of state

i in year r." A variety of factors generate regional wage differentials. To isolate regional wage

differentials that are specific to the apparel industry, I divide wdw,. by the ratio of the average

manufacturing wage in state Ito the national average manufacturing wage.'2 Complete state data

are available for five years, 1970, 1975, 1980, 1985, and 1988, providing 155 observations (5


        I divide w by the average national apparel wage, w, rather than by the Mexico City wage, to omit
variation in the capital wage that is unrelated to the apparel industry.

years x 31 states — omitting the Federal District), of which four sets (1970-1985) correspond to

the closed economy and one set (1988) corresponds to the open economy. To compensate for

variation in transportation infrastructure across states, I measure distance as average hours

required to travel by first-class passenger bus between the capital of state i and Mexico City.'3



A. Econometric Issues

        I have observations on relative apparel wages across states and across time. To control

for idiosyncratic components in the error tenn, I assume j.t has the following form:

        lt =     + + 'Tlk

where ü, is the effect for state i, u, is the effect for year:, and TL is an ii.d. random variable with

mean zero and variance c?. If state and year effects are random, I can use OLS for estimation.

Dwivedi and Srivastava (1978) show that in panel regression if the independent variables do not

vary across groups of observations OLS is identical to GLS. In my case, the distance variables

do not vary across time. This means in a regression of relative wages on log distance the OLS

estimates of the f3's are efficient even if the s are correlated across states or years.

        If state and year effects are fixed instead of random the solution is not so simple. First-

differencing the data eliminates the distance variable; using state dummy variables to control for

fixed state effects introduces perfect rnulticollinearity. I first estimate the regression with and

without year dummies. The distance variable, in addition to capturing transport costs, will pick

up any other state effects that are correlated with distance to Mexico City. To determine what

portion of fixed state effects are related to distance, I perform a second regression in which I

                                                    19
replace distance with state dummies. The estimated state effects represent the mean effect of

state characteristics on relative wages, controlling for the year. There are surely state
characteristics besides distance that matter for wages,              replacing distance with state dummies

will likely increase the explanatory power of the regression. To determine how much, I regress

the estimated state dummies on distance. The variance in the estimated state effects that distance

explains indicates the relative importance of distance among other state characteristics.



B. Results
        Table 4 gives estimation results on regional relative apparel wages for 155 observations

from 1970, 1975, 1980, 1985, and 1988. The (a) columns include year dummies; the (b) columns

do not. I interact log distance with 3RD, a dummy variable that takes a value of one if the state

is a border state and with yr88, a dummy variable that takes a value of one if the year is 1988.

        The results show strong support for the hypothesis that regional relative apparel wages

decrease with distance from Mexico City. In all regressions log distance to Mexico City, log(dj,

is negative and significant at the .01 level. Moreover, the quantitative effect of distance is large.

From.the results in column (3b), a one standard deviation increase in log distance (0.966) reduces

log state relative apparel wages by 0339, which is nearly half a standard deviation (0.722). 1 do

not find, however, that trade liberalization eliminates the distance effect. In two of four

regressions, I reject the null hypothesis that log(d) is zero in 1988 at the .01 level.'4

        There is other evidence trade matters for wages. In all regressions I fail to reject the null



       This hypothesis is equivalent to the hypothesis that the sum of the coefficients on log(dJ and
log(dJyr88 is zero, which is the version I test. A weaker test is that the distance effect falls in 1988. In all
regressions I fail to reject the hypothesis that the coefficient on log(dJ is constant across years at the .05 level.

                                                         20
hypothesis that tog(d) is zero for border states at the .05 leve1. This is consistent with the

hypothesis that border producers' access to foreign markets reduced the importance of distance

from the domestic industry center in Mexico City. It may not seem surprising that wages on the

Mexico-U.S. border are high relative to other regions. Recall, however, that my measure of

relative wages controls for regional wage differentials at the state manufacturing level. Even

controlling for overall wage differentials, then, apparel wages along the border are relatively high.

       Table 5 shows results from regressing log relative wages on state and year dummies.

Estimated state effects for four of the six border states are positive; three are significant at the

.05 level. The only other positive state effect is that for the state of Mexico, which borders

Mexico City. This is cOnsistent with the findings from Table 4, that relative wages are high

along the border. Comparing Table 5 with column (3b) in Table 4 shows that replacing distance

variables with state dummies increases the adjusted R2 from 349 to .793. Distance appears to

account for about two-fifths of the explained variance in regional relative apparel wages that is

attributable to state characteristics. To verify this is the case, I regress the estimated state effects

on the distance variables, again controlling for border states. The resulting regression is

where standard errors are in parentheses and of' is the estimated state effect for state 1. Distance

accounts for 41.4 percent of the variance in regional relative wages that is attributable to state

characteristics. While other state-specific factors affect regional relative wages, distance is a

relatively important among these characteristics. To ensure border states are not driving the

                 (.21.38)   (.1.299)


where nb indicates   non-border states. The coefficient estimates       are consistent with those   above,

but the explained variance    is   lower.


        I proceed to check the robustness of the results    in Table   4. It is likely that improvements


in roads, bridges, and    transport equipment substantially reduced travel time between 1970 and

1988.   This   would   affect the coefficient   estimates   if improvements in transportation        were

correlated with distance    from Mexico City. To control for changes in the relationship between


distance and transport costs, I allow distance effects to vary over time. Table 6 shows results

where I interact log distance with dummy variables for border states and for year. The base

category is interior states in 1970. I find no evidence that distance effects vary over time. In

all regressions I fail to reject the hypothesis that the distance variables interacted with year

dummies are different from zero at the .05 level. Another possibility is that the distance effects

are driven by the inclusion of border states in the regression. To verify this is not the case, I

drop border states from the regression. Table 7 reports the results. Without border states, log

distance from Mexico City remains negative and significant at the .01 level in all regressions.

        The strength of the results is that even controlling for overall manufacturing wage

differentials relative apparel wages are lower for states that are distant from the capital. While

the results on border states are consistent with the hypothesis that trade liberalization has altered

the closed-economy apparel wage structure, this does not imply that the open-economy wage

structure will exhibit less disparity. Border states currently have relatively high wages and the

continuing   relocation of apparel jobs to the north — which is only likely to continue under

                                                   22
NAFTA -- suggests that regional wage differentials will also be a feature of the open economy.



V. Concluding Remarks

       This paper develops a model of regional subcontracting based on location-specific external

economies. Localization economies arise endogenously from the provision of specialized inputs.

Congestion costs due to agglomeration push low-skill activities into outlying regions. I apply the

model to a study of the effects of trade liberalization on the Mexican apparel industry.
Consistent with the model, apparel production in the closed economy was geographically

concentrated. With the opening of the economy, the domestic apparel industry is converting to

product assembly for foreign clients. Concurrently, producers are relocating their activities to the

Mexico-U.S. border region. Estimation results on regional apparel wages are consistent with the

existence of localization economies.

       For a developing economy, trade liberalization involves a transition from vertically-

integrated manufacturing to a specialized role of subcontracting for developed-country firms. In

apparel, and other labor-intensive industries, this transition implies the conversion to off-shore

assembly and possibly profound changes in the spatial location of production. Sectoral-level

analyses miss these changes by focusing on resource movements across industries while ignoring

the organizational and locational changes that occur within industries. This has been the case in

most if not all of the economy-wide models developed to study NAFTA (e.g., USITC 1992). The

effects of NAFTA on the pattern of regional specialization in Mexico are likely to be at least as

profound as those on the pattern of industrial specialization.

Suppose now labor is mobile between countries. Since my focus is the long-run trade
equilibrium, I ignore migration costs and assume labor mobility is perfect. Home labor in
Foreign, then, earns the same wage as Foreign labor. Let L' be the number of workers that
migrate from Home to Foreign. In addition to the profit-maximization conditions in (30)-(33),
we have the condition that real wages are equalized between Home and Foreign. Following (22)

wIw = iIy. Following (24), real-wage equalization in Home and Foreign implies PJP, =

decentralization; in the trading equilibrium, we again have the formation of a regional production
network, with the industry center in the large country and input production in the small country.
