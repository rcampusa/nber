                                            ABSTRACT

We show that political booms, measured by the rise in governments' popularity, predict financial crises
above and beyond other better-known early warning indicators, such as credit booms. This predictive
power, however, only holds in emerging economies. We show that governments in emerging economies
are more concerned about their reputation and tend to ride the short-term popularity benefits of weak
credit booms rather than implementing politically costly corrective policies that would help prevent
potential crises. We provide evidence of the relevance of this reputation mechanism.

                                               1. I NTRODUCTION

      A consistent predictor of financial crises, both in advanced and emerging economies, is
    the magnitude of the preceding credit boom. Schularick and Taylor (2012) show that "credit
    growth is a powerful predictor of financial crises, suggesting that such crises are credit booms
    gone wrong and that policymakers ignore credit at their peril" while Mendoza and Terrones
    (2012) conclude that "not all credit booms end in financial crises, but most emerging markets
    crises were associated with credit booms".1
      These findings pose a challenge for the explanation of financial crises. Why do policy-
    makers not take more steps to reduce excessive leverage and control credit growth during
    a boom? Why are corrective policies often enacted too late, or only after a crisis? While in
    some cases early warning signals might have been mixed, in many other cases warning signs
    seemed paramount and apparent if not to the less informed general public at least to the
    more informed policymakers. In many circumstances what prevents the implementation of
    corrective actions seems to be more lack of political will than lack of information.
      We show that political economy factors indeed help explain the recurring phenomenon of
    credit booms gone bust.2 We use data on government popularity and financial crises (banking
    crises and sudden stops) for more than 60 countries since 1984 and document that increases in
    the government’s popularity, "political booms" henceforth, constitute a powerful predictor of
    crises above and beyond credit booms. Indeed, changes in government popularity are quan-
    titatively as important predictors of crises as well-established early warning indicators such
    as credit growth or capital inflows. There is an interesting caveat to this finding, however.
    "Political booms gone bust" are an emerging market phenomenon only: government popu-
    larity booms precede crises only in developing economies, not in advanced ones. This result

  Schularick and Taylor (2012) construct a historical database with 14 developed countries from 1870 to 2008,
  while Mendoza and Terrones (2012) focus on credit booms for a broader set of countries after 1980 and study
  their link with macroeconomic variables. For other efforts to uncover these relations see Gourinchas et al. (2001),
  Claessens et al. (2011) and Gourinchas and Obstfeld (2012).
2
  Even though some recent literature models the link between booms and busts (see e.g. Mendoza and Bianchi
  (2012) and Gorton and Ordoñez (2014a and 2014b)), not many papers have considered the potentially critical
  role of political economy factors to explain this link.
                                       POLITICAL BOOMS, FINANCIAL CRISES                                         3

    is not only statistically, but also economically significant: one standard deviation increase in
    popularity in emerging markets roughly duplicates the probability of a banking crisis.
      To rationalize this finding, we develop a model of reputation-concerned governments. The
    model tries to capture that it may be politically costly to control a boom with regulation even
    when regulating is the correct course of action because the boom is likely otherwise to end in
    a crash. Different governments may have different capabilities to implement sound economic
    policies, with more capable governments more likely to promote sustainable economic and
    credit growth. Regulation is politically costly as it reveals to the public that the economic
    boom they are experiencing, and for which the government is taking credit for, is in fact not
    sound and cannot be sustained.3 Given their superior knowledge about implemented policies
    and macroeconomic fundamentals, governments are generally in a better position than the
    public to judge the state of the economy and the need for corrective measures.
      More specifically, governments often face the decision to implement or not corrective poli-
    cies to prevent a potential crash, such as policies that inhibit excessive credit. When pre-
    sented with this decision, governments face a trade-off: by not correcting ("riding" hereafter)
    a non-sustainable economic boom, they benefit from the popularity gains during the boom,
    but bear the cost of facing a higher risk that the boom, being unsustainable, ends in a crash.
    Then governments with high reputation concerns delay, and even avoid, the implementation
    of corrective policies since this trade-off is more often resolved in favor of riding the boom.
    So when do governments have high reputation/popularity concerns? If governments have
    low initial levels of popularity then they have more margin to improve it, moreover, if there is
    high uncertainty about their quality to begin with then riding a boom also has more potential to
    change public opinion. Indeed, higher uncertainty and lower popularity of the political class
    seem to be typical characteristics of young democracies rather than of established ones.


3
    Gorton and Ordoñez (2014b) propose an approach to classify credit booms into "good booms" and "bad booms".
    They show that good booms are characterized by a sustained increase in the growth of total factor productivity
    and are less likely to end in crises, while bad booms are characterized by an initial increase in productivity,
    which is not sustained over time and tend to end in crises more likely.
                                POLITICAL BOOMS, FINANCIAL CRISES                               4

  Consistent with the model, we provide evidence that in emerging markets governments
have a lower average popularity than in advanced economies and that there is more uncer-
tainty about their type (captured by a larger volatility in popularity over time). We argue that
these distinguishing features can explain why political booms are predictors of crises only
in emerging countries. We show that, even among emerging markets, low initial levels and
high uncertainty of government popularity help to predict crises later on. This indicates that
political booms gone bust may not be only the result of weaker institutions in emerging mar-
kets, but also of larger reputation concerns of policymakers in those countries. Moreover, the
data suggest that a lack of regulation is the link connecting changes in popularity and the
likelihood of crises. Reputation is negatively correlated with regulation in emerging markets,
but not in advanced economies (that is, popularity in emerging markets declines when there
is regulation) and we also find that crises are typically preceded by regulatory loosening or
regulatory inaction, in particular in emerging markets.
  These results open important questions about policy. In contrast to the common view that
governments’ concerns about their popularity and reputation have positive effects on policy-
making and economic outcomes, our paper argues that these concerns may also have negative
effects, increasing the likelihood of financial crises.
  By establishing that political booms and popularity are important predictors of financial
crises we complement other explanations highlighted, for instance, by Schularick and Taylor
(2009) and Mendoza and Terrones (2012) who focus on domestic credit booms, or Calvo et al.
(2004), Reinhart and Reinhart (2008), and Forbes and Warncock (2012) who focus on external
credit booms, such as bonanzas of international capital flows. Moreover, our results for a
large panel of countries and crises are in line with recent case studies, in particular the paper
on "political credit cycles" in the run-up to the Eurozone crisis by Fernandez-Villaverde et
al. (2013), or the book on "Political Bubbles" by McCarthy et al. (2013), which shows how
political dynamics in the US contributed to the build-up of the housing and credit bubble that
led to the 2008 financial crisis.

  Even though the paper focuses on financial crises, which allows testing the model in a
straightforward way, the environment is broad enough to apply it to many other policy set-
tings beyond credit management and financial regulation. With a change in details and with
different data, the framework could be applied to understanding how political considera-
tions affect fiscal policy, monetary policy, regulation and the macroeconomy (e.g. Drazen
2000, Chang 2001, and more recently Aguiar and Amador 2011, Azzimonti 2011, and Ales et
al. 2012).
  Among the few political economy papers on financial crises is Chang (2007) who shows
how political crises and financial crises tend to be correlated. This is also true in our model:
since a crisis is a signal that arises more likely from a bad government, there is a drop in pop-
ularity upon its occurrence, a political crisis. Our model, however, focuses on the evolution of
popularity previous to a crisis and its predictive power, rather than focusing on the reaction
of political variables after crises. Empirically, we propose a new proxy of political popularity
across countries, instead of focusing on election events only. Using election data, a previous
paper by Brender and Drazen (2008) shows that economic booms are accompanied by rising
government popularity in emerging markets, but not in advanced economies. Our more con-
tinuous measure of popularity allows us to explore the evolution right before crises, which is
not feasible using elections data, unless elections coincide with financial crises.
  Our paper also relates to the literature on reputation concerns developed by Fudenberg
and Levine (1989) and Mailath and Samuelson (2001 and 2006), in which agents privately
know their own type and may modify their actions to modify the inference of other agents
about such a type. We implement a similar setting for governments that use their regulation
and intervention policies to steer the inference of voters about their quality, even when that
implies exposing the economy to a crisis.
  The rest of the paper is structured as follows. We start by showing evidence that govern-
ment popularity and political booms constitute important predictors of financial crises. Then
we develop a reputation model that delivers these findings and provide evidence about the
empirical relevance of the reputation mechanism we propose. We finally conclude.

                      2. P OLITICAL B OOMS P REDICT F INANCIAL C RISES

  This section shows that, together with credit booms, political booms are important predic-
tors of financial crises. We first discuss the data and present a new set of stylized facts on the
evolution of government popularity before financial crises – popularity increases in the run-
up to crises in emerging economies but remains unchanged in advanced economies. Then,
we show regression results indicating that, on top of credit booms, “political booms” are a
good predictor of financial crises in emerging economies.


2.1. Data.

2.1.1. Political Booms: We define political booms as an increase in government popularity,
measured as year on year changes, which is analogous to the measurement of credit booms in
earlier literature (e.g. Schularick and Taylor, 2012). As a proxy for government popularity, we
draw on the "International Country Risk Guide" (ICRG) database of the Political Risk Service
Group, which covers more than 100 countries as far back as 1984. Specifically, we focus on the
ICRG sub-indicator of “government stability”, which measures “the government’s ability to
carry out its declared program(s), and its ability to stay in office” (see PRS 2004). The indicator
ranges from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 12 and it is itself composed of three subcom-
ponents, namely (i) government unity, (ii) legislative strength and (iii) popular support. The
measure can thus be interpreted as a measure capturing shifts in the public opinion as well as
other factors affecting the strength of a government.
  The main advantage of using the ICRG data is that it allows us to overcome the lack of
cross-country information on government popularity, which is a well-known problem in the
political science literature. As explained by Duch and Stevenson (2008), government approval
data is excellent for some countries, such as the US or Germany, but scarce in most devel-
oping countries, especially prior to the mid-2000s. No database exists with a satisfactory
cross-country coverage of government support or voting intentions. As a result, much of
the political economy literature thus far has either used data on election results or approval
                                     POLITICAL BOOMS, FINANCIAL CRISES                                           7

    ratings from individual countries only. Our innovation here is to take advantage of one sub-
    indicator from the well-known ICRG risk database and to use it as a measure for government
    popularity.4
      We find that the ICRG sub-indicator on “government stability” is a useful proxy of govern-
    ment popularity and voting intentions across countries and over time. The variable shows
    a large within-country variation, with notable shifts in just two or three years. The index is
    also closely correlated with actual polling data. To assess this, we collect data on government
    support for four countries for which we could find reliable time series data on government
    approval (Argentina, Brazil, Germany and the US) and compare it to to the monthly ICRG
    measure in each case.5 In the Appendix we show that there is a close co-movement between
    the polling data and our proxy in all four countries (the correlation is 0.86 for the US, 0.53 for
    Germany, 0.76 for Argentina, and 0.56 for Brazil). The government stability indicator tends to
    be less volatile, but it tracks the general trend in government approval reasonably well. We
    are therefore comfortable with using the ICRG "GovStab" indicator as a measure for what we
    aim to capture, namely changes in government popularity surrounding financial crises, and
    use the variable names "government stability" and "popularity" interchangeably.

    2.1.2. Financial Crises. We use several data sources to identify events of financial crisis. In a
    first step, we focus on severe crisis events in advanced and emerging market economies (EMEs)
    since World War II. For this purpose, we draw on the sample of severe crises by Reinhart and
    Rogoff (2009) and Reinhart and Reinhart (2010), which includes the Asian Crisis of 1997 (In-
    donesia, Malaysia, Philippines, South Korea, Thailand, Hong Kong) and other well-known


4
  The ICRG risk data has been used in many previous empirical studies, including Knack and Keefer (1997),
  Acemoglu et al. (2001), Gelos and Wei (2005), Chong and Gradstein (2007), Alfaro et al. (2008) or Kesternich and
  Schnitzer (2010). However, we are not aware of any previous paper that uses this sub-indicator of government
  stability from ICRG data to measure government approval.
5
  For the US, we use the widely cited Gallup survey on presidential approval ratings, for the Bush and Obama
  administration, respectively (share of respondents approving). For Germany, we use the weekly survey on
  likely vote decisions for major political parties conducted by Infratest Dimap, and add the vote share of parties
  currently in government. For Argentina we use the monthly "Trust in Government" survey conducted by Uni-
  versidad Torcuato di Tella, while for Brazil we use the quarterly Index of Government Approval by CNI-Ibope.

emerging market crises (Russia 1998, Argentina 2000/2001 and Turkey 2000/2001). For ad-
vanced economies, we include four of the “big five” (Norway 1987, Finland 1991, Sweden
1991, Japan 1992, but not Spain 1977 due to data availability reasons), as well as the most re-
cent financial crises in the US and Europe (Iceland 2007, Ireland 2007, United Kingdom 2007,
United States 2007, Greece 2008, Portugal 2008 and Spain 2008). This sample of main financial
crises serves as the starting point to analyze data patterns and to distill new stylized facts.
  In a second step, we broaden the sample for a more systematic assessment of crises. First,
we rely on the widely used dataset constructed by Laeven and Valencia (2010), which covers
systemic banking crises worldwide and back to the 1980s. For another look at crisis events we
also use data on systemic sudden stops, as compiled by Calvo et al. (2008) for 108 countries for
the period 1990 to 2004.
  Throughout the analysis, we focus on 22 advanced economies and 40 emerging economies,
a sample which is also used in Mendoza and Terrones (2012). For these 62 countries we
identify 20 severe crises, 57 banking crises and 36 sudden stop episodes since the mid-1980s.
Out of these events, 9 severe crises, 37 banking crises and 30 sudden stops were experienced
by EMEs. We provide a detailed list of countries and crises in the Appendix (Table B.1).


2.2. Stylized facts on popularity surrounding financial crises. This section assesses the rela-
tionship between government stability/popularity and the occurrence of financial crises since
World War II. We find notable data patterns prior to crisis events.
  Figure 1 shows the cumulative percentage change of the government stability index in the
five years prior to the start of a severe crisis. As can be seen, there is a stark difference between
advanced and emerging economies. Government popularity increased substantially prior to
severe crises in emerging economies, including all countries that went through the Asian
crisis, but also prior to the severe crises in Russia and Argentina. On average, the ICRG
measure increased by 53.7% in the five years pre-crisis in emerging economies.
  The opposite holds for crises in advanced economies, but to a lesser extent. On average,
governments saw a decrease in popular support and in their ability to carry out their agenda.
                                    POLITICAL BOOMS, FINANCIAL CRISES                                          9

This is true for crises of the late 1980s and early 1990s, but also for the recent crisis events in
the UK the US and peripheral Europe. On average, the ICRG score declines by 21.5% in the
five years prior to main financial crises in advanced economies.


           F IGURE 1. Cumulative change in government stability (5 years pre-crisis)




 This figure shows the cumulative change in the ICRG government stability index in the 5 years prior to major
financial crises. The sample of crises is taken from Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) and Reinhart and Reinhart (2010).


  The striking change of popularity before severe crises and the difference between emerg-
ing and advanced economies are tracked over time in Figures 2 and 3, where we show the
evolution of the average government stability index, with 0 marking the crisis breakout.
  Figure 2 shows for emerging economies that the score increases roughly from about 6 to
nearly 10 in the five years interval before severe crises. The 3.5 point increase in the index is
statistically significant and corresponds to nearly two standard deviations of the ICRG score.

    F IGURE 3. Advanced economies: Government popularity surrounding severe crises




One can also see that the 90% confidence bands are rather narrow, indicating that the dynam-
ics are similar across EME crisis episodes.
  Figure 3 shows the opposite trend in advanced economies. On average, the government
stability indicator drops by 2 points in the 5-year interval prior to major crises. The change
                               POLITICAL BOOMS, FINANCIAL CRISES                                 11

corresponds roughly to a standard deviation and it is still statistically significant, albeit at a
lower confidence level.
  The evolution of government popularity after the breakout of crises are difficult to interpret
since in many cases governments have changed or adopt very different measures to deal with
crises. This makes the comparison of popularity much less informative.
  In Figures 4 and 5 we show that this pattern on government popularity previous to crises
is confirmed when using the larger sample of banking crises and sudden stop episodes. Gov-
ernment stability increases significantly prior to banking crises and sudden stops in emerging
markets. In contrast, popularity slightly decreases, but not significantly, in the run-up to crises
in advanced economies.
  Summarizing, financial crises are preceded by a strong increase in government support in
emerging economies – we term this phenomenon as “political booms”– while financial crises
in advanced economies are not preceded by a significant change in government popularity (if
anything, it declines).


2.3. Political booms predict financial crises. We next assess the above stylized fact more
systematically. In particular we study whether political booms keep their predictive power
when considering other controls, such as the size of credit booms and other well-documented
drivers of financial crises.
  In the econometric analysis, we closely follow Schularick and Taylor (2012) who exam-
ine the role of credit booms in predicting banking crises in 14 advanced economies back to
the late 19th century. We estimate panel OLS and probit regressions using a binary vari-
able for the start year of banking crises as dependent variable. The key difference of our
approach to that of Schularick and Taylor (2012) is that we focus on “political booms” instead
of “credit booms”. In the baseline equations, we therefore replace their measures of lagged
credit growth and asset growth with our measure on lagged changes in government stabil-
ity. Due to data availability constraints, we focus on a shorter time span – “only” the last

three decades. However, compared to their study, we do broaden the country sample to 62
countries, thereby including emerging economies.
  Our simple forecasting framework uses annual data, and builds on the following two re-
gressions:
  Panel OLS (linear probability):

                   crisisit =    1 (L)P OP U LARIT Yit   +   2 (L)Xit   + ✓i + eit
                                 POLITICAL BOOMS, FINANCIAL CRISES                                  13

  Probit:
                 probit(crisisit ) =   1 (L)P OP U LARIT Yit   +   2 (L)Xit   + ✓i + eit

where crisisit is a binary variable for the start of a crisis in country i in year t, P OP U LARIT Yit
is the continuous ICRG indicator of government stability (year on year change), L is a lag
operator which is greater or equal to one, Xit is a vector of control variables, ✓i are country
fixed effects and eit is an error term. We run this analysis to understand whether the lag
polynomial    1 (L),   the sum of lagged values of our main variable of interest, is statistically
and economically significant.

2.3.1. Banking Crises: Table 1 shows the results using a binary variable for the onset of banking
crises as dependent variable and covering all 60 countries since 1980 (see the Appendix for the
list of countries and banking crises events). In the full sample, we find no clear-cut effect for
the lagged changes in government stability. However, the picture changes once we account
for the type of country. In the subsample of emerging economies, the sum of the lagged
coefficients (“political booms”) is positive and significant at the 5% confidence level, but this
is not the case in advanced economies (columns 2 and 3). Columns 4 and 5 shows our baseline
specification, which includes the full sample and an interaction term for emerging countries.
It is clear again that political booms predict banking crises, but only for emerging countries.
This result is very much in line with the stylized facts shown above.
  Quantitatively, the effects are large. In the OLS regressions, the sum of the interaction term
coefficients of EM Ei ⇤ (L)P OP U LARIT Yit has a value of about 0.04 throughout. This indi-
cates that a one index-point increase in the government popularity (year on year) increases the
probability of a crisis by nearly 4 percentage points. This is large, given that the probability
of a crisis onset in this sample is just 3.7% and that the first difference of the ICRG index has
a standard deviation of 1.15. Put differently, we find that a “political boom”, defined as a one
standard deviation increase in government stability in the past three years, more than doubles
the predicted probability of a banking crisis in emerging markets (from 3.7% to 8.3%, ceteris
paribus). The results are similar in a probit specification (column 5) and when we control for

           The dependent variable is a binary indicator for the onset of banking crises taken from Laeven and Valencia (2010). Our main
           explanatory variable is the change in government stability as measured by the continuous ICRG indicator (ranging from 1 to 12).

common shocks (year fixed effects) and other country-specific factors affecting the probability
of crises. Specifically, we use IMF data from the World Economic Outlook dataset and World
Bank data from the World Development Indicators to account for growth of GDP, growth in
government expenditures (as a fraction of GDP), yearly inflation, changes in reserves (as a

fraction of imports) and the change in a country’s terms of trade. These results are shown in
the Appendix.6
    In column 6 we consider our measures of political booms and credit booms jointly as pre-
dictors of financial crises. Lagged changes in government popularity remains a statistically
and economically significant variable even when including credit growth as a control. This
is also true in the subsample of emerging economies and when using a three year moving
average specification which uses average values from t-3 to t-1, instead of individual yearly
lags (see column 7).
    The relevance of political booms can also be illustrated with a standard diagnostic test for
binary event classification, the Receiver Operating Curve (ROC). Intuitively, the ROC shows
how the estimated model performs as a crisis predictor tool compared to tossing a coin. Per-
formance is defined as the ability to correctly identify positive cases (crisis) and negative cases
(non-crisis) over the sample. The horizontal axis shows the False Positive rate, i.e. the proba-
bility of incorrectly diagnosing a crisis if there is none, against the True Positive rate (vertical
axis) across all possible decision levels. A curve closer to the upper left corner indicates better
model fit, which will also be captured by the area under the curve (AUC). The AUC ranges
between 0.5 and 1, with higher values indicating better prediction performance. For example,
an AUC value of 0.5 means that the model performs no better than tossing a coin (45-degree
line), while a value of 1 indicates perfect classification. The estimated AUC can thus be tested
against the null hypothesis of a 0.5 value (“coin toss”).
    Figure 6 shows the ROC of our main model (Model 1), based on the fixed effects probit
regression of Column 8 in Table 1, and compares it to alternative probit models on the prob-
ability of banking crises: using credit growth only (Model 2), and a full model with both
popularity growth and credit growth (Model 3). The AUC test statistic is similar when com-
paring Model 2 (with lagged credit growth) to Model 1 (with lagged changes in government
stability). The difference between the two models is not statistically significant, but they each

We also find results to hold when we control for changes in executive or years in office of the current government
(using data from the Database of Political Institutions).

outperform the coin toss benchmark significantly (vertical grey line). The best model fit is
achieved when we include both variables, i.e. our proxies for credit growth and for popular-
ity growth. The resulting AUC statistic of Model 3 is a high 0.77 - significantly higher than
the other two models (at the 1% significance level).

  Finally, the results in column 8 of Table 1 indicate that there is an interaction of credit booms
with political booms. More specifically, in EMEs, credit growth appears to be an economically
significant predictor of banking crises only when accompanied by a political boom, i.e. when
government popularity has also increased (or remains stable) in the preceding years. This
can be seen in Figure 7 which is based on column 8 of Table 1 and which plots the estimated
coefficient of real domestic credit growth as 3-year moving average to GDP (on the vertical
axis) conditional on the 3-year moving average change in the government stability index (on
the horizontal axis), using averages of years t-3 to t-1. The dotted line shows 90 percent
confidence bands. Intuitively, credit growth is only significant if the lower confidence band
is above the zero horizontal red line, i.e. only in case the 3-year moving average change
in government stability is 0 or higher. For example, the credit variable shows a coefficient

of 0.0025 at a horizontal index value of 0 (no change in government popularity). With no
change in popularity, an increase in credit growth by one standard deviation (4.8 percentage
points) is associated with a 1.2 percentage point higher crisis probability (the calculation is
0.0025*4.8=0.012). However, when popularity increases from 0 to 1 on the horizontal axis,
the coefficient for credit growth doubles in size to 0.005. A one standard deviation increase
in credit growth then translates into a 2.4 percentage point higher probability of a banking
crisis (the calculation is 0.005*4.8=0.024). In sum, the graph suggests that the impact of credit
growth is much larger in the presence of a political boom.

2.3.2. Sudden Stops: Finally, we also test the relevance of political factors in predicting sys-
temic sudden stops. We follow the exact same procedure as above, but replace the dependent
variable with the sudden stop measure compiled by Calvo et al. (2008) for 36 countries be-
tween 1990 and 2004, which are listed in the Appendix. Table 2 shows the results, which con-
firm that government stability is a statistically significant predictor of crises. Quantitatively,
the effects are again large. In the main model (column 4), the sum of the three interaction term
coefficients of EM Ei ⇤ (L)P OP U LARIT Yit has a value of 0.067 and is highly significant. A

one point increase in the ICRG index (less than one standard deviation) can thus be associated
with a 6.7 percentage point higher probability of observing a sudden stop later on.

              The dependent variable is a binary indicator for the onset of systemic sudden stops taken from Calvo et al. (2008). Our main

              12). All regressions include country fixed effects and robust standard errors clustered on country. Significance levels denoted

effects, see Appendix). The results are also robust when including year effects and when con-
trolling for important macroeconomic confounders, in particular GDP growth and changes in
reserves to GDP or in the country’s terms of trade. The table with robustness checks is again
shown in the Appendix. Overall these results confirm our previous finding and indicate that
political factors are critical determinants of financial crises in emerging markets.

3.1. Intuition. Before going into the specifics, we briefly describe the core mechanism at work
in the model. There are two types of governments. Good governments are more likely to
generate good booms. These are improvements in the economy, such as more business oppor-
tunities, productivity growth and less market frictions, that lead to increases in the need for
credit to take advantage of those opportunities. Since good credit booms are self sustained by
fundamentals they are less likely to end up in crises. However, the economy can also gener-
ate bad booms, which are fueled by bubbles and speculation and should be regulated as they
are likely to lead to financial crises. Good and bad governments observe the nature of the
boom, while the public cannot observe it directly. Also, governments are concerned by their
reputation/popularity, i.e., the publicly-assessed probability of being a good government. If
governments are perceived to be good, for example, they may be more likely to be reelected
or to remain in power.
  Hence, whenever governments observe a bad boom, they know regulation is the right
course of action, but also know that by regulating they reveal the boom is bad, which lowers
their popularity, i.e. the public’s belief they are a good government. This popularity concern
introduces a "popularity first, versus country first" type of trade-off: if popularity concerns are
strong, governments are less likely to implement policies that eliminate bad booms and pre-
vent crises. Reputation concerns then generate a positive correlation between credit booms
and political booms and at the same time a positive correlation between these booms and
subsequent financial crises. Popularity/reputation concerns are strong, among other things,

when there are larger margins to improve it, e.g. when popularity is low or when the type of
the government is uncertain.


3.2. Environment. The economy is composed by households (or voters) and a government.
The government experiences a boom that induces economic benefits ⇧ for households, but
which may generate economic costs X if the boom ends up in a crisis, with X > ⇧. The boom
can be good g or bad b. A good boom is self-sustained by an increase in productivity, and
ends in crisis with an exogenous chance ⌘. A bad boom is self-sustained by speculation and
if not regulated is subject to a collapse, ending in crisis with probability ⌘b = q + ⌘(1          q) > ⌘.
Regulation reduces the gains of any credit boom by " > 0 but only has an effect when the
boom is bad, reducing the probability that a bad boom ends in a crisis from ⌘b to ⌘, but not
changing the probability ⌘ that a good boom ends in a crisis.
    Governments observe the type of boom, but households do not.7 We assume it is optimal
for the government to regulate a bad boom (that is, " < (b
                                                         ⌘            ⌘)X)8, namely to take corrective
measures that discourage speculation and reduce the chance of a crisis from ⌘b to ⌘ at a cost of
loosing boom benefits by ". A good boom can in principle also be regulated away but that is
suboptimal (since " > 0) because regulation does not reduce the fundamental likelihood of a
crisis but still induces a reduction in the boom benefit by ".
    Given the relation between the type of boom and the optimal policy, we denote regulation
as b̂ (the optimal policy for booms b) and we denote no-regulation, namely riding / accom-
modating the boom, as ĝ (the optimal policy for booms g).
    There are two types of politicians in charge of governments: Good G and Bad B. The politi-
cian in charge of the government knows its own type, which is persistent. Good governments
are more likely to generate a good boom than bad governments, this is

                                    pG ⌘ Pr(g|G) > pB ⌘ Pr(g|B).
7
 This extreme assumption can be relaxed with households having some information about the boom type, but
 not perfect information. This assumption just maps into the inference problem about the government’s type.
8
 The net social gains from not regulating a bad boom is ⇧ ⌘bX and from regulating a bad boom is ⇧ " ⌘X.
                                       POLITICAL BOOMS, FINANCIAL CRISES                                                        21

     We assume that good governments (G) always act optimally (i.e. always eliminate a bad
 boom), which allows us to focus on describing just the behavior of bad governments (B), the
 only strategic agent.9
     A government’s payoff depends on two factors: its reputation level                                       (office motivation)
 and a policy reward parameter ⇢ (policy motivation). The reputation level                                     is the probability
 that households assign to the government being good                            ⌘Pr(G) and the government’s payoff
 is increasing in this reputation.10 The reward parameter ⇢ measures the size of the policy
 motivation relative to the office motivation. The government enjoys the payoff ⇢ when acting
 consistently with the state of the world, and enacting the “right policy" namely by regulating
 if the boom is bad and not regulating if the boom is good.
     The payoff for the government does not depend directly on the current reputation but
 on the updated reputation, which is a function both of the current reputation                                       and on the
 regulation decision by the government (ĝ or b̂). A bad government facing a good boom g
 chooses whether to regulate (b̂) or not (ĝ), i.e. the chance of regulating (not regulating)                              B (b̂|g)

 (   B (ĝ|g)),   to maximize its expected payoffs,
                                             n                                                        o
                           u(g) = max             B (ĝ|g)[⇢   + E( ĝ |g)] +    B (b̂|g)E( b̂ |g))       .
                                   B (.|g)


 Likewise, bad governments’ expected payoffs after a bad boom, b are
                                              n                                                   o
                            u(b) = max            B (ĝ|b)E( ĝ |b)   +   B (b̂|b)[⇢   + E( b̂ |b)] .
                                    B (.|b)




9
  For expositional reasons we assume good governments always regulate optimally. Allowing good governments
  to decide whether or not to regulate creates multiple equilibria. However, as discussed in Fudenberg and Levine
  (1998), to take the optimal action is an evolutionary stable strategy for good governments. We could also jus-
  tify this assumption imposing that good governments face larger costs from crises, or that they have a smaller
  discount factor, in which case, even if they decide optimally, they will be more likely to regulate bad booms
  compared to bad governments.
10
  We do not model elections in this simple setup. We just interpret the incumbent government’s payoffs as the
  reelection chance in a model in which the incumbent faces an opponent with random reputation in the last
  period, which is drawn from a distribution with expected probability 0 that the opponent is good.

3.3. Timing. The timing of the stage game is the following: Nature draws the government
type {B, G}. The government experiences a boom and nature draws the type of boom {b, g},
which is a function of the government’s type. After learning the type of boom the bad gov-
ernment decides whether to regulate or not {b̂, ĝ}. Finally, households observe the regulation
and subsequently a crisis or no crisis {C, N C}, and update their beliefs about the government
type. Finally, the government receives its payoff.
  In sum, the variables are: states as s 2 {b, g}, regulation actions r 2 {b̂, ĝ}, and crisis realiza-
tion cr 2 {C, N C}. Strategies are given by                         B (r|s)    and may end up in a crisis or not, so given
an initial reputation            the government’s payoffs are

(1)     u(   B (.|g))   =    B (ĝ|g)[⇢    + [⌘     ĝ,C   + (1       ⌘)   ĝ,N C ]]   +    B (b̂|g)[⌘ b̂,C     + (1           ⌘)     b̂,N C ],



(2)     u(   B (.|b))   =    B (ĝ|b)[b
                                      ⌘ ĝ,C       + (1       ⌘b)   ĝ,N C ]   +   B (b̂|b)[⇢     + [⌘   b̂,C   + (1           ⌘)    b̂,N C ]].




3.4. Definition of Equilibrium. Now, we can define the equilibrium in the stage game.
  A Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium in a one-period model consists of regulation strategies for
the bad government               B   = {   B (.|g),        B (.|b)}   and updated government reputation                                       r,cr   such
that:
  i) The bad government maximizes utility


                                           0                                                0                              0
                   u(    B |g)       u(    B |g)       and            u(   B |b)       u(   B |b)          for all         B.

  ii) Bayes rule is used to update the government’s reputation, where                                                  r,cr         is the updated
probability the government is good conditional on observing regulation r = {b̂, ĝ} and crisis
variable {C, N C}.

state is s.

3.5. Characterization of Equilibria. To start characterizing the equilibrium, we first describe
the net gains for bad governments from riding a boom, which are the gains from not regulating
a bad boom.
  The net gains from enacting the "right policy" given the observed state is given by the
difference between the expected gains from enacting the "right policy" versus the expected
gains from enacting the "wrong policy".
  From equation (1), the net expected profits from taking the right policy and not regulating
a good boom (this is        B (ĝ|g)   = 1) are

(9)                                         u (g) = ⇢ + [E( ĝ |g)                      b̂ ].
                                         POLITICAL BOOMS, FINANCIAL CRISES                                                  24

  From equation (2), the net expected profits from taking the right policy and regulating a
bad boom (this is         B (b̂|b)   = 1) are

(10)                                              u (b) = ⇢ + [   b̂   E( ĝ |b)].

Lemma 1. In any equilibrium, bad governments never regulate a good boom, this is                          B (ĝ|g)   = 1.

  The proof that E( ĝ |g) >              b̂   always, which implies that            B (ĝ|g)   = 1 from equation (9) is
in the Appendix. Intuitively, when booms are good there are two sources of gains from not
regulating the economy. First, trivially, the government obtains a utility ⇢ from just enacting
the right policy. Second, when there is no regulation the population believes it is more likely
the government is good because good booms are more likely under good governments. If, in
contrast to the lemma, bad governments were better off by regulating a good boom, then they
would always prefer to regulate a bad boom. However, this would imply bad governments
would always regulate and then no regulation would immediately signal a good government,
inducing a deviation to no regulation.
  Since      B (ĝ|g)   = 1, in what follows we denote simply as                     the probability    B (ĝ|b)   of distor-
tion, i.e. the probability of riding bad booms without regulation. In other words, the strategy
of riding bad booms            :=     B (ĝ|b)   is effectively the only strategic choice variable.
  Define Z( , ) as the net reputational gain from riding a bad boom, which depends on the
reputation       and on the equilibrium strategy , that is

                                               Z( , ) := E( ĝ |b) ( )       b̂   ( ).

From equation (10) it is clear that bad governments would ride a bad boom when

                                                         Z( , ) > ⇢.

Lemma 2. Z has the following properties:
       (i) For   2 {0, 1}
                                               Z( , 0) = Z( , 1) = 0 for all .

   (ii) For   2 [0, 1] , Z( , ) is strictly decreasing in , with

                                        Z(0, ) > 0, Z(1, ) < 0.

  The proof is in the Appendix. The function Z decreasing in                                     means that the net benefits
of riding a bad boom shrink when it gets more likely that bad governments ride bad booms.
The intuition for that is a compensation effect: when bad governments never ride bad booms,
then it is a good signal for the population to observe no regulation, since this is the same as
observing good booms, which are more likely to be experienced by good governments. When
bad governments ride bad booms more frequently, not observing regulation is no longer a
precise signal of the credit boom being good and sustainable.
  More specifically, reputation tends to increase when the population does not observe any
regulation and to decrease in the presence of regulation. However, when the population be-
lieves bad governments regulate infrequently and sometimes ride bad booms, then reputation
does not increase much in the absence of regulation and does not decrease that much in the
presence of regulation.
  Lemma 2 is illustrated in Figure 8, which shows the properties of Z( , ). Just from an
inspection of the figure, it is clear that an equilibrium exists and is unique. We describe the
equilibrium in the next proposition.

The equilibrium   ⇤
                      is decreasing in ⇢ and is such that

ernment’s type is very uncertain there is more room for governments to change the perception

higher the reputational losses from regulating and following the optimal policy, hence the
higher the incentives for distortion.

3.6. Mapping the model to the data. In this section we show that this model is consistent
with the findings in the empirical section. First, we show that the model implies that political
booms predict financial crises when reputation concerns are large. Then, we discuss why
emerging markets are more likely to have large reputation concerns, making political booms
better predictors of financial crises in those countries.

3.6.1. Political booms can predict financial crises. Tables 1 and 2 document that political booms
are good predictors of financial crises in emerging markets. In other words, when popularity
increases a crisis is more likely to follow. In the model we can capture this evolution of pop-
ularity focusing on the interim period after regulation (or lack thereof) is observed but before
a crisis (or lack thereof) is observed, namely the public observes the policy enacted but the
crisis variable cr 2 {C, N C} is not realized yet. Conditional on not yet having experienced
the resolution of the credit boom, the public observes two possible outcomes, regulation b̂ or
no regulation ĝ. In each case reputation is updated differently. While we do not observe in
the data whether governments have enacted or not regulations specifically designed to avoid
possible crises, we do observe changes in popularity (or reputation), which, according to the
model, are a result of observed regulation. In the next Section we show evidence that ob-
served regulation does affect popularity. The interim updated reputation, conditional on no
regulation ĝ,
                                                           pG

is larger than the updated reputation conditional on regulation b̂,

                                                      (1 pG )

  This result is summarized in the following lemma and proved in the Appendix.

regulation reputation increases.

  The ex-ante probabilities of observing these interim levels of popularity are

                        Pr ( b̂ ) =              (1   pG ) + (1            ) (1    pB ) (1                   ⇤

                        Pr ( ĝ ) =          pG + (1            ) (pB + (1         pB )     ⇤

  The likelihood of an ensuing crisis conditional on observing an increase in popularity (i.e.,

Similarly, the likelihood of a crisis conditional on having observed a previous decrease in
popularity, is

                                                              Pr (C, b̂ )
(12)                                          Pr (C| b̂ ) =               = ⌘.
                                                               Pr ( b̂ )

  Comparing equations (11) and (12) it is clear that, conditional on an increase in reputation
(from       to       ĝ ),   which implicitly comes from a lack of corrective regulation that is inferred
from the data, there is a larger probability of experiencing a crisis ex-post. Furthermore,
when the distortion probability                ⇤
                                                   is larger, the predictive power of a popularity change
(Pr(C| ĝ ) Pr(C| b̂ )) is also larger. In essence, bad governments riding bad booms sometimes
(this is    ⇤
                > 0), is a necessary and sufficient condition for reputation to have predictive power
for the probability of future crises. Lastly, the larger are the expected distortions (this is the
larger is       ⇤
                    ), the larger is the predictive power of an increase in popularity for the arrival of
financial crises.

3.6.2. Why are political booms good predictors of financial crises in emerging markets, but not in
developed countries? A main feature of our analysis is the different role of political booms in
emerging markets compared to developed economies. In this subsection, exploiting data on
the level and volatility of popularity, we document that governments in emerging economies
have an average intermediate popularity while governments in developed economies have an
                                        POLITICAL BOOMS, FINANCIAL CRISES                                                   30

average high popularity. Since reputation concerns are maximized at intermediate popularity
levels, governments are more likely to delay corrective actions in emerging markets.
  Our model shows that political booms are better at predicting crises when                              ⇤
                                                                                                             is large. More-
over, proposition 2 shows that           ⇤
                                             achieves its maximum for intermediate reputation levels and
is small for relatively low and high reputation levels. To see this, assume that the reputation
of governments is intermediate in emerging economies                          2       ,        , which implies        ⇤
                                                                                                                          > 0.
Assume in contrast that in developed economies the reputation of governments is relatively
high such that        ⇤
                          is smaller than in emerging economies. In this case the difference between
equations (11) and (12) is not large enough to predict crises. In particular, if the reputation of
governments in developed economies is relatively high such as                                 > , then       ⇤
                                                                                                                 = 0, and the
probability of a crisis is ⌘ and the change in popularity does not help to predict the probability
of a crisis at all.
  There are two pieces of evidence suggesting that emerging economies have intermediate
levels of reputation while developed economies have high levels of reputation. First popu-
larity is on average lower in emerging markets. Second popularity is also more volatile on
average in emerging markets. We focus on volatility because it constitutes a unique property
of intermediate reputations: maintaining the information content of signals constant, when
reputation is intermediate beliefs vary more than when reputation is either low or high. In
other words, the Bayesian updating variation is larger when reputation is intermediate and
prior beliefs are not strong. Formally
                                                                                      ⇤
                                                             pG   pB     (1    pB )

                                                                  P r(ĝ)P r(b̂)

where (1         ) is the variance of popularity.
  (i) Levels of popularity: The differences in popularity are notable across country groups: In
the full sample (between 1984 and 2010) the average ICRG popularity index is 8.22 among
developed economies and 7.57 among emerging economies, with the difference being statis-
tically significant at a 99% confidence level. Before 1990 this difference was even larger, with
                                    POLITICAL BOOMS, FINANCIAL CRISES                                       31

 an average popularity index of 8.43 in developed economies and 6.00 in emerging economies,
 also a statistically significant difference. This lower level of popularity gives EME govern-
 ments a stronger incentive to ride credit bubbles and delay corrective actions.
     (ii) Volatility of popularity: The popularity of governments in emerging countries is more
 volatile than the popularity of governments in developed countries. The standard deviation
 of our ICRG measure of government popularity is 4.04 in emerging economies and 2.47 for de-
 veloped economies, with the difference being also statistically significant at a 99% confidence
 level.11
     This finding implies that the predictive power of political booms in emerging markets is
 consistent with the model. While the predictive power was obtained by analyzing the proba-
 bility of a financial crisis conditional on an increase in popularity, we can also obtain the uncon-
 ditional probability of a financial crisis,

                            Pr (C) = Pr (C| b̂ ) Pr ( b̂ ) + Pr (C| ĝ ) Pr ( ĝ )
                                                ⇤
                                      = ⌘+          ⌦.

     This implies we would expect emerging markets, this is countries with relative low pop-
 ularity governments, to suffer the occurrence of financial crises more frequently than devel-
 oped economies, everything else the same. This prediction is confirmed in Table 3: emerging
 economies are significantly more likely to be in banking crises and sudden stop episodes com-
 pared to advanced economies. Our model suggests that this difference can be explained by
 the fact that governments in emerging markets are more likely to delay the implementation
 of policies that prevent crises. This perspective complements others explanations for crises
 and volatility in emerging markets, such as the low quality of institutions (e.g. Acemoglu et
 al. 2003)

11
 We do not find countries with very low reputation levels in our sample, which is consistent with having data
 mostly of democratic countries. Once democratic governments reach low enough levels of popularity they are
 typically replaced by other governments. If new governments are drawn from a quality pool that is uncer-
 tain, they will be characterized by intermediate reputation levels. This imposes a lower bound on the level of
 popularity observed in the data.

                      4. E VIDENCE ON THE R EPUTATION M ECHANISM

  This section provides further empirical support for our argument that the reputation chan-
nel is a plausible explanation for the link between political booms and financial crises in
emerging markets. We show that, even among emerging markets alone, political booms pre-
dict financial crises better in countries with higher reputation concerns. Moreover, we doc-
ument a negative correlation between regulation and reputation, suggesting that countries
with low reputation are less prone to regulate and that less regulation improves reputation.
Finally, we show that less regulation is indeed associated with a higher probability of crises
later on.


4.1. Low popularity predicts financial crises, even among emerging markets. Through the
lens of our model, political booms predict financial crises in emerging markets mainly because
their governments have high reputation concerns (intermediate reputation levels), corrupting
their incentives to regulate. Intuitively, when initial popularity of governments is already
high, governments have less incentives to improve their popularity by delaying corrective
actions to prevent crises. To provide further backing for this interpretation, Table 4 shows that
                               POLITICAL BOOMS, FINANCIAL CRISES                              33

the initial level of government popularity helps us to predict financial crises. When popularity
four years before the crisis is low, crises are more likely to occur. This result holds for all
countries but also when restricting the sample to emerging economies alone. Furthermore, it
is robust to including controls, country and year fixed effects. The magnitude of the estimated
coefficient is also large. Based on column 3, a one standard deviation increase in the level of
the government stability lagged by 4 years (3.98 index points) can be associated with a 5.6
percentage point lower crisis probability (the calculation is -0.014*3.98=0.056). Importantly,
by adding country fixed effects we can rule out other potential explanations for this finding,
in particular deep-rooted differences in institutional quality or time-invariant characteristics
of the political system (e.g. parliamentary vs. presidential).

4.2. Regulation as a link between popularity and crises. The theoretical model allowed us
to interpret our evidence linking popularity during booms and subsequent crises as coming
from governments avoiding or delaying regulation. Here we provide supportive evidence
                               POLITICAL BOOMS, FINANCIAL CRISES                                34

for this notion, by showing that (i) there is a negative correlation between regulation and
government popularity, especially in emerging markets and that (ii) prior to crises, there is no
regulatory tightening, usually the opposite in emerging markets.
  To assess the role of regulation empirically, we draw on an IMF database of financial reg-
ulation and financial reform covering 91 economies between 1973 and 2005, by Abiad et al.
(2010). The aggregate index of financial reforms, ranges from 0 to 21 and consists of seven
sub-indicators covering credit controls, interest rate controls, entry barriers in the financial
sector, state ownership of banks, restrictions on international capital flows, banking supervi-
sion and securities markets regulation. We also place special attention on sub-indicators that
capture financial sector regulation in a narrow sense, namely (i) the indicator of credit con-
trols and (ii) the sub-indicators of banking supervision and securities market regulation (we
sum the latter two). The index (and each indicator) is inverted so that high values stand for
stricter regulation.

4.2.1. Negative correlation between regulation and government popularity. The data confirm that
regulation and government popularity are negatively correlated in emerging markets: the
correlation between the aggregate index and the ICRG government stability measure is -0.44,
suggesting that emerging markets with tightly regulated financial systems have less popu-
lar governments. In first differences, the correlation is still negative (-0.08), indicating that
regulatory action is associated with a drop in popularity in EMEs. For advanced economies,
we find the opposite: the correlation between regulatory changes (tightening) and popularity
changes is positive (0.06).
  Table 5 shows more systematic evidence based on fixed effects panel regressions in the
subsample of EMEs. The dependent variable is the index of government stability in levels
(column 1) and year on year changes (columns 2-4), respectively. The explanatory variables
are the proxies for regulation, in particular the aggregate index of financial regulation, in lev-
els (column 1) and in first differences, using the three-year moving average of annual changes
(column 2). We also use changes in the sub-indicator of credit restrictions (column 3) and
                                    POLITICAL BOOMS, FINANCIAL CRISES                                         35

              Table 5: Regulation and Government Popularity in Emerging Markets




 changes in banking and securities market regulation (column 4). In each case, we find regula-
 tion to have significant, negative correlation.12 According to column 2, a one point increase in
 overall regulatory intensity (ranging from 0 to 21) is associated with a decline in government
 popularity index of 0.16. A one point increase in the credit restrictions indicator (ranging from
 0 to 3) is associated with a popularity decline of 0.64 in the ICRG index (which ranges from 1
 to 12).




12
 When we account for global trends by adding year fixed effects, we still find a negative correlation throughout,
 but the coefficient only remains significant with regard to the sub-indicator of credit controls.

     In line with our model these findings suggest that regulation has a negative reputational
 impact only for governments in emerging markets: in advanced economies the coefficient for
 regulatory action is either positive and/or insignificant.

 4.2.2. Emerging market crises are preceded by loose regulation. Here we assess regulatory action
 in the run-up to financial crises in emerging markets. We find that the aggregate regulation
 index drops from an average of 7.3 to only 5.9 during the 5 years before the 9 major crisis
 events in our sample. Similarly, in the full sample of EME banking crises for which we have
 regulation data, the index drops from an average of 12.5 three year prior to the crisis to 11.7
 at the outbreak of the crisis. This suggests that regulation was typically loosened prior to
 EME crises. In contrast, in advanced economies, the index increases in the run up to crises,
 suggesting that regulation is typically tightened.
     The picture is confirmed when looking at changes in the aggregate regulation index country
 by country. Of the 36 banking crises and 28 sudden stop events of emerging markets for which
 we have regulation data, there is not a single case that was preceded by significant regulation
 tightening (an index increase of more than 1 in the three pre-crisis years). As shown in Table
 B.4 in the Appendix, the large majority of EME crises saw either no change in regulation pre-
 crisis or a loosening of regulation. Indeed, more than one third of banking crises and sudden
 stops occurred after a period of significant deregulation, defined as a loosening of 2 index
 points or more.13
     Last but not least, case study evidence supports the view that EMEs delayed necessary reg-
 ulatory action during most pre-crisis booms. The Asian crisis of the 1990s may be the best ex-
 ample. The economies of the "Asian tigers" were booming and by the mid-1990s governments
 had gained strong popular support. At the same time, financial systems were liberalized and
 little regulatory action was taken. An IMF (2000) paper on the Asian crisis concludes that
 "prudential regulations were weak or poorly enforced" and "those indicators of trouble that
 were available seem to have been largely ignored". Similarly, Corsetti et al. (1999) summarize
13
 This is finding is in line with Mendoza and Terrones (2012), who show that credit booms in emerging markets
 are frequently preceded by episodes of financial liberalization (regulatory loosening).
                                    POLITICAL BOOMS, FINANCIAL CRISES                                       37

 that banking and financial systems were very fragile "poorly supervised, poorly regulated
 and in shaky condition even before the onset of the crisis". This corresponds to the assess-
 ment of Radelet and Sachs (1998) that "financial sector deregulation was not accompanied by
 adequate supervision", which "allowed banks to take on substantial foreign currency and ma-
 turity risks". When vulnerabilities became visible, "little action was taken to strengthen the
 banks, and some policy changes [...] actually weakened the system further". Similar anecdotes
 can also be told for pre-crisis Turkey or pre-crisis Russia.14 Overall, this evidence supports the
 reputation mechanism we propose in this paper.


                                             5. C ONCLUSIONS

     Financial crises often are credit booms gone wrong both in developed and emerging coun-
 tries. In this paper we show that financial crises are also political booms gone wrong, but
 only in emerging countries. This new fact may help understand why credit booms often do
 go wrong. In the urge to build popularity, governments in emerging markets may prefer to
 delay or avoid the implementation of corrective policies during booms and by doing so face
 a substantial chance that the boom goes bust. Our theoretical model featuring these politi-
 cal motivations is consistent with this new fact and also generates other implications that are
 consistent with the data.
     We show evidence supporting the reputation mechanism and the regulation channel we
 propose. Most importantly, we rationalize the empirical differences between emerging mar-
 kets and developing countries with one simple observation: emerging market governments
 have lower and more volatile levels of popularity compared to advanced economies. This
 translates into larger reputation concerns, discourages pre-crisis regulation and is associated
 with a significantly higher probability of financial crises in these countries. Indeed, we show


14
 Turkey introduced a new banking law and supervisory framework only after the first IMF bailout in 1999 (the
 law was a core IMF requirement at the time), see http://www.imf.org/external/np/loi/1999/120999.htm. Sim-
 ilarly, Russia witnessed a largely unregulated boom in private credit and securities markets in the mid-1990s.

 that regulation is negatively related to government popularity in emerging markets, but pos-
 itively correlated in advanced economies. Relatedly, and in line with the model’s predictions,
 we observe that most emerging market crises were not preceded by regulation tightening, but
 rather by inaction or even deregulation.
     Our focus on credit booms and financial crises is motivated by the ongoing debate about
 the recent financial turmoil and the incentives of policymakers to regulate financial markets.
 However, the reputational mechanism proposed here is more general and potentially applies
 to a broader set of policy interventions, such as redistributive policies, privatizations, fiscal
 stimulus, taxation decisions, etc. The model and empirical strategy could also be considered
 to study booms and crises in other macroeconomic variables, which are outside the scope of
 this paper.
     More generally, the results open the possibility of developing a theory of political-financial
 traps. If a country does not hold its politicians in high regard on average, that country is more
 subject to crises and economic volatility since political gains from riding political booms are
 higher. This in turn makes crises more likely and keeps average reputation of politicians low,
 a vicious circle.15 Several interesting questions remain open. Does it make a difference on
 the likelihood of crises whether crises occur close to or far ahead of elections? What if gov-
 ernments also have limited information and can only imperfectly identify the sustainability of
 credit booms and the likelihood of financial crises? What measures would allow to exploit the
 positive effects of government reputation concerns without suffering their negative effects?




15
 Moreover, since the quality of new governments is harder for the public to observe, newer governments will
 be more prone to ride booms that are likely to end in crises, and then more likely to be removed from power.
 This implies that countries with new governments are both the ones with the highest turnover and also can be
 stuck in a political boom-financial crisis cycle the longest. Likewise, older governments are the ones more prone to
 implement corrective regulation and be more conservative.

  If E( ĝ |g) =     b̂ ,   equations (9) and (10) are both positive (E( ĝ |g) > E( ĝ |b) as ⌘ < ⌘b,). Hence
 B (ĝ|g)   = 1 and         B (ĝ|b)   = 0. From equations (3)-(8), these strategies imply E( ĝ |g) >                                      b̂ ,   a
contradiction.
  If E( ĝ |g) <     b̂ ,   equation (10) is positive, hence                       B (ĝ|b)          = 0 (recall E( ĝ |g) > E( ĝ |b)). Then
we have three cases. If (9) is positive                        B (ĝ|g)     = 1. Again, from equations (3)-(8), these strate-
gies imply that E( ĝ |g) >                  b̂ ,   which is a contradiction. If (9) is negative, then                      B (ĝ|g)   = 0: the
bad government always regulates (b̂), which means that, if households do not observe regula-
tion (ĝ) believes for sure the government is good, hence E( ĝ |g) = 1, which is a contradiction.
If (9) is zero   B (ĝ|g)     2 [0, 1], which implies E( ĝ |g) >                             b̂ ,   a contradiction.                              ⌅
