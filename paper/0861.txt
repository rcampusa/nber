                     LDC Debt in the l980s: Risk and Reforms



                                    ABSTRACT



     With the rapid increase in LDC indebtedness in the recent decade, the

issues of creditworthiness and country risk have gained new importance.

This paper offers a theoretical and historical analysis of international

capital markets in the presence of default risk. The theoretical model

suggests the possibility of a prisoners' dilemma in the loan market, in

which a country's dominant noncooperative strategy is to default, though

a welfare—improving cooperative strategy is available. The historical

analysis suggests that the IMF may play a key role in guiding creditors

and debtor nations to reach cooperative solutions.

    The private capital markets of the advanced industrial economies reopened on

a large scale to less developed country (LDC) borrowers in the past decade,

after a hiatus of nearly forty years. Private lending to LDC sovereign

borrowers grew sharply in the early 1970s, and then soared in the aftermath of

the first OPEC oil shock, in 1973 (see Table 1). This momentous change

reflected shifts in banking practices within an existing regulatory environment,

rather than new official policy governing international capital flows. The IMP

and central banks did not create the new environment, and have had to work

quickly to adapt their own policies to it. Broadly speaking, this essay takes

the regulator's perspective, by asking what guidelines should govern the over-

sight and control of private international capital flows to the LDCs.   My focus

will be on the issue of LDC creditworthiness and the prospects for defaults in

international loans.   I do not consider an equally important aspect of the debt

problem, the vulnerability of the international banks to a major default.

    The salutary effects of high international capital mobility on the world

economy in the past decade cannot be over—stressed. Most importantly,

widespread access to foreign capital allowed the middle—income developing

countries to sustain very high growth rates in the 1970s, in spite of the OPEC

shocks and the sluggish growth of the developed economies. These countries

experienced real GNP growth of 5.6 percent per annum during 1970—80, little

reduced from the 6.2 percent rate of the previous decade, in large part because

of high domestic investment rates sustained by foreign borrowing.

    On the other hand, serious economic and political stresses emerged in a

number of countries and in the world financial markets, as some borrowers became

seriously overextended in indebtedness. Overall, the non—OPEC LDCs increased

their net debt from $57 billion in 1970, or 13.7 percent of GNP, to $221 billion

in 1979, approximately 17.7 percent of GNP (Sachs [1981], Table 1).    No less

than 11 countries have been required to reschedule debt to official and private

creditors since 1975, and in most of those reschedulings, countries have been

required by creditors to commit themselves to sharply contractionary policies to

restrict new international borrowing. While we shall see that many of these

austerity programs have been successful in alleviating debt difficulties, their

costs in terms of reduced employment and income in the debtor countries have

often been very large.

    The dangers of the growing international indebtedness are many—sided, with

major risks borne both by creditors and debtors. Most directly, the creditors

both official and private, bear the risk of an outright repudiation or default

of outstanding international debt.   The long history of international capital

flows in the 1gth and early 20th century underscores such default risk, for

there is an impressive 150—year record of international defaults by sovereign

borrowers, including repeated defaults by Latin American governments, Turkey.,

Egypt, Portugal, Russia, and others, as well as defaults by no less than 17

American states on bonds floated in Europe in the 19th century. Of course, the

most recent episode of widespread international defaults occurred in 1931 and

1932, during the Great Depression, and was the cause of the collapse of inter—
                                      -4-




national borrowing for the succeeding forty years. It is a story to which I

shall return.

    Until the cataclysm of the Great Depression, the cycle of defaults was con-

sidered a part of the normal working of the international financial system, and

certainly not a threat to the stability of' the overall economic order.

Creditors received substantial risk premia on foreign loans to compensate for

default or "sovereign risk", and the governments of creditors were typ4cally

content to allow their nationals to suffer defaults without significant public

intervention on their behalf (however, experiences varied, as we will see

below).

    With the onset of the worldwide, synchronized defaults of the early 1930s,

official attitudes changed, regarding both the merits of free private capital

movements, and the ramifications of default. Banks, governments, and multila-

teral institutions have gone to great lengths in recent years to avoid sovereign

default, both through positive incentives (e.g. concessionary loans in return

for debtor adjustment policies) and concerted threats of strong retaliation for

debt repudiation. Measured by default frequency, the set of policies has thus

far been remarkably successful: there have been almost no cases of outright

repudiation of debt since 1945, (examples include North Korea and Ghana, and

 the repudiation by Ghana was converted to a rescheduling of debt obligations

after subsequent multilateral negotiations). Moreover, there is no doubt that

 recent events in many debtor economies would have led to default under pre-'WWII

 rules of' the game, but have instead resulted in IMF—supervised adjustment poli—
                                         —5—


cies and debt reschedulings. Many threats remain, however. Debt reschedulings

have become increasingly common (see below), and arrears in interest due have

been rising steadily, now topping $5 billion. Moreover, there have been calls

in recent years, e.g. by the Group of 77 in 1977, for a moratorium on LDC debt

payments. Most large LDC borrowers rejected this approach though.

    One reason for the plethora of pre-1930 defaults versus post—1945

rescheduling, is that the early period was characterized by non—cooperative

strategies of creditors and debtors, while the post—1945 period is characterized

by extensive bargaining and cooperative strategies of banks arid the LDCs.

Formal models of the costs and benefits of default show that there is often a

prisoners' dilemma aspect to loan agreements. The payoff matrix for creditors

and debtors might look as follows (the first entry in each cell is the creditor

payoff):


                                   Debtor Strategy

                             Restrain       Default
                             Demand

           Maintain loans     1, 0             —5, 2


           Increase loans     0,     2      —10, 3



Here, the debtor prefers to default no matter what the strategy pursued by the
                                      —6—



creditor, and the creditor wants to call in loans no matter what action the deb-

tor takes. The resulting non—cooperative solution yields (—2,1), which is

clearly dominated by a policy of increased loans and demand restraint, yielding

(0,2), which a IMF—supervised debt-rescheduling package might achieve. In

situations where the PIF cannot intervene, such as Poland (which is not an IMF

member) the risk of default rises accordingly.

    A second reason for the reduction in defaults is most likely a shift in

bargaining strength between debtors and creditors. After most defaults, in the

19th and early 20th century, private bondholder committees fended for themselves

in negotiations with debtor countries, and their options for retaliation were

rather limited. They could not rely on steady support from the central

government nor even necessarily from other financial institutions (e.g. banking

houses) or foreign bond markets. Since World War II, governments themselves

have become large creditors, and have also more aggressively intervened in

financial market oversight, in part through the IMF. The potential scope and

strength of retaliation to defaults has been considerably enhanced.

    Of course, if defaults are prevented by threats of very strong creditor

retaliation, there is a risk of another sort imposed on LDC borrowers. The

default option can be a way for LDC borrowers to transfer economic risks to

their better diversified creditors, and thus may be part of an efficient debt

structure. In the past, when a large investment project failed, or a country's

terms of trade shifted adversely, a default often resulted. Now, the borrowing

country is forced instead to restrain consumption and growth for a number of

years to satisfy its debt commitments. It is quite possible that the ex ante

expected utility of both borrowers and lenders is raised by a debt package that
                                        -7-



includes a default option with a compensating risk premium.

    Aside from the direct risks of default, there is another set of concerns

about LDC debt that might be termed "systemic" risks. A major default or

series of defaults could lead to bank failures in the advanced economies

perhaps with cascading effects through the world financial system. As

Kindleberger has persuasively argued, such risks are intensified in the inter-

national banking community because of the absence of a clear internatiqnal

"lender of last resort". There is no settled responsibility of domesti,.c central

banks vis—a—vis the foreign subsidiaries of domestic institutions, and the IMF

has abjured from a formal role as lender of last resort. Thus, the types of

bank bailout operations that forestall domestic financial panics might not be

forthcoming in the international setting. Unfortunately, I will be unable to

pursue   this theme in the current paper.
    There is a similar, though less recognized, risk of cascading default origi-
nating in the supply side of the credit markets. In the event of an isolated
default or failure of an international loan, there might arise a strong movement

among creditor institutions to reduce exposure on LDC debt across the board.

The costs of new loans or debt rollovers could rise sharply, thereby pushing a

number of additional economies into default. I will suggest later that such• a

market reaction helps to explain the widespread defaults of 1931 and 1932, and

that a similar paralysis almost gripped the international banks in 1974. The

possibility of a self—fulfilling prophecy of widespread default may remain the

greatest danger posed by the LDC debt today.

   There is a growing and very fine literature detailing various empirical

aspects of LDC borrowing, so that I may be brief in describing the recent

history of international capital movements. Thus, in the first section, I

outline a few stylized facts to characterize the international financial market

as a basis for the subsequent analysis. Next, I present a simple theoretical

model of the international capital markets under risk of sovereign default.

Various points are brought out in the model: (1) rationing will be a standard

device in credit allocation to sovereign borrowers; (2) rationed borrowers will

have an incentive to pursue particular current account goals, and to stimulate

domestic investment; (3) a cooperative solution between banks and sovereign

borrowers will tend to dominate a non—cooperative solution in loan negotiations;

(4) country risk rises with overall indebtedness of the country, and falls with

increasing investment rates in the country; (5) defaults, in general, provide a

useful, but imperfect form of insurance to debtor countries, so that an inter-

national capital market with no defaults is not necessarily our best policy

target.   In the third section, I briefly review the history of sovereign

default, to document the major shifts in market organization between the

pre-WWII and post-WWII international capital markets. Finally, in the fourth

section of the paper, I analyze some aspects of borrowing in the 1970s in light

of the theoretical analysis of the previous section.

I.     LDC Indebtedness in the 1970s

       As the description of LDC indebtdness and its growth is now well known, and

is widely available elsewhere, I will merely summarize the key characteristics

of    the debt for later discussion.I
       Current account   deficits as a percentage of GNP rose sharply for the LDCs in

the    1970s, as did the debt/GNP ratio.     Table 2   shows the current account posi-
tion    of the LDCs, the developed countries, and the major oil exporters

throughout the 1970s. The raw numbers must be adjusted for inflation, since

debtor countries enjoy capital gains due to inflation on their outstanding debts

(i.e. reductions in the real value of their indebtedness) that reduce the effec-

tive current account deficits in any year.             Thus, in 1978, for example, real

LDC deficits were only about half of the official magnitude, while OPEC was

really in deficit in the sense that the capital losses on its outstanding assets

exceeded in value the year's accumulation of financial claims.

       Current   account deficits can be financed through a variety of financial
arrangements, including bank or bond debt, foreign direct investment, equity
investment, etc. While all types of financing reflect a claim by the rest of
the    world on the future income of the deficit country, only certain types of

assets are typically counted as "debt." These are the fixed—income claims on

the debtor country and its citizens, in the form of bank and bond indebtedness.

Mostdata refer to gross debt, but a more meaningful measure is net debt, in
which LDC claims on the rest of the world (e.g. foreign reserves of the central

bank) are subtracted. In many cases, the distinction of debt and other liabili-

ties is important, since equity claims offer yeilds that are contingent on eco-

nomic performance, while bonds do not, so that risks are different with alter-

native mixes of "debt" and foreign ownership of domestic capital. Often,

however, the distinction is misleading, particularly for evaluating total

foreign claims on the domestic output stream in future years. In the case of no

uncertainty, there is no legitimate distinction between the various liabilities.

    Unfortunately, only data for indebtedness     se are readily available.

Some of these data are shown in Tables 2 and 3.   Note first the sharp rise in

D/GNP for the LDCs as a whole during the 1970s. Second, it is important to

point out that the vast majority (over 75) of total indebtedness is publicly

guaranteed by the government of the borrowing country. Even borrowing by pri-

vate corporations is typically under the aegis of the central government.

Third, there has been an enormous rise in the share of government—guaranteed

debt extended by private creditors, though both official and private creditors

played an important role in LDC financing in recent years.

    The aggregate figures hide enormous variations in the borrowing behavior of

individual LDCs. The distribution of indebtedness is highly skewed, and this is

particularly true for indebtedness to private creditors. Mexico and Brazil

alone account for about 40 percent of LDC net bank liabilities, and about 25

percent of total LDC gross debt.   The large borrowers, who are principally

major exporters of manufactures, rely heavily on loans from private creditors

wh:iie the poor countries, with less access to Euromarket loans, have a much

higher fraction of financing through official bilateral or multilateral cre-

dits. (See Table 4.)

    International private sector credits are almost entirely in the form of

rollover, syndicated loans, with maturities of 5-10 years. These are variable

interest rate liabilities with quarterly or semi—annual interest charges fixed

at a pre—deterrnined margin (spread) over LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate).

Official credits have much longer maturities (on average in excess of twenty

years), and are usually at fixed and concessional interest rates.

    Importantly, there is very little participation of the LDCs in the long—term

international bond markets. In contrast to the period before the Great

Depression when dozens of countries and the political subdivisions made exten-

sive use of the bond markets in London, Paris and New York, now there is almost

no LDC participation. As shown in Table 1, net borrowing of non—oil LDCs in the

bond market has been a small fraction of total private credits arranged in the

1970s.

    Nineteenth century international debt was risky, and the market acknowledged

it as such, requiring very large risk premia on LDC loans. A striking aspect of

LDC bank debt in the 1970s has been the remarkably small spreads charged by

banks, as seen in Table 5. The difference in interest charges on loans to the

industrial versus developing countries is very small, and remarkably, there has

been very little tendency for spreads to the LDOs to widen as indebtedness grew.

The banks certainly act as if the prospects of default are small; perhaps we

will see why in the analysis that follows.

II. A Model of International Borrowing and Default

      To understand the risks of sovereign lending and the role of debt

reschedulings, we must first characterize the nature of equilibrium in the

international loan markets. What determines a country's desired level of

indebtedness, or current account deficits? What indicators suggest that an eco-

nomy is on an "unsustainable" path of foreign borrowing, so that it requires

some form of policy intervention? Finally, in what sense, if any, should

sovereign borrowers pursue current account targets as a matter of macroeconomic

policy? To highlight the role of default risk, I will just briefly take up

these questions in a model without defaults, and then turn to the more

realistic model in the following part.


       (a) Borrowing in a Model without Default Risk

      Ignoring issues of default, the essence of "sustainability" of international

borrowing lies in the nations' intertemporal budget constraint. Consider a

world of certainty, in which lenders extend credit to agents in an economy at

interest rate r. If Q is national output, C is private consumption, I is

investment, G is government spending, and D is the level of international

indebtedness, we have:



(1)        Dt+j — Dt =       (Ct   +   It   +   Gt)   —   (Qt — rDt)

Of course, Q is GNP and Q—rD is GDP, so that Dt+i—Dt, which equals the current

account deficit, is the difference of GDP and total absorption. Defining

national savings as GDP net of private plus public consumption expenditure, St =

(Qt — rDt)   —
                 (Ct   +
                           Ct),    we have the identity CAt =          Dt+i — Dt
                                                                                 =
                                                                                     't   —
                                                                                              S.,   where

CAt signifies the current account balance. We say that a country obeys its
                                                —17—



intertemporal budget constraint if the present value of its debt, (1+r)_tDt,

goes to zero as t approaches infinity. In this case, no creditor is left

"holding the bag" over time, with a borrower who is merely borrowing more and

more to repay interest due.IW Using this limiting condition (i) implies:



(2)
          i=O
                (1+r)-(C+G+I)1 =
                                   i=O
                                         (1+r)- -      D(O)



or


(3)             (1 +r)1[Q._(c+I+c).] = L (1     +r)_i(TB)j    D(O)
          i=o                             i=O


TB signifies the trade balance, Q-C-I-G.
      These expressions, then, describe the conditions for sustainable domestic
spending.    According to (2), the discounted present value of total future expen-

ditures must equal the discounted present value of national output, less initial

international indebtedness. Equation (3) puts this constraint in a slightly

different perspective by recording that the discounted sum of future trade

surpluses must equal the initial indebtedness of the economy. In other words,

trade surpluses and deficits must balance over time; the question for an economy

is not whether to run deficits, but rather when to run them.

      The optimal timing of deficits is in general a complex function of current

and future economic variables and characteristics of the economy. Speaking

broadly, three considerations dominate. First, households (or governments on

their behalf) seek to smooth consumption over time. A temporary drop in real
                                         -18-




income, say because of a crop failure or an adverse shift in the terms of trade,

will result in a smaller fall in consumption, with the more steady level of con-

sumption being supported by foreign borrowing. Second, if the market rate of

interest exceeds the social rate of time preference, the country will tend to

save today (i.e. ,   run   trade surpluses) to enjoy higher consumption expenditures

in the future. Finally, if there are favorable investment opportunities given

the world cost of capital, countries will tend to run deficits today to finance

the investment expenditure. There will be a tendency to equalize the marginal

product of capital and the world interest rate.

    When a country's trade deficit rises because of a fall in current income or

a drop in the world interest rate, the rise in indebtedness signals a fall in

future consumption levels, as the debt must eventually be serviced. But when a

deficit emerges becuse of an investment boom, no future consumption sacrifice is

implied. The economy is merely trading one asset, the debt instrument, for

another, the claim to physical capital. Assuming that the latter asset has a

yield at least as high as the former (which is presumably the motive for the

investment expenditure), future consumption possibilities are enhanced, not

diminished. For this obvious reason, measures of debt           se tell us little

about the burdens of future debt service. We must focus separately on national

savings and investment rates to determine the sustainable future paths of

consumption.

    If default is absolutely precluded, bank lending to the economy is only

restricted by the    condition that C, C, I > 0. Thus, the maximum    debt limit

DM(t)   is
                                     —19--




                        =
                            DM(t).



At this debt level, future absorption is restricted to zero in all periods, and

national income is fully used for debt servicing. The supply of funds schedule

is kinked at this point, with perfectly elastic credit at rate r until DM(t) j

reached, and perfectly inelastic credit supply at that level. No interest rate

will bring forth loans in excess of DM. Aithough it is a trivial case, this

kinked supply schedule illustrates that credit ceilings are fully consistent

with perfect competition in the loan market. It is simply the case that the

market value of all loans for D > DM(t) must be negative, and therefore such

loans will not be made by competitive, value—maximizing financial institutions.

    In the case of perfect mobility, all domestic investments are undertaken

that have a positive present value at the prevailing world interest rate.

Importantly, and in sharp contrast to the case with potential default, a rise in

domestic savings has no effect on domestic investment rates, and therefore

results, one-for—one, in a corresponding improvement in the trade balance. We

shall see that under conditions of potential debt repudiation, a rise in savings

can actually raise domestic investment so much that the trade balance worsens,

rather than improves.

    Without doubt, the perfect capital mobility assumption is seriously defi-

cient as a basis for current account analysis. There is solid evidence for

variations in risk premia on loans to sovereign borrowers, as functions of the
                                        -20-



borrowers savings and investment rates and overall debt levels. Moreover,

there j substantial anecdotal evidence that ceilings on country borrowing are

sometimes imposed in the capital markets. One theoretical response to these

complicating factors in loan supply has been to assume a supply schedule for

total borrowing, with the borrowing rate a rising function of total

indebtedness: r =   f(D),   f'>O. When this approach is pursued, countries become

monosopists in the world loan market, and thus have an incentive to follow par-

ticular current account policies. Since increased national indebtedness raises

borrowing costs on inframarginal as well as marginal loans, the policy authori-

ties should ration foreign borrowing (through a quota or capital inport tax) to

limit overall interest costs.

    Because f(D) is arbitrarily specified rather than derived, it is likely to

be a misleading guide to loan supply. In particular, we shall see that the loan

schedule linking r and D will           on domestic policies, and will therefore

not be invariant to policy changes in the borrowing country. In particular, by

raising domestic savings rates, the authorities can shift the supply schedule

outward, and thus lower borrowing costs on outstanding debt. There will, in

general, be an incentive to subsidize savings.


(b) Borrowing in a Model with Default Risk

    In a series of very insightful articles, Eaton and Gersovitz describe how

the potential for sovereign default can dramatically alter our view of inter-

national capital mobility. They consider loans in a non—cooperative

environment, and argue that a loan ceiling exists for sovereign borrowing that
                                      —21 —




is   determined by the effective retaliation that creditors can achieve in the

event of a unilateral repudiation of debt. If the possibilities for effective

retaliation are good, the debt ceiling will be high, as there is little chance

of a default. If there is no way to retaliate, the ceiling is at zero: nothing

will be lent. I examine both the non—cooperative framework and a cooperative

alternative, in which the debtor country can pre—comniit itself to a stabiliza-

tion package in order to sustain international lending.

      I consider a simple framework in which loans are made in one period which

may or may not be paid back in the next. If the loan is defaulted, the creditor

retaliates with a cost to the debtor of a fraction A of national income.

A summarizes all the possible costs of retaliation: trade disruption, exclusion

from future borrowing, seizure of assets, etc. I assume that the retaliation

yeilds no utility to the creditors (or that the costs and benefits of reta-

liation cancel), only a loss to the debtor.

      For a particular debtor, a given level of debt will lead to default in some

circumstances and not in others (depending on second—period income). Creditors

will demand a risk premium that depends on the probability of default, which in

turn depends on the sanctions that creditors impose in the event of default.

Because the posibilities for retaliation are limited, there are some levels of

debt that lead to default with certainty. At these debt levels, there is no

risk premium that can compensate for the default risk: an absolute ceiling of

indebtedness must be imposed by creditors when that level of indebtedness is
                                              —22—



reached. Because of the borrowing ceiling, there is no presumption that all

investments with positive present value at the world interest rate will be

undertaken. The debt ceiling will rise with stronger retaliatory measures, so

that it may be in the debtor's interest to encourage a strong response to

default, in order to raise the debt ceiling, and free up capital inflows.

    The default risks can now be usefully formalized.             I will start with a case

of certainty, and then move on to the case of uncertainty.

    Suppose national output in periods 1 and 2 is given by Q1 and                with

Q Q(K1), and K = K1,1 + I,1. The social welfare function is specified as
u(c1 ,c2)       u(c1 )   + u(c2)/(i + 6), where 6 is the pure rate of time reference.


National indebtedness is equal to the first—period current account deficit,

            =                                                               In the absence
                D1, and the world safe rate of return is given by p.

of default, we have the intertemporal budget constraint C1+C2/(1+P) =

Q1-4-Q2/(1+P)—11, or C2         Q2—(1+p)D1. In the no—default case, we designate C2 as

C2N. With default, there is no second-period debt servicing, but output is

reduced in proportion A CD =           (i — X)Q2.    The default decision depends on whether

C2D is greater than or less than C2.

    Under certainty, banks will agree to make loans up to the point where the

country would choose to default, i.e. to the point where C2D is just less than

C2. We must consider two institutional arrangements, which I will label

"non—cooperative" and "cooperative," in order to determine the debt ceiling. In

the first case, which is mont unual, the loan agreement is reached between the

country and the bank before the country's policies with respect to investment
                                                  —23—




and savings in the first period are revealed. In the cooperative setting, the

country pre—counts itself to an investment—consumption plan before a loan is

arranged. In this case, the bank's loan limits can be based on the observed

first—period policies.

      The term "cooperative' is used in analogy to the game—theoretic situation in

which players may bind themselves to a particular strategy (and in which the

other players recognize the binding constraint). The case in which countries

credibly promise certain policies before loans are made may or may not involve

true cooperation (in the everyday sense) between banks and the country. The

commitment may reflect the fact that certain policies are pre—set by constitu-

tional rules, or by IMF imposition, or by simple calendar constraints. We will

have more to say on the IMF role later.

      Now, in either setting, the bank is safe in extending a loan as long as
                                                               —
C2D     C2N. Since C2D = (1—A)Q2 and C2N =                Q2       (1÷p)D1, the loan is safe as long
as D1       Q2/(1+p). But Q2         is   a function of I, so that the loan is safe as long

as D1       2(K0-i-I1)/(1-i-p)       h(11), with h'>O, h"<O. Let IM(Dl) be the minimum

level of I such that D1 h(I1). A loan D1 will be safe as long as the banks
can   be   sure that Ij       11M(D1).

      In the cooperative setting, the country announces Ii ,                    freeing   up loans in

the amount D1 h(I1). Assuming that the borrowing constraint binds (the

interesting case for our purposes) the "planner" chooses Ii to maximize social

welfare, subject to D1 =          h(11).     Formally, the problem is to solve
                                       —24-

                            C2 = Q2(K0÷11) — (1+P)D1


Implicitly, UC is a function Ii , and through the borrowing constraint, a func-

tion of D1. This function is graphed in Figure 1.      The optimum is attained at

D1c. (The superscript c denotes "cooperative").

In the non—cooperative (NC) setting, D1 is set first and then Ii and C1 are cho-

sen given D1. For given D1 ,          the planner always evaluates two courses of action,

defaulting (D) and not defaulting (ND), and chooses the course with higher uti-

lity. Formally,


()              = max (UD,UND)


             UD = max   u(c1)    +



                  subject   to       C1 = Qi —         Ii   +

                 subject to          C1

                                              Q1
                                                   —
                                                       I    +

                                          =        —
                                     C2       Q2       (i+p)D1

These functions are graphed in Figure 2.                        Note that for D1   D*, the country

will not default, while for D1 > D* it will. Obviously Di* is the credit limit

that banks will impose in the non—cooperative case. Since uNT)(D1) is rising at

D*, the country will choose to borrow up to D1*.

      Since the country defaults if and only if D1 > D*, it is a direct implica-

tion that:


(6)        Ii   IM(D1) if and only if D1 < D*.


      That is, for Dj           the bank knows that investment will be sufficient to
                                               - 28-


guarantee repayment, while for D1 > D*, ft will be insufficient. Therefore, if

we super-impose 11ND and UC as in Figure 3, we find that they touch at D*.

Otherwise UND > UC._1

      Figure 3   allows   up to draw the following crucial conclusions. In the non-

cooperative game, the country reaches UND(D*). In the cooperative game, it

reaches UC(D) which exceeds UND(D*). If default is entirely ruled out (e.g. by

a "world policeman"), it can reach a UND(D), which is the optimum optimorum.

The possibility of default reduces the country's utility by freezing its credit

line. Under certainty, the borrowing country should insist on high penalties

for default, for as A approaches 1, D* approaches D.

      It is crucial to understand the role of cooperation in raising welfare. The

country is better off to borrow D and invest IC(D) than to borrow D* and invest

IND(D*). But if given the chance to borrow D it prefers to invest less, ID(D) <

Ic(D), and to default. Thus, without a commitment by the country to maintain a

high level of investment, the bank will not lend D.

      The importance of the cooperative regime is even more striking when the

country enters the "first" period with pre—existing indebtedness, which we will

denote as D0. With initial debt the planner's problem is slightly changed. In

the cooperative setting the problem is

Again, let          be the cut-off point such that the country defaults if first—

period band D1 exceed Dj. It is possible that D0 is sufficiently high so

that Dp = 0, (in other words the country simplyl plans to default in the
second period, no matter how much it is loaned in the first period).

      Suppose that (a) DDO* =        0; and (b) a cooperative solution exists. The graph
of this situation is shown in Figure 4. This is precisely the Prisoner's dilemma

alluded to in the introduction. In the non—cooperative case the bank loans noth-

ing, since UD(O) > U(O). A cooperative agreement would allow loans up to D1,

making both the bank and the country off (since UC(D1) > UD(O)). The coopera-

tive agreement would pre-commit the country to a substantial investment program.

Again, if the country is absolutely barred from default it can reach uN1)(D),

which exceeds UC(D) and UD(O).

    There is another important problem that can occur in financial markets that

we must consider. Suppose that banks refuse to issue loans to the country in

the first period, even though there is a range of debt for which the country

would re—pay its loan. Since a loan freeze is part of the penalty, embodidied

in A, that attaches to a default, a unilateral freeze on loans reduces the net

penalty associated with default, and makes default more likely. Formally, a

freeze on credit reduces UND(O) relative to UD(O); with UD(O) > u(o) the

country will choose to default. In this sense, a loan freeze by banks in

response to a worry about default can be self—fulfilling.

    It is important to supplement this analysis with uncertainty, for two

reasons.   First, it is only through unexpected events that a bank gets trapped

holding the bad debt of a sovereign borrower; only with uncertainty (or

irrationality) will defaults actually occur. Second, under uncertainty the

default option becomes a vehicle for the banks to assume some of the risk of LDC

investment projects. It may provide an imperfect form of insurance in a world

with incomplete financial markets. I am now carrying out a detailed study of

defaults under uncertainty in a many—period model, and I just touch on the high—

lights of that analysis now.
                                     —33-



    Once uncertainty is added to the model, we find that creditors (assumed to

be risk neutral) will make loans with a positive probability of default, as long

as there exists an interest rate premium that can compensate for the risk. In

this case, changes in the penalty for default, A, affect not only the credit

ceiling on loans, but also the risk characteristics of investments from the

point of view of both debtor and creditor. Under uncertainty, high penalities

for default make the borrower better off, by raising the country's credit

ceiling. Under certainty, higher penalties may actually lower the country's

welfare. Though the ability to borrow is enhanced, the 9insurance" aspect of

defaults is diminished, since the penalties for default become more severe.

Thus, the E[U(C1 ,c2)] may fall (E denotes "expectation"). In general there will

be an optimal A for the debtor country, for which E[U(C1 ,c2)] is maximized sub-

ject to the constraint that risk neutral creditors achieve the expected yield

p. Along with A there is an optimal non-zero probability of default, 11*.

    The usefuliness of default as a risk-spreading mechanism depends on the

alternative financial assets that are available to the debtor country. For

instance, if the investment returns depend on easily identifiable exogenous

conditions (e.g. weather), there may well be an insurance market available to

reduce or eliminate risk (for example, hurricane insurance is commonly held by

many Carribean countries).   More typically, insurance will not be available

for investment where:   (1) the ex post returns to investment are not easily

monitored; or (2) where unmonitored inputs, e.g. labor effort, play an important

role in the production process, so that moral hazard precludes full insurance of

the project. For similar reasons, foreign equity participation in the invest-

ment projects may be unachievable.
                                      —34—



   In these cases, default can be important. Of course, defaults provide a

very imperfect mechanism for diversifying risk, since the retaliation which

follows a default is pareto inefficient (the debtor loses 2' while the credi-

tor welfare, by assumption, is unchanged). Recontracting in the event of

default may not be a viable option for restoring pareto efficient outcomes

moreover, especially if the creditor is unable to verify whether the investment

project in fact failed. Because of the inefficiency of default, the debtor

country will remain with substantial risks even under optimal contracts with

default allowances.

    From a regulatory perspective, then, the interesting question is how

E[U(C1 ,c2)] and the probability of default vary with the costs of default A.     Do

we perform a service to would-be borrowers by constraining their default option?

Does raising A necessarily reduce the probability of default? In general, there

is a welfare tradeoff in raising A:   credit ceilings rise, but so do the risks

of physical investment for the debtor. There may well exist an interior optimum

for A.   Interestingly, the probability of default is not necessarily a strictly

decreasing function of A.   This is because a rise in A tends to increase total

indebtedness, and thus the benefits of default as well as the costs.

    Now we turn to the historical evidence on defaults, where we shall see the

relevance of the preceeding theoretical analysis.

III. Defaults in Historical Perspective

    The concern over LDC debt is anything but new. The history of international

capital movements since at least the early 1gth century is characterized by

large scale borrowing of developing regions, and large scale defaults. Many of

the same debates over prudential standards, government guarantees of foreign

loans, rescheduling of debt, and so forth, have been pursued for 150 years. And

even   many of the actors have remained the same. A number of Latin American

countries that are still among the most problematic for foreign loans first

entered the London bond market upon independence in 1822—25, and defaulted soon

after, setting in train a hundred years of alternating solvency and default. It

is good to keep in mind, though, one actor whose perspective has changed: the

United States shifted from the world's greatest recipient of capital inflows in

the 1gth century to its greatest creditor in the next, and in the process has

been both perpetrator and victim of sovereign defaults.

    The striking comparison of pre—1930 and post—1945 international lending lies

not in scale or even sophistication, but in the changing "rules of the game." In

both periods, the experience is rich, tangled, and contradictory, and governing

rules have always involved inexact and evolving standards. Nonetheless certain

broad generalizations are possible. In the earlier period, defaults were a

recurrent   phenomenom, across countries and over time. Many countries defaulted

on debt as many as five times in the course of the nineteenth century. Defaults

were typically settled in negotiation with private bondholder committees, on

terms which rarely preserved more than a small fraction of the capital value of
                                    —36—



the original asset. After this partial repayment of debt, the debtor country

was typically free to resume borrowing on the international exchanges, subject

of course to high risk prernia on its debt. Contrary to the popular image of

British or American gunboats bearing down on delinquent debtors, true only in a

few such spectacular episodes, governments were usually very reserved in debtor—

creditor conflicts. The British government rarely allowed its foreign policy

goals to be dictated by the fortunes and misfortunes of British financiers.

Only in cases where private and foreign policy goals closely coincided, as in

mid—nineteenth century Egypt and Turkey, did Britain ride the debt situation for

larger political ends, ending up with no less than sovereignty in Egypt (1882)

for its efforts.

    The post—1945 period has thus far operated on a very different basis. At

least until the late 1960s, the great bulk of LDC debt (excluding foreign direct

investment) was in the form of official bilateral or multilateral loans, or

government—guaranteed suppliers credits, often on concessional terms. Thus,

debt problems directly involved creditor governments, rather than the private

market alone. rpically, debt service problems with official creditors have

been handled in negotiations between the debtor country and a multilateral nego-

tiating body of creditor governments, most often in the so—called Paris Club.

In this forum, creditor governments have often acceded to debt restructuring,

grace periods on loan amortizations, and lengthened maturities, but in strong

contrast to the earlier experience, have almost never allowed for an explicit

reduction in the principal owed or interest due.   Of course, some of the diff—
                                     —37—




erence with the earlier period is more apparent than real, for when interest

rates are already on a concessional basis, a lengthening of debt maturities

amounts to a reduction in the market value of liabilities.

    Since the re—emergence of large scale private lending, the private creditors

have even more strongly resisted the substitution of debt relief for debt

rescheduling. In nosense is private debt rescheduling merely a polite phrase

for default, as many observers have suggested. The essence of the reschedulings

has been the preservation of the capital value of outstanding debt. While in

the l9th century, a default settlement often included a conversion of the

defaulted bonds to new bonds (at par) with a reduced coupon rate, in the recent

period, the debt reschedulings have often included an increase in interest rates

on the outstanding debt, to compensate creditors for the greater risk of the

extended maturaties and the transactions costs of rescheduling. Moreover,

arrearages and delinquencies on debt payments are capitalized and added to the

liabilities of the debtor. Assuming that the rescheduled debt is not ultimately

defaulted, the private creditors apparently suffer only small if any capital

losses in the great bulk of debt reshedulings.

    To a great extent, the difference in pre-1945 and post—1945 experience is

the difference in non-cooperative and cooperative outcomes. There was no formal

mechanism available for a debtor country to commit itself to particular behavior

in return for a loan agreement. The only contract between debtors and

bondholders occurred after a default, in order to reach a settlement on the

outstanding claims. After World War II, the creditor clubs and ad-hoc commit-

tees of bank representatives have repreatedly negotiated with debtor countries
                                        -38-



on the verge of default. Moreover the IMF has played the role of arbiter, in

designing stabilization programs for the debtor country that provide the basis

for pareto—improving cooperative agreements with private and official creditors.

We should not suppose that the stabilization programs are therefore gladly

endorsed by the debtor country. The programs have indeed been economically and

politically painful ——   but   still less painful than outright defaults.

    In the following few pages, I pursue this contrast in historical experience,

focussing on some structural features, such as bond versus bank debt, official

versus private credit, and the role of the IMF, that might help to explain the

historical shift.

    (a)   Defaults before World War II: Causes and Remedies

    Table 6 presents a sampling of sovereign defaults until World War II, to

illustrate thier frequency and scope. That defaults were a noiirial and accepted

part of the financial system can be judged by two facts: (i) a default in one

country typically did little to interfere with the flow of' capital to other

LDCs; and (2) a default usually resulted, after several years, in a formal settle-

ment with bondholders that allowed renewed large—scale borrowing by the debtor.

Almost all of the publically—held liabilities of the borrowing countries in this

period were in the form of long—term publically—held bonds rather than bank

debt. The principal role of the great banking houses in developing-country

finance was in underwriting debt, and so defaults rarely had the direct effect

of bringing down a banking house. The Baring crisis of 1890 is the stunning

exception to the rule, which shows that underwriting itself can be a dangerous

business. When an 1888 loan for Argentina was cooly received in the bond

market, the Baring Brothers "felt obliged to lend to Argentina through accep-

tance credits. Falling raw material prices in 1890 made it impossible for the

Argentine government to meet these credits as they came due," and the great

banking house itself succumbed to bankruptcy. (See Kindleberger [1978]).

    An illustration —   in   the extreme —   of   the default cycle that characterized

many 19th century countries is provided by Winkler [1933] for the case of

Guatemala, which I reproduce in Table 7. Far from a permanent bar to flota-

tion of new debt issues, Guatemalan defaults were regularly renegotiated to per-

mit new borrowing. And though it may appear that bond—holders acted irra—

tionally   in continuing to hold Guatemalan debt, it must be stressed that these

assets carried an enormous risk premium, with yields—to—maturity often 500 basis

points above British government consols. Indeed, without a careful calculation

it is difficult to know whether the realized return on a century of Guatemalan

debt exceeded or fell short of the return on safe assets, even with the history

of repeated default.

    There is no simple set of factors that underlay most defaults in the early

period, with the history recording cases of flagrant economic mismanagement,

external shocks (e.g. terms—of—trade deterioration), war and war indemnities,

crop failures, and failed investment schemes, as proximate causes of default.

Kindleberger [1978] notes that the least successful loans were those undertaken

to maintain real consumption levels in the event of external shocks to income,

and that foreign borrowing to match a rise in domestic investment tended to fare

more favorably. He also adds, however, that "productive loans in the developing

countries are not very productive," so •that the distinction between government

consumption and investment expenditure is not as sharp as might be supposed.

    The classic case of "consumption loans" are debts to finance war

indemnities, as in the Davies and Young Loans to finance German reparations

after WWI. An indemnity requires a pure income transfer, which must be matched

by a decline in consumption relative to income. A loan may be undertaken to

smooth the required consumption decline over time. Effectively the loan is

financing a short—term decline in the national savings rate, on the presumption
                                     —44-



that the savings rate will rise later. But, as we shall see, a drop in the

national savings rate is a strong predictor of rising default probabilities.

Loans to finance military expenditure or to wage war have the same risky

character, and help to explain the widespread defaults during the 1820s of a

number of newly-independent Latin American countries.

    Borrowing to finance consumption or military expenditure is no guarantee of

default. Indeed, creditors must expect a high enough probability of debt

repayment that when coupled with the risk premium7 the expected rate of return

on the loan at least matches the return on safe assets. Exogenous shocks, at

least partially unanticipated, must precipitate the default decision, unless

creditors simply misjudge the debtor's intentions or economic position. The

triggering event is often external, such as a recession in the developed

countries that reduces export demand and the debtor's terms of trade. As

Madden, Nadler, and Sauvain [1937] (hereafter MNs) point out, "During the nine-

teenth century, every major downward swing of the business cycle caused the

failure of governments and other foreign borrowers to meet their external

obligations." (p.107) The links of business cycles and default hold clearly in

the 1830s, 1870s, and 1890s. Alternatively, an individual country may

experience a terms—of-trade shock, such as when the spread of artificial fer-

tilizers substantially reduced the price of Peruvian guano, thus contributing to

Peru's default in 1876.

    The most significant of all default episodes, in magnitude and in intellec-

tual and institutional legacy, occurred in 1931—32 in the depths of the Great

Depression. Its lessons are still relevant to us for several reasons.
                                          —45—



The defaults occurred at a time when much of the banking community and public

had become convinced that default risk was a thing of the past, and so it

is a good antidote to such facile thinking today. Just as in our defaultless

era, "Investors in foreign bonds had not suffered any losses for a long time; on

the contrary, they had repeatedly made sizable profits. This pleasant state

came to be regarded    as   normal; investors assumed that the world had entered a

period   of   permanent, defaultless prosperity."I     More importantly, the episode—

points up one of the potential sources of hazard in international capital

mobility: a speculative rush from foreign bonds with no international lender

of last resort or forum for debt rescheduling. To explore this episode, it is

useful first to survey the wreckage. On the New York bond market alone, some or

all of the obligations (including national, provincial, and municipal entities)

of no less than fifteen Latin American countries, thirteen European countries,

China and Canada were in default in 1935 (MNs, pp. 308—318).        Approximately 39

percent of the par value of all foreign bonds on the New York exchange were in

default at the end of that year (MNS, p. 123).        On all of the world's exchanges

defaults totalled about $22.4 billion at the beginning of 1934 (Winkler [1933],

p. xii). So much for America's first large—scale involvement as a major world

creditor!

    A major part of the default mechanism in 1931—32 is typical: the depression

in the developed countries sharply reduced the terms of trade of primary pro-

ducing regions, substantially raising the real value of the debt in terms of

national, incomes throughout. the    world.   As in earlier business cycles, defaults
                                      —46-



were to be expected, and certainly in greater magnitude in 1931—32 than earlier,
given the severity of the cycle.

    Moreover, the incentives to remain solvent also fell. Since the costs of

default include a squeeze on trade flows and an exclusion from foreign

borrowing, an exogenous reduction in trade or an inability to borrow even

without defaulting can lower the incentive to maintain debt servicing. Both

events seem to have occurred in 1930, about six months ppr to the onset of

widespread defaults. The declines in income in the U.S. and Europe had already

reduced agricultural prices in the primary production regions. On top of this

shock came rising trade protectionism in the U.S. and then elsewhere. The

Smoot—Rawley Tariff of June, 1930, provided another blow to the terms of trade

of the developing countries.     More importantly, the capital markets appear to

have   "shut down" to the developing countries after mid—i 930. While $________
billion of foreign debt was floated from January to June, 1930, there was not a
                                                                            The
single   foreign issue, outside of Canadian borrowing, from that date on.

foreign defaults, led by Bolivia, began six months later on January 1, 1931.

Bolivia was soon followed in sequence by Peru, Chile, Brazil, Colombia, and a

dozen other Latin American countries.

 The restriction on foreign borrowing is clearly related to a sharp rise in the

perceived risk of foreign loans. Risk spreads on foreign debt widened enor-

mously in the second half of 1930, as shown in Figure 1. Political violence in

Brazil was greeted by investors with panic concerning all Latin American issues,

and Latin American bond prices fell up to fifty percent in the course of a

single week (October 3-10, 1930), as shown by the following examples:

   Once the defaults began there was no return. The market environment during

1931 is vividly described in the Financial Chronice (January 16, 1932):

    Foreign obligations, both on behalf of governments and on behalf of cor-
    porations, were under taboo all through the year. The financial upheaval
    through which Europe was passing appeared to have put a complete embargo
    upon flotations of that description. This was long before the suspension of
    gold payments by Great Britain and several other countries in September. No
    foreign government issues of any kind were placed in the United States
    during 1931 with the exception of $50,422,000 of Canadian municipal issues,
    and these latter, too, became out of the question when the Canadian dollar
    suffered such heavy depreciation following the action of Great Britain in
    passing off the gold standard.

    Admittedly, it is very hard to judge whether the market reaction was a

rational response to a fait accompli of widespread default, or whether the panic

itself brought on the default. In markets with multiple equilibria and self—

fulfilling prophecy, a complete structural model is necessary to find out "what

might have been." But since the panic selling of all Latin American bonds seems

to have occurred in response to bad news concerning only one debtor, it appears

that imperfect information and a bandwagon effect played a vital role in the

default process. In either interpretation, the market fell into the no—loan cum
                                       —49-


default   box in the creditor—debitor game described in the introduction.

    The remedies to default were as varied as the causes in the period before

World War II. Most typically, the default was followed after a number of years

by a negotiated settlement between the defaulting government and a private

bondholders' committee. In more spectacular cases, military intervention was

occassionally threatened or pursued, as when Germany, Great Britain and Italy

blockaded Venezuela in 1902—03. Not only did the intervention succeed in

restoring debt service payments, but an arbitration in the Hague in 1904

awarded priority to the intervening countries over other claimants (including

the U.S., France, Holland, Belgium, and Spain) on the theory "that they had

incurred the expenses of an intervention which resulted in benefits to others

as well."    The rewards of a job well done! Ten to twenty years leater, the

U.S. was active militarily throughout the region in customs house seizures to

guarantee debt servicing. The most spectacular of all interventions resulted in

loss of sovereignty of the debtor country, as when France installed Maximillian

Mexican Emporer in 1861 after a joint military operation with Britain and Spain.

The British occupation of Egypt (1881—1907) followed joint attempts of Britain

and France to enforce Khedival debt obligations.

    Most authorities concur, however, that "It cannot be said that military

action in support of bondholders is now or ever was an important phase of inter-

national relations," (Borchard, p. 269).J'     Much more frequently, governments

of private creditors did not interfere in default claims, except to prevent

discrimination by the defaulting country in favor of creditors of another

country. Private bondholders committees carried the burden of negotiation with

the defaulting countries. Their main weapon was their power to enforce the
                                         -50-


exclusion   of new debt flotations on the national stock exchanges. More

occassionally, the bonds themselves carried explicit default provisions, e.g.

for arbitration or collateral.        Even more rarely, countries have acceded to

foreign control or supervision of customs receipts, etc. in addition to exclu-

sions of further borrowing.

    Given these coercive devices, defaults were almost always followed by nego-

tiation between creditors and debtors. A hallmark of such negotiations was an

evaluation   of the debtor' s "capacity to pay", in order to determine a degree of
debt forgiveness for the defaulting country (see Cizauskas [1978]).        Most   fre-


quently, existing debt was consolidated and extended, with a significant reduc-

tion in interest and principal due. Interest arrearages were often totally

forgiven in the new debt package. Dozens of examples of these settlements may

be found in Borchard, .       cit.,   p. 323—330. More novel types of settlements

also merit mention. The Peruvian debt from loans of 1869, 1870, and 1872, was

forgiven in return for franchises to the operation of railroad and steamboats in

Peru, and to certain rights in grain production. Bondholders were assigned pro—

rata share in a newly created Peruvian Corporation that took control of these

assets.

(b) The Debt Situ?&tion Since 1945: Reschedulings in Lieu of Default


   The period since World War II must be divided into an early and recent

phase. The legacy of the Great Depression defaults sharply restricted the

access of developing countries to the private capital markets until the late

1960s. Capital flows until that time were dominated by development loans of

multilateral agencies (usually concessional) and supplier credits typically

guaranteed by export—import agencies of the creditor countries. There was no

shortage of debt difficulties in this period, even with the far more limited

scope of loans. But there were also no defaults    Governments acting in ad hoc

multilateral creditor groups, alongside of the Ir4F, used both positive incen-

tives and threats to avert defaults, now viewed by the leading nations as a

major threat to world economic stability.

    From its inception in the early 1950s, the "creditor club" mechanism has

offered debtor countries the prospect of debt rescheduling and extended debt

maturities in exchange for commitments to a stabilization program to alleviate

the debt difficulties. As shown in Table 8, there have been 47 creditor

reschedulings, involving 16 countries, during 1946—1980. The stabilization

programs that underlie the reschedulings are almost always negotiated between

the debtor country and the IMF, and allow the debtor to draw loans for balance—

of—payments support at concessional rates (technically, the country borrows from

its "upper tranche' credits at the IMF, once a stabilization program is

approved.)

    Both as to the nature of credit relief and the form of the stabilization

program, there are consistent patterns that have emerged over time (see IMF
                                     —53—



[1980a, 1980b] for discussion). The agreements cover debt falling due within a

specified consolidation period (usually 1 or 2 years within the date of the

rescheduling), and most or all of that debt is rescheduled (or rolled over).

Typically the consolidation period includes three intervals: a period prior to

rescheduling for which debt payments are in arrears; a period in the future

during which debt is unconditionally rescheduled; and a follow—up period, for

which the debt will be rescheduled conditional on the successful completion of

an IMF stabilization program. Frequently, a grace period is allowed, in which

no interest or amortization is required. Interest arrearages are not forgiven,

though they too may be consolidated into new debt obligations. The interest

rate on restructured debt is generally left to be negotiated bilaterally between

the debtor and creditor countries.

    The IMF stabilization programs that underlie the debt rescheduling are simi-

larly systematic, and are far more controversial. As described by Guitian, for

example, the stabilization programs typically focus on three factors: a reduc-

tion in domestic credit creation, a cut in fiscal expenditure (in part to sup-

port the first objective), and a restoration of price incentives in controlled

sectors of the economy. The last plank has two purposes: to increase efficiency

of production generally, and to relieve claims on the budget in the form of sub-

sidies to commodities subject to controlled prices. This set of policy

prescriptions has been strongly attacked by many academic economists. We will

examine the efficacy of the programs likely in the final section of the paper.

    The list of official debt rescheduling records that many countries par-

ticipate repeatedly in the Paris Club process. This reflects the narrow con—
                                        —53—




solidation   period of rescheduled debt, and not any evidence that the earlier

stabilization programs have been unsuccessful. The consolidation period is kept

short at provide automatically for periodic review of the stabilization efforts.

   With the very sharp increase in private sector loans to the LDCs, a substan-

tially more complex environment has emerged. The vulnerability of private debt

depends importantly on public sector behavior, and vice versa, so that strategic

behavior of the debtor countries, the official creditors, the IMF, and the banks

all are interconnected in a complicated game. As one example of this, each

creditor is concerned that rescheduled debt not be used merely to pay off the

debts of other creditors. The Paris Club regularly requires that a debtor

country that reschedules debts to official creditors undertake to reschedule

debt to private creditors on comparable terms. The public creditors attempt to

prevent the debtor from using the Paris Club rescheduling merely to pay off its

private sector debt.

    The recent history of private capital market transactions shows clearly that

banks sacrifice little if anything in asset values in multilateral debt

rescheduling. The lesson of the Paris Club is even more decisively true for the

private banks: reschedulings are not defaults, in that they convey no debt

relief except with regard to maturity structure. With respect to outright debt

repudiation, North Korea provides the only case involving private credit

in the post—war period.

    While we do not have as much public information about private credit resche—

dulings as we do about the   Paris   club undertakings, recent experiences for

Jamaica, Nicaragua, Peru, Sudan, Turkey, and Zaire between 1975 and 1980 allow

some general points to be made. Most importantly, credit availability to the
                                      —54—




countries   fell when expansionary domestic policies and often external shocks led

to a significant fall in national saving rates. For most of these countries,

service payments fell into arrears before the rescheduling, and the private

renchedulings ere preceded by Paris Club negotiations. In the private

reschedulings, the debt restructuring itself provided for grace periods of about

three years and total maturities of five to seven years. Interest rates were at

spreads of 1 3/4 — 2 percentage points above LIBOR. Importantly, in most cases,

the implementation of the rescheduling was made contingent upon successful per-

formance under an IMP Stabilization plan.

    It is often asserted that banks are too reluctant to declare defaults, and

that they allow bad debts to accumulate in order to avoid a debt repudiation.

The combination of debt rescheduling and IMP stabilization program can in prin-

cipal allow the banks to walk the line between default and unchecked debt

accumulation. We will investigate in Section IV whether the programs have

indeed been successful in their assigned task.

    The IMP seems to provide a crucial ingredient in arrangeing a cooperative

settlement between creditors and debtors. It remains an open question whether

such agreements could be directly reached between the banks and country, without

the involvement of an outside institution. The answer seems to be "no," for

commercial bankers are very wary of undertaking the kind of bargaining and moni-

toring roles that are central to the IMP. The case of Peru in the mid—1970s

provides a case in point, for the banks and Peru tried unsuccessfully to mimic

an IMP program   without the IMF.   The experiment was a debacle, and eventually

 the IMF had to enter the scene.
                                 —55—



Cline [1981, Pp. 305—306] has described this case in some detail:

     In March 1976 the Bermudez government sought a large balance.-
     of—payments loan from major U.S. banks, without a prior IMF
     standby agreement. The government felt that agreeing to IMF
     conditions would be unacceptable politically, although in its
     discussion with the banks, the government proposed a program
     very much like that which might have secured IMF support.
     Partly out of fear of a more liftist coup if Bermudez lost
     power, the banks eventually agreed, but only after the regime
     demonstrated willingness to take unpopular stabilization
     measures...

     The program called for an initial $200 million in loans with
     a second $200 million to follow after several months, con-
     tingent on government adherence to the policy purchase.
     Signed only by the end of 1976, the package soon demonstrated
     the frailty of such direct intervention by banks; for reasons
     of data availability, technical capacity, and political sen-
     sitivity, it proved impossible for the banks to enforce their
     lending conditions, and adverse publicity for the interven-
     tion (plus its ineffectiveness) caused the leading banks to
     resolve that they would not become entangled in similar
     packages in the future but would rely on the IMF as the moni-
     toring authority.

IV.   Prospects   for LDC Debt in the 1980s

      In light of our theoretical and historical discussion, there are three prin-

cipal concerns that surround the current debt situation. First, is the threat

that Kindleberger [1977] raises that "the problem of developing—country debt today

is that the proceeds of loans of developing countries, and even of Britain,

France and Italy in the last 3l,years, have been used to finance consumption and

that the recycling has postponed default but cannot be continued indefinately."

(1977, p. 14). He argues that the "analor of [oil recycling] with reparations

recycling is exact," since both involve a fall in savings rates to avoid a

necessary fall in real consumption standards, and then reminds us of the fate of

reparations loans. In this gloomy view, we would predict in the coming years

either     explicit defaults or a steady accumulation of bad debt by banks, who

continue to loan out of fear of a default.

      A second potential concern lies on the opposite end: that the costs of

defaults are so large and the effectiveness of debt renchedulings and stabiliza-

tion programs so consistent, that many LDCs are forced to bear extraordinary,

and unwarranted risks in the development process. Should defaults or debt

relief be encouraged by policy authorities in some cases?

      Third, there is the risk that credit suppply to the LDCs might suddenly

shrink because of a bank failure, an isolated default, a coup, etc., with the

result of provoking a chain of further defaults and panic. Is the cooperative

mechanism strong enough to prevent a clamp—down on foreign loans?

      The concern over "consumption loans" to finance oil imports seems not to be
                                     —57—



warranted for the LDCs as a whole, during 1973-78.   While the timing of sharp

rises in LDC indebtedness certainly coresponds to the oil price hikes, there is

no logical corollary that the debt is therefore paying for oil imports. Indeed,

as I pointed out elsewhere (Sachs, 1981), the current account deficits for

non-OPEC, oil—exporting developing countries rose at least as much relative to

GD? as for oil—importing developing countries (Table 9)!   Indeed, the debt/GNP

ratio for middle—income oil-exporters (excluding Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Libya and

Kuwait) rose from 10.9 percent in 1970 to 24.5 percent in 1980, while it rose

from 10.2 percent to only 14.8 percent for the middle-income importers. The LDC

debt problem is not neatly explained by oil import dependence.

    One clue as to the LDC adjustment process is provided in Table 10, from the

World Bank. The oil—importing LDCs responded to the rise in fuel prices by

compressing non-oil imports as a percentage of GD? and expanding exports.

Incredibally, Brazil held the dollar value of merchandize imports flat for four

years after the oil price increase. In strong contrast to the Kindleberger

position, savings rates actually rose in the period. (If the inflation—

correction mentionned on p. 9 is used to adjust the savings data, savings rates

would rise even more strongly than in Table io.)

    The large deficits of the middle—income developing countries arose in this

period because very large increases in investment rates exceeded more moderate

increases in savings rates, and not because of a fall in savings rates per se.

In the aggregate for nine large LDC debtors, the savings-investment relations

were as follows (from Sachs, 1981, p. 235):

The investment boom, and a matching decline in the OECD, led to a hefty shift in

the locus of world investment, as shown in Table 11. This high rate of capital

formation helped to fuel the rapid growth of the middle—income LDCs throughout

the 1970s.

    Of course, it is not fortuitous that the big debtor countries maintained

high savings rates in this period. To a large extent, the high savings rates

permitted these countries to continue to borrow heavily on the international

market, for the reasons explored in the previous section. In many cases, with

Brazil the best known, large scale borrowing in fact followed upon significant

domestic financial reforms that raised home savings rates (domestic savings rose

from 21.1 during 1960-64, to 21.8 during 1965—69, to 23.8 during 1970—74, before

slipping back to 21.3 for 1975—77, following the oil shock). Mexico,

Phillipines, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand among the large nine borrowers,

had large increases in savings rates after the 1973 oil shock (comparing 1965—73

and 1974—79).         (See Sachs [1981], pp. 234—235.)

    The large debtor countries enjoy continued access to international loans

though many display high Debt/GNP or Debt/Exports ratios. Since they also have

high savings rates, the debt levels reflect high investment, and are therefore

not a prima facie matter of concern. More generally, a leading banker has

stated that developing countries "with good economic management are able to

borrows much in excess of any debt—service requirement," giving these countries

"strong incentives to pursue policies that maintain their creditworthiness with

private banks." Most rescheduiings can be traced to a combination of "bad luck"

(e.g. excessive government spending in light of the terms—of—trade shift), which

shows up as a fall in domestic savings.

    Some examples of investment and savings develoçnents for countries that

rescheduled public debt between 1975 and 1980 are found in Table 12.   In all cases,

there is some drop in savings rates after 1970—73, though it is apparently

slight for Turkey. In these cases, and in many other similar examples, the

extent of bank lending available to the debtor country fell sharply as the

savings rate deteriorated. A freeze on new lending, in line with the credit—

ceiling model described earlier, seems to take hold before the debt rescheduling

process begins. When new loans are unavailable to finance interest and amor-

tization payments, the country typically begins to accumulate arrearages, at

which point it signals its need for a debt rescheduling, and its willingness to

undertake a stabilization program.

    An important question for us ii whether the stabilization programs in fact

stabilize, or merely protect the banks from the onus of an explicit default.
                                       -63—



Very broadly speaking, the record is one of mixed, though substantial success in

moderating current account deficits, but often at significant political and eco-

nomic costs to the debtor.     Clear examples of success in recent years include

Chile and Peru, who have both restored high economic growth and declining exter-

nal indebtedness relative to GNP. Following its 1975 rescheduling, Chile's

Debt/GNP ratio fell from 59.6 percent (1975) to 37.2 percent (1979). Similarly,

Peru's fell from a high of 66.3   percent in the year of its rescheduling (1978)
to 58.0 percent in the next. And in both cases, real economic activity and

savings picked up one year after the rescheduling.

    More serious dilemmas exist for countries like Zaire and Sudan, for which

stabilization programs have imposed very significant costs on output and growth.

In Zaire, for example, real consumption levels and GNP have been declining

sharply and continuously since the first rescheduling in 1976. In 1979, the

Debt/GNP ratio was a whopping 51.8 percent, though the debt amounted to   a   mere

$3.8 billion. Continued stringent policies will undoubtedly reduce this debt,

though at further extreme hardship to the very poor country. In the pre—1930

arrangements, Zaire would have long ago defaulted. And if economic prospects

subsequently improved, it would have redeemed a fraction of the value of the

debt. Unluckily, Zaire provided the first case of rescheduling of the private

banks in the 1970s, and the stand that they took was consequently stern. The

IMP should create mechanisms in the future to allow for greater debt relief of

such   countries.
    I close the analysis by returning to an indirect risk in international
lending, that an event such as a default or bank failure might dramatically
shrink   the market for international loans. While the system of creditor clubs

and IMF oversight probably moderates this risk to some extent, there is no

guarantee that the FUnd could effectively keep private credit lines open in the

event of a major panic. Indeed, the ;market responses in 1974—75 to the

Herstatt and Franklin Iational Bank failures only reinforce the fears of a major

calamity emanating from the credit supply side. As a recent IMF report records,

        the bank failures had major consquences or interbank rela-
        tionships and international lending. Tiering of interbank
        deposit rates become considerably more pronounced and many
        small and medium—sized banks withdrew from the market,
        leaving more of the recycling up to those big banks which
        tended to receive deposits themselves. Japanese banks also
        retreated from the market because of prudential concerns,
        particularly on the funding side. Connected with these
        events was an adrupt hardening of lending terms and a decline
        in new credit commitments.

An important reason that this restraint did not have more serious consequences

is that the drop in real interest rates across the board in 1974—75 far exceeded

the rise in spreads on loans to the LDCs, so that overall credit terms improved

for those countries for which credit was available.

    Some steps were taken in 1974—75 to protect the capital markets from a chain

of bank failures, including the "1975 Concordat of the Cooke Committee" of the

Group of Ten (and Swiss) central banks, which vested primary responsibility for

the solvency of foreign bank branches with the home-country central bank..?-W A

second step was a tightening of central—bank supervision over the off—shore

portfolios of domestic banks. These are useful measures to prevent a breakdown

in confidence over the solvency of commercial banks in the international

market3. The nahility of medium—size banks to compete on the interbank market

in late 1975 is probably vitiated by the clarification and tightening of central

bank responsibility. But it seems much less likely that the steps taken in
                                    -66-



recent years would guarantee continued lending to LDCs in the event of an ini-

tial "shock" that starts with an LDC default or debt repudiation. To use the

old cliche regarding monetary policy, infusions of central bank reserves in such

a case might be like "pushing on a string," without guaranteeing continued loans

to the LDC.

V. In Lieu of a Conclusion

   This essay merely raises some of the issues involved in a complicated and

controversial topic. I have even ignored one major aspect of the risks of

international lending: the vulnerability of the international banking system to

a large default or debt moratorium. I have had to handle in a very cursory way

the strategic aspects of LDC negotiations with official and private creditors in

recent years. This is especially troubling since gaming behavior is at the core

of many of the risks to international debt today.

   The theoretical analysis stresses that the riskineses of debt (or the cre-

ditworthiness of a sovereign borrower) depends on (1) the overall savings and

investment behavior in the borrowing country; and (2) the institutional set—up

within which loans are extended. On the first point, a sharp rise in indebted-

ness that reflects high investment rates is far less risky than a comparable

increase in debt that is financing a drop in savings rates. For this reason,

country—risk indicators such as debt—GNP ratios or debt—service ratios can only

tell a partial story; the important criteria for creditworthiness must focus on

the reasons for rising indebtedness. On the second point, the IMF has a key

role in arranging package deals that commit sovereign borrowers to stabilization

programs in return for continued credit flows. When such arrangements cannot be

negotiated (as in Poland), the risks of default rise substantially.

   With regard to the recent borrowing experience, I have tried to suggest a

reason for optimism. One   must   focus on the   underlying   economic factors leading

to the high levels of borrowing in order to get a clear view of the dangers

therein. Both the ability to repay debt and the disincentives to default rise

to the extent that indebtedness reflects high levels of domestic investment

rather than low levels of savings. And    at     least for the major borrowing

countries, such a pattern is evident in the 1970s (unfortunately the data for

savings behavior after the second oil shock, in 1979—80, are not yet in).

According to the theoretical discussion, this co—occurance of high investment

rates and large lending to the LDCs is not merely fortuitous; rational creditors

will raise their exposure on sovereign debt in line with high savings and

investment rates of the borrower. In any event, there is no facile relationship

between oil—import dependence and deficits in recent years, which is a good

thing for the borrowers, creditors, and the international community as a whole.

     the maximum values of U(C1)+U(C2)/(i+ subject to various constraints. The

     solution for UC is subject to the same constraints as for UND, plus the

     added constraint D1 =   h(I1).   Since UC is subject to an added constraint,

     UC must be   UND.
