                                         ABSTRACT

This paper uses a numerical global general equilibrium model to simulate the possible effects of
US initiated trade protection measures on US manufacturing employment. The simulation results
show that US trade protection measures do not increase but will instead reduce manufacturing
employment, and US losses will further increase if trade partners take retaliatory measures. The
mechanism is that although the substitution effects between domestic and foreign goods have
positive impacts, the substitution effects between manufacturing and service sectors and the
retaliatory effects both have negative influences, therefore the whole effect is that the US will
lose manufacturing employment.

1. Introduction

    Protecting and promoting manufacturing employment is one of the most important

objectives of recent and prospective US trade protection measures. The logic often

claimed is that reduced imports by tariffs can protect targeted domestic sectors and

increase employment. But this is just the direct inference, and does not take into account

of other influencing mechanisms. There are three other factors influencing trade

protectionism effects on manufacturing employment. Firstly; substitution effects

between domestic and foreign goods, which determine how much foreign consumption

will be moved to domestic goods after tariff measures. Secondly; substitution effects

between manufacturing and service sectors, which determines how much

manufacturing consumption will be moved to service sectors. Finally; the retaliation

effect. The US tariff measures will undoubtedly encounter retaliation from other

countries, which may destroy positive effects of protection. Therefore, it is ambiguous

how the US trade protectionism would influence manufacturing employment and so the

US hope to increase manufacturing employment through trade protectionism may be

just be a wishful dream. Additionally, trade protection measures also have other

negative impacts; they prevent a country from reaping the benefits of specialization,

disrupt the movement of goods and services, and they lead to a misallocation of

resources. Also, consumers and producers often pay higher prices when tariffs are

implemented.


    There are several other papers which numerically explore the effects of the US

trade protectionism but none has manufacturing employment as its objective. Guo et al.

                                            3
(2018) uses a multi-sector, multi-country general equilibrium (GE) model with

intersectional linkages to forecast how exports, imports, output, and real wages would

change if Trump’s threat of 45% tariffs to China is carried out. Ciuriak and Xiao (2018)

introduce the GTAP general equilibrium model to quantify the impacts of the US

section 232 steel and aluminium tariffs to Canada. Bouet and Laborde (2017) use a

static multi-country and multi-sector Armington trade model to evaluate potential trade

wars between the US and emerging countries. But little research has been done on the

trade protection effects on manufacturing employment. Li et al. (2018) explores the

economic impacts of the possible China-US trade wars with a numerical GE simulation

methodology, and finds a negative influence to the US manufacturing employment.

Petersen et al. (2017) uses a numerical GE model to simulate the effects of the US

withdrawal from NAFTA, introducing a border adjustment tax and trade protection

measures to the rest of the world. Results show that tariff measures from the US will

hurt manufacturing employment. But this research are not focused on the

manufacturing employment effects.


    Additionally, there is a series of literature exploring reasons of the US

manufacturing employment decline. One stream of papers evaluates whether Chinese

exports can account for the decline of US manufacturing employment, including David

et al. (2013), Feenstra et al. (2017), Amiti et al (2017), etc. Another stream of papers

exploring relations of technological change and the falling US manufacturing

employment, including Harrison and McMillan (2011), Ebenstein et al. (2014),

Harrison and Fontagne (2017), and etc. These papers relate to the reasons for the US


                                           4
trade protection measures, but do not look at the influence of trade protection measures

on manufacturing employment.


    Based on these backgrounds, we build a multi-country and multi-sector GE model

with endogenous trade imbalance to numerically simulate the manufacturing

employment effects of the US trade wars with other countries, including China, the EU,

Canada and Mexico. The purpose of the research is to check whether the US trade

protection measures can increase manufacturing employment. Our simulation results

will have implications for US trade protectionism measures, and also improve

understanding of theoretical relations between trade protectionism and manufacturing

employment.


    This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the GE model, data and

parameter calibration. Section 3 reports the simulation results for different scenarios.

Section 4 gives sensitivity and robustness analysis results. Section 5 draws conclusions

and policy implications.

2. GE Model, Data and Parameters Calibration

    2.1 Model Structure


     We build a global general equilibrium model and add a monetary structure using

inside money following Whalley et al. (2011) to endogenously determine the trade

imbalance. In our global general equilibrium model with monetary structure, we allow

inter-commodity trade to co-exist within the period along with trade in debt in the form

of inside money. We use a single period model where either claim on future

consumption (money holding) or future consumption liabilities (money issuance) enter

the utility function as incremental future consumption from current period savings. This

is the formulation of inside money used by Patinkin (1971) and Archibald and Lipsey

(1960).


     We assume M                    {1, 2,          , m} countries for each produce N      {1, 2,   , n} goods

with T {1, 2,            , t} factors model framework. Production functions are CES

technology of each good in each country

where Qil is the output of the lth industry in the country i , Fisl is the factor s

conditions subject to the endowment constraints imply the factor input demand

equations.



                                                               6
     Consumption functions for each country is a nested CES utility function. We use

the Armington assumption of product heterogeneity across countries, and assume

claims on future consumption enter preferences and are traded between countries. Each

country can thus either issue or buy claims on future consumption using current period

income. The first utility level has N consumption goods and one inside money.


     For simplicity, we consume a two goods situation, which are manufacturing goods

and non-manufacturing goods, so the first level utility function is

                                                                                    )             Di 3 (Yi )        ]        ˈi   country (2)


Where X iNT denotes the consumption of non- manufacturing goods in the country i ,

country i , and Yi denotes the inside money for the country i . Additionally D i1 , D i 2

and D i 3 are share parameters and V i is the top level elasticity of substitution in

consumption.


     The composite of manufacturing goods is defined by the other consumption level

reflecting the country from which goods come. We assume that this level two composite

consumption is of CES form and represented as,

Where xijT is the consumption of manufacturing goods from the country                                                                     j in

country i . If i             j this denotes that this country consumes its domestically produced

tradable goods. E ij is the share parameter for country j ' s manufacturing goods

                                                                          7
consumed in the country i . V i ' is the elasticity of substitution in level two preferences

in the country i .


    We assume a representative consumer in the country i with income as I i . The

budget constraint for this consumer’s consumption is


     PiT X iT  pciNT X iNT  pciY Yi               Ii                                       (4)


     Here, Yi represents both inside money (debt) held by country i , and also country

i ' s trade imbalance. Yi ! 0 implies a trade surplus (or positive claims on future

consumption); Yi  0 implies a trade deficit or future consumption liabilities

(effectively money issuance), and Yi                         0 implies trade balance.


    For trade deficit countries, the utility will decrease in inside money since they are

the issuer. In order to capture this given that Yi  0 for these countries, we use an

upper bound Y 0 in the utility function in a term [ Y 0  Yi ] following Whalley et al.

(2011) and assume that Y 0 is large enough to ensure that Y 0  Yi ! 0 . We use the

transformation yi               Y 0  Yi to solve the optimization problem and yields

    Using the general equilibrium model above, we can calibrate it to a base case data

set and then simulate the potential effects.


     2.2 Data and Parameters Calibration


     We use 2016 as our base year in building a benchmark numerical general

equilibrium dataset for use in calibration and simulation. We include 29 countries in

our numerical model; Australia, Bahrain, Brazil, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, EU

(Europe Union), India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, New

Zealand, Oman, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Philippines, Qatar, Russian, Saudi Arabia,

Singapore, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, US (United States), Vietnam, and ROW

(rest of world). Production factors in our numerical models include capital (K) and

labour (L). We include only two goods in our model structures, which are

manufacturing goods and non- manufacturing goods.


     All countries’ factor input and production data are calculated from WDI of World

Bank database. We use agriculture and service share of GDP data and GDP data to yield


                                               10
production data of manufacturing goods and non-manufacturing goods and use

capital/GDP ratio to yield capital and labour input in production. We set the upper

bound ( Y 0 ) in our monetary structure to equal 1000 in all countries. We use world

values minus all individual countries to generate ROW values. For the two goods, we

assume secondary industry (manufacturing) reflects manufacturing goods, and primary

and tertiary industries (agriculture, extractive industries, and services) yield non-

manufacturing goods. For the two factor inputs, we use total labour income (wage) to

denote labour values for inputs by sector. We adjust some of the data values for mutual

consistency for calibration purposes.


     Trade data between each pair of countries are from the UN Comtrade database.

We use individual country total export and import values to indirectly yield exports to

and imports from the ROW. Using production and trade data, we can then calculate

each country’s consumption values. We obtain each country’s import tariff data from

the WTO Statistics Database. For ROW, we cannot obtain its import tariff directly, and

so we use world average tariff rate to denote its value.


     There are no available estimates of elasticities for individual countries on the

demand and production sides of the model. Many of the estimates of domestic and

import goods substitution elasticity are around two, so we set all these elasticities in our

model to two (Whalley and Wang, 2010). We change these elasticities later in sensitivity

analysis to check their influence on simulation results.


     With these data, we calibrate the model parameters. When used in model solution



                                            11
these will regenerate the benchmark data as an equilibrium for the model. Then, using

these parameters we can simulate the effects of the different scenarios we set in the

paper.

3. Simulation Results

     The US had already initiated tariff wars with China, the EU, Canada and Mexico

and we explore the effects of different country groups one by one to check whether the

US can gain from tariff protection on manufacturing employment. For each country

group scenario, we analyse both the US unilateral tariff wars and bilateral tariff wars

(tariff initiation and retaliation). For each type of tariff wars, we set three levels of tariffs

which are 30%, 45% and 60%. For the simulation results, we mainly pay attention to

the effects on the US, and also some tariff wars related countries of Canada, China, the

EU and Mexico. Additionally, employment effects on the whole world will be included

in our analysis either.


     3.1 Manufacturing Employment Effects of the US Tariff Wars with China


     The US-China tariff war simulation results show that the US will lose on

manufacturing employment in both unilateral and bilateral tariff wars. As the tariff level

increases, the US lose more on manufacturing employment. Meanwhile, negative

effects to the US are larger in bilateral tariff wars than in unilateral tariff wars. Therefore,

although import tariffs protected the US domestic manufacturing sectors and may

switch demands from foreign to domestic, the increased consumption price also

switched demand and production from manufacturing sectors to service sectors. Then

the whole effect is that the US manufacturing production and employment decrease.

Specifically, under the US unilateral tariff wars, US manufacturing employment with

the tariff rates of 30%, 45% and 60% are separately -1.329%, -1.786% and -2.152%.



                                               13
Under bilateral tariff wars, US manufacturing employments with the tariff rates of 30%,

45% and 60% are separately -2.639%, -3.326% and -3.809% (see Table 1).

    China as a country involved in a tariff war also suffers on manufacturing

employment because China has been hurt by the US tariff protection measures. With

the increase of the import tariff rate, the negative impact on China's manufacturing

employment is increasing. Compared with negative impacts to the US, China loses less.

Meanwhile, negative effects to China under bilateral tariff wars are stronger than under

unilateral tariff wars. Specifically, manufacturing employment effects under unilateral

tariff wars at tariff rates of 30%, 45% and 60% are separately -0.099%, -0.13% and -

0.152%; effects under bilateral tariff wars are separately -0.547%, -0.701% and -0.816%

(see Table 1).


    Manufacturing employment effects on other countries outside of the tariff wars are

all positive. As the import tariff rates increase, the positive effects increase.

Additionally, positive effects to other countries are larger under bilateral tariff wars.

World manufacturing employment will decrease under the US-China tariff wars,

negative effects are larger as tariff war rates increase and larger under bilateral tariff

wars. Specifically, under unilateral trade wars with tariff rates of 30%, 45% and 60%,

                                                     14
world manufacturing employment will separately decrease 0.235%, 0.325% and

0.399%; and under bilateral trade wars with tariff rates of 30%, 45% and 60%, world

manufacturing employment will separately decrease 0.521%, 0.668% and 0.773% (see

Table 1).


     3.2 Manufacturing Employment Effects of the US Tariff Wars with EU


    Under the US and EU tariff trade wars, all involved countries will lose, meaning

that the US cannot gain employment from trade protection measures. Comparatively,

the US will lose more manufacturing employment than the EU. The larger the tariff

rates both regions levy, the stronger the negative effects of manufacturing employment

to both. Negative effects under bilateral trade wars are more severe under unilateral

trade wars. Specifically, the US will receive negative effects of -1.338, -1.778% and -

2.122% under unilateral tariff wars of 30%, 45% and 60% rates, and receive negative

effects of -3.649%, -3.283% and -5.779%. The manufacturing employment effects to

the EU under unilateral 30%, 45% and 60% rates of tariff wars are separately -0.762%,

-1.024% and -1.233%, and under the bilateral tariff wars these effects are separately -

1.081%, -1.561% and -1.726% (see Table 2).

     Manufacturing employment effects to uninvolved countries are mostly positive,

except China under the US-EU bilateral tariff wars. China’s received negative effects

under bilateral tariff wars is determined by trade relations between countries, because

both the US and EU are China’s big trade partners. The US-EU tariff wars have negative

impacts on the world, and the effects are larger under bilateral trade wars. As the tariff

rates increase, the world manufacturing employment negative effects increase.


     3.3 Manufacturing Employment Effects of the US Tariff Wars with Canada


     If the US and Canada have tariff wars, both countries will lose on manufacturing

employment, and comparatively Canada loses much more than the US. As tariff rates

increase, the negative employment effects on both countries increase. Simulation

results prove that the US cannot gain manufacturing employment when having trade

wars with Canada. Specifically, under unilateral tariff wars with 30%, 45% and 60%

rates, the US manufacturing employment will lose -1.617%, -2.128% and -2.521%, and

Canada will lose -14.009%, -18.932% and -22.898%. Meanwhile, under bilateral tariff

wars with 30%, 45% and 60% rates, the US manufacturing employment will separately

lose -3.035%, -3.575% and -4.203%, and Canada will separately lose -23.078%, -

23.919% and -28.435% (see Table 3).


     Manufacturing employment effects to other countries outside of trade wars are

mostly positive except China under unilateral tariff wars and some lower tariff rate

bilateral tariff wars. The world as a whole will lose on manufacturing employment

under both unilateral and bilateral US-Canada tariff wars. Specifically, under unilateral

tariff wars with rates of 30%, 45% and 60%, the world manufacturing employment will

decrease separately -0.479%, -0.642% and -0.771%; and under bilateral tariff wars with

rates of 30%, 45% and 60%, the world will decrease separately -0.908%, -1.113% and

-1.315% (see Table 3).

     3.4 Manufacturing Employment Effects of the US Tariff Wars with Mexico


     Under the US-Mexico trade wars, both countries’ manufacturing employment will

decrease and comparatively Mexico’s relative decrease is much more than the US. As

import tariffs increase, both countries’ loss on manufacturing employment increases.

Meanwhile, both countries’ manufacturing employment will decrease more under

bilateral tariff wars than under unilateral tariff wars. Specifically, under unilateral tariff

wars with tariff rates of 30%, 45% and 60%, the US manufacturing employment will

decrease separately by -1.254%, -1.658% and -1.971%; and Mexico will decrease

separately by -11.394%, -15.474% and -18.79%. Under bilateral tariff wars with tariff

rates of 30%, 45% and 60%, the US manufacturing employment will decrease

separately by -2.099%, -2.75% and -3.245%; and Mexico will decrease separately by -

13.85%, -18.514% and -22.191% (see Table 4).




                                                     17
     Other countries outside of the US-Mexico tariff wars can mostly gain on

manufacturing employment, with the exception of China. China’s manufacturing

employment will decrease under trade wars between the US and Mexico. The whole

world’s manufacturing employment will decrease under both unilateral and bilateral

US-Mexico tariff wars. Specifically, the world’s manufacturing employment will

separately decrease by -0.353%, -0.475% and -0.573% under unilateral tariff wars with

tariff rates of 30%, 45% and 60%; and decrease by -0.617%, -0.815% and -0.968%

under bilateral tariff wars with tariff rates of 30%, 45% and 60% (see Table 4).

4. Sensitivity and Robustness Analysis

     We perform sensitivity analysis to preference elasticities, and robustness check

with trade cost wars and different model structure simulations.


     4.1 Sensitivity Analysis to Preference Elasticities


    Preference elasticities in our paper are randomly determined to equal two

according to some literature. We need to have a sensitivity analysis to preference

elasticities. We change preference elasticities to separately equal 1.5, 3.0 and 4.5 to

check the sensitivity of simulation results. As we have two different preference

elasticities in our utility function, which are elasticities of manufacturing and non-

manufacturing goods, and elasticities of domestic and foreign goods. Therefore, we

perform sensitivity analysis to both elasticities separately and simultaneously, totalling

three different situations.


    For simplicity, we only report sensitivity analysis results to the US-China bilateral

tariff war with 45% rate. Sensitivity analysis results are listed in Table 5. Columns 2-4

are sensitivity analysis to elasticity of manufacturing and non-manufacturing goods.

Columns 5-7 are sensitivity analysis to elasticities of domestic and foreign goods.

Columns 8-10 are sensitivity analysis to simultaneous change of both elasticities.

Results show that negative effects to both China and the US on manufacturing

employments increase as elasticity of manufacturing and non-manufacturing goods

increase, decrease as elasticity of domestic and foreign goods increase, and increase as

whole preference elasticities increase. Sensitivity analysis show that an elasticity


                                           19
change only influences effect intensity and does not influence effect direction.

        4.2 Robustness Check with Both Tariff and Non-tariff Wars


        Above analysis only analysed the manufacturing employment effects of trade wars,

and we further explore the effects of trade cost (both tariff and non-tariff) wars to check

the robustness of our simulation results.


       In order to analyse the trade cost war effects, we introduce trade costs into the

model. Trade costs include not only import tariffs but also other non-tariff barriers such

as transportation costs, language barriers and institutional barriers. We divide trade

costs into two parts in our model, import tariff and non-tariff trade costs. For non-tariff

trade costs, they are different from the import tariff: they cannot collect revenue, and

importers need to use actual resources to cover the costs involved. In the numerical

model, we assume that the resource costs involved in overcoming all other non-tariff

barriers are denominated in terms of domestic non-tradable goods. We incorporate this

resource feature through the use of non-tradable goods equal in value terms to the cost

of the barrier. We calculate trade costs following the approaches in Wong (2012) and

Novy (2013). Their method is to take the ratio of bilateral trade flows over local trade,


                                                                    20
scaled to some parameter values, and then use a measure that captures all barriers.


     Using the GE model with trade cost, we simulate the manufacturing employment

effects of trade cost wars. For simplicity, we only report the results of the US-China

trade cost wars. Simulation results show that negative effects of manufacturing

employment to both the US and China are stronger under trade cost wars and that

comparatively the US loss is larger than Chinas. All other results are the same as under

tariff wars. Specifically, negative effects of manufacturing employment to the US under

unilateral trade cost wars with import rates of 30%, 45% and 60% are -2.519%, -3.106%

and -3.493%; and under bilateral trade cost wars are -4.237%, -4.846% and -5.187%.

Negative effects of manufacturing employment to China under unilateral trade cost

wars with import rates of 30%, 45% and 60% are -0.154%, -0.186% and -0.207%; and

under bilateral trade cost wars are -1.014%, -1.195% and -1.303% (see Table 6).

Robustness checks with trade cost wars prove that the above simulation results are

reliable.

     4.3 Robustness Check with Different Model Structures


     We use a different model structure to check the robustness of our simulation results.


                                                                 21
We introduce another kind of endogenous trade imbalance model structure to do our

simulation. We follow Whalley and Wang (2010) to build the model structure. In

traditional models, money is neutral in the sense that once domestic money supplies are

specified, an equilibrium exchange rate is determined independently of the real side,

and a fixed exchange rate regime and trade imbalance does not occur. If the exchange

rate is fixed, then the relative domestic money stock needs to accommodate it so as to

support it as an equilibrium exchange rate. In the structure we use, the monetary regime

is non-accommodative to the fixed exchange rate; and in this case the trade surplus or

deficit will be endogenously determined by the equation


     Si   Ii  M i
                                                                              (17)

     Where Si is trade surplus for country i , I i is the total income of country i ,

M i is the money supply in country i . Once money supply in country i has been

fixed, then the trade imbalance for country i will be endogenously determined. Global

trade clearance determines that all of countries’ trade should be balanced, which is

     ¦S   i   0
      i                                                                       (18)

     We add these conditions in the global general equilibrium model yielding an

endogenous monetary trade imbalance GE model. Using this new model, we simulate

our analysis. For simplicity, we only report the results of the US-China tariff wars.

Simulation results reveal that manufacturing employments of both the US and China

will decrease, and comparatively the US decrease more than China. Simulation results

with this different model structure are close to above main results, which proves the


                                           22
robustness of our simulation results (see Table 7).

5. Conclusions and Remarks

    This paper uses a numerical 29-country global GE model with inside money to

endogenously determine trade imbalance, and simulate manufacturing employment

effects of the US initiated trade protection measures including both unilateral and

bilateral tariff measures. We set three levels of tariff rates to separately equal 30%, 45%

and 60%, and explore the US tariff wars with China, the EU, Canada and Mexico.


    Simulation results suggest that the US may not gain manufacturing employment by

taking trade protection measures against China, the EU, Canada and Mexico. Instead,

US manufacturing employment may decrease when taking trade protection measures

against its trade partner countries. As the US tariff rate increases, the manufacturing

employment losses of both countries in the trade war increase. The US’s manufacturing

employment losses are larger than partner countries in the US-China trade war and the

US-EU trade war, and are smaller than partner countries in the US-Canada trade war

and the US-Mexico trade war. Sensitivity analysis finds that both trade war involved

countries’ manufacturing employment loss increases as the preference elasticity of

manufacturing and non-manufacturing goods increases, decreases as the preference

elasticity of domestic and foreign goods increases, and increases as the whole

preference elasticity increases.


    Our research results suggest that the US manufacturing employment will decrease

if the US take trade protection measures to some trade partner countries including China,

the EU, Canada and Mexico. US manufacturing employment will further decrease if



                                            24
trade partner countries take retaliatory measures. This suggests that the US wanting to

save manufacturing employment through trade protection measures may be

unachievable.
