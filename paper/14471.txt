Mental Health Parity Legislation, Cost-Sharing and Substance Abuse Treatment Admissions

NBER Working Paper No. 14471
November 2008, Revised July 2009

                                              ABSTRACT

Treatment is highly cost-effective in reducing an individual’s substance abuse (SA) and associated
harms. However, data from Treatment Episodes (TEDS) indicate that per capita treatment admissions
substantially lagged behind increases in heavy drug use from 1992-2007. Only ten percent of individuals
with clinical SA disorders receive any treatment, and almost half who forgo treatment point to accessibility
and cost constraints as barriers to care. This study investigates the impact of state mental health and
SA parity legislation on treatment admission flows and cost-sharing. Fixed effects specifications indicate
that mandating comprehensive parity for mental health and SA disorders raises the probability that
a treatment admission is privately insured, lowering costs for the individual. Despite some crowd-out
of charity care for private insurance, mandates reduce the uninsured probability by a net 2.4 percentage
points. States mandating comprehensive parity also see an increase in total treatment admissions.
Thus, increasing cost-sharing and reducing financial barriers may aid the at-risk population in obtaining
adequate SA treatment. Supply constraints mute effect sizes, suggesting that demand-focused interventions
need to be complemented with policies supporting treatment providers. These results have implications
for the effectiveness of the 2008 Federal Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act in increasing
SA treatment admissions and promoting cost-sharing.

                                          1. INTRODUCTION

       Of the twenty million individuals with clinical alcohol or drug abuse disorders

(collectively known as substance abuse or SA disorders), only ten percent received treatment in

the past year, implying that nearly eighteen million went untreated (2007 National Survey of

Drug Use and Health - NSDUH). Among those who do not obtain treatment, nearly 50 % point

to cost constraints or lack of insurance coverage as impediments to care. Even amongst the

privately-insured, almost one out of four cite affordability or non-coverage issues.

       Mental illness or SA disorders are not treated at par with physical illness by public and

private insurers. The Mental Health Parity Act of 1996, effective from January 1, 1998,

addressed this coverage disparity by mandating that group health insurance coverage offered by

large employers (with over 50 employees) must cover mental illness equal to the lifetime and

annual caps for physical illnesses. This Act, however, did not apply to SA disorders and

chemical dependency nor did it fully address unequal coverage since insurers could still set

higher co-payments and deductibles with lower treatment limits for mental illnesses. Some of

the loopholes have been addressed by the recently enacted Mental Health Parity and Addiction

Equity Act of 2008, effective October 3, 2009. Applying to both mental health as well as SA

disorders, it mandates parity for all financial requirements (including deductibles, co-payments,

coinsurance, and out-of-pocket expenses), treatment limitations (including limits on the

frequency of treatment, number of visits, days of coverage, or other limits on treatment scope or

duration), and out-of-network benefits of group health plans. More importantly, with continued

availability of cost and non-group health plan exemptions, the new law, similar to the 1996

provisions, continues to apply only to policies with existing mental health benefits. Group plans

that do not already offer mental health coverage are not required to do so.
                                                                                                                  4

         To rectify these loopholes several states have legislated more generous provisions.

Whether improved access to treatment and reduction of out-of-pocket costs have had a positive

impact on the decision to seek treatment depends on how effective the laws have been in

facilitating significant cost-sharing and expanding access for individuals in need. This study

exploits the substantial state-level differences in both scope and timing of enactment of the parity

laws to analyze the impact of such mandates on flows into SA treatment admissions. We also

investigate the impact of these laws on cost-sharing by examining how they have affected the

probability that a treatment admission is covered by private insurance or is uninsured. With low

prevalence of SA treatment and reporting biases, population and household surveys do not

provide adequate sample sizes to facilitate rigorous analyses of state or locality-specific policy

factors. Spanning 1992 though 2007, this study employs administrative data on almost 26

million treatment admissions from the Treatment Episodes Data Set (TEDS), matched with each

state’s insurance policy. Fixed-effects specifications account and control for statistical and

policy endogeneity as well as unobservables potentially correlated with policies and treatment

admissions.

         If the comprehensive state mandates are found to be effective, then with only 12 states

currently offering full parity, there is considerable scope for policy interventions. The results

also have implications for the likely effects of the 2008 Parity Act on substance abuse treatment

admissions and insurance coverage.

                                                  2. BACKGROUND

         An extensive body of literature indicates the effectiveness of drug abuse treatment in

reducing drug use and associated harms including adverse health effects, crime, HIV infection,

and unemployment, relative to no treatment.1 For instance, in a large sample of opiate-dependent


1
 See, for instance, Reuter and Pollack (2006), Stewart et al. (2002), Institute of Medicine (2000), and Metzger
(1998).
                                                                                                            5

individuals in Philadelphia, 21 % of treated individuals tested positive for HIV after seven years

versus 51 % in a matched no-treatment group (McLellan et al., 2000). Furthermore, cost-benefit

studies have consistently shown that treatment imparts positive economic returns with benefits

far exceeding costs. Rajkumar and French (1997) conclude, for instance, that conservative

benefits of avoided criminal activity and intangible victimization costs alone outweigh even the

most expensive residential treatment programs. According to California’s Drug and Alcohol

Treatment Assessment, a dollar invested in substance abuse treatment yields a return of seven

dollars from reduced health care costs, crime, lost-productivity, and other prevented adverse

consequences (Delaney et al., 2000).

        Studies also show that drug abuse treatment may be cost-effective relative to other

alternatives. The cost of treatment (about $12,500 for residential and $3,100 for outpatient

treatment per person-year) is significantly less than the cost of incarceration (about $40,000 per

person-year) (Schneider Institute of Health Policy, 2001). Examination of state-level

expenditures on criminal justice and public health programs (Saffer et al. (2001), yield a cost

saving differential of 30% in the use of treatment relative to the use of enforcement and the

criminal justice system.2 Rydell et al. (1996) show the cost effectiveness of treatment of heavy

substance users over source country control, interdiction, or domestic enforcement.

        Despite this apparent consensus on the cost-effectiveness of drug abuse treatment, a

gradual reallocation of federal funding from demand to supply reduction has been taking place.

(Figure 1). The share of the federal drug control budget for law enforcement, interdiction, and

border control has steadily risen from 47 to 65 % from 1995 through 2009, contrasted to the




2
 Such comparative studies need cautious interpretation as the various approaches are not necessarily
alternatives. Treatment and criminal justice may be mutually reinforcing. For instance, enforcement
activities affect treatment decisions and treatment referrals sometimes originate in the criminal justice
system through drug courts or alternative sentencing.
                                                                                                                       6

decline in funding for treatment programs and treatment research over this period (35 % to 23

%). Prevention activities declined in share from 18 to 12 %.3

         Concurrently, treatment admissions have failed to keep up with recent increases in

substance abuse. Figure 2 documents the trends for population-adjusted (ages 15+) drug-related

hospital emergency department (ED) visits derived from the Drug Abuse Warning Network

(DAWN) and SA treatment admissions. Contrast the over 35% increase during 1992 through

2002 of total substance-related ED visits with the relatively flat trend in treatment admissions.4

Two thirds of all SA treatment admissions cite cocaine, heroin and marijuana as primary,

secondary, or tertiary substances of abuse. Figures 3 and 4 break down the separate trends.

While ED visits related to cocaine and heroin use increased over this same period by about 53 %,

related treatment admissions increased by less than six percent, with a recent downward trend.

         Treatment, however, represents a significant cost barrier for substance users. Mental

health and substance abuse parity legislation is aimed at overcoming discrimination against those

with mental illnesses as well as reducing out-of-pocket expenses towards treatment benefits.

Due to the high comorbidity between mental disorders and substance abuse, mental health parity

laws may have a positive externality on SA treatment. Saffer and Dave (2005) show that

individuals diagnosed with a mental illness in their lifetime are three times more likely to be

cocaine users relative to individuals with no mental illnesses. Two-stage models indicate a

Control Policy, Fiscal Year 2010 Budget Summary.

  Trends in drug-related ED visits are presented only until 2002 since a re-design of the DAWN sampling frame
makes data from 2003 onwards non-comparable to any of the prior years. Nevertheless, recent DAWN data also
suggest an increase in population-adjusted drug-related ED visits (by 5 % between 2004-2006). Part of the growth
in drug-related hospital ED visits may be due to an increase in the purity of illicit substances. The steady trend in
drug-related ED visits however does not perfectly mimic the trends in drug purity. For instance, the average purity
of powder cocaine reached a high in the early to mid-1980s, declined somewhat in the early 1990s, remained stable
for the rest of the decade, and has recently shown signs of rising again. Heroin purity increased dramatically from
the early 1980s until about 1993, and has remained relative stable since. In contrast, cocaine and heroin-related ED
visits have mostly exhibited a steady upward trend over the past 25 years. Some of the increase in ED admissions
may also be driven by inexperienced drug users, though generally all age groups share in the rising trend in drug-
related ED visits.
                                                                                                                      7

causal link from higher prevalence of mental illness to increased substance abuse. Any policy

that effectively reduces the cost of psychiatric treatment may therefore have a positive impact on

SA treatment.5

         Evidence on the effectiveness of mental health parity legislation, however, is mixed.

Studies have only considered the impact of such legislation on mental health services utilization

and not on outcomes related to SA treatment. Whereas McGuire and Montgomery (1982) and

Frank (1985) find an increased utilization of psychiatric services, recent studies offer mixed

evidence. A SAMHSA report studied the experience of two insurers (Blue Cross/Blue Shield -

BCBS and Kaiser/Community Health Plan) covering 80 % of Vermont’s privately insured

population, subsequent to the state’s parity law taking effect on January 1, 1998 (Hausman,

2003). Parity significantly increased the likelihood of insured individuals receiving mental

health treatment, on the order of 18 to 24 %; there was also a rise in outpatient visits per use.6

Using state level data, Klick and Markowitz (2006) conclude that mental health mandates are

ineffective in reducing suicide rates. Based on individual-level data from the Healthcare for

Communities survey, Pacula and Sturm (2000) find that such legislation has not significantly

increased utilization of mental health services, though they surmise that this may be due to

insurance displacement for high-risk individuals.

         Underscoring the limited scope of the 1996 federal law and its various exemptions,

several studies show the state mandates have had limited or no effect on employees. For

instance, Gruber (1994) shows that state mandates for certain health services including substance

5
  This characterization of the substance user as being responsive to incentives and variations in costs and benefits is
borne out in the literature. Studies have shown that drug consumption does respond negatively to monetary prices
and the probability of arrest (Grossman et al. 2002, Dave 2006). Saffer and Dave (2005) analyzed the demand for
addictive substances among individuals with mental disorders, a sub-population that may be most likely to abstain
from rational decision-making. However, their study further confirms that even mentally-ill individuals cut back on
their alcohol use, cigarette smoking, and cocaine use when monetary prices rise. Also see Becker, Grossman, and
Murphy (1991) for an analysis of the drug user as a rational, lifetime utility maximizing agent.
6
  However, costs of providing mental health and substance abuse treatment increased only from 2.3 % of spending
for all services to 2.47 % for BCBS. Other studies have also shown that a popular argument against enacting such
laws, namely an increase in health care costs, remains unfounded (Sturm et al., 1999).
                                                                                                    8

abuse and mental illness, by often being lower than existing benefits, have no impact on the

probability of coverage for an employee of a small firm. In fact, state mandates to cover alcohol

treatment may lower the probability that a small firm offers insurance. Consistent with this

explanation, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA 1999)

reported that almost half of all eligible employers were already compliant with the federal

Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 prior to becoming effective, and 68 % of the plans witnessed

no change in benefits.

       That evidence on the effects of insurance mandates on mental health services utilization

is mixed is not to say that substance abuse and mental health treatment do not respond to prices

or cost-sharing. Goodman et al. (1999) analyze an insurance claims database from self-insured

employers and find that, conditional on treatment, substance abuse and mental health treatment

respond to the price of care. Their results show that the magnitude of the price elasticity is

directly related to the co-insurance rate.

       Thus the answer to the still open question on the effect of mental health parity laws on

SA treatment admissions may hinge on whether the laws effectively expand access for

individuals in need and facilitate significant cost-sharing. We are not aware of any large-scale,

nationally-representative studies which have directly examined the link between mental health /

substance abuse parity legislation and flows into treatment admissions and payment source of the

admissions.

                                                3. DATA

3.1 Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS)

       The empirical work is based on substance abuse treatment admission flows derived from

the Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS). TEDS is an administrative data system designed to

collect information on the number and characteristics of treatment admissions into private and
                                                                                                                      9

public facilities receiving any public funding (including state agency funding and federal block

grants). Data are collected by substance abuse agencies during the treatment intake interview

with the client, and then forwarded to SAMHSA for processing. TEDS covers about 85 % of

total admissions to eligible providers, which represents about 67 % of the entire population of

treatment admissions to all known providers.7 Due to the difficulties in obtaining data, states

generally do not report information from purely private facilities that do not receive any state or

public funds.8 Thus, while TEDS is not expected to represent a random subset of the entire

population of treatment admissions, the population captured by TEDS is more likely to be low-

income and low-education and is also more likely to be confronted with accessibility and cost-

sharing issues relative to treatment admissions in purely private facilities.

         We employ data from 1992 to 2007 and restrict the analysis to clients who are 18 years of

age and older, resulting in 25,742,103 SA treatment admission records. For each admission,

primary, secondary, and tertiary substances of abuse are observed along with client

demographics, source of referral, prior history, insurance status, and payment source.9 In 2007,

alcohol was the most prevalent primary substance of abuse among admissions (42.2 %),

followed by heroin (14.6 %), cocaine (13.9 %) and marijuana (12 %).

         Table 1 presents the demographic composition of treatment admissions and drug use

between 1992 and 2007. Data for drug consumption are based on self-reported past year illicit

drug use and recoded illicit drug or alcohol abuse or dependence from the National Household

7
  About 58 % of all treatment facilities are privately-operated but non-profit, about 29 % are private for-profit, and
the remainder are operated by the state, local or federal government (National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment
Services, 2007). About 81 % of SA treatment admissions occur in TEDS-eligible facilities, with the remainder
occurring in purely private facilities.
8
  The scope of facilities included in TEDS is affected by state-level differences in licensure, certification, and
accreditation practices, and disbursement of public funds. For example, some state SA agencies regulate private
facilities and individual practitioners, while others do not. To account for any such state-level variations, all models
control for state fixed effects and a vector of state-level factors related to mental health, drug use, health care
spending, and public funding of SA treatment.
9
  Information on client insurance status and actual payment source, asked in 40 states over the sample period, is
available from the TEDS supplemental module. There are no systematic differences in admission characteristics
between these 40 states and the full sample.
                                                                                                                      10

Survey of Drug Abuse (NHSDA).10                Admissions are predominantly male and White with a

slight decline in the former between 1992 and 2007 suggestive of an increase in illicit drug use

among females. Despite a decrease in past year illicit drug use, treatment admissions amongst

Whites increased from 61.8 to 65.3 %. Blacks’ share of treatment admissions declined from 27.2

to 21.4 % coinciding with a small decrease in their past year usage. There is also a rise in

treatment admissions of young adults, older adults and those with high school degrees and above,

even as they have increased illicit drug use over this period.

         Among past year drug users, the vast majority (64-67 %) were privately insured.

Compare this to SA treatment admissions, in which only about 5.3 % of clients had private

health insurance in 2007, with this share having declined from 9.5 % in 1992. In contrast, the

share of admissions with public insurance (Medicaid or Medicare) increased from 19 to 27 %

possibly reflecting in part the expansions in general Medicaid eligibility that occurred in the

early to mid-1990s.

         Being privately insured does not necessarily mean that the client’s treatment services are

covered by insurance. In 2007, about 22 % of privately-insured individuals reported in the

NHSDA that they did not receive treatment due to affordability issues or because it was not

covered. Among privately insured clients in TEDS, 44 % paid mostly out-of-pocket

(presumably because their plans do not offer commensurate coverage of SA treatment services);

this share has almost doubled since 1992 (22.3 %). Private insurance covered treatment services

only 34 % of the time (down from 66 % in 1992). Thus, there are two noteworthy trends: first is

the decline in private insurance status among treatment admissions, and second is the decline in

coverage of treatment services conditional on insurance.11


10
   A redesigned sampling frame for the NHSDA in 2002 and 2003 makes earlier years non-comparable to periods
post-2002. Thus, prevalence rates are presented for 1992 and 2001.
11
   There has also been a slight decline in self-referrals and an increase in referrals from criminal justice sources. The
decline in self-referrals may be indicative of payment and cost constraints. Even though self-referrals declined, a
                                                                                                                     11

         There has also been a suggestive increase in supply constraints over the past 16 years.

Both the number of facilities offering SA treatment as well the number of admissions per capita

have remained relatively flat. The mean waiting period between request for service and actual

admission (or first provision of clinical service) increased from about 5.5 to 7 days. While the

majority of clients enter treatment with no waiting time, this share has also declined from its

peak of 73 % to 64 % over the past decade. These disparities suggest unequal propensity in

seeking and obtaining treatment, partly related to cost and supply constraints.

3.2 Data Linked to TEDS

         We matched the TEDS admission records to several additional variables based on year

and state where the admission took place. The supplementary data include information on

mental health parity laws, illicit drug-related arrests, suicide mortality, health care and Medicaid

spending, welfare reform legislation, and other state-level socio-economic conditions.

         Legislation regarding mental health parity laws is derived from the National Conference

of State Legislatures database on State Laws Mandating or Regulating Mental Health.12 Three

dichotomous indicators capture a state’s legislation status regarding mandating broad, limited, or

weak insurance parity for the treatment of mental health disorders. The first indicator of broad

parity relates to states which mandate comprehensive parity for the treatment of mental illnesses

with few or no exceptions. These states require insurers to provide, as for physical illness, the

same level of benefits for a broad range of mental health conditions, including substance abuse

disorders and chemical dependency. These benefits include inpatient and outpatient visit limits,

co-payments, deductibles, and annual and lifetime limits. The laws apply to group health plans

in all cases, and to most individual health plans. As of 2007, only twelve states had legislated



greater portion of self-referrals was insured in 2007 versus 1992 suggesting a significant selection relating to cost-
constraints and health coverage in terms of who seeks treatment.
12
   See http://www.ncsl.org/ and Rickert and Ro (2003)
                                                                                                                    12

such broad parity compared to no states in 1992.13 The second measure reflects states

mandating limited mental health benefits where parity only applies to certain groups (ex: those

with severe biologically-based mental illness or state and local employees). In addition, some of

these states only require employers to offer parity in one of their health plans (mandated

offering) or require parity only if the plan already offers any type of mental health service

(mandated if offered). Other states mandate a minimum benefit that is less than equal to that for

physical illnesses. In addition, parity laws in many of these states do not apply to substance

abuse disorders. In 2007, 36 states plus D.C. mandated such parity with exceptions, compared to

17 states in 1992. None of these states requires group health insurers to provide both mental

health as well as SA benefits with full parity. The third group, which comprises the reference

group in all specifications, includes states for which parity legislation is either non-existent or

fraught with exceptions; for those states that do have some legislation, parity does not extend to

substance abuse disorders or chemical dependency and also does not apply to group health plans

(which comprise the vast majority of the insured in the U.S.). In 1992, there were 33 states and

D.C. with non-existent or weak mental health parity (hereby denoted as weak parity). By 2007,

only 2 states remained (ID and WY). Figure 5 shows the progression of states from weak to

limited to broad parity over the sample period. We exploit this substantial variation in the scope

and timing of enactment of the state laws to identify their impact on treatment admission flows

and cost-sharing.

        To separate out the effect of insurance parity legislation from other shifts in state funding,

models control for block grants for state substance abuse treatment and prevention.14 Another

concurrent policy shift that occurred during the 1990s related to welfare reform. To account for

   These are funds appropriated by Congress for use by states, and account for about 40% of public funds spent on
prevention and treatment in the states.

welfare reform, we construct an indicator, based on the characterization in the 1997 report by

the Council of Economic Advisors (CEA, 1997; U.S. Department of Health and Human

Services, 1999), for the fraction of time period t that a given state had a waiver in place that

substantially altered the nature of its Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC)

program.15 We also define a similar indicator for whether a given state had implemented changes

to its welfare policies under Temporary Aid to Needy Families (TANF). Finally, in addition to

capturing the timing of welfare reform, we also include welfare caseloads in each state as a

proxy for the reform. Since the parity indicators are measured at the state level, additional

locality-specific socioeconomic and policy variables are included in models to capture time-

varying trends within states. Table 2 describes these measures and presents means for all

analysis variables for the sample period (1992-2007).

                                        4. ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK

        Since addictive substances are ultimately consumer goods, the analysis can be framed

within the context of consumer theory. The probability that a given substance user would seek

treatment is a function of the discounted net benefits of treatment. It would be cost-effective for

an individual to undergo SA treatment if lifetime benefits exceeded the lifetime costs. Cost-

sharing through insurance would lower the cost of seeking treatment and make treatment a more

attractive option for substance users, ceteris paribus. Thus, health insurance parity laws, by

mandating full mental health and SA parity, may expand the coverage of substance abuse

treatment and lower out-of-pocket costs to the individual.

        In studying the effects of state parity legislation on SA treatment admissions, we proceed

in two steps. First, we investigate whether the enactment of insurance parity increased the

number of treatment admissions in the state. While we estimate models for the total number of


15
  For instance, NJ implemented a major AFDC waiver on October 1, 1992. Thus, the indicator for AFDC waiver
for NJ takes on a value of 0.25 for 1992, reflecting the three months in that year that the waiver was in effect.
                                                                                                        14

SA treatment admissions as a baseline comparison, we mainly focus on treatment admissions

that are self or privately-referred (the latter also including referral through a health-care provider

or an employer) for two reasons.16 First, this focus is more consistent with consumer choice

framework which explicitly assumes that it is the consumer who makes the decision to seek

treatment based on cost-benefit calculus. Second, changes in insurance policy are a demand-

driven intervention and in general applicable to individuals on the margin of seeking treatment;

by affecting out-of-pocket payments for treatment services, parity legislation would presumably

impact an individual’s propensity to seek treatment. As a result of this rational choice, self-

referrals are likely to be most sensitive to insurance changes and will therefore capture an upper-

bound effect of insurance legislation on SA treatment admissions.

(1)        Tst = Est exp (λ0 + λ 1Lst + Zst Ω + υs + τt + ωst)

Equation (1) posits that the total number of SA treatment admissions for state s in year t is a

function of parity laws (L), a vector of state-varying characteristics such as economic conditions

and SA-related funding (Z), and a stochastic disturbance (ω). All specifications control for state

(υ) and year (τ) fixed effects, which account for unobserved time-invariant state heterogeneity

and overall trends. We estimate this specification using a Poisson regression model for two

reasons. First, the discrete nature of the outcome variable as a count of admissions makes the

Poisson probability distribution especially suitable. Second, the Poisson framework does not

suffer from the “incidental parameters” problem and can accommodate fixed effects well

(Cameron and Trivedi, 1998). Since the Poisson framework implicitly assumes that the mean of

each count (for state s and year t) is equal to its variance, we adjust all standard errors for over-

dispersion as described in Wooldridge (2001). Exposure for each unit is represented by Est,

which can be proxied by state population.17

         Estimates from equation (1) will inform on whether comprehensive SA treatment parity

increases flows into treatment facilities. Since such state legislation is hypothesized to work

through cost-sharing and coverage of SA and mental health treatment, we further investigate

whether the parity mandates affected the probability that a treatment admission is insured versus

uninsured.

(2)      Prob(Cist = 1) = Φ(β0 + β1Lst + Xist Γ + Zst Π + υs + τt + εist)

In the above specification, C represents a coverage indicator for whether the ith SA treatment

admission, in state s and year t, is privately-insured (and in alternative models, uninsured or

publicly insured). Equation (2) postulates that this insurance status is a function of state

regulations regarding mental health parity (L), a vector of admission-specific characteristics such

as the client’s demographic measures, type of admission, and service setting (X), a vector of

state-specific factors including the total number of treatment admissions, economic conditions,

and SA treatment funding (Z), and a stochastic admission-specific disturbance (ε). Unmeasured

time-invariant, state-specific characteristics (υ) and overall trends (τ) are accounted for by state

and year fixed effects, respectively. The key parameter of interest is β1, the marginal effect of

the state mandate on the insurance status of treatment admissions. Specification 2 is estimated

via probit regression with Φ denoting the standard normal distribution.18

         Specifications (1) and (2) are akin to a difference-in-differences (DD) framework. The

effect of policy is estimated by comparing changes in outcomes pre- and post-legislation for



17
   Specifying state population as the exposure constrains the coefficient of the natural log of population to one in the
Poisson framework. We estimate models by including log population as a covariate with its coefficient free-varying
since state population may also proxy for the other state differences. Results are robust to both specifications.
18
   Results are not sensitive to estimation via logit regression or linear probability models with heteroscedasticity
correction.

states that enacted parity laws over 1992-2007 relative to states that did not enact or change

their laws. This effect is identified only through within-state variation in parity laws over time.

                                                5. RESULTS

5.1 State Parity Legislation and Aggregate SA Treatment Admissions

        Table 3 presents estimates of the Poisson model specified in equation (1). The first

specification indicates that broad parity for mental health and SA treatment benefits significantly

affects total flows into SA treatment admissions. Specifically, states which enact broad parity

see a 12.8 % increase in total treatment admissions, relative to the reference group of states with

weak parity. Contrast this to a marginal 4.7% increase for states with limited (far less

comprehensive in scope and accompanied by various exclusions) parity legislation.

        Since self-referred individuals with SA are likely to be more motivated to seek treatment

if the services are covered under their health plans, relating parity legislation to the number of

total self-referred admissions in the state is likely to trace the possible role of cost sharing

through which parity legislation can impact treatment admissions. As hypothesized,

specification 2 shows that the marginal effect of broad parity legislation increases substantially

in magnitude, suggesting that such laws increase the number of self-referrals by 23.1 %. Limited

parity has no impact. Specification 3, which broadens individual-initiated treatment to include

admissions referred by a health-care provider or an employer, likewise indicates that broad parity

is associated with a 20.7 % increase in such admissions while limited parity shows no effect.

        Specification 4 considers SA treatment admissions referred through the criminal justice

system. Since these admissions are more likely to reflect coercion or mandatory diversion of

non-violent drug offenders into treatment, we would not expect insurance parity laws to have any

significant impact. The results reassuringly confirm this hypothesis. While these estimates are

insignificant, the non-zero magnitudes may pick up any residual effect of unobserved state-
                                                                                                                    17

varying factors. Thus, criminal-justice admissions may be utilized as a further control group

to purge the effect of unobservables from the estimated effects for self-referred or privately-

referred admissions. Table 3, which presents these as the difference-in-difference-in-differences

(DDD) estimates, suggest that broad mental health parity has increased self-referred and

privately-referred admissions between 11-14 %.19 The DDD estimates confirm that limited

parity laws have no significant effect on any measure of SA treatment admissions.20

         It should be noted that the reported effect magnitudes of the parity legislation are not

sizeable since they represent the impact of a 100 % increase in the probability of enacting broad

parity, which is about 3.3 times the observed standard deviation in these laws. Thus, a one

standard deviation increase in the probability of enacting broad parity would raise self-referred

admissions by about 4.2 %.21

5.2 Specification Checks

         The DDD estimates provide one way to purge the effects of unobservable time-variant

state factors. Additional specification checks, that directly control for confounding policy shifts

and state-specific socioeconomic measures and which account for policy endogeneity, are

presented in Table 3. Panel A presents models for self-referred admissions.




19
   The DDD estimate is constructed by subtracting the coefficient estimates on criminal justice referrals from
corresponding estimates on self and private referrals.
20
   With respect to the demographic covariates, self-referred (criminal justice-referred) SA treatment admissions are
quadratic in age, increasing up to age 39 (33) and declining subsequently. States with more self-referred treatment
admissions also tend to have higher admissions being female and educated, in contrast to criminal justice-referred
admissions which are more likely to be male and low-educated. Both increase with the prevalence of Blacks in total
state treatment admissions.
21
   Goodman et al. (1999) estimate an average out-patient treatment demand elasticity of approximately -0.43 and an
average inpatient treatment demand elasticity of -1.14 (evaluated at a 50% coinsurance rate), based on a claims
database. In their study 25 (50) % of the increased inpatient (outpatient) usage attributable to fractional coinsurance
comes from an increased number of users. In TEDS, about 40 % of admissions are inpatient care and the remainder
represents outpatient clients. Assuming a mean coinsurance rate for all health services of 20 %, broad mental health
parity would reduce an individual’s price of treatment by 80 %. Based on the mean price response from Goodman
et al., broad parity would increase the number of inpatient and outpatient treatment users by 19.4 %. Our estimates
(11.3 - 13.8 %) are plausible in that they about 60-70 % of the calibrated estimate. The conclusion offers some
reasons for the muted effects.
                                                                                                                     18

         A policy shift concurrent with the enactment of 1990s state parity legislation related to

welfare reform. Specification 1 controls for whether the state had implemented changes to its

welfare policies through major waivers to its AFDC program and through implementation of

TANF. In addition, the models control for the total number of welfare recipients in the state,

which declined considerably over this period partly due to the welfare reform and partly due to

economic conditions (Dave et al., 2008). The latter are captured by the contemporaneous and

one-year lags of the state unemployment rate and per capita personal income. Specification 1

also controls for state funding of substance abuse prevention and treatment through federal block

grants. The results remain relatively robust suggesting that broad parity increased self-referred

admissions by about 15 %, similar to the DDD effect of 14 %.

         As some state policies tie funding for special groups (for instance, criminal justice

population), capacity constraints may force crowding out of self-referred admissions. This

possibility is captured in specification 2, which controls for the total number of criminal justice-

referred admissions. Coefficient estimates (not reported) suggest a crowd-out elasticity of -0.12

to -0.26 for self- and privately-referred admissions. The effect magnitude of broad parity

legislations is not sensitive to accounting for such crowding out.22

         Another potential concern relates to policy endogeneity. States which enact

comprehensive mental health parity laws may be systematically different from the other states.

For instance, Sturm and Pacula (1999) show that states adopting strict parity laws had both lower

levels of mental health care utilization and supply constraints. This may explain why mental

health parity laws may not have significantly increased utilization in these states (Pacula and

Sturm, 2000). We check for systematic baseline differences between states that enact broad

parity legislation at some point over the sample period and states that do not, prior to enactment.

22
  This is partially due to the controls for state economic conditions and state welfare policies, which are correlated
with criminal-justice referrals. If state economic and welfare measures are excluded, then accounting for criminal
justice-referrals does reduce the effect of broad parity on treatment admissions.
                                                                                                    19

While Sturm and Pacula (1999) found that states which adopt stricter mental health parity laws

had low levels of mental health care utilization to begin with, we do not find any significant

differences between the adopters and the non-adopters with respect to SA treatment admissions

prior to the legislation. However, states which adopt broad parity do have somewhat lower health

care expenditures per capita (by about 12%) and slightly lower Medicaid expenditures per

enrollee (by about 6%), prior to enactment. There are no significant differences with respect to

Medicaid enrollment (adjusting for population), arrest rates for drug abuse violations, or suicide

mortality rates.

            Nevertheless, the decision to enact broad parity may be dependent on states’ prior

experience with health care spending, drug enforcement, admission trends, or other measures

correlated with treatment admissions. Thus, policy endogeneity results from unobserved time-

variant state factors that may be correlated with both parity laws and SA treatment admissions.

This is analogous to an omitted variables bias in an intertemporal context. Similar to the

approach followed by Gruber and Zinman (2001) and Dave (2008), specifications 3-5 attempt to

correct for this endogeneity by controlling for lagged measures potentially driving state parity

laws such as lagged SA treatment admissions (Specification 3), lagged state health care spending

per capita, Medicaid spending per enrollee, and Medicaid enrollment (Specification 4), and

finally, (Specification 5) lagged state suicide mortality (a proxy for mental illness) and lagged

state arrests related to drug possession and drug abuse violations (as proxies for state drug

policy). Specification 3 further controls for state-specific linear trends, which account for

unobserved state-specific factors that vary systematically over time. The estimates are relatively

robust and similar to the DDD estimate -- broad parity appears to increase self-referred

admissions by 9.6 to 15.9 percent.23


23
     In all models, the effect of limited parity laws is insignificant (not reported in Table 4).
                                                                                                                  20

         Specification 6 implements an additional check for policy endogeneity with lagged and

leading parity legislation, following Model (1993). In such specifications, only the coefficients

on the lagged policy measure should be significant. The lead effects should be insignificant with

coefficients close to zero. This would then suggest that changes in parity laws are driving

changes in treatment admissions. If the leading effects are significant, then this suggests that

parity laws are conditionally correlated with past shocks to treatment admissions, which would

be an indication of policy endogeneity.24 The point estimate of the lead broad parity law

coefficient is insignificant and relatively small in magnitude, suggesting that current treatment

admissions do not seem to be correlated with future parity laws. Furthermore, the lagged effects

are slightly larger than the contemporaneous effects estimated in specifications 3-5, suggesting a

small lagged response to policy in addition to the contemporaneous effect.

         Table 4 Panel B presents models for privately-referred admissions. The extended

specifications suggest that broad parity increased such admissions between 8.4 - 16.2 %,

enveloping the DDD estimate of 11.4 % (Table 3). Overall, the estimates from Table 4 suggest

that the results are robust to unobserved shocks and policy shifts possibly confounding the

relationship between parity laws and treatment admissions.

5.3 State Parity Legislation and Insurance Status of Individual Treatment Admissions

         The most likely channel through which parity mandates affect treatment is through

individual coverage, and to investigate this we next analyze whether the laws affected the

observed coverage of treatment admissions. Table 5 presents estimation of equation (2). The

first specification indicates that, relative to states that offer weak parity, states which mandate

broad parity have a higher probability (by 3.7 percentage points) that the treatment admission is




24
  Results are robust to alternate lag and lead structures. Results are also similar for models that control for
contemporaneous (in lieu of lagged) parity laws in these specifications.
                                                                                                    21

privately insured after enacting the law. There is no commensurate significant impact of

limited parity legislation.

        While parity legislation is likely to affect employed individuals or their spouses and

dependents who have some form of health insurance, public funding is likely to target more

vulnerable populations at risk of being on public support. Thus, crowd-out of private for public

coverage is not a significant concern. Nevertheless, the possibility remains that states may be

relying on parity legislation as a substitute for public funding or public coverage of mental health

and SA treatment. Specification 2 suggests that this is not the case; among states which enacted

broad parity, public insurance coverage of treatment admissions actually increased. The

combined increase in private and public coverage of SA admissions serves to reduce the

probability that an admission is uninsured by ten percentage points among states that enact broad

parity (specification 3).

        That broad mental health parity raises the probability of a publicly-insured admission is

suggestive of states increasing funding efforts to treat and prevent SA problems over the sample

period. This is supported by our finding that while limited parity has no impact on private

insurance, it is associated with a 2.5 percentage points increase in public insurance coverage

which is mirrored by a decrease of a similar magnitude in the probability of an uninsured

admission. SA funding through block grants was increasing at an average annual rate of about

five percent. General expansions in Medicaid eligibility were also under way, reflected in the

increase in the prevalence of public insurance among treatment clients (Table 1), and many states

started to include drug treatment coverage under welfare reform or mandatory diversion

programs. To the extent that these policies also coincided with the enactment of parity

legislation, the estimate of the net effect of broad parity on uninsured admissions would be

biased upwards (in absolute magnitude). Specifications 4-6 correct for this confounding by
                                                                                                               22

adding in a vector of state funding-related covariates, including the SA treatment block grant

and the percent of treatment admissions in the state covered by Medicaid and covered under

other government payments. It is reassuring that, in specification 5, broad or limited parity

legislation no longer has any effect on the probability that the admission is publicly insured.

Parity legislation should most plausibly affect private insurance coverage. Specifications 4 and 6

indeed suggest that broad SA parity raises the probability that an admission is privately insured

and lowers the probability that an admission is uninsured by about 3.5 to 3.9 percentage points.

There is no effect of limited parity on insurance coverage of treatment admissions. The next two

models control for a rich set of client-specific covariates including indicators for employment,

marital status, and substances of abuse and also control for lagged measures of drug enforcement

and suicide mortality in the state. The magnitude of the effects remains robust.

        This decline in the uninsured propensity, however, may not represent a net benefit or

financial incentive to the individual if the increase in privately insured admissions (reduction in

uninsured) is crowding out no-charge admissions. Parity laws would impart a financial incentive

to seek treatment only through significant cost-sharing. However, a significant portion (49 %

over the sample period) of admissions which are uninsured is not charged payments or falls

under charity care. About 40 percent of the uninsured clients pay fully out-of-pocket. The 3.5 to

3.9 percentage-points reduction in the probability of uninsured is roughly divided 40-60 between

a decline in no-charge and a decline in self-pay admission probabilities.25 That is, while

comprehensive insurance mandates appear to reduced uninsured admissions, about 40 % of the

reduction would have received charity care through the facilities anyway. The remainder of the

reduction in uninsured is matched by a decrease in admissions where the individual was fully

responsible for payment (self-pay). Thus, the net effect of broad parity on the probability that a

25
  Results (not reported in the tables) are based on models for dichotomous indicators showing whether the
admission was self-pay and no-charge. Reduced sample sizes for detailed payment sources make these estimates
more imprecise (p-values between 0.10 and 0.20).
                                                                                                                   23

formerly self-paying admission is now covered by private insurance is about 2.1 to 2.4

percentage points. This is the relevant impact to consider since it represents a pure financial

incentive for individuals to seek treatment who otherwise may find it inaccessible due to out-of-

pocket costs. Evaluated at the sample prevalence of uninsured clients, this translates into an

effect size of about 3 - 4 %. The low magnitudes are consistent with the estimates from the

aggregate models in Table 3.26

5.4 Impact of Mandated-if-Offered Parity Legislation

         All specifications thus far have indicated nil effects of limited parity legislation. Limited

parity states generally have a hodgepodge of laws with various exceptions and none requires

group plans to provide both mental health and SA treatment benefits at full parity. In order to

investigate whether some of these limited laws may be more effective than others, of the limited

parity states, we separate out those that have enacted “mandated if offered” laws. These states

require that mental health overage be equal to other medical conditions only if the plan offers

mental health coverage.27 The recently enacted 2008 federal law can be classified as “mandated

if offered” since it mandates parity only if the plans offer mental health coverage; it does not

require plans to provide mental health or SA benefits if they do not already do so. The

remaining limited parity states require employers to offer parity in only one of their health plans

(mandated offering) or mandate minimum mental health coverage that is not required to be equal


26
   The effects of the other demographic characteristics mimic the general composition of the population that is likely
to have private health insurance (relative to public insurance or no insurance) -- white, male, and educated. There is
a quadratic effect of age as private insurance propensity decreases up to age 32 and then rises subsequently. All
models also include indicators for type of treatment into which the client was admitted. Almost half of all SA
treatment admissions occur on an ambulatory non-intensive outpatient basis (reference category). Relative to these
admissions, those which involve 24-hour detoxification services in non-hospital settings and those which involve
long-term (more than 30 days) non-acute care are more likely to be uninsured. All other service setting types are
less likely to be uninsured.
27
   States with mandated-if-offered parity laws, as of 2007, are AZ, FL, IA, KY, LA, and NE. In alternate
specifications (results available upon request), we also separate out other forms of limited parity (mandated benefits
and mandated offering). We do not find significant effects of these other forms of limited parity, though large
standard errors owing to a smaller number of states in disaggregated categories calls for some caution in interpreting
the insignificant results.
                                                                                                    24

to other medical conditions (minimum mandated benefit). In specifications 1 and 2, we do not

find statistically significant effects of mandated-if-offered laws or other limited parity legislation

on self-referred and privately-referred SA treatment admissions, relative to weak parity states.

This is not surprising given that the laws also do not appear to have imparted substantial cost-

sharing; there is no effect on the coverage of treatment admissions and no significant reduction

in the probability that the admission is uninsured (specification 3).

                                            6. CONCLUSIONS

       The consensus in the prior literature indicates that substance abuse treatment is both

efficacious and cost-effective relative to other drug-control alternatives. Furthermore, the gap

between heavy drug use and treatment admissions appears to have widened over the last decade.

Thus, from a policy standpoint, it is integral to analyze the economic factors that impact flows

into substance abuse treatment.

       In addition to supply constraints, a significant portion of substance abusers cite cost and

accessibility issues as a primary reason for forgoing treatment. For instance, among privately

insured individuals in 2007, treatment services were primarily paid out-of-pocket almost half the

time; private insurance was the primary source of payment in only about 33 % of the cases.

The importance of cost-sharing is highlighted by the analysis of state insurance parity legislation,

the results of which indicate that laws which mandate broad parity for SA and mental health

treatment are associated with an increase in the total number of self-referred treatment

admissions. Such legislation also raises the probability that the admission is privately insured

and conversely, decreases the probability that the admission is uninsured. Though there does not

appear to be any crowding-out with respect to public insurance support, this is not the case with

regard to charity care and non-payment where some crowd-out does exist. Nevertheless, there is

a net two to three percentage point reduction in the probability of uninsured self-payer treatment
                                                                                                    25

admissions. These effects are confined to states which support broad and comprehensive

parity while states with limited parity do not display any positive impact on the number of

treatment admissions or cost-sharing.

       Several underlying factors may be attenuating the effect magnitudes of broad parity.

First, parity legislation applies only to health insurance already offered and will most likely

affect individuals who have some form of non-public coverage. Data from the NSDUH indicate

that about 60 % of the drug- and alcohol-abusing population has private health insurance

compared to 71 % of individuals who do not have such disorders. This may limit the scope of

effectiveness of parity mandates by relating to substance abusers with access to non-public

coverage in the first place. Second, even if broad parity is found to have an effect on treatment

admissions, policy endogeneity may imply that the estimated effect is understated if states with

low levels of treatment admissions are more likely to adopt stricter parity laws. While the

specification checks we implemented suggest that the results are not materially affected when

addressing this concern, the possibility is not fully discounted. Third, perhaps more relevant for

this analysis, the limited effect sizes may also reflect supply and capacity constraints. Even if

parity legislation induces demand for treatment by reducing costs among covered individuals,

there may be some offset as the number of facilities have remained relatively constant over the

past decade and waiting times have trended upwards. This relatively inelastic supply of

treatment, together with the two other factors mentioned, suggest that our estimates of the effects

of parity on treatment admissions and coverage incentives may be on the conservative side.

       Currently, only 12 states mandate that group insurers provide for mental health and SA

treatment benefits, and that they do so on equal terms with other benefits, with minimal

exceptions. These states’ existing laws are, in fact, more protective than the Mental Health

Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008, leaving significant potential to reduce chronic
                                                                                                       26

substance abuse through more states adopting stronger parity laws. Though the 2008 Act does

require mental health and SA parity with respect to financial requirements and treatment

benefits, this applies only to plans that already include mental health coverage in their benefits

package. Similar to the 1996 Mental Health Parity Act, the 2008 law not only does not require

group plans to include mental health or SA coverage in their benefits, it also allows for cost

exemptions. Six states have already enacted “mandated if offered” laws similar to the 2008

Federal law and an additional 15 states require plans to offer minimum mental health coverage

(though not necessarily on equal terms as other conditions). Thus, with two-thirds of the nation

already mandating parity at a level that is at least as protective as the 2008 federal law, there is

perhaps little room for a strong aggregate effect. Furthermore, extrapolating from the estimated

effects of limited mental health parity legislation and specifically, from the insignificant effects

of the state mandated-if-offered laws, it is unlikely that for the remaining states for whom the

2008 law will be more protective, the federal law will have a significant impact on either cost-

sharing of SA treatment admissions, or reduction of out-of-pocket payments for individuals

needing treatment, or increase in treatment admission flows.

       Since parity legislation may not help to defray costs for all, policy interventions which

subsidize treatment among uninsured users also has the potential to significantly provide

treatment to those who need it but cite cost constraints as an impediment. Such demand-focused

interventions by themselves, however, are likely to have muted effects unless paired with

policies which improve treatment supply and ease capacity constraints.

  Dependent variable represents a count of the number of SA treatment admissions, aggregated for each state and year.
Coefficient estimates from fixed effects Poisson regression models are presented. Standard errors are adjusted for over-
dispersion and reported in parentheses. DDD estimate is obtained by subtracting the coefficient estimate on Criminal Justice
Referrals reported in model 4, and standard errors for the differenced estimates are presented in brackets. Models for self-
referred, privately-referred, and criminal-justice referred admissions also control for total SA treatment admissions. Statistical
significance is denoted as follows: *** p≤0.01, ** 0.01<p≤0.05, * 0.05<p≤0.10. Pseudo R-squared represents one minus the
ratio of the log-likelihoods for the full model versus the intercept-only model.

  Dependent variable represents a dichotomous indicator of whether a substance abuse treatment admission is privately insured, publicly insured, or uninsured. Marginal effects
from probit models are presented. Standard errors are adjusted for arbitrary correlation within state-year cells and reported in parentheses. Significance is denoted as follows: ***
p≤0.01, ** 0.01<p≤0.05, * 0.05<p≤0.10. Pseudo R-squared (representing one minus the ratio of the log-likelihoods for the full model versus the intercept-only model) and Percent
Correctly Predicted (based on the predicted probability relative to a cutoff of the sample mean) are presented as goodness-of-fit measures.

  Vector includes seven indicators for service provider type: 24 hour detox services in hospital and non-hospital settings, 24 hour non-detox medical care in hospital setting, short-
term (30 days or less) non-acute care, long-term (more than 30 days) non-acute care, ambulatory intensive outpatient, and ambulatory detoxification). Reference group is
ambulatory non-intensive outpatient.
3
  Vector includes total number of substance abuse treatment admissions in the state, state-level personal income per capita, state unemployment rate, and log state population.
4
  Vector includes state substance abuse treatment block grant, percent of treatment admissions in state covered by Medicaid, and percent of treatment admissions in state covered
by state funds including public insurance and other state payments to SA facilities.
5
  Vector includes indicators for number of substances of abuse, and indicators for whether alcohol, cocaine, heroin, and marijuana were cited as the primary, secondary, or tertiary
substances of abuse.
6
  Vector includes one and two-year lags of state suicide deaths, state-level arrests from any drug abuse violation, and state-level arrests for illicit drug possession.

  Sample is limited to states and years which have not enacted broad mental health parity legislation. Reference category is weak
parity. For Poisson models, dependent variable represents a count of the number of SA treatment admissions, aggregated for
each state and year. Models control for basic covariates listed in Table 2, state covariates, and vector of lagged suicide mortality
and drug arrests. For probit models, dependent variable represents a dichotomous indicator of whether a substance abuse
treatment admission is privately insured or uninsured. Marginal effects are presented. See notes to Table 5. Model controls for
basic covariates listed in Table 5, state covariates, service setting, admission characteristics, and vector of lagged suicide
mortality and drug arrests.
