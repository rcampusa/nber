Preparing to Export

                                              ABSTRACT

Exporters differ considerably in terms of export-market participation over time and employment size.
But this marked diversity among exporters is not reflected in their workforce composition regarding
commonly observed worker skills or occupations. Using Brazilian linked employer-employee data,
we turn to a typically unknown worker characteristic: a worker's prior experience at other exporters.
We show that expected export status, predicted with current destination-country trade instruments,
leads firms to prepare their workforce by hiring workers from other exporters. Hiring away exporter
workers is associated with both a wider subsequent reach of destinations and a deeper market penetration
at the poaching firm, but only with reduced market penetration at the firm losing the worker. This
evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that expected export-market access exerts a labor demand
shock, for which exporters actively prepare with selective hiring, and with the idea that a few key workers
affect a firm's competitive advantage.

1 Introduction
A large body of empirical evidence and recent trade theory suggest that exporters substantively differ
from non-exporters regarding size, productivity and workforce composition.1 To learn more about
export success, this paper compares Brazilian exporters among themselves regarding export dynamics
and workforce characteristics. We document that firms actively prepare for expected exporting by
hiring a few key workers from other exporters, and we provide evidence that hiring exporter workers
is a strong predictor of various aspects of export-market success at the poaching firm.
       There is considerable heterogeneity in performance and sizes among exporters. When we rank
Brazilian exporters by their export-market participation over three consecutive years, this performance
ranking is almost perfectly mirrored in a monotonic size ranking from about 80 workers at “marginal”
in-out switching exporters to 550 workers at “successful” exporters with a sustained OECD-market
presence. Surprisingly, the substantive heterogeneity in export participation and size is not reflected
in observable worker characteristics. The workforce composition regarding skills and occupations is
similar among otherwise diverse exporters and in some cases statistically indistinguishable. Compa-
rable to our evidence for Brazil, Bernard and Jensen (1997, 1999), Trefler (2004) and Harrigan and
Reshef (2011) also find negligible differences in educational composition among U.S., Canadian and
Chilean exporters in the cross section.2 This leads us to hypothesize that typically unobserved worker
characteristics can be important determinants of export-market performance.
       We use comprehensive linked employer-employee data for the universe of formal Brazilian man-
ufacturing firms and their export behavior between 1990-2001 to extract an otherwise unobserved
worker characteristic: a worker’s prior experience at other exporting firms. We define hires from ex-
porters as the head count of hired workers whose immediately preceding formal employment was at
   1
      The literature following Bernard and Jensen (1995) documents exporter premia for many countries (see for example
Bernard and Wagner 1997, Isgut 2001, Álvarez and López 2005). Exporter wage premia persist after controlling for
unobserved worker and spell effects in linked employer-employee data (for example Schank, Schnabel and Wagner 2007,
Krishna, Poole and Senses 2011).
    2
      Results for exporter responses to large-scale trade shocks are more mixed. Trefler (2004) detects no response of the
educational workforce composition at Canadian exporters under the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement, whereas Bustos
(2011) finds that Argentine firms employ more educated workers when M ERCOSUR reduces import duties in Argentina’s
neighboring export markets. Results are also mixed for major exchange rate shocks. Verhoogen (2008) argues that
Mexican exporters upgraded workforce skills as reflected in wages around the Peso devaluation in 1995, whereas Frı́as,
Kaplan and Verhoogen (2009) favor the interpretation that increases in wage premia at Mexican exporters after the Peso
devaluation are largely shared rents not associated with skill upgrading. Brambilla, Lederman and Porto (2012) find that
the workforce skill composition at Argentine exporters responded to the revaluation of the Peso against the Brazilian Real
in 1999 only among the exporters that ship to high-income countries. Those studies rely on large-scale macroeconomic
shocks for identification, whereas our instrumentation method also isolates exporter responses during tranquil times.

an exporter. We propose that expected favorable export conditions in the future, predicted by current
product market conditions abroad, exert a labor demand shock that leads firms to prepare workforces.
To provide evidence on the hypothesis, we implement a new identification strategy for export prepara-
tions in economically stable times: we use current sector-level imports into destinations outside Latin
America from source countries other than Brazil as instruments to predict a Brazilian firm’s future
export status. Our panel data allow us to simultaneously condition on a rich set of worker and firm
characteristics, including a firm’s overall employment change, as well as firm, sector and year effects,
domestic sector-level absorption and sector-year trends. A firm’s instrumented future export status in
turn predicts significantly more hires of former exporter workers in the current year.
   Firms in Brazilian regions with many exporters, large firms, and firms with lasting export-market
participation react most responsively in hiring away other exporters’ workers. The poached workers
share in the current employer’s wage premium. A corollary of our hypothesis is that firms for which
foreign product market conditions predicted a high probability of export-market participation but
which subsequently fail to become exporters should let go again the recently poached hires from
exporters. Our results show that unexpectedly unsuccessful exporters indeed separate again from
most of their recently hired former exporter workers.
   Former-exporter hires predict both a wider reach of destinations at the extensive margin and a
deeper export-market penetration at the intensive margin. These effects are strongest when there
is an overlap of export destinations between the former and the current employer. Poaching exporter
workers in marketing-related occupations predicts a wider destination reach, whereas poaching skilled
production workers predicts a deeper market penetration. These findings are consistent with the idea
that exporters actively build up workforce expertise for expected export-market access. Results also
suggest that worker mobility may be a crucial mechanism by which knowledge spreads through an
economy: we find that firms losing workers to other exporters do not suffer a significant decline in the
number of export destinations, only a decline in market penetration, whereas hiring firms experience
improvement at both margins.
   Our paper is related to several strands of the existing literature. Recent trade theory for heteroge-
neous firms explains how the sorting of workers to employers interacts with exporting. One line of
research considers competitive labor markets and generates assortative matching of more able work-
ers to more capable firms, but workers with the same characteristics are paid the same wage (see
for example Manasse and Turrini 2001, Yeaple 2005, Verhoogen 2008, Bustos 2011, Monte 2011,


                                                   2
Burstein and Vogel 2012). Another line of research introduces labor market frictions so that workers
with the same ability can be paid different wages by different firms, and higher wages by exporters.
Search and matching frictions and the resulting bargaining over surplus from production can induce
wages to vary across firms (see for example Helpman, Itskhoki and Redding 2010, Davidson, Matusz
and Shevchenko 2008, Coşar, Guner and Tybout 2011). Alternatively, efficiency wages that induce
effort or fair wages can vary with revenue between firms (see for example Egger and Kreickemeier
2009, Amiti and Davis 2011, Davis and Harrigan 2011). Our data show that similarly able workers
receive different wages depending on their employer (see also Helpman et al. 2012).
   Worker skills relevant for exporting have been shown to be portable from firm to firm in case stud-
ies and firm surveys (Rhee 1990, Gershenberg 1987, Görg and Strobl 2005). Using linked employer-
employee data, Balsvik (2011) and Poole (2013) provide systematic evidence that domestic employers
exhibit higher productivity and pay higher wages after they hire workers from foreign-owned firms.
Parrotta and Pozzoli (2012) document that poached recruits with specific knowledge from a prior em-
ployer significantly raise value added at the hiring firm. Poole (2013) uses linked employer-employee
data from the same Brazilian source as we do and documents a statistically significant pay increase of
incumbent workers at domestic firms after workers from foreign-owned firms join, but the pay raise
is small. For export-market participation, in contrast, we find the hiring of a few former exporter
workers to be an economically important variable, predicting a probability increase in export-market
participation of about 3 percentage points. This is a considerable probability shift, given an overall
exporting frequency of only 5 percent in manufacturing, and is similar in magnitude to what only
substantive changes in observed workforce characteristics would predict.
   In recent research closely related to ours, Minondo (2011), Sala and Yalcin (2012) and Mion and
Opromolla (2012) investigate how the presence of managers with prior exporter experience changes a
firm’s outcomes. Minondo (2011) and Sala and Yalcin (2012) use linear and probit probability mod-
els for a firm’s export status and show for Spanish and Danish firms that the presence of a manager
with a previous job spell at an exporter predicts a higher probability of export participation at the cur-
rent employer. Mion and Opromolla (2012) estimate Mincer wage regressions for Portuguese linked
employer-employe data and document that managers with prior exporter experience receive sizeable
wage premia, especially if the preceding and the current employer export to common destinations.
Those empirical strategies lend themselves to the interpretation that a favorable labor supply condi-
tion (the treatment with managers assigned to firms) facilitates export performance at the manager’s


                                                    3
current employer. Our paper poses the complementary question and asks conversely how favorable
product market conditions translate into a firm’s labor demand for skills pertinent to exporting. Re-
lated to the specific literature on demand for observed skill and product-market conditions (see for
example Guadalupe 2007 and the survey by Fortin and Lemieux 1997), we provide evidence that
typically unobserved ability, inferrable from a worker’s career history, influences employment and
pay. Reminiscent of findings in the literature on knowledge spillovers and agglomeration (for exam-
ple Jaffe, Trajtenberg and Henderson 1993, Moretti 2004), the targeted hiring of exporter workers is
statistically most significant in locations with a concentration in manufacturing.
       Much empirical research has established evidence that firms with a competitive advantage self-
select into exporting (see for example Clerides, Lach and Tybout 1998, Bernard and Jensen 1999).3
A more recent branch of the literature is opening up the black box of self selection and explores
preparations for export-market entry.4 López (2009) documents for a Chilean plant sample that pro-
ductivity and investment increase prior to export-market entry. Identification rests on the notion of
Granger causality that subsequent realizations of firm-level variables should not cause current realiza-
tions. Aw, Roberts and Xu (2011) structurally estimate a model of innovation and exporting choices,
and find that allowing for both endogenous exporting and innovation contributes to large estimated
productivity gains at Taiwanese electronics plants. Iacovone and Javorcik (2012) study unit prices of
products at Mexican plants. They use anticipated cuts in U.S. tariffs, which offer large-scale exoge-
nous variation, and show that a product variety receives a domestic price premium one year before its
first export, consistent with advance quality upgrading. Our paper explores preparations in workforce
choice and uses current foreign product market conditions as instruments for identification, so our
findings equally apply to exporter behavior under ordinary economic conditions.
       The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. We describe our data in Section 2, and we
document substantial differences among exporters in Section 3. In Section 4 we turn to our main anal-
ysis of workforce choice in response to foreign product market conditions, present the identification
strategy, and empirically document active workforce preparations for subsequent exporting. Section 5
highlights worker and job characteristics that are closely associated with subsequent exporter success.
Section 6 concludes.

      Most evidence suggests that a firm-level competitive advantage leads to exporting, and typically not the reverse, with
some exceptions (for example Van Biesebroeck 2005, Crespi, Criscuolo and Haskel 2008).
    4
      This economic literature adds systematic evidence to case study and survey findings from related research in strategic
management (see for example Gomez-Mejia 1988 and the survey by Leonidou, Katsikeas and Coudounaris 2010) as well
as organizational change (for a survey see Helfat and Lieberman 2002).

2 Data
We combine data from three main sources. Our first data source is the universe of Brazilian exporters:
a three-dimensional panel data set by firm, destination country and year between 1990 and 2001.
Second, we match those exporter data to the universe of formal firms and all their formally employed
workers. This second data source is a three-dimensional linked employer-employee panel data set by
firm, worker and year between 1990 and 2001. The matched employer-employee-exports data provide
us with information on the workforce at exporters as well as on transitions of workers from firm to
firm, and complement the exporter data with the universe of formal non-exporting firms. Third, we
combine the former two data sources with worldwide trade flow data by sector at distant destinations
for Brazilian exporters to construct instrumental variables (IVs) for export status.


Exporter data.     Exporter data derive from the universe of Brazilian customs declarations for mer-
chandise exports by any firm collected at S ECEX (Secretaria de Comércio Exterior). For compara-
bility to other studies, we remove agricultural and mining firms as well as commercial intermediaries
from the exporter data and only keep manufacturing firms that report their direct export shipments.
See Appendix A.1 for more detail on the S ECEX data and their deflation.


Linked employer-employee data.         Our source for linked employer-employee data is R AIS (Re-
lação Anual de Informações Sociais), a comprehensive administrative register of workers formally
employed in any sector of Brazil’s economy. This register contains the universe of formal Brazilian
firms, including non-exporters. R AIS offers information on worker characteristics such as education,
a detailed occupational classification of the job, the firm’s industry, and the legal form of the company
including its foreign ownership, as well as the worker’s earnings. We keep observations for the years
1990 through 2001, again drop all firms outside manufacturing, and then construct workforce and
firm characteristics from employment on December 31st, and we track recent hires back to their
last preceding employer’s export status. These R AIS records consist of 49 million formal workers
employed at 449,390 manufacturing firms (1,767,491 firm-year observations). See Appendix A.2 for
more detail on R AIS.
   Combined with the S ECEX exporter data 1990-2001, we find that 23,518 manufacturing firms
are exporters in at least one sample year (87,050 exporter-year observations). These manufacturing
exporters account for only around 5 percent of formal manufacturing firms, similar to the around 5


                                                   5
percent exporter share in the U.S. universe of manufacturing firms (Bernard, Jensen and Schott 2009).
Single-employee firms enter the R AIS records, explaining the apparently low share of exporter firms
compared to data from many other developing countries, which censor their samples at a minimum
employment level. In terms of employment, manufacturing exporters account for 24 million jobs or
roughly half of Brazilian formal employment during the sample period.
       Including both non-exporters and exporters, there is a total of 1,767,491 firm-year observations in
our manufacturing data (after restricting the sample period to the years 1992-2001 in order to measure
export status with two lags). In regression analysis, we use one lead year and our basic regression
sample shrinks to 1,557,474 firm-year observations for 1992-2000. When we include employment
change at the firm level as a covariate in regressions, only firms with observations for two consecutive
years remain in the sample, and sample size drops to 1,277,201 firm-year observations for 1992-2000.
       Given those large sample sizes, we report statistical significance only at the one-percent signifi-
cance level throughout this paper.


Tracing workers to prior and future employers. We track a firm’s hires back to their prior em-
ployer. We define a relevant hire at a manufacturing firm as a worker accession that is not classified
as a transfer between the firm’s plants and that lasts at least until December 31st of the calendar year.
We then trace the worker back to the last preceding formal-sector employment for up to three prior
years and obtain the former employer’s export status.5 This allows us to identify hires from exporters
as acceding workers whose immediately preceding formal-sector employment during up to three past
years was at an exporter. For predictions of exporter performance, we obtain in addition the share of
common export destination markets (overlap) between the prior and the current employer, an indica-
tor whether the former employer was a continuous exporter for three years, an occupational indicator
whether the worker’s prior employment was in sales (CBO 3-digit classification codes 400 to 499),
and another occupational indicator whether the worker’s prior employment was in an ISCO-88 skilled
blue-collar occupation.6
       We also track workers into the future. First, we follow recent hires from exporters into the next
calendar year and identify subsequent separations. We define separations of recent exporter hires as
   5
    For hires from exporters in 1990 or 1991 we use the exporter category in 1992 (see Table 1).
   6
    We also constructed a common-sector indicator whether the prior and the current employer are in the same subsector
IBGE industry, an indicator whether the worker is employed in the same occupation at the current employer as at the prior
employer, and the worker’s tenure at the prior employer. We found none of those variables to be statistically significant
predictors of exporter performance (Table 12), conditional on our common covariate set, and omit them.



                                                           6
hires from exporters whose new employment terminates before December 31st of the following year.
Second, we track any worker who separates from a firm to the immediately following formal-sector
employment for up to three subsequent years and obtain the future employer’s export status (mirroring
the definition for hires from exporters). This allows us to define departures to exporters as separating
workers whose immediately following formal-sector employment during up to three future years will
be at an exporter.


Worldwide trade flows by sector. Our IVs for expected export status are imports into destinations
outside Latin America from source countries other than Brazil, by subsector IBGE. We use WTF data
on bilateral trade (Feenstra et al. 2005) from 1991 to 2000 to construct the IVs by subsector      IBGE ,

year and six world destinations. The six world destinations are Asia-Pacific Developing countries
(APD), Central and Eastern European countries (CEE), North American countries (NAM excluding
Mexico), Other Developing countries (ODV), Other Industrialized countries (OIN), and Western Eu-
ropean countries (WEU). We remove Latin American and Caribbean countries (LAC) from our set of
IVs. We concord the SITC (Rev. 2) sectors at the four-digit level in WTF to subsector IBGE.7 We then
calculate aggregate imports into each foreign destination region, excepting imports from Brazil, by
subsector IBGE. The IVs will prove to be significant predictors of export status in Brazil. Conditional
on total domestic demand by sector, as well as firm, sector and year effects and detailed firm charac-
teristics, these foreign trade flows are plausibly unrelated to firm- or worker-level outcomes in Brazil
other than through export-market shocks.



3        Exporter Types and Workforce Characteristics
Exporter categories.           To document export success over time, we adopt a lexicographic ranking of
export-market participation. We consider the current year and two preceding years and record in
which of the three years a firm was an exporter with at least one reported shipment (8 possible combi-
nations). We first order firms by current-year export status (t), within current-year status by past-year
status (t−1), and within those by two-years past status (t−2). Beyond this basic time-pattern rank-
ing, we separate non-exporting firms into those that are permanent non-exporters (non-exporters in
every sample year) and current non-exporters (with foreign sales in at least one sample year). We

also separate continuous-exporting firms into non-sustained exporters that do not serve one common
destination in all three years, into sustained non-OECD exporters that serve at least one non-OECD
country for three years, and into sustained OECD exporters that serve at least one OECD country for
three years (resulting in a total of 11 possible combinations). Table 1 shows our resulting ranking of
export success, with the category in the upper-most row showing the least successful exporters (per-
manent non-exporters) and the lower-most row containing the most successful exporters (sustained
OECD exporters).8
       We choose these export-status categories to clarify beyond a two-period categorization that there
is considerable heterogeneity among exporters, both in terms of workforce sizes and export values.
As displayed in Table 1, our time-pattern and destination-market ranking of export-market success is
a refinement of a simpler two-period grouping of exporters into non-exporters for three consecutive
   8
     In an alternative ordering, Álvarez and López (2008) classify firms as permanent exporters if they export in all sample
years, as sporadic exporters if they export in at least one sample year, and as non-exporters if they do not export during
the sample period. Except for permanent non-exporting, our lexicographic ordering does not depend on the number of
sample periods. When we adopt the Álvarez and López classification, we obtain similar results.

years, exporters that quit exporting (including past quitters), firms that start exporting (including past
starters), and exporters with continuous exporting.9 Curiously, our refined export-status ranking is
almost perfectly mirrored in the firms’ ranking by workforce size (column 2). For example, permanent
non-exporters have an average size of twelve workers, in-out switchers who recently quit exporting
employ 76 workers, recent export starters employ 104 workers, while sustained OECD exporters
employ 552 workers on average. This surprising employment size monotonicity is preserved for all
but one pair of neighboring rows.10 Our refined export-status ranking is also positively related to
annual sales (column 3, correlation coefficient of .11 at the firm level).
       The vast majority of formal-sector manufacturing firms (over 90 percent) never exports in any year
between 1990 and 2001. The 57,149 firms that quit or start exporting make up more than half of all
firms that export in at least one year between 1990 and 2001 but account for only 6 percent of all export
sales. Even among the continuous exporters, it is the select group of sustained OECD exporters that
dominates. The 25,234 sustained OECD exporters are fewer than one-third of all current exporters,
but they ship close to 90 percent of Brazilian exports and employ more than half of all exporters
workers (and one-third of all Brazilian manufacturing workers). For a breakdown of export-market
participation and employment by sector, see Table A.1 in the Appendix.


Workforce composition.           Table 2 reports summary statistics for the universe of manufacturing
firms, restricting the sample to 1992-2000 to account for one lead in addition to two lags in export
status. There are substantive differences in export-market participation among exporters. Compared
to firms that start exporting, continuous exporters serve 2.7 times (one log unit) more destinations and
have 4.6 times (one-and-a-half log units) larger sales per destination. Continuous exporters exhibit
less than a one-in-twelve frequency of quitting exports, while firms that recently started exporting
(within the past two years) quit exporting with almost a one-in-three frequency.
       Surprisingly, workforce characteristics do not reflect exporters’ performance and size differences.
The most prevalent occupation in manufacturing, skilled blue-collar work, is performed by 63 percent
of workers at the average manufacturing firm and by around 57 percent of workers at exporters,
almost independent of the exporters’ export status. Similarly, white-collar occupations are preformed
   9
      About 39 percent of manufacturing exporters are starters; they account for employment of four million workers out
of a total of 49 million in manufacturing and command 6 percent of export sales.
   10
      A two-period classification would have lumped past quitters with non-exporters, but their workforce size turns out
to be more similar to other quit-exporting firms under the refinement. Similarly, a two-period classification would have
lumped past starters with continuous-exporting firms, but their workforce is more similar to other start-exporting firms
under the refinement.

to a similar degree across exporters, varying only between 28 and 31 percent. The most prevalent
schooling level in manufacturing is primary education. There are more primary schooled workers at
the average manufacturing firm with a share of 76 percent than at exporters with a share of 67 percent,
but there is only minor variation among exporters for primary school educated workers (between 66
and 69 percent) or highly educated workers (between 8 and 10 percent).11
       Firm heterogeneity is often described with log premia regressions, which show that non-exporters
significantly differ from exporters along several dimensions including workforce characteristics.Arguably

       Exporters, and especially continuous exporters, exhibit net employment reductions, a phenomenon beyond the scope

less attention has been paid to differences among exporters. In our exporter-premia regressions, we
condition on sector and year effects, as well as on the firm’s log employment to control for the part
of the exporter premium that is predictable with size differences. The omitted firm category is non-
exporters for at least three years.
    Table 3 shows that workers at continuous exporters earn a wage premium of 55 percent (.44 log
units) over workers at non-exporters, and even workers at recent export-market quitters earn 38 per-
cent (.32 log units) more than workers at firms with no exports for three years. Only a small part of this
wage premium is due to different workforce compositions, as the log wage residual (from a regression
on educational and occupational workforce variables) shows. The residual log wage still exhibits a
premium between 28 and 42 percent (.25 and .35 log units) over non-exporters. These findings are
consistent with the hypothesis that mostly unobserved worker characteristics are associated with a

firm’s export status and that there is sharing of an exporter’s profits with the exporter employees.12
       Workforce composition differences in Table 3 are economically small and not generally statisti-
cally significant (at the one-percent significance level in the universe of firms). Employment premia
for white-collar occupations, for instance, are statistically significantly different between exporters
but economically roughly similar at a 7 to 10 percent premium for exporters of any status over non-
exporters. For college (tertiary) educated educated workers there are statistically significant differ-
ences among continuous and other exporters but these differences are economically small (just as the
raw mean differences in Table 2 show no marked variation among exporters of different status).
       One typically unobserved worker characteristic is the worker’s prior work experience at an ex-
porter. Continuous exporters hire 43 percent (.36 log units) more workers from other exporters than
export starters, conditional on firm size, and export starters hire 33 percent (.29 log points) more work-
ers with prior exporter experience than export quitters. Compared to these substantive differences in
gross hires of workers with typically unobserved prior exporter experience, the observed workforce
composition differences in Table 3 appear small.13
       In Figure 1, we look beyond mean comparisons and plot nonparametric estimates of densities
for firm characteristics. In the left graph of the Figure, the kernel estimates for log employment

     The differences in pay and gross hires of former exporter workers are even more pronounced in premia regressions
that do not condition on size, and workforce characteristics premia are economically more similar among exporters (see
Online Supplement).

reflect the marked size rankings from Table 1 before, with continuous exporters’ sizes exhibiting a
clearly right-shifted probability mass over firms that start exporting, firms that quit exporting, and
non-exporters in this order. The ranking becomes less clear-cut for shares of white-collar occupations
in the right graph of Figure 1. While there is still a pronounced difference between non-exporters
and exporters, the density functions for exporters with different status exhibit multiple crossings and
do not suggest as clear a ranking as there appears to be for sizes. The minor economic differences
of workforce characteristics among exporters in Table 1 and the right graph of Figure 1 suggest that
more successful and larger exporters employ scaled-up workforces with similar compositions as their
less successful and smaller competitors.


Predictions of future export-market participation.                    This evidence leads us to hypothesize that
former exporter workers possess unobserved skills that are associated with exporter performance and
could be more relevant performance predictors than conventional observable workforce differences.
Before we investigate this hypothesis in detail in the following Section, we turn to a descriptive
regression of future export status on current firm-level characteristics to assess the predictive power
of workforce characteristics for export status.
       Table 4 reports binomial logit predictions for future export-market participation (t+1), given to-
day’s export participation and firm-level characteristics.14 All specifications condition on sector and
year effects as well as sector-level absorption (total domestic demand including imports but excluding
exports) to control for sector-level business cycles.15 Consistent with much prior evidence, firms with
larger employment are more likely to be exporters than non-exporters one year later, and firms with
more highly educated workers or with more skill-intensive occupations are more likely to be exporters
than non-exporters. But, conditional on schooling, only the most skill-intensive professional occupa-
tions are a statistically significant predictor of next-period exporting (at the one-percent significance
level). In line with existing evidence on sunk costs of export-market entry (e.g. Roberts and Tybout
  14
      The binomial exporter-nonexporter dichotomy makes this initial specification closely comparable to Clerides, Lach
and Tybout (1998), Álvarez and López (2005) or Crespi, Criscuolo and Haskel (2008) and also to our first-stage regressions
in the next Section.

      A conditional logit specification for firm-fixed effects performs poorly, reducing the estimation sample by more than
90 percent to only 98,731 observations and predicting an export-market participation rate of 26.2 percent, far above the
actual 4.9 percent. In contrast, a linear probability model with firm-fixed effects, similar to our first-stage instrumental-
variable regression below (Table 5) performs reasonably well, with negative predicted probabilities for just 2 percent
of the sample. The linear model shows a strong association between hiring former exporter workers and export-market
participation. For descriptive evidence, we limit our discussion to the more conservative estimates from unconditional
binomial logit.

1997), current exporting is a highly significant predictor of future exporting with a predicted marginal
probability increase of roughly one-sixth.16 Hysteresis in exporting is better explained by a firm’s
presence in more export destinations than by its market penetration of given destinations. Among the
exporters, firms with double the current number of export destinations have about a four times larger
predicted marginal probability than firms with double the current exports per destination.17 There is
no evidence that being an affiliate of a foreign multinational enterprise (MNE) is a significant pre-
dictor of future exporting after controlling for current exporting. These estimates are highly robust
across specifications.
       Starting with specification 2, we investigate the predictive power of hiring former exporter work-
ers. Whereas relative net employment expansions have no statistically significant effect on next-year
exporting (at the one-percent level), the indicator for hiring former exporter workers is highly signifi-
cant. In economic terms, hiring at least one former exporter worker has a similar predictive power for
future exporting (an increase of export participation by 3 percentage points) as has the share of ter-
tiary educated workers in the workforce at current exporters.18 This suggests that hiring key workers
with an exporting background from prior employers is strongly associated with future export-market
participation. Specification 3 includes the log number of gross hires from exporters, if non-zero. The
included variable reduces the coefficient on the indicator for hiring former exporter workers by little
and has itself a significantly positive coefficient. This suggests that it is a small number of key workers
with an exporting background that matters most for the prediction.
       To understand at which firms hiring former exporter workers has the strongest predicted effect on
future export-market participation, we construct an indicator variable for high-skill firms. We classify
a firm as high-skill intensive if its current share of technical/supervisory and professional/managerial
occupations falls into the top quartile of firm-year observations. Specification 4 includes the high-
skill firm indicator and its interactions with the exporting indicator and the indicator for hiring former
exporter workers. Coefficient estimates show that, at high-skill firms, the association between future
exporting and hiring former exporter workers is absent. This suggests that hiring key workers with an
exporting background matters most for exporting at firms with lower initial skill intensity.
  16
      Estimates vary from .048(1−.048) · 3.326 = .152 in specification 1 to .171 in specification 3.
  17
      The implied probability increases are ln(2) · .048(1−.048) · .579 = .018 for export destinations and ln(2) · .048(1−
.048) · .175 = .005 for exports per destination.
   18
      The respective predictions are that hiring former exporter workers is associated with a probability increase for next-
year export-market participation by .055(1−.055) · .532 = .0277 percentage points in specification 2. By comparison,
increasing the share of tertiary educated workers at exporters eightfold from .1 to .8, thus substituting the primary-educated
share of the workforce (Table 2), is associated with a .055(1−.055) · .7 · .674 = .0245 point probability increase.

    To summarize, existing research documents that workforce characteristics differ between non-
exporters and exporters. Our descriptive evidence shows in addition that export-market performance
and sizes also differ markedly among exporters of different status. But commonly observed workforce
characteristics such as educational attainment and occupations are quite similar among exporters de-
spite substantive diversity in export performance and size. Instead unobserved workforce character-
istics, in particular a worker’s prior experience at another exporting firm, is an important predictor of
the current employer’s future export-market participation. We now query to what extent the hiring of
former exporter workers occurs in preparation for export-market participation.



4     Preparing to Export
In trade models with endogenous technology adoption such as Yeaple (2005) and Costantini and
Melitz (2008), falling variable trade costs induce more firms in differentiated-goods industries to
adopt innovative technology and raise their employment, hiring away from differentiated-goods pro-
ducers with lower productivity (in Costantini and Melitz 2008) or hiring away the top-skilled workers
from firms with inferior technology (in Yeaple 2005). The timing of hiring and technology-adoption
decisions is explicitly modelled by Costantini and Melitz who show in simulations that anticipated
future drops in variable trade costs lead firms to adopt innovation before the anticipated favorable
trade shock manifests itself.


Estimation model.     Motivated by these theories, we adopt a straightforward empirical model of the
firm’s employment and export decision in two parts. First, a firm i observes export-market conditions
zit abroad at time t and uses them to linearly estimate the probability of its own future export-market
participation next year xi,t+1 , conditional on its current firm characteristics and domestic market con-
ditions yit :
                                     xi,t+1 = yit′ γ y + z′it γ z + ηit ,                            (1)

where ηit is a mean independent error term and γ y and γ z are vectors of regression coefficients. The
measures of export-market conditions zit are sector-level imports into foreign destinations (outside
Latin America) from source countries other than Brazil. The idea for these foreign-demand IVs is
that, prior to exporting, firms use the foreign market information available in the media, through trade
fairs, or from specialized trade journals on their product markets to infer the future market conditions


                                                     16
of their own expected residual demand.
       Second, firm i uses the prediction of its future export status x̂i,t+1 = yit′ γ̂ y + z′it γ̂ z to choose the
number of its hires from exporters hit :

                                       ln(1 + hit ) = yit′ β y + x̂i,t+1 βx + ϵit ,                                      (2)

where ϵit is a mean independent error term that is uncorrelated with zit , conditional on the set of
covariates yit . The measure ln(1 + hit ) of log gross hiring from exporters is zero for zero hires and
increases monotonically at a decreasing rate in the number of hires so that regression coefficient reflect
semi-elasticities.19 In robustness analysis, we also use exports two and three periods in advance, xi,t+2
and xi,t+3 , for otherwise the same right-hand side variables in equations (1) and (2).
       The control variables yit include firm fixed effects, sector fixed effects, year fixed effects and
domestic sector-level absorption (to control for a potentially co-integrated sector-level business cycle
abroad and in Brazil), three indicators for the firm’s current export status (to capture different degrees
of persistence in export market participation), the firm’s employment change between t − 1 and t
relative to employment at t (to control for total net hiring that coincides with the hiring of exporter
workers), employment, workforce composition shares of worker education and occupation categories,
an indicator whether the firm is directly foreign owned, and an indicator whether the firm is high-skill
intensive (its current share of technical/supervisory and professional/managerial occupations falling
into the top quartile of firm-year observations). Specifications with firm-level IVs also include sector-
year trends.
       While a large swing in the real exchange rate or dismantling trade barriers offers substantive vari-
ation beyond a firm’s control, findings from such large-scale experiments, which might have consider-
able concomitant macroeconomic consequences, are arguably less instructive about exporter behavior
in ordinary times. We therefore adopt an instrumentation strategy that relates a firm’s export-market
participation next year to current destination-market shocks. Our main identifying assumption is
that current foreign market conditions zit in destinations outside Latin America affect the hiring of
exporter workers hit only through expected export-market participation—conditional on the firm’s
current export status, its other observed characteristics and domestic market conditions at the sector
level.
  19
     We experimented with three more specifications of the left-hand side outcome in equation (2): ln hit (which is only
defined for non-zero hires), hit , and an indicator 1(hit > 0). Those specifications result in the same significance and sign
patterns as the specifications reported below (see Online Supplement).



                                                            17
       Our main hypothesis is that βx is strictly positive. When firms observe a favorable foreign import-
demand shock so that they can expect a higher chance of exporting x̂i,t+1 next year, they prepare their
workforces similar to technology upgrading in Costantini and Melitz (2008) and top-skill hiring in
Yeaple (2005). Our empirical design allows us to interpret a positive βx coefficient as evidence of
preparing to export because market conditions zit at distant destinations abroad plausibly isolate how
favorable product demand translates into a firm’s labor demand (1 + hit ) for exporting skills.


Export-market shocks.            There is limited econometric guidance to date for the selection among
multiple valid IVs when some IVs are potentially weak but others strong. If the F statistic for the
hypothesis that the instrumental-variable coefficient is non-zero on the first stage surpasses a value
of 10, an instrument is commonly considered a strong one (Stock, Wright and Yogo 2002). We have
six potential IVs but our export status classification requires three IVs for our regressions to be just
identified. To select the strongest possible set of IVs, we use the F statistic like an information
criterion. We first regress the binary future exporting indicator on all six IVs and other exogenous
variables, conditioning on firm, sector and year effects. From this initial regression we select the three
IVs with the highest t statistics. We then set out to add IVs in the order of their t statistics, from next
highest to lowest, and observe the evolution of the F statistic as we include IVs, with the intent to stop
including IVs as soon as the F statistic starts falling. We find the import-demand IVs of OIN, WEU
and NAM to have similarly high t statistics (between 3.9 and 3.4 in absolute value) and then add CEE
to the regression, which has the next highest t statistic (1.7 in absolute value). With this addition, the
F statistic for joint significance of the IVs drops, however, from 18.0 to 14.1. We therefore use no
IVs other than import demand in OIN, WEU and NAM.
       The upper panel (specification A) in Table 5 shows the results from linear regressions of future
exporting on these pure demand IVs, conditional on our set of control variables.20 There is no a priori
expected sign for coefficients on our foreign import-demand measures. A positive sign is consistent
with favorable consumer demand conditions at the foreign destination both for Brazilian and non-
Brazilian exporters. A negative sign is consistent with unfavorable residual demand at the foreign
destination for Brazilian exporters in the wake of large competing shipments by non-Brazilian export
countries. By this interpretation of coefficients in Table 5, shipments from non-Brazilian export coun-
tries to North America and other industrialized countries tend to substitute Brazilian exports whereas
  20
     Firms are not nested within sectors in our data so sector fixed effects are separately identified but common clustering
of standard errors in the two-stage least squares regression becomes inviable.

others’ shipments to Western Europe tend to complement Brazilian exports (columns 1 through 3).
Expectedly, signs of significant coefficients are reversed for Brazilian firms that quit exporting (col-
umn 4).
   Foreign market conditions zit vary by sector and year and capture pure demand effects, which
are common to all firms within a sector. While instrument validity is unaffected by this limited
variation, predictive power of the IVs can be a concern. The F statistic clearly exceeds 10 for the
binary future exporter indicator and for export starters, but the F statistic falls below the threshold
of 10 for continuous exporting status and for firms that quit exporting. We will therefore interpret
second-stage results for continuous exporters and export quitters with caution. For export status two
or three periods in advance, in contrast, the same IVs clearly exceed the F statistic threshold of 10 for
all exporter categories in our robustness regressions (see Tables B.4 and B.4 in the Appendix).
   In the presence of sunk entry costs the firms’ responses to changing foreign market conditions
depend on the firm’s current export status (Dixit 1989). Among the control variables yit we include
the firm’s current export status, thus capturing the direct effect of current exporting on hiring exporter
workers on the second stage (2). As a result, the interaction of worldwide market conditions and the
vector of current export status indicators zitww · xit is a valid instrument as long as persistent firm-
level export-supply shocks are summarized by the current export status and hence do not confound
second-stage estimation. We exclude imports into any Latin American economy from the measure
of worldwide imports zitww and interact worldwide import demand with indicators for the three export
status categories other than non-exporters (Table 1).
   The middle panel (B) in Table 5 shows the results for the first-stage of the according interacted
instrumental variable regression. Expectedly, the F statistics now far exceed the threshold of 10. In
the lower panel (C) in Table 5, we introduce sector-year trends in addition and the F statistics remain
above the threshold of 10. The identifying assumption for the new set of instruments (B and C) is
more restrictive. So we will check second-stage estimates from the alternative sets of instruments
(A-C) against each other to assess robustness and query their implied validity.


Hiring away exporter workers. We now consider the hiring of former exporter workers at time
t as a preparation for anticipated export-market participation in the next year. For this purpose, we
use expected export-market participation at t+1, predicted by the above-mentioned observed foreign
import-demand shocks at t.
   Results in Table 6 show that expected future exporting is significantly positively associated with

susceptible to favorable foreign demand conditions (treatment responders). In contrast, the ordinary
regression (column 1) measures the covariation of observed future export-market participation on the
universe of firms, including the bulk of never-exporting firms that are not susceptible to favorable
foreign demand (never responders). Coefficients in IV regressions therefore expectedly exceed those
from ordinary regression. We provide evidence on the most responsive firms by region and size below,
consistent with this interpretation (Table 8).
    Using pure foreign-demand IVs (specification A in column 2) predicts that firms prepare for an
expected 10 percentage-point increase in the probability of export-market participation next year with
one gross hire of a former exporter worker at the sample mean.21 This is a plausible number. The
average firm in the sample exports with a probability of 4.9 percent (Table 2). The average exporter
contracts twelve former exporter workers per year during the sample period, while recent export
quitters just hire three former exporter workers on average and the mean manufacturing firm just hires
one (Table 2). Using foreign-demand IVs interacted with the firm’s present export status (columns 3
and 4) leads to a smaller magnitude: by this measure, an expected 10 percentage-point increase in the
exporting probability next year results in advance gross hiring of only .4 former exporter workers.
    We condition on a firm’s relative employment change, so employment expansions at hiring firms
cannot confound our finding. We control for affiliates of foreign multinational enterprises, so our
specification separates the effect of exports from foreign ownership. Our finding is also unaffected by
common sectoral business cycles between Brazil and foreign markets because we control for domestic
absorption at the sector level.
    Numerous coefficients on current firm characteristics are consistent with the interpretation that
strong firm-side performance up to the current year is not typically associated with hiring former ex-
porter workers. Continuous exporting firms up to the current period, and export starters in the current
period, hire strictly fewer former exporter workers than non-exporters, whereas firms that just quit
exporting in the current period contract more former exporter workers, arguably in anticipation of a
    21
       By the coefficient estimate in column 2, implied gross hiring of former exporter workers is .1 · 4.772 · (1 + h̄) = 1.00
workers for a 10 percentage-point increase in the exporting probability and mean former exporter hires h̄ = 1.1 (Table 2).
It is .1 · 2.048 · (1 + h̄) = .43 by column 3 and .1 · 1.748 · (1 + h̄) = .37 by column 4.

mean reversion in their export participation. Similarly, firms with more tertiary educated workers and
a higher skill intensity hire strictly fewer former exporter workers (with a minor coefficient alteration
for the fraction of exporters among high skill intensive firms). As the only exception to the overall
pattern, a larger share of skill-intensive white-collar occupations is associated with hiring more for-
mer exporter workers, conditional on the education composition of the workforce and the firm’s rank
in the skill intensity distribution. The overall pattern broadly supports the interpretation that currently
less successful exporters and less well staffed firms pursue the strongest advance hiring of former
exporter workers.
   A comparison of results from the three different sets of instruments (A-C) shows that signs and
significance patterns are highly robust across specifications (columns 2 through 4), with signs identical
when significant for thirteen out of fifteen covariates.


Concomitant changes in observed skill demand compared to exporter experience.                A remaining
concern with our findings could be that a firm may hire former exporter workers away not because of
their prior exporter experience but because of their other skills. Those other skills could correlate with
employment at an exporter. To isolate a hiring firm’s changes to observed skill demand, we therefore
augment the specifications of Table 6 with a set of concomitant relative employment changes by
education and occupation group at the firm. Table 7 reports the results. A comparison to coefficient
estimates in Table 6 shows that the inclusion of controls for observed workforce skill changes hardly
affects our main estimates. None of the slight coefficient changes are statistically significant. (For
first-stage results see Table B.1 in the Appendix.) We conclude that a firm with expected export-
market participation prepares its workforce by hiring away workers from other exporters because of
those workers’ exporter experience.
   Given the robustness across sets of instruments and sets of controls, we now return to the dif-
ference in coefficient magnitudes between the instrumented and non-instrumented specifications. To
assess our explanation that non-exporting firms (never responders) bias ordinary regression coeffi-
cients downwards, we query which firms most responsively hire former exporter workers.


Hiring away exporter workers by region and firm size.             We interact the indicator of exporting
one year in advance with the firm’s location in one of three broad regions in Brazil, having three
instruments at hand. São Paulo state is Brazil’s manufacturing center, hosting about half of Brazil’s
manufacturing value added during the 1990s. The South and South East of Brazil (excluding São

the South nor the remaining South East (Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais and Espı́rito Santo) can match
São Paulo state’s concentration of manufacturing industries.
    Results in the upper panel of Table 8 corroborate our interpretation that instrumented regressions
reflect the responses of firms that are susceptible to favorable foreign demand conditions (treatment
responders). We ignore results from weak instruments (specification A in column 2). Only firms in
São Paulo state significantly respond to favorable foreign demand by hiring away exporter workers
(columns 3 and 4). Arguably only the industry agglomeration in São Paulo state offers a sufficiently
thick labor market to permit effective worker poaching.

Hiring away exporter workers by expected export status.                           Theory implies that firms with the
largest anticipated gains from exporting have the strongest incentive to engage in preparatory hiring

       Note that current mean log employment at exporters is 4.329 (Table 2), so an estimate of the net effect of future export
status in specification A (column 2) is .863 = −12.046 + 2.982 · 4.329. The net effect is therefore positive as expected
but hard to interpret.

(Yeaple 2005, Costantini and Melitz 2008). One proxy to returns from export-market participation
is the expected exporter category, with expected continuous exporters arguably commanding larger
gains than expected export starters. We accordingly estimate equation (1) for a vector of anticipated
exporter status over three categories and look up to three years into the future.
       Table 9 reports the results for one year in advance (t+1, with first stage results in Table 5, columns 2
through 4) and for two and three years in advance (t+2 and t+3, with first-stage results in Tables B.4
and B.5 in the Appendix). We disregard results from specification A in column 2, which produce a
poor R2 fit on the second stage under relatively weak instruments.23
       As theory suggests, expected continuous exporters exhibit the strongest response. Results for t+1
show directly that expected continuous exporters hire more former exporter workers than any other
firm. The coefficient on continuous exporting monotonically drops for later years t + 2 and t + 3,
consistent with a declining incremental response of continuous exporters. To interpret results for t+2
in levels, note that expected continuous exporters at t+2 must be at least export starters at t+1, so
the coefficients in the lower panels of Table 9 cumulate with those in the panel above (for export
status definitions see Table 1). Expected continuous exporters at t+2 therefore also hire more former
exporter workers than any other firm. At t+3, only the response of continuous exporters is statistically
significant.
       Expected export starters two years into the future at t+2 exhibit a stronger response than expected
export starters at t+1, consistent with the idea that firms engage in gradual workforce preparations
for exporting. Interestingly, current exporters that are predicted to quit exports within a year by
t+1 hire significantly more former exporter workers than non-exporters. Export quitting at t+2 or
t+3, in contrast, is not associated with hiring of former exporter workers. These estimates suggest
that current exporters threatened by immediate export-market exit have a stronger incentive to poach
former exporter workers than non-exporters, perhaps because a current exporter’s expected returns
from catching up to well staffed exporters are larger than for never-exporters.


Wage changes and their components for hires from exporters.                          The value of a former exporter
worker to the current employer should be reflected in the wage payment. For every hired worker j
  23
       We consider the coefficient on expected export quitters at t+1 in specification A spuriously significant, given weak
instruments with an F statistic of only 7.16 (Table 5 column 4). When instruments are sufficiently strong with F statistics
of 145.8 for t+ 2 and 138.5 for t+3 (Tables B.4 and B.5 column 4), then expected export quitters exhibit no significant
hiring.

Notes: Log wage change is difference between the current log wage (component) and the log wage (component) at
the preceding exporter. Log wage components from Mincer (1974) regressions by year for the cross section of plants,
decomposing the log wage into a worker observable component, a plant-fixed component, and an individual worker
residual, and then summing up over current employer’s hires from exporters. Linear regressions, controlling for firm fixed
effects, sector and year effects, and sectoral absorption; for linear sector trends in specification 4. Specifications 2, 3 and 4

from an exporter, we compute the difference in the log wage between the current job and the immedi-
ately preceding job (ln wjt − ln wj,t−τ ). We then use the mean log difference in wages of hired former
                                                                                      ∑
exporter workers at a given firm i as the left-hand side variable (∆i ln wit ≡ (1/Ji ) j ln wjt /wj,t−τ ),
and run our main regression equation (2) with the mean former exporter workers’ log wage difference
between jobs as dependent variable (∆i ln wit = yit′ δ y + x̂i,t+1 δx + ϵit ). Table 10 reports the important
coefficient estimate for expected future exporter status in the upper panel. Former exporter workers
receive a sizeable log wage premium upon being hired away in response to the new employer’s fa-
vorable export market demand shock. The pay increase is statistically significant at the one-percent
level only in specification B (column 3) but would be significant at the five-percent level in all IV
specifications.
      To determine the source of the wage increase, we resort to a Mincer log wage regression ln wjt =

                                                              28
zjt ′ ϑt +ψi(j)t +νjt in the cross section of workers j year by year to isolate three log wage components
for every worker (as in Menezes-Filho, Muendler and Ramey 2008):24 first the log wage component
zjt ′ ϑ̂t that is predicted by observed worker characteristics (education, occupation, labor force expe-
rience, gender, age); second the plant-specific component ψi(j)t predicted by a plant fixed effect in
the annual cross section of employers (reflecting both a pure plant component and unobserved dif-
ferences in workforce composition such as the plant average match effects); and third an individual
worker residual component (νjt ). We then use the mean difference in those wage components for
hired former exporter workers at a given firm i as the left-hand side variable in our main regression
equation (2). Table 10 reports the coefficient estimates for expected future exporter status in the lower
three panels.
       Only the firm-average plant fixed effect is statistically significantly associated with the new em-
ployer’s favorable export demand shock, whereas neither a hired former exporter worker’s individual
residual wage component nor the worker’s observable characteristics are associated with the wage
premium at the new employer. The decomposition exercise therefore shows that the pay increase for
former exporter workers between jobs stems from the new employer’s firm-wide pay, in which all
employees share.


Firing recent exporter hires upon unexpected export failure. Regression specifications so far
offer evidence for our main hypothesis that a firm hires away exporter workers when it can expect
to realize export-market gains. A corollary of our hypothesis is that a firm with favorable foreign-
demand conditions, which currently predict a high probability of export-market participation next
year, should lay off again its currently poached hires from exporters if it fails to become an exporter
by next year.25 To pursue this placebo-like treatment, we follow recent hires from exporters in the
current year into the next calendar year and identify separations that occur before the end of the next
calendar year. We define separations of recent exporter hires as hires from exporters in the current
year whose new employment terminates before December 31st of the next year. We then restrict the
firm sample in two ways. First, we keep only those firm observations whose predicted export indicator
for next year is above the sample median, consistent with a favorable expectation of export-market
participation. Of those firm observations, we only keep the ones that turn out to be non-exporters
  24
       To narrow the data to a single job per worker and year, we retain the last recorded and highest-paid job spell (randomly
dropping ties) in a given year.

next year. Second, we keep only firm observations with predicted exporting next year above the 75th
percentile, and of those only the non-exporters next year.
    For each restricted sample of unexpectedly failing exporters, we replicate equation (2) and regress
separations from current exporter hires ln(1+si,t+1 ) on the prediction of the firm’s future export status
x̂i,t+1 and the control variables. We know from estimates of equation (2) that a higher propensity
of exporting next year leads to more hires of exporter workers in the current year. If those hires
mainly serve for export-market entry, and little else, then we should expect in the restricted sample of
unexpectedly failing exporters that a higher propensity of exporting next year leads to more firings of
these recently hired former exporter workers over the next year. Results in Table 11 corroborate this
implication.
    The coefficient estimate on the exporting predictor for next year is strictly positive. Unexpectedly
failing exporters fire more recent exporter hires if the exporting predictor induced them to poach
more exporter workers in the current year. Given our endogenous sample restriction based on first-
stage estimates, we bootstrap the standard errors over both estimation stages. The coefficients are
statistically significant at the one-percent level in the larger sample with the median export indicator as
the cutoff for a firm’s predicted export indicator (and at the five-percent level in the smaller sample for
specification B). Comparing estimates in the upper panel of Table 11 to the hiring estimates (Table 6)

suggests that unexpectedly failing exporters let go again of between one-third to 90 percent of the
recently poached hires from exporters.26
         In summary, firms hire former exporter workers in advance of expected favorable export con-
ditions, and especially firms in regions with thick manufacturing labor markets contract exporter
workers in response to expected export-market participation. Large firms and firms that anticipate to
become continuous exporters pursue relatively more such advance hires. The hired former exporter
workers share in the firm-wide wage premium upon their employment change. Conversely, unexpect-
edly failing exporters lay off a significant fraction of their recently hired former exporter workers. We
now return to a descriptive investigation into the importance of advance hiring of exporter workers
for a firm’s performance in foreign markets.



5          Predictors of Exporter Performance
Performance after hiring away exporter workers. We now restrict the sample to exporters only
and seek additional evidence on two aspects of exporter performance. We decompose the log of
a firm’s exports into the log number of its export destinations (market reach) and its log exports
per destination (market penetration). We relate these two outcomes next year to the firm’s present
characteristics, including its hires of former exporter workers.
         Table 12 shows two sets of three regressions for exporting firms, one set with the log number of
destinations as dependent variable (columns 1 through 3) and one set with the log exports per desti-
nation as dependent variable (columns 4 through 6). Each regression conditions on the other outcome
variable to isolate the covariation of predictors. A firm’s workforce characteristics exhibit similar
covariations with the outcomes as in our binomial regression of exporting on current characteristics
(Table 4), so we suppress the workforce shares and the MNE indicator for brevity.
         In a short regression, neither the indicator for hiring former exporter workers nor the log number
of hired exporter workers are significant predictors of market reach at the one-percent significance
level (column 1). The log number of hired exporter workers, however, is a significant predictor of
export-market penetration in a short regression (column 4). We next bring to bear exporter categories
in our data to discern between hires from continuous exporters and hires from recent export starters.
For both outcomes at the hiring firm, market reach (column 2) and market penetration (column 5),

         The coefficient ratios range from .37 and .36 under specifications (B) and (C) to .89 under specification (A).

now the log number of workers hired from continuous exporters is a significant predictor of better
export performance, but not the number of hires from export starters. This finding is consistent with
the idea that workers with a background at continuous exporters have unobserved characteristics that
are more important for reaching more destinations and deeper into a destination than workers just
with experience at export starters.
    Finally, we bring to bear both additional worker-level and exporter information in our data to gain
more detailed insight from long regressions. Among the hires from exporters, mostly workers in mar-
keting occupations at the prior employer predict a wider market reach at the hiring firm (column 3) but
not a deeper export-market penetration (column 6). Mostly workers in skilled blue-collar occupations
at the prior employer predict a deeper market penetration by the hiring firm (column 6) but not a wider
export-market reach (column 3). A larger overlap of export destinations between the prior employer
and the current employer predicts a higher success for both market reach and penetration at the hiring
firm. These findings are consistent with the idea that workers bring with them destination-specific
knowledge. The findings also invite speculation that salespersons may be more important to reach
additional destinations (perhaps because they know market characteristics and clients), whereas pro-
duction skills (perhaps for high quality and timely delivery) are more relevant for deeper penetration
of a market with additional sales.


Performance after departures of workers to exporters. For a final investigation as to how knowl-
edge may move with workers, we consider the effect of departing workers on an exporter’s success.
For this purpose, we track a worker who separates from a firm to the immediately following formal-

                                                              33
sector employment for up to three subsequent years and obtain the future employer’s export status
(mirroring the definition for hires from exporters). This allows us to define departures to exporters as
separating workers whose following formal-sector employment is at an exporter.
    We include an indicator for such worker departures to exporters and the log number of departures
to exporters as additional regressors into the specifications of market reach and market penetration be-
fore. Table 13 reports the results for the two new variables. Remarkably, the log number of departures
is a significant predictor only for market penetration (in the specification of column 6). A consistent
interpretation is that current exporters might only suffer a significant loss in market penetration but
not in market reach, once they know how to access a given set of foreign markets.
    This result is interesting in at least two regards. First, the result offers a potential explanation why
worker poaching can be successful. While the hiring firm may expect to improve export outcomes
in two dimensions, both regarding market reach and market penetration, the losing firm may expect
to suffer only in the dimension of market penetration. This difference in product-market outcomes
potentially raises the marginal product of the poached worker for the hiring firm above the value for
the losing firm. Second, the result suggests that worker mobility may be an efficient mechanism by
which knowledge spreads through an economy. If the moving worker’s marginal product increases
with the move, the spread of knowledge is welfare improving.



6    Concluding Remarks
Using rich linked employer-employee data that track Brazilian manufacturing firms, their exports
and individual workers over more than a decade, we document substantive size and performance
differences among exporters, not just between exporters and non-exporters. Despite this diversity
in export-market performance and employment, the workforce composition varies little among ex-
porters. Looking into typically unobserved aspects of workers’ job histories, we find that hiring a
small number of former exporter workers is an important predictor of a firm’s export-market suc-
cess. To measure the extent of active workforce preparations for future exporting, we use import
demands for non-Brazilian goods outside Latin America as instruments. We find that firms hire for-
mer exporter workers in response to favorable demand conditions abroad and in advance of expected
export-market entry. Especially firms in regions with thick manufacturing labor markets, large firms,
and firms that can anticipate to become continuous exporters contract exporter workers in response to


                                                    34
expected export-market participation.
    Hiring workers from marketing-related occupations at former exporters predicts a wider reach
of destinations, and hiring skilled blue-collar workers from exporters predicts a deeper penetration
of destinations. Yet the exact origins of former exporter workers’ skills remain a matter for future
research. Former exporter workers may have special skills from passive learning or active training
at former exporters, they may know individual clients or have broad insight into destination-market
characteristics, or their prior exporter employment may simply signal a screened but unobserved
ability.
    Our results are consistent with the idea that firms, especially firms with long-term export potential,
actively contract a competitive workforce to add to their initial advantage, and then select to export.
So firms prepare for expected export-market participation through prior workforce upgrading. These
workforce preparations are consistent with recent trade models where firms can both choose export-
market participation and engage in innovation, while each activity raises the return to the other. A
firm’s competitive advantage is therefore partly under its own control, and firms share in an economy’s
knowledge pool through mobile workers.

Appendix

A        Data Appendix

A.1 SECEX exports data
All export values in the S ECEX exports data are reported in current U.S. dollars (USD), free on board
(fob). We have observations on exporting plants, declared export values and export destinations for
the years 1990 through 2001. We aggregate monthly plant-level export information to years and firms.
We deflate export sales to their August-1994 equivalents using the monthly U.S. consumer price index
(from Global Financial Data). The choice of August 1994 is motivated by the timing of Brazil’s last
major currency reform in July 1994, which put the Brazilian Real (BRL) value at an initial exchange
rate of one with the U.S. dollar (USD).
       Exporting is transitory for most Brazilian exporters. Similar to evidence in Brooks (2006) for
Colombian plants between 1981 and 1991, only a fraction of any cohort of first-time exporters con-
tinues to export after a year. Of the 1993 cohort, for instance, less than a quarter of firms is still an
exporter by 1998, five years later. Of the 1996 cohort, only slightly more than a quarter of firms is
still an exporter by 2001.27


A.2 RAIS linked employer-employee data
Brazilian law requires every Brazilian plant to submit detailed annual reports with individual infor-
mation on its employees to the ministry of labor (Ministério de Trabalho, MTE). The collection of
the reports is called Relação Anual de Informações Sociais, or R AIS, and typically concluded at the
parent firm by March for the preceding year of observation. By design, R AIS covers all formally
employed workers in any sector (including the public sector) and tracks workers nationwide over
time between formal jobs. Workers with no current formal employment, however, are not in R AIS.
Our version of the data provides monthly spell information on individually identified workers at in-
dividually identified plants. Similar to our treatment of the S ECEX data, we aggregate the monthly
worker-plant information to years and firms for most of our analysis. (For Mincer log wage regres-
sions at the worker level we retain the last recorded and highest-paid job spell, randomly dropping

ties, in a given year and estimate cross-sectional employer fixed effects at the plant level.) Annual
aggregation removes seasonal fluctuations in worker accession and separation rates from the data.
    R AIS primarily provides information to a federal wage supplement program (Abono Salarial), by
which every worker with formal employment during the calendar year receives the equivalent of a
monthly minimum wage. A strong incentive for compliance is that workers’ benefits depend on R AIS
so that workers follow up on their records. The ministry of labor estimates that currently 97 percent of
all formally employed workers in Brazil are covered in R AIS, and that coverage exceeded 90 percent
throughout the 1990s.
    We keep observations for the years 1990 through 2001, drop all firms outside manufacturing,
and then use the data for the construction of several sets of variables. First, we use employment
on December 31st to obtain information on the firm’s workforce size and composition across all its
plants. We pay attention mainly to the education and occupation categories and construct according
shares and changes over time (see Appendix A.2 for definitions). Second, we use worker IDs to trace
recent hires at potential exporting firms back to their preceding employer and count the number of
gross hires who were employed at an exporter in their immediately preceding job. For the purpose of
worker tracking, we restrict the worker sample to all proper worker IDs (11-digit PIS).
    Third, we obtain industry information for every firm. R AIS reports industries at the subsector
IBGE     classification (roughly comparable to the NAICS 2007 three-digit level) over the full sample
period. Subsector IBGE industries are recorded by plant, however. There are multi-plant firms in our
sample, and we assign the industry associated with most employees in a given year to multi-plant
firms. At the subsector      IBGE   level, there are twelve manufacturing industries in R AIS. The main
sector affiliation of firms varies over time. There are 36,599 observations of firms that change sector
so that firm effects are not nested within sector effects in later empirical analysis. While R AIS offers
comprehensive workforce information, data on domestic sales are neither available from S ECEX nor
R AIS.
    Table A.1 reports firm counts, the share of exporters (from the link to S ECEX exporter infor-
mation) and select firm characteristics by subsector           IBGE .28   On average, only about 5 percent of
Brazilian formal-sector manufacturing firms are exporters, a considerably smaller share than in Chile

     We consider as industrialized countries the 24 OECD member countries in 1990: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada,
Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nor-
way, Portugal (including Madeira Islands), Spain (including Alborán, Parsley Island, and Canary Islands), Switzerland,
Turkey, United Kingdom (including Channel Islands), and the United States. We exclude the following types of exports
and destinations: immediate reexports of imports, on-board aircraft consumption, and non-declared destinations.

(21 percent of manufacturing plants export in 1990-96, see Álvarez and López 2005), or Colombia
(18 percent of plants in 1991, see Brooks 2006) and Mexico (36 percent of plants in 1996, see Iacov-
one and Javorcik 2012). Our data are more closely comparable to the U.S. universe of manufacturing
firms (a 5 percent exporter share in the U.S. universe of manufacturing firms, see Bernard, Jensen and
Schott 2009).
       Exporting is most frequent in machinery and equipment manufacturing industries, where work-
force sizes per firm also tend to be large. Except for transportation equipment, the industries with
most frequent exporting are populated by firms with below-average sizes and below-average exports
per firm. We account for sector differences with industry-fixed effects in all regressions.


A.3 Education and occupation categories in RAIS
We group education information from nine R AIS education categories into three categories as shown
in Table A.2.
       Occupation indicators derive from the 3-digit        CBO    classification codes in our nationwide R AIS
data base, and are reclassified to conform to           ISCO -88.29     We map R AIS occupations into   ISCO -88

occupations and regroup them into five categories as shown in Table A.3.

Earnings. We use the monthly December wage paid to workers with employment on December
31st of a given year. R AIS reports the December wage in multiples of the current minimum wage. We
use the log of annualized December wages as our earnings measure, defined as the reported monthly
wage times the December U.S. dollar equivalent of the current minimum wage times 12. Similar to
export values, we deflate this earning measure to its August-1994 equivalent using the monthly U.S.
consumer price index (from Global Financial Data).


Legal form.    R AIS reports a firm’s legal form, including its direct foreign ownership by a foreign
company (the according legal form code is “branch or office of foreign company”). Indirect foreign
ownership, minority foreign ownership, or portfolio holdings do not fall under this category. We use
the annual mode of legal form across the firms’ workers to deal with occasional coding errors of legal
form. The self-reported foreign-ownership category in R AIS potentially differs from foreign own-
ership in Poole (2013), who uses independent information on direct and indirect foreign ownership
from the Central Bank of Brazil for a shorter sample period.
