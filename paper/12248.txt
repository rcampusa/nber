                                            ABSTRACT

We identify the relative importance of changes in the conditional variance of fundamentals (which
we call “uncertainty”) and changes in risk aversion (“risk” for short) in the determination of the term
structure, equity prices and risk premiums. Theoretically, we introduce persistent time-varying
uncertainty about the fundamentals in an external habit model. The model matches the dynamics of
dividend and consumption growth, including their volatility dynamics and many salient asset market
phenomena. While the variation in dividend yields and the equity risk premium is primarily driven
by risk, uncertainty plays a large role in the term structure and is the driver of counter-cyclical
volatility of asset returns.

1     Introduction

Without variation in discount rates, it is diﬃcult to explain the behavior of aggregate stock prices
within the confines of rational pricing models. An old literature, starting with Pindyck (1988),
focused on changes in the variance of fundamentals as a source of price fluctuations, suggesting that
increased variances would depress prices. Poterba and Summers (1986) argued that the persistence
of return variances does not suﬃce to account for the volatility of observed stock returns, whereas
Barsky (1989) was the first to focus attention on the fact that increased uncertainty may also aﬀect
riskless rates in equilibrium which may undermine the expected price eﬀects. Abel (1988) examined
the eﬀects of changes in the riskiness of dividends on stock prices and risk premiums in a Lucas
(1978) general equilibrium model, with the perhaps surprising result that increased riskiness only
lowers asset prices when the coeﬃcient of risk aversion is lower than one.
    Changes in the conditional variance of fundamentals (either consumption growth or dividend
growth) as a source of asset price fluctuations are making a comeback in the recent work of Bansal
and Yaron (2004), Bansal, Khatchatrian and Yaron (2002), and Bansal and Lundblad (2002), which
we discuss in more detail below.          Nevertheless, most of the recent literature has not focused on
changes in the variability of fundamentals as the main source of fluctuations in asset prices and risk
premiums but on changes in risk aversion and risk preferences. The main catalyst here was the
work of Campbell and Cochrane (1999), CC henceforth, who showed that a model with counter-
cyclical risk aversion could account for a large equity premium, substantial variation in returns and
price-dividend ratios and long-horizon predictability of returns. There have been a large number
of extensions and elaborations of the CC framework (see e.g. Bekaert, Engstrom and Grenadier
(2004), Brandt and Wang (2003), Buraschi and Jiltsov (2005), Menzly, Santos and Veronesi (2004),
and Wachter (2004)) and a large number of articles trying to find an economic mechanism for changes
in aggregate prices of risk (Chan and Kogan (2002), Lustig and Van Nieuwerburgh (2003), Santos
and Veronesi (2000), Piazzesi, Schneider and Tuzel (2003), and Wei (2003)).
    In this article, we try to identify the relative importance of changes in the conditional variance of
fundamentals (which we call “uncertainty”) and changes in risk aversion (“risk” for short)2 . We build
   2 Hence, the term uncertainty is used in a diﬀerent meaning than in the growing literature on Knightian uncertainty,

see for instance Epstein and Schneider (2004). It is also consistent with a small literature in international finance
which has focused on the eﬀect of changes in uncertainty on exchange rates and currency risk premiums, see Hodrick
(1989, 1990) and Bekaert (1996). The Hodrick (1989) paper provided the obvious inspiration for the title to this
paper.

on the external habit model formulated in Bekaert, Engstrom and Grenadier (2004) which features
stochastic risk aversion and introduce persistent time-varying uncertainty in the fundamentals. We
explore the eﬀects of both on price dividend ratios, equity risk premiums, the conditional variability
of equity returns and the term structure, both theoretically and empirically. To diﬀerentiate time-
varying uncertainty from stochastic risk aversion empirically, we use information on higher moments
in dividend and consumption growth and the conditional relation between their volatility and a
number of instruments.
   The model is consistent with the empirical volatility dynamics of dividend and consumption
growth and matches a large number of salient asset market features, including a large equity premium
and low risk free rate and the volatilities of equity returns, dividend yields and interest rates. We
find that variation in the equity premium is driven by both risk and uncertainty with risk aversion
dominating. However, variation in asset prices (consol prices and dividend yields) is primarily due
to changes in risk. These results arise because risk aversion acts primarily as a level factor in the
term structure while uncertainty aﬀects both the level and the slope of the real term structure and
also governs the riskiness of the equity cash flow stream. Consequently, our work provides a new
perspective on recent advances in asset pricing modelling. We confirm the importance of economic
uncertainty as stressed by Bansal and Yaron (2004) and Kandel and Stambaugh (1990) but show
that changes in risk are critical too. However, the main channel through which risk aﬀects asset
prices in our model is the term structure, a channel shut oﬀ in the original Campbell and Cochrane
(1999) paper while stressed by the older partial equilibrium work of Barsky (1989).
   The remainder of the article is organized as follows. The second section sets out the theoretical
model and motivates the use of our state variables to model time-varying uncertainty of both dividend
and consumption growth. In the third section, we derive closed-from solutions for price-dividend
ratios and real and nominal bond prices as a function of the state variables and model parameters
and examine some comparative statics results. We also demonstrate that two extant models, Abel
(1988) and Wu (2001), severely restrict the relationship between uncertainty and equity prices and
show why this is so. In the fourth section, we set out our empirical strategy. We use the General
Method of Moments (Hansen (1982), GMM henceforth) to estimate the parameters of the model.
The fifth section reports parameter estimates and discusses how well the model fits salient features
of the data. The sixth section reports various variance decompositions and dissects how uncertainty
and risk aversion aﬀect asset prices. Section 7 concludes.

2     Theoretical Model

2.1    Fundamentals and Uncertainty

To model fundamentals and uncertainty, we begin with the specification of Abel (1988) but enrich
the framework in a number of dimensions.      Abel (1988) models log dividends as having a persis-
tent conditional mean and persistent conditional variance and models the stochastic behavior of the
conditional mean and the conditional coeﬃcient of variation of dividends. Hence, he assumes that
dividends are stationary. We modify this set up to allow for a unit root in the dividend process, as
is customary in modern asset pricing, and model dividend growth as having a stochastic volatility
process. In addition, we relax the assumption that dividends and consumption are identically equal.
While consumption and dividends coincide in the original Lucas (1978) framework and many sub-
sequent studies, recent papers have emphasized the importance of recognizing that consumption is
financed by sources of income outside of the aggregate equity dividend stream, for example Santos
and Veronesi (2005), and Bansal, Dittmar and Lundblad (2004). Our modeling choice for dividends
and stochastic volatility is described by the following equations.


                                                   √    ¡                  ¢
                           ∆dt = µd + ρdu ut−1 +    vt−1 σdd εdt + σdv εvt                        (1)
                                                     √
                             vt = µv + ρvv vt−1 + σvv vt−1 εvt


where dt = log (Dt ) denotes log dividends, ut is the demeaned and detrended log consumption-
dividend ratio (described further below) and vt represents “uncertainty,” and is proportional to the
conditional volatility of the dividend growth process.    All innovations in the model, including εdt
and εvt follow independent N (0, 1) distributions. Consequently, covariances must be explicitly para-
meterized. With this specification, the conditional mean of dividend growth varies potentially with
past values of the consumption-dividend ratio, which is expected to be a slowly moving stationary
process. Uncertainty itself follows a square-root process and may be arbitrarily correlated with div-
idend growth through the σdv parameter. The sign of σdv is not a priori obvious. From a corporate
finance perspective, an increase in the volatility of firm cash flows may increase the present value
of the costs of financial distress but it may also make growth options more valuable (see Shin and
Stulz (2000) for a recent survey). Because it is a latent factor, vt can be scaled arbitrarily without
empirical consequence and we therefore fix its unconditional mean at unity.


                                                  3
   We model consumption as stochastically cointegrated with dividends, in a fashion similar to
Bansal, Dittmar and Lundblad (2004), so that the consumption dividend ratio, ut , becomes a
relevant state variable. We model ut symmetrically with dividend growth,

                                                                               √
                      ut = µu + ρuu ut−1 + σud (∆dt − Et−1 [∆dt ]) + σuu        vt−1 εut .                  (2)


By definition, consumption growth, ∆ct , is


 ∆ct = δ + ∆dt + ∆ut
                                                          √    ¡                 ¢     √
      = (δ + µu + µd ) + (ρdu + ρuu − 1) ut−1 + (1 + σud ) vt−1 σdd εdt + σdv εvt + σuu vt−1 εut . (3)


Note that δ and µu cannot be jointly identified.           We proceed by setting the unconditional mean
of ut to zero and then identify δ as the diﬀerence in means of consumption and dividend growth.3
Consequently, the consumption growth specification accommodates arbitrary correlation between
dividend and consumption growth, with heteroskedasticity driven by vt .               The conditional means
of both consumption and dividend growth depend on the consumption-dividend ratio, which is an
AR(1) process.      Consequently, the reduced form model for dividend and consumption growth is
an ARM A(1, 1) which can accommodate either the standard nearly uncorrelated processes widely
assumed in the literature, or the Bansal and Yaron (2004) specification where consumption and
dividend growth have a long-run predictable component. Bansal and Yaron (2004) do not link the
long run component to the consumption-dividend ratio as they do not assume consumption and
dividends are cointegrated.4
   Our specification raises two important questions. First, is there heteroskedasticity in consump-
tion and dividend growth data? Second, can this heteroskedasticity be captured using our single
latent variable specification? Perhaps surprisingly, there is substantial aﬃrmative evidence regard-
ing the first question, but to our knowledge none regarding the second question. Ferson and Merrick
(1987), Whitelaw (2000) and Bekaert and Liu (2004) all demonstrate that consumption growth
volatility varies through time. For our purposes, the analysis in Bansal, Khatchatrian and Yaron
(2004) and Kandel and Stambaugh (1990) is most relevant. The former show that price-dividend

ratio.
   4 In a recent paper, Bansal, Gallant and Tauchen (2004) show that both a Campbell Cochrane (1999) and a

Bansal-Yaron type model fit the data equally well.



                                                       4
ratios predict consumption growth volatility with a negative sign and that consumption growth
volatility is persistent. Kandel and Stambaugh (1990) link consumption growth volatility to three
state variables, the dividend yield, the AAA versus T-Bill spread, and the BBB versus AA spread.
They find that, consistent with the Bansal et. al. (2004) results, dividend yields positively aﬀect
consumption growth volatility. In Table 1, we extend and modify this analysis. We estimate the
following model by GMM,


                              x2t+k = ν0 + ν1 rft + ν2 dpft + ν3 spdt + εt+k                           (4)


where we alternatively model ∆dft and ∆cft , (filtered) dividend and consumption growth, as xt . Be-
cause the observable fundamental series are filtered using a four-period moving average to eliminate
seasonality, the prediction lag, k, is set at four quarters. Above, rft is the risk free rate, dpft is the
(also filtered) dividend yield, and spdt is the nominal term spread.        We defer a discussion of the
data to Section 4 of the article. Suﬃce it to say that our analysis uses data starting in 1926 (but
we lose one year when calculating lags), whereas the previous papers use post-war samples.             We
considered an alternative model where time-variation in the conditional means was removed and the
conditional variance of the residuals was modelled as in Equation (4). Because consumption and
dividend growth display little variation in the conditional mean, the results were quite similar for
this case.
   The results are reported in Table 1. Panel A focuses on univariate tests while Panel B reports
multivariate tests.    Wald tests in the multivariate specification very strongly reject the null of
no time variation for the volatility of both consumption and dividend growth. Moreover, all three
instruments are significant predictors of volatility in their own right: high interest rates are associated
with low volatility, high term spreads are associated with high volatility as are high dividend yields.
The results in Bansal et al (2004) and Kandel and Stambaugh (1990) regarding the dividend yield
predicting economic uncertainty appear robust to the sample period and are also valid for dividend
growth volatility.
   Note that the coeﬃcients on the instruments for the dividend growth volatility are 5-15 times as
high as for the consumption growth equation. This suggests that one latent variable may capture the
variation in both. We test this conjecture by estimating a restricted version of the model where the
slope coeﬃcients are proportional across the dividend and consumption equations. This restriction



                                                    5
is not rejected, with a p-value of 0.8958.           We conclude that our use of a single latent factor for
both fundamental consumption and dividend growth volatility is appropriate. The proportionality
constant, η, is 0.0807, implying that the dividend slope coeﬃcients are about 12 times larger than
the consumption slope coeﬃcients.
   The last two lines of Panel B examine the cyclical pattern in the fundamentals’ heteroskedasticity,
demonstrating a strong counter-cyclical pattern. This is an important finding as it intimates that
heteroskedasticity may be the driver of the counter-cyclical Sharpe ratios stressed by Campbell and
Cochrane (1999) and interpreted as counter-cyclical risk aversion.
   Table 1 (Panel A) also presents similar predictability results for excess equity returns.               We
will later use these results as a metric to judge whether our estimated model is consistent with
the evidence for variation in the conditional volatility of returns.             While the signs are the same
as in the fundamentals’ equations and the t-statistics are well over one, none of the coeﬃcients are
significantly diﬀerent from zero at conventional significance levels.


2.2    Investor Preferences

Following CC, consider a complete markets economy as in Lucas (1978), but modify the preferences
of the representative agent to have the form:
                                           "∞                              #
                                            X                − Ht )1−γ − 1
                                                     t (Ct
                                      E0         β                           ,                             (5)
                                           t=0
                                                               1−γ

where Ct is aggregate consumption and Ht is an exogenous “external habit stock” with Ct > Ht .
   One motivation for an “external” habit stock is the “keeping up with the Joneses” framework
of Abel (1990, 1999) where Ht represents past or current aggregate consumption. Small individual
investors take Ht as given, and then evaluate their own utility relative to that benchmark.5                In
CC, Ht is taken as an exogenously modelled subsistence or habit level. In this situation, the local
                                                                         ³        ´
coeﬃcient of relative risk aversion can be shown to be γ CtC−H
                                                             t
                                                               t
                                                                 , where   Ct −Ht
                                                                             Ct     is defined as the
surplus ratio. As the surplus ratio goes to zero, the consumer’s risk aversion goes to infinity. In our
model, we view the inverse of the surplus ratio as a preference shock, which we denote by Qt . Thus,
                  Ct
we have Qt ≡    Ct −Ht ,   in which case risk aversion is now characterized by γQt , and Qt > 1. As Qt
changes over time, the representative consumer investor’s “moodiness” changes, which led Bekaert,
  5 For empirical analyses of habit formation models where habit depends on past consumption, see Heaton (1995)

and Bekaert (1996).

Engstrom and Grenadier (2004) to label this a “moody investor economy.”
   The marginal rate of substitution in this model determines the real pricing kernel, which we
denote by Mt . Taking the ratio of marginal utilities of time t + 1 and t, we obtain:

                                         (Ct+1 /Ct )−γ
                              Mt+1 = β               −γ                                          (6)
                                         (Qt+1 /Qt )

                                    = β exp [−γ∆ct+1 + γ (qt+1 − qt )] ,


where qt = ln(Qt ).
   We proceed by assuming qt follows an autoregressive square root process which is contempora-
neously correlated with fundamentals, but also possesses its own innovation,

                                                                        √
                      qt = µq + ρqq qt−1 + σqc (∆ct − Et−1 [∆ct ]) + σqq qt−1 εqt                (7)


As with vt , qt is a latent variable and can therefore be scaled arbitrarily without economic conse-
quence; we therefore set its unconditional mean at unity. In our specification, Qt is not be forced
to be perfectly negatively correlated with consumption growth as in Campbell and Cochrane (1999)
and other interpretations of habit persistence. In this sense, our preference shock specification is
closest in spirit to that of Brandt and Wang (2003) who also allow for Qt to be correlated with
other business-cycle factors. Only if σqq = 0 and σqc < 0 does a Campbell Cochrane like specifica-
tion obtain where consumption growth and risk aversion shocks are perfectly negatively correlated.
Consequently, we can test whether independent preference shocks are an important part of varia-
tion in risk aversion or whether its variation is dominated by shocks to fundamentals. Note that
the covariance between qt and consumption growth depends on vt which is itself counter-cyclical.
Hence, when σqc < 0, risk aversion and consumption are negatively correlated with the increase in
risk aversion in recessions a positive function of the degree of fundamental uncertainty.


2.3    Inflation

When confronting consumption-based models with the data, real variables have to be translated
into nominal terms. Furthermore, inflation may be important in realistically modeling the joint
dynamics of equity returns, the short rate and the term spread. Therefore, we append the model




                                                   7
with a simple inflation process,


                              πt = µπ + ρππ πt−1 + κEt−1 [∆ct ] + σπ επt                           (8)


The impact of expected ‘real’ growth on inflation can be motivated by macroeconomic intuition, such
as the Phillips curve (in which case we expect κ to be positive). Because there is no contemporaneous
correlation between this inflation process and the real pricing kernel, the one-period short rate will
not include an inflation risk premium. However, non-zero correlations between the pricing kernel
and inflation may arise at longer horizons due to the impact of Et−1 [∆ct ] on the conditional mean of
inflation. Note that expected real consumption growth varies only with ut ; hence, the specification
in Equation (8) is equivalent to one where ρπu ut−1 replaces κEt−1 [∆ct ].
                                                                  b t+1 , that is a simple transfor-
   To price nominal assets, we define the nominal pricing kernel, m
mation of the log real pricing kernel, mt+1 ,

   To summarize, our model has five state variables with dynamics described by the equations,


                                             √    ¡                  ¢
                     ∆dt = µd + ρdu ut−1 +    vt−1 σdd εdt + σdv εvt
                                               √
                       vt = µv + ρvv vt−1 + σvv vt−1 εvt
                                                                         √
                       ut = ρuu ut−1 + σud (∆dt − Et−1 [∆dt ]) + σuu      vt−1 εut
                                                                         √
                       qt = µq + ρqq qt−1 + σqc (∆ct − Et−1 [∆ct ]) + σqq qt−1 εqt

with ∆ct = δ + ∆dt + ∆ut .
   As discussed above, the unconditional means of vt and qt are set equal to unity so that µv and
µq are not free parameters. Finally, the real pricing kernel can be represented by the expression,

3     Asset Pricing

In this section, we present exact solutions for asset prices, and gain some intuition for how the model
works. We then compare the behavior of our model to its predecessors in the literature, such as
Abel (1988), Wu (2001) Bansal and Yaron (2004) and Campbell and Cochrane (1999). Our model
represents a more elaborate framework than any of these. This is necessary because the scope of
the current investigation is wider than that of former studies. As we will see shortly, this model is
better able to match a wide variety of empirical features of the data which we believe is necessary to
credibly discern the relative importance of uncertainty versus stochastic preferences in decomposing
variation in asset prices and the equity premium.                However, a drawback of this richness is that
while we are able to readily calculate exact pricing formulas for stocks and bonds, these solutions
are suﬃciently complex and nonlinear that it is diﬃcult, for instance, to trace pricing eﬀects back
to any single parameter’s value. Below, we provide as much intuition as possible.
    The general pricing principle in this model is simple and follows the framework of Bekaert and
Grenadier (2001). Assume an asset pays a real coupon stream Kt+τ , τ = 1, 2...T . We consider
three assets: a real consol with Kt+τ = 1, T = ∞, a nominal consol with Kt+τ = Π−1
                                                                                t,τ , T = ∞,

(where Πt,τ represents cumulative gross inflation from t to τ )and equity with Kt+τ = Dt+τ , T = ∞.
The case of equity will be slightly more complex because dividends are non-stationary (see below).
Then, the price-coupon ratio can be written as

                                           ⎧             ⎡                  ⎤⎫
                                           ⎨n=T
                                             X            Xn                 ⎬
                             P Ct = Et               exp ⎣   (mt+j + ∆kt+j )⎦                            (13)
                                           ⎩                                 ⎭
                                               n=1         j=1


By induction, it is straight forward to show that

                             n=T
                             X

for X ∈ [A, B, C, D, E, F ].     The exact form of these functions depends on the particular coupon
stream as we now demonstrate. We proceed by first pricing real bonds (bonds that pay out 1 unit
of the consumption good at a particular point in time), then nominal bonds and finally equity.


3.1     Real Term Structure

Consider the term structure of real zero coupon bonds. The well known recursive pricing relationship
governing the term structure of these bond prices is

                                          σqu = σqc σuu

and A0 = B0 = C0 = E0 = F0 = 0. (Proof in Appendix).

   We will examine the dynamics implied by this solution shortly, but first it is instructive to note
the form of the price-coupon ratio of a hypothetical real consol (with constant real coupons) in the
following proposition. This result is immediate once it is realized that the payoﬀs to such a consol
are the sum of those of the above real bonds.

Proposition 2 Under the conditions set out in Proposition 1, the price-coupon ratio of a consol
paying a constant real coupon is given by
                                 ∞
                                 X
                        Ptrc =         exp (An + Bn ∆dt + Cn ut + En vt + Fn qt )                (18)
                                 n=1

   Note that inflation has zero impact on real bond prices, but will, of course, aﬀect the nominal
term structure.
   We now examine the impact of fundamentals on the real term structure of bond prices, starting
with the consumption-dividend ratio, captured by the Cn term. The lagged consumption-dividend
ratio enters the conditional mean of both dividend growth and itself. Either of these channels will
in general impact future consumption growth given Equation (3). If, for example, the net eﬀect of
a high consumption-dividend ratio is higher expected future consumption growth, then this implies
lower future marginal utility. All else equal, investors will desire to borrow from this happy future,
but since bonds are assumed to be in zero net supply, interest rates must rise to oﬀset the borrowing
motive.
   The volatility factor, vt , has important term structure eﬀects because it aﬀects the volatility of
both consumption growth and qt . As such, vt aﬀects the volatility of the pricing kernel, thereby
creating precautionary savings eﬀects. In times of high uncertainty, investors desire to save more.

                                                     11
For equilibrium to obtain, interest rates must fall, raising bond prices. Note that the second, third
and fourth lines of the En are positive: increased volatility unambiguously drives up bond prices.
Thus the model features a classic ‘flight to quality’ eﬀect. If we look at the ‘direct’ eﬀect, we find
                                                                             2

                                              ³                             ´

                                         σcc ≡ (1 + σud ) σdd + σdv   + σuu   .                         (19)


   The risk aversion variable, qt , aﬀects bond prices through oﬀsetting utility smoothing and precau-
tionary savings channels. A high current realization of qt leads to an expectation that future qt will
be relatively lower (due to stationarity), indicating a lower future marginal utility state. Smoothing
motives again induce a desire to borrow from the future, forcing down bond prices in equilibrium.
These eﬀects are captured by the first two terms in the Fn equation. On the other hand, higher qt
also increases the volatility of the pricing kernel, which tends to increase the precautionary savings
motive.   This eﬀect is governed by the third term in the expression for Fn . In sum, the direct
eﬀect (that is, excluding lagged functional coeﬃcients) of a unit change in qt on the consol price is
γ (ρqq − 1) +   1
                2   (γσqq )2 .
   It is instructive to gain some further insight into the determinants of the term structure in this
model. Let us first focus on the real interest rate. While the rate is implicit in Proposition 1, it is
also useful to derive it exploiting the log-normality of the model:

                                                                 1
                                             rrft = −Et [mt+1 ] − Vt [mt+1 ] .                          (20)
                                                                 2

The conditional mean of the pricing kernel economically represents consumption smoothing whereas
the variance of the kernel represents precautionary savings eﬀects.               To make notation less cum-
bersome in terms of notation, let us reparameterize the consumption growth process as having
conditional mean and variance


                             Et [∆ct+1 ] = δ + µd + (ρdu + ρuu − 1) ut ≡ µc + ρcu ut
                                                   2
                                 Vt [∆ct+1 ] = vt σcc .                                                 (21)




                                                            12
Then the real rate simplifies to


                        rrft = − ln (β) + γ (µc − µq ) + γρcu ut + φrq qt + φrv vt                    (22)


with φrq = γ (1 − ρqq ) − 12 γ 2 σqq
                                  2
                                     and φrv = − 12 γ 2 (σqc − 1)2 σcc
                                                                    2
                                                                       . Consequently, our model features a
three-factor real interest rate model, with the consumption-dividend ratio, risk aversion, and uncer-
tainty as the three factors. Changes in risk have an ambiguous eﬀect on interest rates depending on
whether the smoothing or precautionary savings eﬀect dominates (the sign of φrq ). If vt is indeed
counter cyclical, then variation in vt will tend to make real rates pro-cyclical.
   To obtain intuition for the term spread, let us consider a two period bond and exploit the
log-normality of the model. We can decompose the spread into three components:

                              1                      1                       1
            rrf2,t − rrft =     Et [rrft+1 − rrft ] + Covt [mt+1 , rrft+1 ] − V art [rrft+1 ]
                              2                      2                       4

The first term is the standard expectations hypothesis (EH) term, the second term represents the
term premium and the third is a Jensen’s inequality term (which we will ignore). Because of mean
reversion, the eﬀects of ut , vt , and qt on the first component will be opposite of their eﬀects on
the level of the short rate.     For example, the coeﬃcient on qt in the EH term is φrq (ρqq − 1).
Because preference shocks are positively correlated with marginal utility, the term premium eﬀect
of qt will counter-balance the EH eﬀect when φrq > 0. In fact, it is straightforward to show that
the coeﬃcient on qt for the term premium is 12 γφrq σqq
                                                     2
                                                        .
   Increased uncertainty depresses short rates and, consequently, the EH eﬀect implies that uncer-
tainty increases term spreads. The eﬀect of vt on the term premium is very complex because the
correlation between qt and the kernel is also driven by vt . In fact, straightforward algebra shows
that the coeﬃcient on vt is proportional to

         £ 2                                ¡                            ¡ 2     2
                                                                                    ¢              ¢¤
(σqc − 1) σuu (γρuc + φrq σqc ) + (1 + σud ) γρuc σud + φrq σqc (σud + 1) σdd + σdv   − φrv σvv σdv .


While the expression looks impossible to sign in general, it is at least conceivable the eﬀect is positive.
If that is the case, the EH and term premium eﬀects reinforce one another.

We proceed as with the real term structure, keeping in mind that the appropriate recursion for the

nominal term structure involves the nominal pricing kernel, m
The pricing relationship governing the nominal term structure of bond prices is therefore

   From Proposition 3, we can immediately glean the salient diﬀerences between the real and nom-
inal term structures.              en equation captures a drift eﬀect from µπ - high unconditional
                        First, the A
inflation erodes the value of the prices of nominal bonds relative to their real counterparts. Addition-
ally, a volatility eﬀect, through σππ , is unambiguously positive, but is of second order importance.
                                                                                      en and D
   Second, the eﬀect of changes in inflation on the term structure is captured in the C      en
                                        e n implies higher inflation levels will further erode nominal
terms. Assume ρππ > 0, the equation for D
bond prices, in line with economic intuition. Furthermore, because expected inflation is also aﬀected
by expected consumption growth through ut , if inflation responds positively to higher real growth,


                                                  14

there will be a further relative erosion of nominal bond prices through C
   Because the conditional covariance between the real kernel and inflation is zero, the nominal
short rate satisfies the Fisher hypothesis,

                                                                  1 2

The last term is the standard Jensen’s inequality eﬀect and the previous three terms represent
expected inflation.

In any present value model, under a no-bubble transversality condition, the equity price-dividend
ratio is represented by the conditional expectation,

        Pt
where   Dt   is the price dividend ratio.      This conditional expectation can also be solved in our
framework as an exponential-aﬃne function of the state vector, as is summarized in the following
proposition.

   It is clear upon examination of Propositions 1 and 4 that the price-coupon ratio of a real consol
and the price-dividend ratio of an equity claim share many reactions to the state variables. This
makes perfect intuitive sense. An equity claim may be viewed simply as a real consol with stochastic
coupons. Of particular interest in this study is the diﬀerence in the eﬀects of state variables on the
two financial instruments.
                        bn illuminates an additional impact of a high realization of the consumption-
   Inspection of Cn and C
dividend ratio, ut , on the price-dividend ratio.    This marginal eﬀect depends positively on ρdu .
Feedback from ut to the conditional mean of ∆dt may cause higher expected cash flows when ut is
high, increasing equity valuations.
   Above, we established that higher uncertainty decreases interest rates and increases consol prices.
Hence a first order eﬀect of higher uncertainty is a positive ‘term structure’ eﬀect. Two channels
govern the diﬀerential impact of vt on equity prices relative to consol prices. This is evident upon
                                         bn . Let us take them in turn. The two eﬀects are governed
inspection of the expressions for En and E
by the volatility of future cash flows and the covariance between future cash flows and the pricing
kernel. First, the terms, 12 σdd
                              2
                                 and 12 σdv
                                         2
                                            arise from Jensen’s Inequality and tend towards an eﬀect
of higher cash flow volatility increasing equity prices relative to consol prices. While this may seem
counterintuitive, it is simply an artifact of the log-normal structure of the model. The key terms
for describing the riskiness of cash flows are represented by the second two lines in the expression for
bn . They arise from the conditional covariance between cash flow growth and the pricing kernel.

As in all modern rational asset pricing models, a negative covariance between the pricing kernel and
cash flows induces a positive risk premium and depresses valuation. The ‘direct eﬀect’ terms (those
                                                                                       bn line in
excluding lagged functional coeﬃcients) can be signed. For the second two lines of the E
Proposition 3, they are,
                                                          ¡ 2     2
                                                                     ¢
                                  −γ (1 + σud ) (1 − σqc ) σdd + σdv

If the conditional covariance between consumption growth and dividend growth is positive, (1 + σud ) >
0, and consumption is negatively correlated with qt , σqc < 0, then the dividend stream is negatively
correlated with the kernel and increases in vt exacerbate this covariance risk. Consequently, uncer-
tainty has two primary eﬀects on stock valuation: a positive term structure eﬀect and a potentially
negative cash flow eﬀect.
   Interestingly, there is no marginal pricing diﬀerence in the eﬀect of qt on riskless versus risky
coupon streams: the expressions for Fn and Fbn are functionally identical.         This is true by con-
struction in this model because the preference variable, qt , aﬀects neither the conditional mean nor
volatility of cash flow growth, nor the conditional covariance between the cash flow stream and
the pricing kernel at any horizon.     We purposefully excluded such relationships for two reasons.
Economically, it does not seem reasonable for investor preferences to aﬀect the productivity of the
proverbial Lucas tree. Secondly, it would be empirically very hard to identify distinct eﬀects of vt
and qt without exactly these kinds of exclusion restrictions.
   Finally, note that inflation has no role in determining equity prices for the same reason that it
has no role in determining the real term structure. While such eﬀects may be present in the data,
we do not believe them to be of first order importance for the question at hand.


3.3.1   Relation to Previous Literature

It is useful at this point to reflect on the diﬀerences between these equity pricing results and those of
two other papers which have considered the eﬀects of uncertainty on equity prices. First, Abel (1988)
creates an economy in which the eﬀect of increased cash flow volatility on equity prices depends on
a single parameter, the coeﬃcient of relative risk aversion. That setup is vastly diﬀerent from ours.
Most importantly, Abel (1988) maintains that dividends themselves are stationary and so are prices
(at least on a per-capita basis). Also , there is no distinction between consumption and dividends
in his model, so that the covariance of cash flows with the pricing kernel and the volatility of the



                                                   17
pricing kernel are proportional. Finally, there is no preference shock. In the current framework,
we can consider the eﬀects of some of Abel’s assumptions by simply shutting down the dynamics of
the consumption dividend ratio (ut = 0) and stochastic risk aversion (qt = 0). However, we do not
implement Abel’s assumption that dividends and prices are stationary.

tion that the following parameters are zero,

to alter the riskiness of the dividend stream beyond the real term structure eﬀects because cash
flows and the pricing kernel are proportional. Clearly, Abel’s result is not robust to these diﬀerent
distributional assumptions and this simplified framework is too restrictive for our purposes.
   Wu (2001) develops a model wherein increases in volatility unambiguously depress the price-
dividend ratio.   The key diﬀerence between his model and ours is that Wu models the interest
rate as exogenous and constant. To recover something like Wu’s results in our framework requires
making the real interest rate process exogenous and maintaining the volatility process of Equation
(10). Assume for example that we introduce a stochastic process xt and modify the specification of

                              ln β   1        γ         √
                       ∆dt =       + xt−1 + vt−1 + vt−1 εdt

                         xt = µx + ρxx xt−1 + σx εxt + σxv vt−1 εvt + σxd vt−1 εdt                 (28)


     It is easily verified that under these specifications and the additional assumptions of Proposition
5, xt is equal to the one-period real risk free rate. The solution for the price-dividend ratio in this
economy is described in the following proposition

     By considering the expression for E n , we can see that the direct eﬀect of an increase in vt is
1
2γ   (1 − γ).   Therefore, only when γ > 1 will an increase in volatility depress the price-dividend
ratio, but this ignores equilibrium term structure eﬀects.     In the context of an endogenous term
structure model therefore, Wu’s results are not readily generalizable.
     Bansal and Yaron (2004) assume that the conditional volatility of consumption growth follows
an AR(1) process proportional to that of dividend growth. By assuming Epstein and Zin (1989)
preferences, they separate the intertemporal elasticity of substitution (IES) from pure risk aversion.
They find that an increase in volatility lowers price-dividend ratios when the IES and risk aversion
are larger than unity.

3.4     Sharpe Ratios

Campbell and Cochrane (1999) point out that in a lognormal model the maximum attainable Sharpe
ratio of any asset is an increasing function of the conditional variance of the log real pricing kernel.
In our model, this is given by,


                              Vt (mt+1 ) = γ 2 σqq
                                                2
                                                   qt + γ 2 (σqc − 1)2 σcc
                                                                        2
                                                                           vt


The Sharpe ratio is increasing in preference shocks and uncertainty. Thus, counter-cyclical variation
in vt may imply counter-cyclical Sharpe ratios. The eﬀect of vt on the Sharpe ratio is larger if risk
aversion is itself negatively correlated with consumption growth. In Campbell and Cochrane (1999),
the kernel variance is a positive function of qt only.



4       Empirical Implementation

In this section, we describe how we bring the model to the data.           We proceed by describing our
data and estimation strategy.


4.1     Data

We measure all variables at the quarterly frequency and our base sample period extends from 1927:1
to 2004:3.


4.1.1    Equity Market

We used the CRSP quarterly data files from 1926-2003 to create stock market variables.                Our
stock return measure is the standard CRSP value-weighted return index. To compute excess equity
returns, rtx , we subtract the 90-day continuously compounded T-Bill yield earned over the same
period (see next subsection for a description of bond market data).             For the dividend yield and
dividend growth, our methods diﬀer slightly from the most common constructions in the literature.
For the dividend yield, we proceed by first calculating a (highly seasonal) quarterly dividend yield
series as,
                                      µ          ¶−1 µ                          ¶
                                          Pt+1           Pt+1 + Dt+1 Pt+1
                            DPt+1 =                                 −
                                           Pt                 Pt      Pt



                                                     20
        Pt+1 +Dt+1         Pt+1
where       Pt       and    Pt    are available directly from the CRSP dataset as the value weighted stock
return series including and excluding dividends respectively. We then use the four-period moving
average of ln (1 + DPt ) as our observable series,

                      1
             dpft =     [ln (1 + DPt ) + ln (1 + DPt−1 ) + ln (1 + DPt−2 ) + ln (1 + DPt−3 )] .
                      4

This measure of the dividend yield diﬀers from the more standard technique of summing dividends
over the course of the past four quarters and simply scaling by the current price.            We prefer our
filter because it represents a linear transformation of the underlying data for which we can account
explicitly when bringing the model to the data. As a practical matter, the properties of our filtered
series and the more standard measure are very similar with close means and volatilities and an
unconditional correlation between the two of approximately 0.95 (results available upon request).
For dividend growth, we fist calculate quarterly dividend growth,

                                                         ∙                ¸
                                                             DPt+1 Pt+1
                                            ∆dt+1 = ln
                                                              DPt Pt

Then, to eliminate seasonality, we use the four-period moving average as the observation series,


                                            1
                                   ∆dft =     (∆dt + ∆dt−1 + ∆dt−2 + ∆dt−3 ) .                         (29)
                                            4

Because the above moving average filters for dividends require four lags, our sample is shortened,
eﬀectively beginning in 1927.


4.1.2    Bond Market and Inflation

We use standard Ibbotson data (from the SBBI Yearbook) for Treasury market and inflation series
for the period 1927-2003. The short rate, rft is the (continuously compounded) 90-day T-Bill rate.
The log yield spread, spdt , is the average log yield for long term government bonds (maturity greater
than ten years) less the short rate. Note that the timing convention of these yields is such that they
are dated when they enter the econometrician’s data set.              For instance, the 90-day T-Bill return
earned over January-March 1990 is dated as December 1989, as it entered the data set at the end
of that month. Inflation, πt , is the continuously compounded end of quarter change in the CPI as
reported by Ibbotson.


                                                         21
4.1.3   Consumption

To avoid the look-ahead bias inherent in standard seasonally adjusted data, we obtained nominal
non-seasonally adjusted (NSA) aggregate non-durable and service consumption data from the web-
site of the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) of the United States Department of Commerce
for the period 1946-2004.      We denote the continuously compounded growth rate of the sum of
non-durable and service consumption series as ∆ct . From 1929-1946, consumption data from the
BEA is available only at the annual frequency.       For these years, we use repeated values equal to
one-fourth of the compounded annual growth rate. Because this methodology has obvious draw-
backs, we repeated all our analysis using an alternate consumption interpolation procedure which
presumed the consumption-dividend ratio, rather than consumption growth was constant over the
year.   Results using this alternate method are very similar to those reported.         Finally, for 1927-
1929, no consumption data is available from the BEA. For these years, we obtain the growth rate
for real per-capita aggregate consumption from the website of Robert Shiller at www.yale.edu, and
computed aggregate nominal consumption growth rates using the inflation data described above in
addition to historical population growth data from the United States Bureau of the Census. Then,
repeated values of the annual growth rate are used as quarterly observations. The raw consumption
growth data was deflated with the inflation series described above. Due to the strong seasonality of
consumption data and to mitigate the near term look-ahead bias of the repeated value methodology
used for converting annual growth rates to the quarterly frequency, we use the four-period moving
average of ∆ct as our observation series,


                                       1
                              ∆cft =     (∆ct + ∆ct−1 + ∆ct−2 + ∆ct−3 ) .                             (30)
                                       4


4.2     Estimation and Testing Procedure

We now discuss the GMM methodology we use to estimate the model parameters.


4.2.1   Parameter Estimation

Our economy has five state variables, which we collect in the vector Yt = [∆dt , vt , ut , qt , πt ]. While
ut , ∆dt and πt are directly linked to the data, vt and qt are latent variables. We are interested in
the implications of the model for seven variables: filtered dividend and consumption growth, ∆dft



                                                    22
and ∆cft , inflation, πt , the short rate, rtf , the term spread, spdt , the dividend yield, dpt , and log
excess equity returns, rxt . For all these variables we use the data described above. The first three
variables are (essentially) observable state variables; the last four are endogenous asset prices and
returns. We collect all the observables in the vector Wt .
    The relation between term structure variables and state variables is aﬃne, but the relationship
between the dividend yield and excess equity returns and the state variables is non-linear. In the
Computational Appendix, we linearize this relationship and show that the approximation is quite
accurate. Note that this approach is very diﬀerent from the popular Campbell-Shiller (1988) and
Campbell (1990) linearization method, which linearizes the return expression itself before taking the
linearized return equation through a present value model. We first find the correct solution for the
price-dividend ratio and linearize the resulting equilibrium.
    Conditional on the linearization, the following property of Wt obtains,


                                           Wt = µw (Ψ) + Γw (Ψ) Ytc                                              (31)


where Ytc is the companion form of Yt containing five lags and the coeﬃcients superscripted with ‘w’
are nonlinear functions of the model parameters, Ψ. Because Yt follows a linear process with square-
root volatility dynamics, unconditional moments of Yt are available analytically as functions of the
underlying parameter vector, Ψ. Let X (Wt ) be a vector valued function of Wt . For the current
purpose, X (·) will be comprised of first, second, third and fourth order monomials, unconditional
expectations of which are uncentered moments of Wt . Using Equation (31), we can also derive the
analytic solutions for uncentered moments of Wt as functions of Ψ. Specifically,


                                               E [X (Wt )] = f (Ψ)                                               (32)


where f (·) is also a vector valued function (subsequent appendices provide the exact formulae)6 .
This immediately suggests a simple GMM based estimation strategy. The GMM moment conditions
   6 In practice, we simulate the unconditional moments of order three and four during estimation. While analytic

solutions are available for these moments, they are extremely computationally expensive to calculate at each iteration
of the estimation process. For these moments, we simulate the system for roughly 30,000 periods (100 simulations
per observation) and take unconditonal moments of the simulated data as the analytic moments implied by the model
without error. Due to the high number of simulations per observation, we do not correct the standard errors of the
parameter estimates for the simulation sampling variability. To check that this is a reasonable strategy, we perform
a one-time simulation at a much higher rate (1000 simulations / observation) at the conclusion of estimation. We
check that the identified parameters produce a value for the objective function close to that obtained with the lower
simulation rate used in estimation.

                                                      T t=1

Moreover, the additive separability of data and parameters in Equation (33) suggests a ‘fixed’ optimal
GMM weighting matrix free from any particular parameter vector and based on the data alone.
Specifically, the optimal GMM weighting matrix is the inverse of the spectral density at frequency
zero of gT (Wt ; Ψ0 ), which we denote as S (WT ).
    To reduce the number of parameters estimated in calculating the optimal GMM weighting matrix,
we exploit the structure implied by the model. Under the model, we can project X (Wt ) onto the
vector of state variables Ytc , which stacks the contemporaneous five state variables and a number of
lags,
                                                        b tc + εbt
                                              X (Wt ) = BY

      b and εbt are calculated using a standard linear projection of X (Wt ) onto Ytc . We assume
where B
                                        b is diagonal and estimated it using the residuals, εbt , of the
the covariance matrix of the residuals, D,
projection. The projection implies


                                          Sb (WT ) = B

                                                                      b


where Sb (YTc ) is the spectral density at frequency zero of Ytc . To estimate Sb (YTc ), we use a standard
pre-whitening technique as in Andrews and Monahan (2004). Because Ytc contains two unobservable
                                                      h                             i0
variables, vt and qt , we use instead the vector Ytp = ∆dft , πt , ∆cft , rft , dpft and one lag of Ytp to
span Ytc 7 .
    To estimate the system, we minimize the standard GMM objective function,

                                ³      ´    ³ ´ ³     ´−1    ³ ´0

in a one-step GMM procedure.
    Because the system is nonlinear in the parameters, we took precautionary measures to assure
that a global minimum has indeed been found. First, over 100 starting values for the parameter
vector are chosen at random from within the parameter space. From each of these starting values,

we conduct preliminary minimizations. We discard the runs for which estimation fails to converge,
for instance, because the maximum number of iterations is exceeded, but retain converged parameter
values as ‘candidate’ estimates.   Next, each of these candidate parameter estimates is taken as a
new starting point and minimization is repeated. This process is repeated for several rounds until a
global minimizer has been identified as the parameter vector yielding the lowest value of the objective
function. In this process, the use of a fixed weighting matrix is critical. Indeed, in the presence
of a parameter-dependent weighting matrix, this search process would not be well defined. Finally,
the parameter estimates producing the global minimum are confirmed by starting the minimization
routine at small perturbations around the parameter estimate, and verifying that the routine returns
to the global minimum.


4.3    Moment Conditions

We use a total of 34 moment conditions to estimate the model parameters. These moments are
explicitly listed in Table 2. They can be ordered into 6 groups. The first set is simply the uncon-
ditional means of the Wt variables; the second group includes the second uncentered moments of
the state variables. In combination with the first moments above, these moments ensure that we
are matching the unconditional volatilities of all the variables of interest. The third set of moments
is aimed at identifying the autocorrelation of the fundamental processes.      Because of the moving
average filter applied to dividend and consumption growth, it is only reasonable to look at the fourth
order autocorrelations. Because our specification implies complicated ARMA behavior for inflation
dynamics, we attempt to fit both the first and fourth order autocorrelation of this series. The fourth
set of moments concerns contemporaneous cross moments of fundamentals with asset prices and
returns. As was pointed out by Cochrane and Hansen (1995), the correlation among fundamentals
and asset prices implied by standard implementations of the consumption CAPM model can be
much too high. We also include cross moments between inflation, the short rate, and consumption
growth to help identify the ρπu parameter in the inflation equation and a potential inflation risk
premium.
   Next, the fifth set of moments identifies higher order moments of dividend growth. This is crucial
to ensure that the dynamics of vt are identified by, and consistent with, the volatility predictability
of the fundamental variables in the data. Moreover, this helps fit their skewness and kurtosis.
   Note that there are 34 − 19 = 15 over-identifying restrictions and that we can use the standard


                                                  25
J-test to test the fit of the model.



5     Estimation Results

This section describes the estimation results of the structural model, and characterizes the fit of the
model with the data.


5.1    GMM Parameter Estimates

Table 2 reports the results of the above described estimation procedure. We start with dividend
growth dynamics. First, ut significantly forecasts dividend growth. Second, the conditional volatil-
ity of dividend growth, vt , is highly persistent with an autocorrelation coeﬃcient of 0.9795 and itself
has significant volatility (σvv , is estimated as 0.3288 with a standard error of 0.0785). This confirms
that dividend growth volatility varies through time. Further, the conditional covariance of dividend
growth and vt is positive and economically large: σdv is estimated at 0.0413 with a standard error
of 0.0130.
    The results for the consumption-dividend ratio are in line with expectations. First, it is very
persistent, with an autocorrelation coeﬃcient of 0.9826 (standard error 0.0071). Second, the contem-
poraneous correlation of ut with ∆dt is sharply negative as indicated by the coeﬃcient σud which is
estimated at −0.9226. In light of Equation (3), this helps to match the low volatility of consumption
growth. However, because (1 + σud ) is estimated to be greater than zero, dividend and consumption
growth are positively correlated, as is true in the data. Finally, the own volatility parameter for
the consumption dividend ratio is 0.0127 with a standard error of just 0.0007, ensuring that the
correlation of dividend and consumption growth is not unrealistically high.
    The dynamics of the stochastic preference process, qt , are presented next.      It is estimated to
be quite persistent, with an autocorrelation coeﬃcient of 0.9787 (standard error 0.0096) and it has
significant independent volatility as indicated by the estimated value of σqq of 0.1753 (standard
error 0.0934). Of great importance is the contemporaneous correlation parameter between qt and
consumption growth, σqc .    While σqc is negative, it is not statistically diﬀerent from zero.    This
indicates that risk is indeed moving countercyclically, in line with its interpretation as risk aversion
under a habit persistence model such as that of Campbell and Cochrane (1999) (further discussion
below). What is diﬀerent in our model is that the correlation between consumption growth and risk


                                                  26
aversion8 is −0.37 instead of −1.00 in Campbell and Cochrane. The impatience parameter ln (β)
is negative as expected and the γ parameter (which is not the same as risk aversion in this model)
is positive, but not significantly diﬀerent from zero. The wedge between mean dividend growth and
consumption growth, δ, is both positive and significantly diﬀerent from zero.
   Finally, we present inflation dynamics. As expected, past inflation positively aﬀects expected
inflation with a coeﬃcient of 0.2404 (standard error 0.1407) and there is negative and significant
predictability running from the consumption-dividend ratio to inflation.


5.2      Model Moments Versus Sample Data

Table 2 also presents the standard test of the overidentifying restrictions.             The overidentification
test fails to reject, with a p-value of 0.6234. However, there are a large number of moments being fit
and in such cases, the standard GMM overidentification tests are known to have low power in finite
samples. Therefore, we examine the fit of the model with respect to specific moments in Tables 3
and 4.
   Table 3 focuses on linear moments of the variables of interest: mean, volatilities and autocorre-
lations.   The model fits the data exceedingly well with respect to the unconditional means of all
seven of the endogenous variables. This includes generating a realistic low mean for the nominal
risk free rate of about 1% and a realistic equity premium of about 1.2% (all quarterly rates). The
volatilities of the endogenous variables are also well matched to the data. The implied volatilities
of both the financial variables and fundamental series are within one standard error of the data
moment. Finally, the model is broadly consistent with the autocorrelation of the endogenous series.
The (fourth) autocorrelation of filtered consumption growth is somewhat too low relative to the
data. However, in unreported results we verified that the complete autocorrelograms of dividend
and consumption growth implied by the model are consistent with the data.                    The model fails to
generate suﬃcient persistence in the term spread but this is the only moment not within a two
standard bound around the data moment. However, it is within a 2.05 standard error bound!
   As explored below, the time varying volatility of dividend growth is an important driver of equity
returns and volatility, and it is therefore important to verify that the model implied nonlinearities in
fundamentals are consistent with the data. In Table 4, we determine whether the estimated model
  8 More specifically, the conditional correlation between ∆c
                                                              t+1 and qt+1 when vt and qt are at their unconditonal
mean of unity.




                                                        27
is consistent with the reduced form evidence presented in Table 1, and we investigate skewness
and kurtosis of fundamentals and returns.      In Panel A, we find that the volatility dynamics for
fundamentals are quite well matched. The model produces the correct sign in forecasting dividend
and consumption growth volatility with respect to the short rate and the spread; only the volatility
dynamics with respect to the dividend yield are of the wrong sign. However, for return volatility,
all the predictors have the right sign, including the dividend yield.
    Panel B focuses on multivariate regressions.         This is a very tough test of the model as it
implicitly requires the model to also fit the correlation among the three instruments. Nevertheless,
for consumption growth volatility the model gets all the signs right and every coeﬃcient is within
two standard errors of the data coeﬃcient. The model also produces a fantastic fit with respect to
time-variation in return predictability. However, the fit with respect to dividend growth volatility
is not as stellar with two of three signs missed.
    Panel C focuses on skewness and kurtosis.        The model implied kurtosis of filtered dividend
growth is consistent with that found in the data and the model produces a bit too much kurtosis
in consumption growth rates. Equity return kurtosis is somewhat too low relative to the data, but
almost within a 2 standard error bound.      The model produces realistic skewness numbers for all
three series.   We conclude that the nonlinearities in the fundamentals implied by the model are
reasonably consistent with the data.



6     Risk, Uncertainty and Asset Prices

In this section, we explore the dominant sources of time variation in equity prices (dividend yields),
equity returns, the term structure, expected equity returns and the conditional volatility of equity
returns. We also investigate the mechanisms leading to our findings.
    Tables 5 and 6 contain the core results in the paper. Table 5 reports basic properties of some
critical unobserved variables, including vt and qt . Table 6 reports variance decompositions with
standard errors for several endogenous variables of interest and essentially summarizes the response
of the endogenous variables to each of the state variables. Rather than discussing these tables in
turn, we organize our discussion around the diﬀerent variables of interest using information from
the two tables.




                                                    28
6.1    Uncertainty and Risk

Table 5, Panel A presents properties of unobservable variables under the estimated model. First,
note that ‘uncertainty,’ vt , which is proportional to the conditional volatility of dividend growth is
quite volatile relative to its mean and is extremely persistent. These properties reflect the identifying
information in the characteristics of the dividend yield, short rate and spread as well as the higher
moments of fundamentals.       Similarly, qt has significant volatility and autocorrelation.    Because
local risk aversion, RAt , in this model is given by γ exp (qt ), we can examine its properties directly.
The median level of risk aversion in the model is 2.52, a level which would be considered perfectly
reasonable by most financial economists. However, risk aversion is positively skewed and has large
volatility so that risk aversion is occasionally extremely high in this model.
   Panel B of Table 5 presents results for means of the above endogenous variables conditional on
whether the economy is in a state of expansion or recession. For this exercise, recession is defined
as one quarter of negative consumption growth. Both vt and qt (and hence local risk aversion) are
strongly counter-cyclical.


6.2    Uncertainty, Risk and the Term Structure

Panel A of Table 5 also displays the properties of the real interest rate and the real term spread.
The average real rate is 17 basis points (68 annualized) and the real interest rate has a standard
deviation of around 90 basis points. The real term spread has a mean of 38 basis points, a volatility
of only 28 basis points and is about as persistent as the real short rate. In Panel B, we see that
real rates are pro-cyclical and spreads are counter-cyclical.
   Panel C of Table 5 shows that uncertainty tends to depress real interest rates, while positive risk
aversion shocks tend to increase them. In the theoretical section, we derived that the eﬀect of qt on
real interest rates is ambiguous depending on whether the consumption smoothing or precautionary
savings eﬀect dominates. At our parameter values, the consumption smoothing eﬀect dominates.
The eﬀect of vt is entirely through the volatility of the pricing kernel and represents a precautionary
savings motive. Hence, the correlation between real rates and qt is actually positive, while the
correlation between real rates and vt is negative. Overall, real rates are pro-cyclical because vt is
strongly counter-cyclical.
   The real term spread displays a positive correlation with both vt and qt , but for diﬀerent reasons.



                                                   29
As we discussed in the theoretical section, if the expectations hypothesis were to hold, mean reversion
would imply that the eﬀect of either variable on the spread would be the opposite sign of its eﬀect
on the interest rate level. Figure 1 decomposes the exposures of both the real interest rate and the
spread to vt and qt into an expectations hypothesis part and a term premium part and does so for
various maturities (to 40 quarters). The exposure to vt is negative and weakens with horizon leading
to a positive EH eﬀect. Because vt has little eﬀect on the term premium, the spread eﬀect remains
positive. Hence, when uncertainty increases, the term structure steepens and vice versa.
   Figure 1 also shows why qt has a positive eﬀect on the real term spread, despite the EH eﬀect being
negative. Yields at long maturities feature a term premium that is strongly positively correlated
with qt . In the theoretical section, we derived that the sign of the term premium only depends on
φrq which is positive: because higher risk aversion increases interest rates (and lowers bond prices)
at a time when marginal utility is high, bonds are risky.
   In Table 6, we report the variance decompositions. While three factors (ut , vt , and qt ) aﬀect
the real term structure, vt accounts for the bulk of its variation. An important reason for this fact
is that vt is simply more variable than qt . The most interesting aspect of the results here is that
qt contributes little to the variability of the spread, so that qt is mostly a level factor not a spread
factor, whereas uncertainty is both a level and a spread factor. When we consider a real consol, we
find that qt dominates its variation. Because consol prices reflect primarily longer term yields, they
are primarily driven by the most persistent level factor, which is qt , through its eﬀect on the term
premium.
   For the nominal term structure, inflation becomes an important additional state variable ac-
counting for about 12% of the variation in the nominal interest rates. However, inflation is an
even more important spread factor accounting for about 31% of the spread’s variability.           What
may be surprising is that the relative importance of qt increases going from the real to nominal
term structure. The reason is the rather strong positive correlation between inflation and vt , which
arises from the negative relation between inflation and the consumption dividend ratio, that ends
up counterbalancing the negative eﬀect of vt on real interest rates.


6.3    Uncertainty, Risk, and Equity Prices

Here we start with the variance decompositions for dividend yields and equity returns in Table 6.
For the dividend yield, qt dominates as a source of variation. The contribution of qt to variation


                                                  30
in the dividend yield is almost 90%.       To see why, recall first that qt only aﬀects the dividend
yield through its eﬀect on the term structure of real interest rates (see Proposition 4). Under the
parameters presented in Table 2, the impact of qt on real interest rates is positive at every horizon
and therefore it is positive for the dividend yield as well. Formally, under the parameters of Table
2, Fbn in Proposition 3 is negative at all horizons.
   Next, consider the eﬀect of vt on the dividend yield.       Uncertainty has a ‘real consol eﬀect’
and a ‘cash-flow risk premium’ eﬀect which oﬀset each other.       We already know that vt creates
a strong precautionary savings motive, which decreases interest rates.       All else equal, this will
serve to increase price-dividend ratios and decrease dividend yields. However, vt also governs the
covariance of dividend growth with the real kernel.     This risk premium eﬀect may be positive or
negative, but intuitively the dividend stream will represent a risky claim to the extent that dividend
growth covaries negatively with the kernel. For instance, if dividend growth is low in states of the
world where marginal utility is high, then the equity claim is risky. In this case, we would expect
high vt to exacerbate this riskiness and depress equity prices when it is high, increasing dividend
yields.   As we discussed in section 5.5, σqc contributes to this negative covariance.   On balance,
these countervailing eﬀects of vt on dividend yield largely cancel out, so that the net eﬀect of vt on
dividend yields is small. This shows up in the variance decomposition of the dividend yield. On
balance, qt is responsible for the overwhelming majority of dividend yield variation, and is highly
positively correlated with it.   The negative eﬀect of ut arises from its strong negative covariance
with dividend growth.
   Looking back to panel C in Table 5, while increases in qt have the expected depressing eﬀect on
equity prices (a positive correlation with dividend yields), increases in vt do not. This contradicts
the findings in Wu (2001) and Bansal and Yaron (2004) but is consistent with early work by Barsky
(1988) and Naik (1994). Because the relation is only weakly negative, there may be instances where
our model will generate a classic “flight to quality” eﬀect with uncertainty lowering interest rates,
driving up bond prices and depressing equity prices.
   Next notice the determinants of realized equity returns in Table 6.        First, over 30% of the
variation in excess returns is driven by dividend growth and dividend growth is positively correlated
with excess returns.    This is not surprising in light of the fact that dividend growth enters the
definition of stock returns directly and dividend growth has almost half as much variation as returns
themselves. The other primary driver of stock returns is qt . This is a compound statistic which


                                                   31
includes the eﬀect of current and lagged qt . In fact, the contemporaneous eﬀect of qt on returns is
negative (see Table 5) as increases in qt depress stock valuations. However, the lagged eﬀect of qt
on returns is positive because, all else equal, lower lagged prices imply higher current returns.


6.4     Uncertainty, Risk and the Equity Premium

We again go back to Table 5 to investigate the properties of the conditional equity premium,
Et [rxt+1 ].   The premium is quite persistent, with an autocorrelation coeﬃcient of 0.9789.         In
Panel B, we also find that expected equity returns are higher in recessions which is consistent with
counter-cyclical risk aversion. Panel C shows that both vt and qt are positively correlated with the
equity premium. The risk premium in any model will be negatively correlated with the covariance
between the pricing kernel and returns. We already discussed how uncertainty is negatively corre-
lated with cash flows and this dominates the small positive correlation with price-dividend ratios.
The eﬀect of qt comes mostly through the capital gain part of the return: increases in qt both raise
marginal utility and lower prices making stocks risky. Table 6 shows that the point estimate for the
share of the equity premium variation due to vt is about 17% but with a standard error of 13%,
with the remainder due to qt .
   The fact that both the dividend yield and expected equity returns are primarily driven by qt
suggest that the dividend yield may be a strong predictor of equity returns in this model. Table 7
shows that this is indeed the case, with a regression of future returns on dividend yields generating
a 1.53 coeﬃcient. We also compare the model coeﬃcients with the corresponding statistics in the
data. It turns out that the predictability of equity returns during our sample period is rather weak.
Table 7 reports univariate coeﬃcients linking equity returns to short rates, dividend yields and
spreads. The sign of the coeﬃcients matches well-known stylized facts but none of the coeﬃcients
are significantly diﬀerent from zero. The model produces coeﬃcients within two standard errors of
these data coeﬃcients but this is of course a rather weak test. While it is theoretically possible
to generate a negative link between current short rates and the equity premium which is observed
empirically, our model fails to do so at the estimated parameters.       We also report the results of
a multivariate regression on the aforementioned instruments. The model here gets all the signs
right and is always within two standard errors of the data coeﬃcients. More generally, the ratio,
V AR (Et [rxt+1 ]) /V AR (rxt+1 ), from Tables 3 and 5, implies a quarterly R2 of less than one percent,
so the model does not generate much short term predictability of equity returns consistent with


                                                  32
recent evidence. There is a large debate on whether predictability increases with the horizon. In
our model, the variance ratio discussed above for 10 year returns equals about 12% (not reported).
   While we have studied the conditional equity premium, it remains useful to reflect on the success
of the model in matching the unconditional equity premium. To make the model’s success complete,
it also matches the low risk free rate while keeping the correlation between fundamentals (dividend
and consumption growth) and returns low. In fact, the correlation between dividend growth and
equity returns is 0.28 in the data and 0.33 in the model. For consumption growth, the numbers are
0.07 and 0.11 respectively. Consequently, this model performs in general better than the Campbell
and Cochrane (1999) model, which had trouble with the fundamentals-return correlation. The
success of our model is primarily driven by the added flexibility oﬀered by an additional state
variable. When we set σqq = 0, and re-estimate the model, the model is strongly rejected and we
fail to match the high equity premium and the low risk free rate.     Consequently, while we have
formulated a consumption-based asset pricing model that successfully matches many salient asset
pricing phenomena, the presence of preference shocks not correlated fundamental shocks are essential
to its success.


6.5    Uncertainty, Risk, Equity Return Volatility and Sharpe Ratios

To conclude, we investigate the properties of the conditional variance of equity returns, the equity
Sharpe ratio and the maximum attainable Sharpe ratio available in the economy discussed in Section
2. We begin with the numbers in Panel A of Table 5.      The conditional variance of excess equity
returns has a mean of 0.0092, a standard deviation of of 0.0070 and an autocorrelation of 0.9794
at the quarterly frequency.   The final two columns of Table 5 report results for the conditional
Sharpe ratio of equity and the maximum attainable Sharpe ratio available in the economy discussed
in Section 2. The mean equity Sharpe ratio attains approximately three quarters of the maximum
attainable value. Both Sharpe ratios are strongly persistent and possess significant time variation
driven by vt and qt . These Sharpe ratios are quarterly, and so their magnitude is roughly half of
annualized values.
   The conditional variance of equity returns is counter-cyclical.    Interestingly, the increase in
expected equity returns during recessions is not as large as the increase in the expected variance
which contributes to the equity Sharpe ratio being not counter-cyclical. The maximum Sharpe ratio
does display counter-cyclical behavior.


                                                33
    Moving to Table 6, not surprisingly, the conditional volatility of equity returns is largely governed
largely by vt , which accounts for 75% of its variation with a standard error of only 32%. Here, qt
contributes 25% to the total volatility variation.



7     Conclusion

This paper has attempted to sort out the relative importance of two competing hypotheses for the
sources of the magnitude and variation of asset prices. First, one literature has explored the role
of cash flow volatility dynamics as a determinant of equity premiums both in the time series and
cross section.   Recent work in this area includes Wu (2000), Bansal and Yaron (2003), Bansal,
Khatchatrian and Yaron (2002), and Bansal and Lundblad (2004). A quite separate literature has
explored shocks to investors preferences as drivers of equity prices. Prominent papers in this area
include Campbell and Cochrane (1999), Abel (1990, 1999), and a large number of elaborations such
as Wachter (2004), Bekaert, Engstrom and Grenadier (2004), Brandt and Wang (2003), Menzly,
Santos and Veronesi (2004) ), Wei (2004), and Lustig and van Nieuwerburgh (2004). With some
exceptions, the focus has been on equities.
    We design a theoretical model and empirical strategy which are capable of accommodating both
explanations, and then implement an optimal GMM estimation to determine the relative importance
of each story. We stress that from a theoretical perspective, it is important to consider the term
structure eﬀects on equity prices, a point prominent in the work of Abel (1988) and Barsky (1989).
We conclude that both the conditional volatility of cash flow growth and time varying risk aversion
emerge as important factors driving variation in the term structure, dividend yields, and equity risk
premium and the conditional volatility of returns. Not surprisingly, uncertainty is more important
for volatility whereas risk aversion is more important for dividend yields and the risk premium.
    Our work is indirectly related to two other important literatures. First, there is a large literature
on the conditional CAPM which predicts a linear, positive relation between expected excess returns
on the market and the conditional variance of the market. Since the seminal work of French,
Schwert and Stambaugh (1987), the literature has struggled with the identification of the price
of risk, which is often negative in empirical applications (see Scruggs (2003)). Of course, in our
model, there are multiple sources of time variation in risk premiums and both the price of risk and
the quantity of risk varying through time. Upon estimation of our structural model, we identify a


                                                     34
strong positive contemporaneous correlation between expected equity returns and their conditional
volatility.   However, this relationship varies through time and contains a cyclical component (see
Table 5).
    Second, the volatility feedback literature has provided a link between the phenomenon of asym-
metric volatility (or the leverage eﬀect, the conditional return volatility and price shocks are nega-
tively correlated) and risk premiums. It suggests that prices can fall precipitously on negative news
as the conditional volatility increases and hence induces higher risk premiums (when the price of
risk is positive). Hence, the literature primarily builds on the conditional CAPM literature (see
Campbell and Hentschel (1992) and Bekaert and Wu (2000)). Wu (2001) sets up a present value
model in which the variance of dividend growth follows a stochastic volatility process and shows
under what conditions the volatility feedback eﬀect occurs. There are two reasons why Wu’s (2001)
conclusions may not be generally valid. First, he ignores equilibrium considerations–that is the
discount rate is not tied to preferences. Tauchen (2005) also shows how the presence of feedback
may depend on preference parameters.      Second, he assumes a constant interest rate. Within our
set up, we can re-examine the validity of an endogenous volatility feedback eﬀect.      We intend to
explore the implications of our model for these two literatures in the near future.

A       Proof of Propositions
A.1     Proof of Proposition 1
The well known recursive pricing relationship governing the term structure of these bond prices is
                                      rz
                                              £       rz
                                                             ¤
                                    Pn,t = Et Mt+1 Pn−1,t+1                                   (35)
         rz
where Pn,t    is the price of a real zero coupon bond at time t with maturity at time (t + n). The
following proposition summarizes the solution for these bond prices. We solve
                                                                          ¡ the model for a slightly ¢
                                                                    √
generalized (but notation saving) case where the qt = µq +ρqq qt−1 + vt−1 σqd εdt + σqu εut + σqv εvt +
√           q
  qt−1 σqq εt . Our current model obtains when

                                       σqd = σqc σdd (1 + σud )
                                       σqu = σqc σuu
                                       σqv = σqc σdv (1 + σud ) .                                 (36)

    Suppose the prices of real, risk free, zero coupon bonds are given by
                       rz
                      Pn,t = exp (An + Bn ∆dt + Cn ut + Dn πt + En vt + Fn qt )                   (37)

where

                            An = f A (An−1 , Bn−1 , Cn−1 , En−1 , Fn−1 , Ψ)
                            Bn = 0
                            Cn = f C (An−1 , Bn−1 , Cn−1 , En−1 , Fn−1 , Ψ)
                            Dn = 0
                            En = f E (An−1 , Bn−1 , Cn−1 , En−1 , Fn−1 , Ψ)
                            Fn = f F (An−1 , Bn−1 , Cn−1 , En−1 , Fn−1 , Ψ)

    Then we have

     exp (An + Bn ∆dt + Cn ut + Dn πt + En vt + Fn qt )
     = Et {exp (mt+1 + An−1 + Bn−1 ∆dt+1 + Cn−1 ut+1 + Dn−1 πt+1 + En−1 vt+1 + Fn−1 qt+1 )}
     = Et {exp(ln (β) − γ (δ + ∆ut+1 + ∆dt+1 ) + γ∆qt+1
     + An−1 + Bn−1 ∆dt+1 + Cn−1 ut+1 + Dn−1 πt+1 + En−1 vt+1 + Fn−1 qt+1 )}




                                                  39
   Equating the coeﬃcient on the two side of the equation, we get:

            f A = ln β − γδ + An−1 + (Bn−1 − γ) µd + En−1 µv + (Fn−1 + γ) µq
           f C ≡ ((Bn−1 − γ) ρdu + Cn−1 ρuu + γ (1 − ρuu ))
           f E ≡ En−1 ρvv
                 1                                                       2
               + ((Bn−1 − γ) σdd + (Cn−1 − γ) σud σdd + (Fn−1 + γ) σqd )

                 1
               + ((Cn−1 − γ) σuu + (Fn−1 + γ) σqu )2
                 2
                 1                                                                 2
               + ((Bn−1 − γ) σdv + (Cn−1 − γ) σud σdv + (Fn−1 + γ) σqv + En−1 σvv )
                 2
                 µ                                            ¶
                                         1                  2
           f F ≡ Fn−1 ρqq + γ (ρqq − 1) + ((Fn−1 + γ) σqq )
                                         2

   Proof for Proposition 3 follows the same strategy as above.

A.2    Proof of Proposition 4
Let Pt and Dt be the time-t ex-div stock price and dividend.

   Using the property of lognormality distribution and equating coeﬃcients on both side of the

resulting calculated value for P Dt has not converged, then the sequences are extended another 100
years until either the P Dt value converges, or becomes greater than 1000 in magnitude.

so that it is also linear in the state vector under these approximations. Also, log excess equity
returns can be represented follows. Using the definition of excess equity returns,

                      rxt+1 = −rft − pdt + gdt+1 + πt+1 + gpdt+1
                                                                   ¡           ¢

where r0 , r10 and r20 are implicitly defined.

B.1     Accuracy of the Equity Approximation
To assess the accuracy of the log linear approximation of the price dividend ratio, the following
experiment was conducted. For the model and point estimates reported in Table 2, a simulation
was run for 10,000 periods. In each period, the ‘exact’ price dividend ratio and log dividend yield


                                                                    42
were calculated in addition to their approximate counterparts derived in the previous subsection.
The resulting series for exact and approximate dividend yields and excess stock returns compare as
follows (quarterly rates).

C     Analytic Moments of Yt and Wt
Recall that the data generating process for Yt is given by,

                                     Yt = µ + AYt−1 + (ΣF Ft−1 + ΣH ) εt
                                     Ft = sqrt(diag(φ + ΦYt ))                                     (45)

It is straightforward to show that the uncentered first, second, and first autocovariance moments of
Yt are given by,

               Yt = (Ik − A)−1 µ
         ³      ´                        ³         0
                                                                                     ´
      vec Yt Yt0 = (Ik2 − A ⊗ A)−1 · vec µµ0 + µYt A0 + AYt µ0 + ΣF Ft2 Σ0F + ΣH Σ0H
       ³        ´                        ³         0
                                                                   ³                    ´´
             0
    vec Yt Yt−1   = (Ik2 − A ⊗ A)−1 · vec µµ0 + µYt A0 + AYt µ0 + A ΣF Ft2 Σ0F + ΣH Σ0H            (46)
                                                        ¡         ¢
where overbars denote unconditional means and Ft2 = diag φ + ΦYt .
   Now consider the unconditional moments of a n-vector of observable variables Wt which obey
the condition
                           Wt = µw + Γw Yt−1 + (Σw           w
                                                   F Ft−1 + ΣH ) εt                       (47)
where µw is an n-vector and Σw       w         w
                                F , ΣH and Γ are (n × k) matrices. It is straightforward to show
that the uncentered first, second, and first autocovariance moments of Wt are given by,

           Wt = µw + Γw Yt
                                 0
      Wt Wt0 = µw µw0 + µw Yt Γw0 + Γw Yt µw0 + Γw Yt Yt0 Γw0 + Σw  2 w0    w w0
                                                                 F Ft ΣF + ΣH ΣH
                             0
                                                                     ³               ´
         0
     Wt Wt−1 = µw µw0 + µw Yt Γw0 + Γw Yt µw0 + Γw Yt Yt−1
                                                        0 Γw0 + Γw Σ F 2 Σw0 + Σ Σw0
                                                                        F t F    H H               (48)

It remains to demonstrate that the observable series used in estimation obey Equation (47). This is
trivially true for elements of Wt which are also elements of Yt such as ∆dt , ∆ct , πt . Using Equations
(25), (44) and (41), it is apparent that rtf , dpt and rtx satisfy Equation (47) as well.

    The symbols ∆dt , ∆ct ,and rxt refer to log filtered dividend and consumption growth and log excess
equity returns. The table presents regressions of squared future values of these variables onto a set of three

    Simulated moments, in square brackets, are calculated by simulating the system for 100,000 periods using
the point estimates from Table 2 and calculating sample moments of the simulated data. Autocorrelations
are all at one lag except for series denote with an asterisk (*): dividend growth, consumption growth and the
dividend price ratio, which are calculated at 4 lags. The second and third numbers for each entry are the
sample moments and corresponding standard errors (in parentheses) computed using GMM with 4 Newey

    Panels A and B repeat the regression models for squared series of Table 1 and also reports analogous
simulated statistics generated by the model estimated in Table 2. Panel C reports unconditional skewness
and kurtosis for the variables in each column. In each panel, the simulated moments (100,000 simulations)
are reported in square brackets and the corresponding data statistics and standard errors are reported below,
with the standard errors in parentheses.
    In panels A and B, the regressions are of the form:

                                   x2t+k = ν0 + ν1 rft + ν2 dpf + ν3 spdt + εt+k

                                     f

and 4 Newey West lags are used in the GMM estimation, but for returns, k = 1 and no Newey West lags
are used. In Panel A, the regression is univariate; that is only one instrument is used per regression. Panel
B reports the full multivariate regressions.

    Simulated moments are calculated by simulating the system for 100,000 periods using the point estimates
from Table 2 for a number of variables including: vt , dividend growth volatility, qt , the log inverse con-
sumption surplus ratio, RAt , local risk aversion which is γ exp (qt ),. The variables rrft and rspdt represent
the real short rate and real term spread respectively, and Et [rxt+1 ] and Vt [rxt+1 ] denote the conditional
mean and conditional variance of excess stock returns. St denotes the conditional Sharpe ratio for equity.
M axSt denotes the maximum attainable Sharpe ratio for any asset in the economy which is given by the
                                1/2
quantity, [exp (Vt (mt+1 )) − 1] .
    In Panel B, means of simulated data conditional on a binary recession/expansion variable are presented.
Recessions are defined in the simulated data as periods of negative real consumption growth. Recessions
represent approximately 8% of all observations in the simulated data.
    In Panel C, the simulated unconditional correlations among vt , qt and other endogenous variables are
reported.

    The symbols, rrft , rspdt , and cprcons refer to the theoretical real short rate, real term spread, and the
coupon-price ratio of a real consol. The table reports the fraction of variation of selected variables due to
variation in elements of the state vector.
    The variable in each row can be expressed as a linear combination of the current state and lagged vector.
Generally, under the model in Table 2, for the row variables, xt ,

                                               xt = µ + Γ0 Ytc

where Ytc is the ‘companion form’ of the N −vector, Yt ; that is, Ytc is comprised of ‘stacked’ current and
lagged values of Yt . µ and Γ are constant vectors implied by the model and parameter estimates of Table 2.
Let V ar (Ytc )be the variance covariance matrix of Ytc . Based on µ and Γ, the proportion of the variation
of each row variable attributed to the nth element of the state vector is calculated as

                                            Γ0 V ar (Ytc ) Γ(n)

                                        ©    ª
where Γ(n)  is a column vector such that Γ(n) i = { Γ}i for i = n, N + n, ...and zero elsewhere. Standard
errors are reported below in angle brackets and are calculated from the variance covariance matrix of the
parameters in Table 2 using the ∆-method.

   The predictability model for excess returns is defined as,

                               rxt+1 = β0 + β1 rft + β2 dpft + β3 spdt + εt+1
                                                                                                             f
and is estimated by GMM. Data are quarterly US aggregates from 1927:1-2004:3. The symbols rft , dpt ,
spdt , and rxt refer to the log yield on a 90 day T-bill, the filtered log dividend yield, the log yield spread,
and log excess equity returns (with respect to the 90 day T-bill). Simulated moments, in square brackets,
are calculated by simulating the model for 100,000 periods using the point estimates from Table 2 and
estimating the above model on the simulated data. The second and third numbers for each entry are the
sample moments and corresponding standard errors (in parentheses).

   Under the model of Table 2, real risk free yields of horizon, h, have solutions of the form,

                                                            rrfh,t = ah + A0h Yt

where the coeﬃcients above are functions of the ‘deep’ model parameters. This figure shows the eﬀect on
these yields and the associated spreads (relative to the 1 period yield) of 1 standard deviation changes in the
latent factors, vt and qt using the point estimates in Table 2. At horizons greater than 1, these eﬀects can
be further decomposed into parts corresponding to the expectations hypothesis (EH), and term premiums,
which are drawn in blue and red bars respectively.
