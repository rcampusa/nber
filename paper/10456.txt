                                        ABSTRACT

This paper analyzes and estimates the reaction function of the Japanese monetary authorities in

deciding when to intervene in the foreign exchange (forex) markets, using daily Japanese

intervention data from April 1, 1991 to December 31, 2002. This paper is the first in estimating the

reaction function of the monetary authorities in the forex market intervention with following new

methods. First, a theoretical friction model is presented to describe the intervention as cost-

minimizing behavior. Second, the ordered probit analysis, which is consistent with the theoretical

model, was carried out to predict authorities’ reaction function. The regime change from frequent,

small-size intervention before June 1995 and infrequent, large-size intervention after June 1995 is

established and estimations are conducted for two different regimes separately. Third, a noise-to-

signal ratio is applied in selecting the optimal cutoff point in estimated ordered probit function to

use the model for predicting interventions. Major findings are as follows: (1) There was a regime

change in June 1995 from small-scale frequent interventions to large-scale infrequent interventions;

(2) the first half of the sample period had lower friction costs than the second half of the sample

period; (3) Judging from the model and data, the optimum cutoff was higher in the first half than the

second half.

1. Introduction
          The monetary authorities of Japan have intervened in the foreign exchange
market more frequently than other G7 countries in, at least, the past thirteen years.1
Between April 1991 and December 2002, the Japanese authorities intervened in 214 days
(7% of business days), of which 32 days were in the direction of purchasing the yen and
selling the dollar, and 182 days in the opposite direction. (The Japanese Ministry of
Finance, under a new Vice Minister of Finance for International Affairs, conducted much
more frequent and large-scale interventions from January 2003 to March 2004, but that
episode will be left for our future analysis.) The Japanese Ministry of Finance has
disclosed the intervention days and amounts from April 1, 1991 to recent months. Ito
(2003) described the institutional aspects and the data as well as making a first attempt of
analyzing effectiveness, profits, and a reaction function. This paper, improving
significantly over Ito (2003), analyzes and estimates the reaction function of the Japanese
monetary authorities in deciding when to intervene in the yen/dollar market, using daily
intervention data from April 1, 1991 to December 31, 2002. The paper is intended to
analyze objectively the intervention reaction function without a value or normative
judgment.
          The disclosure of new data set stimulated several detailed studies. Ito (2003)
investigated the effectiveness of the intervention, considering various criteria that are
derived from possible motivations. He found that interventions before June 1995 was
broadly ineffective in moving the exchange rate of the intervention days in the intended
direction, while interventions after June 1995 to March 2001 were judged to be effective.
He also estimated profits, realized income and unrealized capital gains, made by
intervention, that amounted to 8.6 trillion yen over the ten year period. Fatum and
Hutchison (2003) investigated the effectiveness of intervention using an event study
methodology. They found strong evidence that sterilized intervention affected the
exchange rate. Kearns and Rigobon (2003) estimated the effectiveness of intervention,
that is, the impact of interventions on the exchange rate, using Australian and Japanese
intervention data. Dominguez (2003) also analyzed the effectiveness of the Japanese
intervention and compared to Federal Reserve Bank interventions. Frenkel, Pierdzioch,


1 The intervention decision in Japan is under jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of
Japan acts as an agent for implementation. The yen for intervention is obtained by issues of
short-term government securities (Financial Bills) and listed as the liability in the special budget for
intervention, while the acquired dollars are on the asset side of the special budget. See Ito (2003) for
details of institutional aspects.


                                                    2
and Stadtmann (2002) used the Japanese disclosed data and estimated the reaction
function. Their specification and estimation method are different from ours. Hillebrand
and Schnabl (2003) also used the Japanese intervention data and found effectiveness after
1999. Galati and Melick (2002) analyzed the effectiveness of interventions on market
expectations and found some evidence of effectiveness in the mark/dollar and yen/dollar
markets.
           This paper is the first in estimating the reaction function of the monetary
authorities in the foreign exchange market intervention with the following new features.
First, a general reaction function is derived from the cost-minimizing behavior of the
monetary authorities that takes into account political costs associated with intervention.
The model predicts a neutral band (no intervention) for wide range of state variables.
Second, the ordered probit model is applied to estimate the equation derived from the
theoretical model. Third, the model is applied to the Japanese data that were disclosed in
2001 for the period since April 1991, with a careful consideration to a possible regime
change after 1995. Fourth, a method to choose the optimal cutoff in predicting
intervention is proposed. In the literature, the cutoff is chosen arbitrarily, such as 0.5 in
probit equation fitted valued. In order to choose the threshold more rationally, we
propose to find the optimal cutoff by minimizing the noise-to-signal ratio.
           Ito (2003) has estimated the reaction function of the Japanese authorities using
the usual OLS. However, interventions were carried out only less than 10 percent of the
business days on average during the sample period. Therefore, for more than 90 percent
of the time, obvious zeros of interventions are not well predicted. A small amount of
intervention predictions are most of the time turned out to be exactly the forecast errors
of opposite signs. In order to rectify this problem, two estimation methods have been
proposed in the literature. One method is based on the Probit model with a binary choice
dependent variable, intervention or no intervention. (See Baillie and Osterberg (1997) and
Dominguez (1998)). However, no theoretical model was presented. Another is based on
the ''friction'' model. Almekinders and Eijffinger (1996) proposed a model with political
frictions that no intervention is required when deviation from an optimal is small. The
reaction function of intervention was derived formally rather than in ad hoc way. The
Almekinders and Eijffinger model uses intervention amount as the dependent variable.
           This paper extends the Almekinders and Eijffinger paper to show explicitly the
target exchange rate, the loss function, and cost-minimizing behavior of the monetary
authorities. However, our estimation method is the Ordered Probit in which the
dependent variable is the indicator function (-1, 0 or 1) of intervention, not intervention
amount in Almekinders and Eijffinger (1996). One choice that an economist has to face in


                                             3
the literature of intervention is whether to use the actual dollar (or yen) amount of
intervention or the indicator function of intervention. If the fact that intervention is
carried out, which the market almost always knows within an hour as a market rumor, is
more important than the precise amount, then the indicator function is appropriate. If the
amount makes the difference in the impact on the exchange rate movement, the amount
should be used. One drawback on using the precise amounts of interventions is the fact
that the market usually does not know the amount of intervention on the day of
intervention.
          In the analysis of a reaction function of the monetary authorities, the indicator
function is more appropriate, if an impact on the exchange rate is due more to the fact
that there is an intervention than to how large it is, then authority's decision on whether or
not to intervene is more important than how much to intervene. Moreover, when the
monetary authorities decide to intervene, which the paper attempts to capture, the
authorities may not know how much to spend that day. They may buy/sell more foreign
exchanges as hours progress and the impacts become known. For these reasons, we will
use the indicator function of intervention, whether the yen was sold or bought, or no
intervention, in this paper.
          The model of reaction function can be seen as a prediction of intervention. The
literature on the prediction has been developed in the financial crisis literature. One
strand of the early warning model of currency crises, such as Kaminsky and Reinhart
(1999), uses a model to predict a crisis and evaluate alternative model specifications by
calculating the noise-to-signal ratio. We apply the noise-to-signal ratio method to
evaluation of various specifications of the intervention reaction function. The evaluation
can lead to the choice of the optimal cutoff in the probit estimation of predicting
intervention. This is a new insight in the intervention reaction function literature.
          The often-cited motivation for intervention is to prevent too much appreciation
or depreciation, both as a level and as a speed. (See Edison (1993), Dominguez and
Frankel (1993), Almekinders (1995), and Sarno and Taylor (2001, 2003) for surveys.)
Too much appreciation (in a short period time) would harm exporters, while too much
depreciation (in a short period time) would harm importers and confidence of financial
market in general. To maintain a stable exchange rate that are broadly consistent with
fundamentals is an aim of the monetary authorities.
          This paper will ask a question when the authorities decide to intervene in the
1991-2002 time period. Considering that the frequency of interventions had changed
greatly before and after June 1995, all regressions will be conducted for the whole sample,
the earlier period (before June 1995), and the latter period (after June 1995).


                                              4
          To anticipate, major findings are as follows: (1) A regime change in June 1995
from small-scale frequent interventions to large-scale infrequent interventions was found
to have occurred, as found by Ito (2003), and attributed to the change in personnel who
was in charge of intervention at the Ministry of Finance; (2) the first half of the sample
period had lower friction costs than the second half of the sample period; and (3) For the
econometrician who cannot directly observe the authorities’ friction costs, the optimum
cutoff is estimated to be higher in the first half than the second half.
          The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives an overview of the
yen/dollar exchange rate movement and intervention incidents from April 1991 to
December 2002. Section 3 gives the specification of reaction function derived from a
model. Section 4 estimates the model of interventions and analyzes the estimation results.
Section 5 evaluates the predictability of interventions. Section 6 concludes the paper.


2. Overview of the yen/dollar movement
In Figure 1, the yen/dollar movement is shown. The yen had fluctuated between 147
yen/dollar (on August 1, 1998) and 80 yen/dollar (on April 19, 1995). From 1991 to April
1995, the yen appreciation trend was observed, followed by the yen depreciation trend
from April 1995 to August 1998. The yen appreciated from August 1998 to January
2000, when the yen has just above 100 yen/dollar. The yen depreciated after that, until
the yen reached the mid-120s in March 2001.
                                  Figure 1 about here
         Figure 2 shows the monthly-aggregated amounts of interventions. All
interventions to purchase the yen were conducted when the yen/dollar rate was higher
(yen being more depreciated) than 125 yen, while all interventions to sell yen were
conducted when the yen/dollar rate was lower (yen being more appreciated) than 125 yen.
The fact that the dollar was bought when it was relatively cheap vis-à-vis the yen, and
that the dollar was sold when it was relatively expensive means great profits to the
monetary authorities. From April 1991 to December 2002, the realized gains (by
purchasing the dollar and selling the matching amount) amounted to 1 trillion yen, and
the net interest income (the interest income earned on the accumulated foreign reserves
due to interventions minus the interest payments on the yen securities) amounted to 4.9
trillion yen. At the end of December 2002, the accumulated net intervention amounts in
terms of the dollars, 225 billion dollars, have the inventory unit price of 108.8 yen/dollar,
while the market price was 118.7 yen/dollar, suggesting the unrealized gains of 2.3
trillion yen. The gains suggest that the interventions were rather stabilizing in the notion
of Milton Friedman, as argued in Ito (2003). (After the first draft of paper was written,


                                             5
the intervention amounts have soared and the yen appreciated despite the frequent and
large-scale intervention. At the time of this writing, the yen/dollar level is below 110
yen/dollar. And the authorities are estimated to carry unrealized losses. However, the
analysis of interventions in 2003-2004 will be left to a future research.)
                                       Figure 2 about here
          The intervention size and frequencies greatly changed before and after June 21,
1995, when Dr. Sakakibara became Director General of the International Finance Bureau
of Ministry of Finance. Table 1 shows the number of intervention days, the total yen
amount of intervention, the average (per-day) size of intervention for each year. In the
first half of sample (April 1991-June 20, 1995), 165 interventions were conducted, while
only 49 interventions were conducted in the second half (June 21, 1995—December
2002) of the sample. The total intervention amount was 8 trillion yen in the first half,
while it was 25 trillion yen in the second half. The average intervention size was about
47 billion yen in the first half, but the average size of intervention increased by more than
ten times in the second half of the sample. In summary, the first half was characterized by
frequent, small-size interventions, while the second half by infrequent, but large-size
interventions.
                                        Table 1 about here
          Dr. Sakakibara himself noted the difference, emphasizing that it was a deliberate
choice. Talking of interventions by his predecessor, Dr. Sakakibara writes, “The market
was accustomed to interventions, because they were too frequent. The interventions were
taken as given. Most interventions, including joint interventions, were predictable, so
that interventions, even joint ones, had only small, short-term effects, and could not
change the sentiment of the market.” (Sakakibara (2000), p.119) “[T]he change in
intervention philosophy and technique [was introduced]. For this, all I have to do was to
make a decision and convince the Vice Minister and the Minister of [its desirability]. For
one, the frequency of interventions was reduced substantially, and per-intervention
amount was increased, in order to push up the level [of the dollar vis-à-vis the yen]”
(ibid., p.120)
          Words and deeds of Dr. Sakakibara seem to show the deliberate changes in the
intervention style in order to change the level of the exchange rate by influencing the
expectation of the market. Less frequent, but large-scale each time, interventions were a
hallmark of the period from June 1995 to end-2002.2 In the next section, we rigorously


2Dr. Sakakibara retired in July 1999. But, his successor, Mr. Kuroda was widely regarded as a person
who inherited the same philosophy toward the exchange rate market function and intervention policy.

examine the monetary authority’s decision to intervene using an econometric model that
takes into account the feature that interventions are infrequent events.


3. Model of Infrequent Intervention
3.1. Loss Function
In most of papers in the literature, the intervention reaction function is typically assumed
rather than derived. An exception is Almekinders and Eijffinger (1996) that derived a
reaction function from the loss function of the monetary authorities.3 We follow their
approach, with more realistic formulation of the target exchange rate and the cost
function of intervention. The monetary authorities are assumed to have a loss function
that should be minimized using interventions. The loss function is assumed to be:

                      Min     E[ Loss t | Ω t −1 ] = E[( s t − s tT ) 2 | Ω t −1 ]        (1)

where st denotes the log of the yen/dollar rate at the close of the New York market (time
t); sTt denotes the target of the yen/dollar rate for the monetary authorities at time t; and
Ωt-1 denotes the information available to the monetary authorities and market participants
at the end of date t-1.4 The specification means that the loss is defined by squared
deviation of the actual exchange rate from the target rate at date t. In addition, the
monetary authorities are assumed to believe that the exchange rate is a random walk if
there is no intervention and the date t intervention has impacts on the actual exchange
rate process. The process of exchange rate is as follows:
                                 s t = st −1 + ρInt t + u t                       (2)
where ut is a white noise. Effectiveness of intervention on exchange rate implies the
negative sign of ρ. For example, the yen-purchasing intervention (Intt>0) by the monetary
authorities tends to appreciate the yen (st -st-1<0), then the negative sign of ρ should be
obtained.


The pattern of intervention by Mr. Kuroda does not show an apparent change from the one by Dr.
Sakakibara.
3 The objective of the Frenkel, Pierdzioch, and Stadtmann (2002) paper is similar to ours. The

difference is specification and methodology. They have defined the loss function as a weighted sum
of the deviation from the target exchange rate and the deviation from the target intervention amount,
and applied the model to the Japanese intervention data. The former is simply the moving average or
PPP. We think that using the intervention target in the loss function is not convincing. Their paper is
not using the friction model, unlike Almekinders and Eijffinger (1996) and this paper. The Frekel,
Pierdzioch, and Stadtmann paper did not check a possible regime change in the middle of the sample
period, unlike Ito (2003) or this paper.
4
   The New York close rate, instead of the Tokyo market, is used because Janapese intervention of day
t can be carried out in the Tokyo market, European market, or New York market. See Ito (2003) for a
detailed time line for this.


                                                       7
          Minimizing the loss function (1) by choosing Intt subject to the constraint (2)
leads to the following intervention reaction function:
                                            1
                                  Int t* = − ( st −1 − stT )                 (3)
                                                        ρ
Intt* denotes the optimal intervention. The authorities have a target exchange rate that is
defined by the weighted average of the past exchange rates. We pick up three
representatives from the past exchange rates; the yen/dollar rate in the previous day, the
yen/dollar rate in the previous month (21 business days), the past-one-year moving
average of the yen/dollar rate. Therefore, the target exchange rate is

                                     s tT = α 1 s t − 2 + α 2 st −21 + α 3 stMA
                                                                             −1                       (4)

where α 1+ α 2+ α 3=1. 5 For example, when the monetary authorities pay greater
attention to long-run stability than to other factors, α3 takes a value close to one. This
represents the desire by the monetary authorities for mean reversion. On the other hand,
when they attach greater importance to short-run stability than to others, α1 takes a
value close to one. This is the case when a short-run movement (st-2 to st-1) is to be
reversed, or at least to be moderated in speed. Coefficientα2 represents the medium term
target of the authorities, that is mean reversion to the trend of the past one month. In the
case they attach equal importance, each αi takes 1/3. Using (3) and (4), the optimal
intervention can be written as
                                 α1                     α                       α
                    Int *t = −      ( st −1 − st − 2 ) − ２ ( st −1 − st − 21 ) − ３ ( st −1 − stMA
                                                                                               −1 )
                                 ρ                       ρ                       ρ

                       = β1 ( st −1 − st − 2 ) + β 2 ( s t −1 − st − 21 ) + β 3 ( s t −1 − stMA
                                                                                             −1 )     (5)

That is, the optimal intervention is a function of three explanatory variables; the change
in the yen/dollar rate on day t-1; the change in the yen/dollar rate in the previous 21
(business) days; the percent deviation of the current (day before) level from the
past-one-year moving average. Note that the relationships among parameters are written
as follows: αi=βi/(β1+β2+β3) and ρ= -1/(β1+β2+β3). This means that once we
can estimateβi, we can identify αi and ρ, respectively. As we will see, however, this is
not the case.



5
 α3 is assumed to be one in Almekinders and Eijffinger (1996). Thus, our target rate may be
considered as a general form of their target rate. Another approach is to use the PPP rate instead of
equation (4). However, given the availability of the data in the monthly base, it leads to a sticky target
rate in the daily model of intervention.


                                                            8
3.2. Political Cost
The specification of intervention (5), when taken literally, implies that intervention
should take place almost everyday. This is inconsistent with the fact that interventions
were actually carried out only less than 10 percent of the business days on average. One
way to rectify this problem is to model explicitly the political cost for intervention, that is
incurred during decision-making process for designing the optimal intervention strategy
(see Almekinders (1995) and Almekinders and Eijffinger (1996)). Political costs reflect
costs of discussion with Minister of Finance of own country and other major countries of
intervention currencies. In order to carry out intervention, an explanation to the Minister
of Finance, and in some cases to other ministers, including Prime Minister, is necessary
and a tacit approval of other countries has to be sought after. Political costs are most
likely independent of the size of intervention. However, once the approval is secured,
then intervention can be carried out in several days in a row, if the situation does not
change dramatically.
          What is called political cost may reflect aversion to intervention by those who
are in charge of interventions, namely, officials at the Ministry of Finance. Those who
believe that the market will have power to restore an equilibrium sooner than later, they
find costs to be high, while those who believe that the market can overshoot and get
misaligned for a long time tend to find political costs low. Any consideration that is not
captured by the specification of the target rate will show up as the political costs.
          With the presence of political costs, intervention takes place if and only if
benefits of intervention are higher than costs. Usually, political costs are assumed to be a
function of intervention at date t. If intervention was carried out the day before, then the
political cost is less, because the decision by the Minister was already secured once, so
that an additional cost on the day after is much less. Therefore, we assume that political
costs are a function of interventions not only at date t but also at date t-1. Under this
assumption, we can explain why intervention tends to be correlated (once intervened,
another intervention is likely to occur the day later). Therefore, a cost function of
intervention is defined as

                          FC1+ − FC 2 1( Int t −1 > 0) if   Int t > 0
                  FC t =  −                                                            (6)
                          FC1 − FC 2 1( Int t −1 < 0) if    Int t < 0

where FC1j>0, FC2>0, and 1(.) is the indicator function. For example, FC1- may be
smaller than FC1+, implying that the yen-selling intervention takes fewer costs than the
yen-purchasing intervention. The opposite situation may be possible. FC2>0 implies that
intervention at date t-1 reduces political costs of intervention at date t.

3.3. Ordered Probit
         The monetary authorities compare benefits of reducing losses of no intervention
to fixed costs of intervention, and carry out interventions only when benefits are higher
than costs. Note that the greater the optimal intervention the greater the loss of no
intervention. Therefore, once the optimal intervention crosses the thresholds, the
monetary authorities intervene in the foreign exchange market. The actual intervention
can be written as:

                − 1 if                        Int t* + ε t < µ1 + β 4 1( Int t −1 < 0)
                
       IInt t =  0 if       µ1 + β 4 1( Int t −1 < 0) < Int t* + ε t < µ 2 − β 4 1( Int t −1 > 0)             (7)
                + 1 if                    µ 2 − β 4 1( Int t −1 > 0) < Int t* + ε t
                
μ1<0，μ2>0, β4>0 and εt～i.i.d.N(0,σ2).
          Given the observation that the direction of intervention at date t was never
different from that of date t-1, the equation (7) can be replaced by the equation (8):

                                         − 1 if                  y t* < µ1

                  X t β = β1 (st −1 − st −2 ) + β 2 (st −1 − st −21 ) + β 3 (st −1 − stMA
                                                                                       −1 ) + β 4 IIntt −1
                                                                                                           .
This model is considered as an Ordered Probit Model and can be estimated by the
maximum likelihood method. However, we estimate βi*=βi/σ and μi*=μi/σ, not
βi and μi directly. This means that we can estimate αi=βi*/(β1*+β2*+β3*) but
there is no way to identify ρ without additional assumptions. The model can be
regarded as a reaction function with a “neutral band” of no-intervention.

3.4. Relationship to Conventional Specification
        The conventional reaction function of the monetary authorities, without the
neutral band of no-intervention, is presented here for comparison. Let us recall that Ito
(2003) defined a reaction function that was conventional in the literature and estimated it.
The intervention, either size (amount) of intervention (Int) or the indicator, IInt = (1,0, or
-1), is regressed on the daily exchange rate change, the monthly change, the deviation
from a long-run equilibrium, and the intervention of the day before. In the indicator




                                                            10
specification, the following regression can be estimated:6
             IInt t = φ 0 + φ1 ( s t −1 − s t − 2 ) + φ 2 ( s t −1 − s t − 21 ) + φ 3 ( s t −1 − s tMA
                                                                                                    −1 ) + φ 4 IInt t −1 + ν t
                                                                                                                                 (9)
The equation (9) can be interpreted as a linearlization of the general intervention reaction
function (8). Therefore, the conventional regression has a constant term while the ordered
probit function has no constant term. Furthermore, vt has heteroskedasticity and thus
heteroskedasticity-and-autocorrelation-consistent (HAC) standard errors should be used
for inference.


4. Estimating a Reaction Function
4.1. Structural Break
          Structural changes are suspected from observations of intervention patterns, as
described in Section 2. In this section, a structural break for the reaction function is
tested first in order to examine whether our observation, supported by Dr. Sakakibara’s
own assertion, is confirmed by data.
          The regression analysis will be conducted to test rigorously the possible break at
around the time of June 1995, when Dr. Sakakibara became in charge of intervention.
First, the null hypothesis of no break at June 21, 1995, for the ordered probit regression,
eq. (8) is rejected at the 1% significance. Therefore, our prior of structural changes due
to a personnel change is confirmed by the statistical test.
          For the linear version, (9), the Supτ (F(τ)) test, a la Andrews (1993), is
conducted to search for a (unknown) date of structural break. For possible (known)
dates of a structural break, the Chow test was conducted. The F-statistic for the
structural break is plotted in Figure 3. Possible structural break dates are tested, and the
single peak of the F-statistic is found to be on April 18, 1995.7 The break date is two
months earlier than the date we identify by the personnel change, June 21. The reason
for this deviation is based on the following pattern of intervention during the two-month
period between the two dates. Although continuous interventions, a hallmark of
pre-Sakakibara era, seemed to have ended on April 18. The only intervention after this
date before June 21 was May 31. Therefore, according to statistical analysis, the policy


6
  Ito (2003) used the intervention amount instead of the indicator functions:
with the size of intervention, the following regression was estimated:
         Int t = θ 0 + θ1 ( st −1 − st −2 ) + θ 2 ( st −1 − st −21 ) + θ 3 ( st −1 − stMA
                                                                                       −1 ) + θ 4 Int t −1 + ω t
7
   The possible structural break days to be tested are the middle 70% of the sample period. Namely the
first 15% and the last 15% of days are excluded from test for a structural break. For the large-sample
approximation to the distribution of the Supτ (F(τ)) test to be good, the subsample endpoints should
not be close to zero so that 15% trimming is a common choice in practice.


                                                                             11
switch from frequent interventions to infrequent interventions occurred on April 18.
                                  Insert Figure 3 about here
          The F-statistic for a hypothesis of structural break on April 18 is 45, and the null
is rejected with 1 percent significance. Moreover, the F-statistic on June 21, which is 33,
is also large enough to reject the null with 1 percent significance. Since we have prior
knowledge of regime change due to a personnel change, supported by a memoir of Dr.
Sakakibara, we will adopt June 21 as the structural break date. Below, all models are
estimated for the entire period, before June 21, 1995 (pre-June 1995), and after June 21,
1995 (post-June 1995).8

4.2. Conventional Regressions
          The conventional reaction function, equation (9), is estimated. This is basically
an update of the reaction function estimated in Ito (2003), extending the sample period by
one year, with a modification of replacing Intervention amount (Int) with the intervention
indicator (IInt) as a dependent variable.
          Results are shown in Table 2. The reaction function gives different estimates and
explanatory power in the first half and second half of the sample. Reactions to the
previous day changes (φ1), to the medium-term trend (φ2) , and to the deviation from
the long-run trend ( φ 3), were all much stronger in the first half. Of these, the
medium-term trend seemed to have been ignored by the authorities in post-1995:06
period. This reflects the fact that there were much more frequent interventions in the
first half. The coefficient of lagged intervention (φ4) was also found to be significant
in both periods, with a larger coefficient in the first period.
                                        Insert Table 2
          The explanatory power of the regression was significantly lower in the second
half of the sample, but this is consistent with the reputation that Dr. Sakakibara wanted
the intervention to be unpredictable. He believed that a surprise intervention would be
more effective than a predictable one.

4.3. Ordered Probit Regressions
         Estimates of the ordered probit model are summarized in Table 3. The
following six observations stand out. First, a tendency of lean-against-the-wind
interventions is confirmed for the daily and medium-term considerations. For the daily


8 Even if we adopt April 18 as the regime change date, most of the findings comparing the first
regime and second regime remain valid.


                                                 12
reaction, β1*>0 holds true for the entire, pre-June 1995, and the post-June 1995
periods. The positive coefficient means that yen appreciation (depreciation) on the day
before tends to trigger an intervention to sell (buy, respectively) the yen. There was also
a tendency of lean-against-the-wind interventions when there is trend of appreciation
(depreciation) in the medium term (preceding 21 days), asβ2*>0 is confirmed for the
entire and pre-June 1995 periods. Namely, if the yen appreciation (depreciation) occurred
in the last 21 days, then it is more likely to intervene and sell (buy, respectively) the yen.9
                                   Insert Table 3 about here
          Second, intervention is more likely to occur when the exchange rate is more
deviated from a long-run moving average, as β3* > 0 holds for the entire, pre-June 1995,
and post-June1995 periods. Therefore, the monetary authorities tend to intervene when
the exchange rate deviates more from the long-run equilibrium that is defined by the
moving average of past one year.
          By construction, the original weights of the three components of the target
exchange rate are calculated. Using α1+α2 +α3 =1, we can calculate each component,
(α1 , α2 , α3). In the pre-June 1995, period, (α1 , α2 , α3) = (0.62, 0.20, 0.18),
while in the post-June 1995 period, ( α 1 , α 2 , α 3) = (0.88, 0.00, 0.12), with a
restriction that non-significant estimate being set to zero. In the pre-June 1995 period,
the monetary authorities were mindful of the daily, medium-term, long-term exchange
rate movements. In the post-June 1995 period, the monetary authorities attached
importance almost solely to the daily exchange rate movements, with a minor
consideration to the long-term misalignment.
          Third, the coefficient of interventions of day before is estimated as significant,
β4*>0. This implies that the likelihood of interventions does increase if there was an
intervention the day before. This reflects the lower political costs of continuous
interventions. The result does hold for the entire, pre-1995:06, and post-1995:06
periods. The magnitude of increasing likelihood of intervention is 1.6 and 1.7,
respectively.
          Fourth, the neutral band of no intervention was estimated to be (-2.1, +1.9) for
the first subsample, and (-2.2, +3.0) for the second subsample. That is, the neutral band
was much wider in the second half than the first half. The difference in the neutral band


9
  Dr. Sakakibara has a reputation of carrying out the lean-in interventions (β*2<0).
The reputation partly comes from his own writings. This reputation is not proven by the
estimation. For the medium term (β*2), however, neither lean-in or lean-against
interventions was not proved for the post-June 1995, that is, the Sakakibara period.


                                             13
gives quite a different prediction on interventions, and this is consistent with casual
observations of the frequency of interventions, as shown in Table 1. Figures 4, 5, and 6
show the estimated neutral band and the fitted value of the latent variable y*. For the
entire period, Figure 4 shows the relationship between the neutral band and the fitted
value. When estimated separately, Figures 5 and 6 show the relationship of the two
subperiods. With the narrow band in the first half, it was predicted as shown in Figure 5,
that interventions are frequent, while with the wide band in the second half, the frequency
of interventions was predicted as low as in Figure 6.
                               Figures 4, 5, and 6 about here
          Fifth, there are asymmetries in the neutral bands, that is the magnitudes of upper
band and lower band are different only in the second half. It is often said that the
Japanese monetary authorities are much more tolerant to yen depreciation than yen
appreciation. One way to formalize this asymmetry hypothesis would be to compare the
ceiling and floor of the neutral band. In the first period, the band was symmetric in
positive and negative directions as the band was estimated to be (-2.1, +1.8). In the
second period, it was shown that the monetary authorities were much more tolerant
toward the yen depreciation than the yen appreciation. This shows that political costs
were quite symmetric in both directions in the first period, but were biased in preference
for yen depreciation in the post-June 1995, the Sakakibara period.
          Sixth, although the regression of the second half still has lower explanatory
power (McFadden’s R2) than the first half, the difference between the two period is
greatly narrowed in the regression with the neutral band (Table 3) compared to the
conventional regression (Table 2). The R2 increases from 0.078 to 0.178 in the second
half. This is due to the fact that the model is rich enough to allow prediction of zero
intervention in the model.

4.4 Difference between the two subsamples
It has been established in reviewing the Japanese interventions in the 1990s that the
pre-June 1995 period was characterized by frequent, small-scale interventions, while the
post-June 1995 period was characterized by infrequent, large-scale interventions. By
the conventional reaction function, a la Ito (2003), showed that the reaction function was
estimated badly in the second sub-sample. Coefficients of the past exchange rate changes
and the deviation from an equilibrium level are smaller in the second period than the first
period. The smaller estimated coefficients reflects the fact that most of the days, the
regressions were fit to predict the zero of the dependent variable. Those who were in
charge of interventions in the second period are estimated to be quite insensitive to the


                                            14
exchange rate changes. Infrequent, but large-scale interventions in the second period
produced the large forecast errors.
          By introducing political costs that lead to a neutral band of no-intervention, it is
possible to distinguish whether the monetary authorities of the second period was
insensitive to the exchange rate changes—that is the target exchange rate was low—or
the political costs were high for some reasons.

5．Minimizing a surprise or a false alarm?
One way to judge how well the reaction function is tracing the intervention indicator
variable is to regard the model as a prediction of intervention, and evaluate the accuracy
of prediction. Suppose that an econometrician (or a private-sector market participant) is
interested in predicting whether there is intervention on day t at the beginning of the
Tokyo market, then the probit model can be used for this purpose. The market participant
does not like a surprise (i.e., an actual intervention without a warning from a model) or a
false alarm (i.e., a model predicts an intervention, which would not take place). The
ordered probit model gives the fitted value of probability for intervention. Then, by
choosing the cutoff for the indicator in [0,1], the econometrician can either predict, at the
beginning of the Tokyo market, that the intervention will take place or not on that day. If
the fitted value of probability exceeds the chosen cutoff value, then an intervention is
predicted, while the lower fitted value is ignored for prediction.    If the cutoff is too low,
then too many interventions are predicted, and most of them will turn out to be false
alarms. If the cutoff is too high, then too few interventions are predicted so that actual
interventions would take place without the warning call. The task is a well-known
problem of balancing minimization of the type one errors vs. the type two errors.
          Table 4 summarizes the 2x2 matrix of the prediction and actual interventions:
correct prediction, the type one errors, and type two errors. Cell A is the number of days
when the signal (warning/prediction) of intervention was issued, and actual intervention
was observed. Cell B is the number of days when a warning was issued but turned out
to be a false alarm. Cell C is the count of days when actual intervention takes place
without a warning by the model. This is the event of surprise intervention. Cell D is the
number of days when a model predicts no intervention that turned out to be true. 10


10  We implicitly ignore the possibilities that the probability of the yen-purchasing (selling)
intervention is higher than that of the yen-selling (purchasing) intervention, when the yen-selling
(purchasing) intervention takes place. In our argument, this case is counted as a correct signal, though
it is a noise. However, this is not a problem because these cases do not happen in our data. The
monetary authorities always have some economic reasons to intervene in the forex market so that we


                                                   15
          The currency crisis literature has developed a way to evaluate the so-called early
warning model of the crisis. (See Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999) for the seminal work.)
They have proposed to use the noise-to-signal ratio. Note that A/(A+C) is the ratio of
correct signal of the actual intervention (crisis in the early warning literature) days, while
B/(B+D) is the ratio of false alarms of the no-intervention days. When a very low cutoff
is chosen, then the ratio of correct signals A/(A+C) will increase, but the ratio of false
alarm B/(B+D) will increase as well. When a very high cutoff is chosen, the ratio of
correct signal decreases, making interventions are surprises, although the ratio of false
alarms would decrease. The noise-to-signal ratio is defined as ([B/(B+D)]/[A/(A+C)]).
The optimal cutoff, as proposed by Kaminsky and Reinhart, is chosen to minimize this
ratio. Since A+C and B+D are constant, the optimal cutoff can be chosen to minimize
B/A.
          Tables 5-1, 5-2, and 5-3 show the optimal cutoff and the resulting counts in the
format of Table 4, for the entire sample, the first half, and the second half, respectively.
For the first half, the optimal cutoff was 0.72, but the correct signal was issued 50 times
out of 165 interventions. The ratio of correct signal was 30%, while about 70% of
interventions were surprise interventions. The false alarm was issued only 8 times out
of 936 no-intervention days. The noise ratio was only 0.8%. The noise-to-signal ratio
was 0.0282. The intervention was in the sense quite predictable.
          For the second half, the optimal cutoff was 0.30. With this cutoff, the correct
signal was only 5 times out of 49 interventions. The correct signal ratio was about 10%,
that is, about 90% of interventions were surprises. The false alarm was issued 13 times
out of 1905 no-intervention days; the noise ratio was 0.7%. The noise-to-signal ratio
was 0.0669 that is much higher than the first half. The main difficulty was the low ratio
of correct signal. The signal ratio was 30% in the first half of the sample, while it was
10% in the second half of the sample. In other words, the signal turned on 58 times, in
which 8 turned out to be false (13% of false signal ratio) in the first period. In the second
period, the false signals were 13 out of 18 (72% of false signal ratio).
          This confirms the conventional wisdom, as documented in Ito (2003) that
interventions in the second half of the sample were quite unpredictable, and that was
intended by Dr. Sakakibara. It should be noted that the reaction function in this section is
of the in-sample prediction type. If the model is seriously used for prediction, the
out-of-sample prediction model should be developed.                   However, it is not


do not have a situation in which the econometrician expects the yen-purchasing (selling) intervention
when the yen-selling (purchasing) intervention takes place.

straight-forward, as both regression and the cutoff point should be optimized everyday.
This is left for future research.

6．Conclusion
This paper has proposed and estimated a new model of intervention activities of the
Japanese monetary authorities. The reaction function of intervention has been typically
estimated with a regular OLS regression. However, the conventional model has a
shortcoming of predicting interventions almost always that turned out to be false. The
new model is based on a theoretical model of interventions with political fixed costs of
intervention. The ordered probit model with a neutral band of no-intervention, is derived
from theory, and estimated for the 1991-2002 period. The frequency and size of
intervention changed, from frequent, small-size interventions to infrequent, large-size
interventions, in June 1995 when Dr. Sakakibara became in charge of intervention policy.
          The ordered probit reaction function with a neutral band was estimated for the
entire, first-half, and second-half of the sample. The following points stand out. The
interventions were of the lean-against type, in that large changes in the previous days
tended to prompt interventions to counter the movement. The authorities tended to
intervene when the exchange rate deviated large from a long-term moving average. When
there was an intervention a day before, it is more likely, other things being equal, for the
authorities to intervene. The neutral band was much wider in the second half than the first
half. In the second half, the neutral band was asymmetric, in that the yen depreciation
was more tolerated than yen appreciation.
          The ordered probit function can be viewed as a forecasting model of intervention
indicator. When a cutoff level is chosen, the prediction of intervention is generated, that
may turn out to be true or false. The optimal cutoff level was chosen to minimize the
noise-to-signal ratio. The optimal cutoff was higher in the first half than the second half.
The noise-to-signal ratio was higher in the second half, as many interventions were
surprises. According to the writings of the Dr. Sakakibara, this was a deliberate policy of
the authorities.
          The newly proposed model of interventions is successfully estimated. It
remains to be a future task to refine the specification, and introduce a concept of
out-of-sample forecasts in calculating the noise-to-signal ratio.
