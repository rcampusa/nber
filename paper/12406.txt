                                           ABSTRACT


         We estimate the medical cost per life-year gained from increased utilization of HIV drugs
by estimating the impact of increased drug utilization on the life expectancy and drug and hospital
expenditure of HIV/AIDS patients, using aggregate (U.S. national-level) data for the period
1982-2001. We use IMS Health data on the aggregate number of and expenditure on HIV drug
prescriptions, the CDC’s AIDS Public Information Data Set, and data from AHRQ’s Nationwide
Inpatient Sample.
         Estimates of mortality models imply that actual life expectancy of HIV/AIDS patients in
2001 was 13.4 years higher than it would have been if the drug utilization rate had not increased
from its 1993 level. Estimates of a model of hospital discharges imply that increased utilization of
HIV drugs caused hospital utilization to decline by .25 to .29 discharges per person per year during
the period 1993-2001. Medical cost per additional life-year is estimated to have been $17,175.
         Treatments that cost this amount are widely considered to be cost-effective. The consistency
of this estimate with those from previous studies suggests that analysis of aggregate data may be a
useful alternative or additional approach to evaluating the cost-effectiveness of new treatments.

Introduction


        Between 1993 and 2000, inflation-adjusted expenditure on HIV drugs per person living

with AIDS increased more than fivefold, from about $1700 to about $9000. This was largely

attributable to substantial HIV drug innovation during this period: the number of FDA-approved

HIV drug classes tripled (from 1 to 3), and the number of FDA-approved HIV drugs increased

from 3 to 17 [1].

        We will show that, during the same period, the number of hospital admissions for HIV

infection per person living with AIDS declined 67%, and the five-year survival rate of people

diagnosed with AIDS increased from 3% to 54%. How much of the decline in the hospitalization

rate, and increase in the survival rate, can be attributed to the large increase in HIV drug

utilization? To determine the incremental cost-effectiveness of these drugs, we need answers to

these questions.

        Previous studies have used a variety of methods to estimate the clinical benefits and cost

effectiveness of HIV/AIDS drugs. Freedberg et al [2] developed a mathematical simulation

model of HIV disease, using the CD4 cell count and HIV RNA level as predictors of the

progression of disease. They derived clinical data from major clinical trials, including the AIDS

Clinical Trials Group 320 Study, and data on costs from the national AIDS Cost and Services

Utilization Survey and the Red Book. They found that for patients similar to those in the AIDS

Clinical Trials Group 320 Study (mean CD4 cell count, 87 per cubic millimeter), life expectancy

adjusted for the quality of life increased from 1.53 to 2.91 years, and per-person lifetime costs

increased from $45,460 to $77,300 with three-drug therapy as compared with no therapy. The

incremental cost per quality-adjusted year of life gained, as compared with no therapy, was

$23,000. On the basis of additional data from other major studies, the cost-effectiveness ratio for

three-drug therapy ranged from $13,000 to $23,000 per quality-adjusted year of life gained. They
                                                                                                       4


concluded that treatment of HIV infection with a combination of three antiretroviral drugs is a

cost-effective use of resources.

        Duggan and Evans [3] used individual-level pharmacy and medical claims data on about

10,000 California Medicaid recipients diagnosed with HIV/AIDS to estimate the effect of HIV

antiretroviral (ARV) treatments on longevity and long-term health care spending during the

period 1993-2003. Approximately half of all AIDS patients in the U.S. are enrolled in Medicaid.

They accounted for the fact that patients taking ARVs are significantly less healthy than the

average patient in their sample. Their findings demonstrated that the increase in the use of four

drugs approved by the FDA in late 1995 and early 1996 was responsible for more than 90 percent

of the drop in the mortality rate from 1995 to 1998. Despite the entry of more than a dozen drugs

since these four, mortality rates have remained virtually unchanged. They found that the use of

the new drugs led to a threefold increase in lifetime Medicaid spending due to their high cost and

the resulting increase in life expectancy. Despite this, the new treatments were cost-effective,

with the average additional cost in Medicaid spending per life-year saved equal to $23,000.

        In this paper, we use a third approach to estimate the clinical benefits and cost

effectiveness of HIV/AIDS drugs: estimation of econometric models of mortality and

hospitalization rates of HIV/AIDS patients using aggregate (U.S. national-level) time-series data

for the period 1981-2001.



Methods



    We will estimate the relationship in the population of HIV/AIDS patients between the HIV

drug utilization rate and both (1) the mortality rate and (2) the HIV hospitalization rate. First we

will explain how these three variables were measured. Then we will specify the relationships to

be estimated.
                                                                                                    5


    Mortality rate. The mortality rate is the number of deaths in a period divided by the average

number of people alive during the period. It can be estimated during the period 1981-2001 from

the CDC’s AIDS Public Information Data Set [4]. AIDSPIDS contains two types of data: micro

and macro. The micro data set contains one record for each AIDS case reported to CDC during

the period 1981-2001. It reports the month of diagnosis of the person’s first AIDS-indicator

opportunistic condition. It also indicates whether the CDC was notified that this patient died by

the end of 1999, but to protect confidentiality, it does not report the date of death.

    The macro data set provides frequencies of AIDS cases, by period (half-year) of diagnosis

and period of death. For example, it reveals that 264 people diagnosed with AIDS in the first half

of 1988 died in the second half of 1992.

    The CDC expanded its AIDS surveillance definition on January 1, 1993 to include all HIV-

infected adults and adolescents who had less that 200 CD4+ T-lymphocytes/µL or a CD4+ T-

lymphocyte percent of total lymphocytes less than 14, or who have been diagnosed with

pulmonary tuberculosis, invasive cervical cancer, or recurrent pneumonia [5]. This revision had a

substantial impact on the number of reported cases: the number of reported cases increased from

47,293 in 1992 to 104,759 in 1993. But to measure trends over time using a constant case

definition, CDC developed methods that estimated incidence of 1987 or 1993 definition

opportunistic infections for cases that met only the 1993 immunologic (CD4+) criteria. As a

result, the 1993 expansion of the AIDS case definition had only a small, transitory effect on the

estimated number of diagnosed cases: the number of diagnosed cases was 79,657 in 1992 and

79,879 in 1993.

    Let

          N_DIAGj = the number of people first diagnosed with AIDS in year j

          N_DIEDj = the number of deaths from AIDS in year j

These data allow us to calculate the number of AIDS patients alive at the beginning of period t

(N_ALIVEt) and the mortality rate during period t (MORT_RATEt), as follows:
                                                                                                      6


        N_ALIVEt = Σj=1t-1 (N_DIAGj - N_DIEDj)

        MORT_RATEt = N_DIEDt / ((N_ALIVEt + N_ALIVEt+1)/2)

The top part of Figure 1 displays data on the AIDS mortality rate. We computed the annual

mortality rate from semiannual data as follows: a = (1 – (1 – s)2), where a denotes the annual

mortality rate and s denotes the semiannual mortality rate.

        The CDC [6] publishes data on the U.S. HIV/AIDS mortality rate; Lai et al [7] used these

data to compute the potential gains of life expectancy due to the elimination or reduction of

HIV/AIDS deaths. The CDC’s HIV/AIDS mortality rate (CDC_RATE) is defined as follows:



        CDC_RATE = N_DIED / POP



where POP = population. The CDC’s mortality rate (the unconditional probability of dying from

HIV/AIDS) is the product of two variables: the probability of dying from HIV/AIDS, conditional

on having HIV/AIDS, and the probability of having HIV/AIDS:

CDC_RATE = (N_DIED / PREV) * (PREV / POP)

              = MORT_RATE * (PREV / POP)

where PREVt = (N_ALIVEt + N_ALIVEt+1) / 2.

Since we want to examine the relationship between the HIV drug utilization rate and the mortality

rate in the population of HIV/AIDS patients, we will analyze data on the conditional mortality rate

(MORT_RATE), rather than on the CDC’s unconditional mortality rate.

        The lower part of Figure 1 displays data on the percentage change in the AIDS mortality

rate. Before 1987, when the first HIV drug was introduced, the mortality rate was in the 60-70%

range, and was not declining. From the first half of 1987 to the second half of 1995, it declined at

the rate of 6.1% per half year. From the second half of 1995 to the first half of 1998, it declined

four times as rapidly--at the rate of 24.8% per half year. From the first half of 1998 to the first

half of 2001, it declined less rapidly--at the rate of 9.0% per half year.
                                                                                                        7


        We compared mortality rates in 1994, 1997, and 2000 derived from AIDSPIDS with

corresponding rates reported by Duggan and Evans [3, Table 2] from the California Medicaid

sample. The mortality rates in 2000 differ by only 10%, and both series indicate much more

rapid decline during 1994-1997 than during 1997-2000. However, the AIDSPIDS series exhibits

more rapid decline: the ratio of the 1994 to the 2000 mortality rate is 6.25 for AIDPIDS, vs. 4.42

for the California Medicaid sample.

        Survival functions for 1993 and 2000 are depicted in Figure 2. They demonstrate the

dramatic reduction in mortality during the 1990s.

        The average age of people diagnosed with AIDS tended to increase over time. Before

1985, over half of people diagnosed were under 35. After 1999, less than 30% of people

diagnosed were under 35. In general, mortality rates increase with age, so the increase in age at

diagnosis may make the decline in mortality even more striking. However, it is possible that the

disease progresses less rapidly in older patients than it does in younger patients, so the decline in

the age-adjusted mortality rate could be smaller than the decline in the crude mortality rate.

Although we have time-series data on the age distribution of people diagnosed with AIDS, we do

not have data on the age distribution of people living with AIDS, so we can’t make an explicit

adjustment for this. However, the data indicate that the age distribution of people diagnosed with

AIDS shifted at a fairly steady rate, so the estimation procedure we will use (described below),

which involved first-differencing the data, may adequately control for the effect of changes in the

age distribution of people living with AIDS.

        Life expectancy. Our goal is to assess the impact of changing HIV drug utilization on

the life expectancy of HIV/AIDS patients. The concept of life expectancy we use is the one used

by the National Center for Health Statistics [8] to calculate the official government estimates of

U.S. life expectancy. It is based on the “period life-table” (as opposed to the “cohort life-table”)

method. The period life table presents what would happen to a hypothetical (or synthetic) cohort

if it experienced throughout its entire life the mortality conditions of a particular period in time.
                                                                                                        8


The period life table renders a “snapshot” of current mortality experience, and shows the long-

range implications of a set of duration-specific death rates that prevailed in a given year.

        Under certain assumptions, there is a very simple relationship between life expectancy

and the crude mortality rate. If the survival distribution function is exponential, i.e. the hazard

rate is independent of duration, life expectancy is simply the reciprocal of the crude mortality

rate. For example, if the crude mortality rate is 5%, then life expectancy is 20 years.

        Analysis of the AIDSPIDS data revealed that the hazard rate is not independent of

duration: the hazard rate is strictly decreasing with respect to duration of illness. For example, a

person is 17% less likely to die in the third year after diagnosis than in the first year after

diagnosis, and is 35% less likely to die in the fifth year than in the first year. This may be partly

or wholly attributable to heterogeneous severity of (or vulnerability to) illness: individuals with

less severe cases are both more likely to survive until the beginning of year t, and less likely to

die during year t, conditional on survival until the beginning of year t. We therefore also

computed estimates of life expectancy from survival functions that are more flexible than the

exponential (e.g. the Weibull or the Gamma) We found that these estimates of life expectancy

were fairly similar to those produced by the much simpler approach (i.e. computing the reciprocal

of the mortality rate), despite evidence that the hazard rate is not independent of duration.

Therefore, like Duggan and Evans [3], we will estimate life expectancy by the reciprocal of the

mortality rate:

        LEt = 1 / MORT_RATEt = ((N_ALIVEt + N_ALIVEt+1)/2) / N_DIEDt

        Drug utilization rate. The drug utilization rate (rxt) is the ratio of the number of

prescriptions (Rx’s) for HIV drugs to the number of people living with AIDS.

        rxt = N_RXt / ((N_ALIVEt + N_ALIVEt+1)/2)

            = HIV rx’s per person living with AIDS in period t

where N_RXt = the number of prescriptions (Rx’s) for HIV drugs in period t. (This refers to any

prescription during the time period considered (i.e., consecutive as well as simultaneous)).
                                                                                                      9


        Data on the numerator of this ratio were obtained from IMS Health. Different purchasers

incur different expenditures for the same drug in the U.S. This is particularly true for HIV drugs,

where the major payers are state Medicaid and AIDS Drug Assistance Programs, who receive

substantial receive discounts and manufacturer rebates. These discounts and rebates are reflected

in the IMS data: the data reflect actual transaction prices, not list prices such as “average

wholesale price”.

        Data on the denominator were computed from AIDSPIDS. Data on HIV drug

expenditure, quantities, and prices, 1987-2003, are shown in Table 1. Figure 3 shows average

drug utilization during the period 1981-2001. No HIV drugs were consumed (or approved) until

1987. From 1987 to 1992, the number of HIV Rx’s per person increased steadily, reaching about

3.7 per half-year in 1992. From 1992 to 1995, average drug utilization declined, to about 2.2 HIV

Rx’s per half-year. From the second half of 1995 to the second half of 1997, average drug

utilization quadrupled, from 2.55 to 10.29 per half-year. Despite the FDA approval of five new

drugs during 1998-2000, it stayed close to ten through the first half of 2001.

        Hospitalization rate. We obtained annual data on inpatient hospitalizations for HIV

infections during the period 1993-2002 from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS). NIS is the

largest all-payer inpatient care database in the United States. It contains data from approximately

7 million hospital stays. NIS is the only national hospital database with charge information on all

patients, regardless of payer, including persons covered by Medicare, Medicaid, private

insurance, and the uninsured. NIS 2002 contains all discharge data from 995 hospitals located in

35 States, approximating a 20-percent stratified sample of U.S. community hospitals. NIS data

are available from 1988 to 2002, and HCUP publishes state- and national-level data for the period

1993-2002. The number of States in the NIS has grown from 8 in the first year to 35 currently.

        Data on inpatient hospitalizations for HIV infections (Major Diagnostic Category 25)

during the period 1993-2002 were downloaded directly from the HCUPnet website [9] and are

presented in Table 2. We defined the HIV hospitalization rate as follows:
                                                                                                        10


        hospt = N_HOSPt / ((N_ALIVEt + N_ALIVEt+1)/2)

                 = inpatient hospital discharges for HIV infections per person living with AIDS in
        year t
where N_HOSPt = the number of inpatient hospitalizations for HIV infections in period t

        Econometric specification. We will estimate the relationship in the population of

HIV/AIDS patients between the HIV drug utilization rate and both (1) the mortality rate and (2)

the HIV hospitalization rate. The mortality analysis will be based on semiannual data for the

period 1982:2-2001:2 (N = 39). The hospitalization analysis will be based on annual data for the

period 1993-2001 (N = 9).

        We will examine the relationship between the logarithm of the mortality rate and the HIV

drug utilization rate. This seems appropriate because the mortality rate is bounded between zero

and one, and also because the mortality rate changed by a factor of 18 over the sample period.

We don’t use the logarithm of the HIV drug utilization rate because this variable was equal to

zero before 1987. This semi-logarithmic specification is predicated on the hypothesis of

diminishing returns: equal successive increases in the HIV drug utilization rate result in declining

successive (absolute) reductions in the mortality rate. We show below that this specification

seems to fit the data quite well.

        The hospitalization rate changed far less during 1993-2001—by a factor of 3.8—than the

mortality rate changed during 1982:2-2001:2. It is also not bounded from above. We estimated

models of both the hospitalization rate and the logarithm of the hospitalization rate. The

estimates had similar implications; the former model seemed to fit the data slightly better, so we

will report estimates of that model.

        Many time series variables are characterized by unit roots. A variable y is said to have a

unit root if π = 1 in the autoregressive equation yt = γ + π yt-1 + εt. As Greene [10, p. 846]

observes, the regression of one variable characterized by a unit root on another variable

characterized by a unit root “is virtually certain to produce a significant relationship, even if the
                                                                                                      11


two are, in fact, independent.” He notes that under these circumstances, “the case for first

differencing or detrending is compelling” [10, p. 847].

        We estimated autoregressive equations for each of the three variables. The results are

shown in Table 3. These estimates suggest that all three variables have, or nearly have, unit

roots. (The estimate of π in the log(mort) equation is significantly greater than one.) We will

therefore estimate relationships between first differences, rather than levels, of the variables.

Although the first difference of log(mort) is not stationary—the slope of the regression of

∆log(mort) on a time trend is negative and significant—the first difference of the HIV drug

utilization rate appears to be stationary. Greene [10, p. 844] observes that further differencing of

time-series can increase rather than decrease autocorrelation.

        Hence, we will estimate the following model of the mortality rate:

(1)     ∆ln(mort_ratet) = δ + β ∆rxt + υt

where

        mort_ratet = the crude mortality rate in period t

                rxt = HIV rx’s per person living with AIDS in period t

and ∆ denotes the change from the previous period.

        Eq. (1) embodies the assumption that changes in the rate of mortality decline are related

only to contemporaneous changes in average drug utilization. It is quite possible that changes in

mortality also depend on lagged changes in average drug utilization. To allow for this possibility,

we will also estimate models like:

(2)     ∆ln(mort_ratet) = δ + β ∆rxt + β−1 ∆rxt−1 + β−2 ∆rxt−2 + υt

In this model, the long-run effect of drug utilization (i.e., the effect of a sustained increase in rx)

is the sum of the coefficients, (β + β−1 + β−2).
                                                                                                     12


          If drug utilization is exogenous with respect to mortality, changes in mortality should

depend on current and past changes in drug utilization, but not on future changes. We can test the

exogeneity of drug utilization by testing whether β+1 = 0 in the model

(3)       ∆ln(mort_ratet) = δ + β+1 ∆rxt+1 + β ∆rxt + β−1 ∆rxt−1 + β−2 ∆rxt−2 + υt

          We will estimate the following model of the hospitalization rate:

(4)       ∆hospt = δ + β ∆rxt + υt

where

          hospt = inpatient hospital discharges for HIV infections per person living with AIDS in

year t.

Since the hospitalization time series is extremely short, we will not investigate the lag structure of

this relationship.



Results



Mortality results. Figure 4 shows the time series plots of ∆ln(mort_ratet) and ∆rxt. It suggests

that changes in the rate of mortality decline were closely related to changes in average drug

utilization.

          Estimates of regressions of ∆ln(mort_ratet) on current, lagged, and/or future changes in

drug utilization (eqs. 1-3) are reported in Table 4. All equations were estimated allowing for

first-order serial correlation. The Durbin-Watson statistics indicate that the residuals are

reasonably well-behaved.

          Column 1 shows the regression of ∆ln(mort_ratet) on ∆rxt and ∆rxt−1. The coefficients on

both variables are negative and highly significant. The magnitude of β−1 is 50% larger than the

magnitude of β, indicating that an increase in drug utilization reduces the mortality rate 50%
                                                                                                       13


more after six months than it does immediately. The sum of the coefficients is -0.10: one

additional prescription per person living with AIDS reduced the mortality rate by about 10%.

        In column 2 we also include a time trend, to further guard against the possibility of

spurious correlation. Although the trend is significant, its inclusion has virtually no effect on the

estimated β’s.

        In column 3 we add ∆rxt−2 to the equation, but exclude the time trend. The coefficient on

∆rxt−2 is significant at the 6% level; adding it increases the magnitude of the sum of the β’s by

19%. In column 4 we include the time trend. The coefficient on ∆rxt−2 is significant at the 10%

level; the sum of the β’s is now -.11.

        Finally, in column 5, we include ∆rxt+1, the change in drug utilization in the next period.

The coefficient on ∆rxt+1 is far from statistically significant (p-value = 0.66), lending support to

the exogeneity of drug utilization.

        These estimates can be used to calculate how much higher the mortality rate would have

been in 2001 if the drug utilization rate had not increased up until that point. The calculations are

summarized in Table 5. Between 1993 and 2001, the average semiannual rate of drug utilization

increased by 6.5, from 2.9 to 9.4 prescriptions. The estimates in column 4 imply that this reduced

ln(mort_rate) by 0.71. In other words, ln(mort_rate2001) would have been 0.71 higher if the rate of

drug utilization had not increased since 1993; mort_rate2001 would have been 2.03 (= exp(0.71))

times as high as it actually was. The actual value of mort_rate2001 was 3.8%, so the predicted

value, if drug utilization had not increased after 1993, is 7.7% (= 2.03 * 3.8%). As discussed

above, life expectancy may be approximated by the reciprocal of the mortality rate. This implies

that actual life expectancy in 2001 was 13.4 (= 26.3 – 12.9) years higher than it would have been

if the drug utilization rate had not increased from its 1993 level. These data suggest that about

60% of the total 22.6-year increase in life expectancy during 1993-2001 is attributable to the

increase in drug utilization.

Hospitalization results. Figure 5 shows annual data on changes in drug and hospital utilization

during 1994-2002. This chart suggests that there is a strong inverse relationship between these

variables.

        Estimates of eq. (4) are presented in Table 6. Estimates of β and δ are significantly

different from zero, suggesting that the hospitalization rate is inversely related to the drug

utilization rate, and that the hospitalization rate would have declined, even if the drug utilization

rate had not increased. From 1993 to 2001, the semiannual drug utilization rate increased by 6.33

(from 2.88 to 9.21). The estimates imply that this caused hospital utilization to decline by .25 to

.29 discharges/year. (The total decline in hospital utilization was 0.75 discharges per year).

    Now we will estimate the effect of increased HIV drug utilization and expenditure on overall

medical expenditure per year and over the course of the patient’s remaining life. First we will

estimate actual expenditure per HIV patient in 2000. Then we will estimate what expenditure per

patient would have been in 2000 in the absence of any increase in drug utilization after 1993.

    Data on average inpatient and outpatient utilization and costs in 2000 are available from

HIVnet [11]. Data on average prescription drug utilization and costs in 2000 are calculated in

Table 1. These figures are summarized in Table 7. As shown in Table 1, from 1993 to 2000,

mean drug expenditure per patient increased by $7356 (in 2001 dollars). This was due to

increases in both the average number and average price of prescriptions. We estimate that the

1993-2000 increase in drug utilization reduced the average number of hospital admissions per

HIV patient in 2000 by 0.33. (In the absence of the drug utilization increase, the number of

hospital admissions (like the number of deaths) would have been double what it actually was.)

Therefore the 1993-2000 increase in drug utilization reduced mean hospital expenditure in 2000

by $3826. About 52% (= $3826/$7356) of the increase in HIV drug expenditure appears to have

been offset by a reduction in hospital expenditure.

        The increase in drug utilization may also have reduced outpatient costs: between 1991

and 2000, the average annual number of outpatient visits per HIV patient declined from 41.0 to
                                                                                                     15


6.4. (The 1991 figure was calculated from the AIDS Cost and Services Utilization Survey.) But

time-series data on outpatient visits are not available, so it is hard to know how much of this

decline can be attributed to increased drug utilization. For the moment, assume that increased

drug utilization reduced hospital expenditure, but not outpatient expenditure.

        In this case, we predict that, if drug utilization had not increased from its 1993 level,

average medical expenditure in 2000 would have been $10,247 (= $13,777 - $7356 + $3826). As

Table 8 shows, by combining these annual expenditure figures with the life expectancy figures

derived earlier, we can compute actual vs. counterfactual lifetime medical expenditure. In 2000,

average medical expenditure per HIV patient was $13,777, and his life expectancy was 26.3

years, so (undiscounted) lifetime medical expenditure is projected to be $362 thousand. If drug

utilization had not increased from its 1993 level, average medical expenditure in 2000 would

have been $3530 lower, and life expectancy would have been 12.9 years, so lifetime medical

expenditure would have been $132 thousand. Medical cost per additional life-year is $17,175 (=

$230,140 / 13.4).



Discussion



        This paper has assessed the impact of increased utilization of HIV drugs on the life

expectancy, annual medical expenditure, and lifetime medical expenditure of HIV/AIDS patients,

using aggregate (U.S. national-level) data for the period 1982-2001.

        Estimates of a mortality model implied that actual life expectancy in 2001 was 13.4 years

higher than it would have been if the drug utilization rate had not increased from its 1993 level.

About 60% of the total 22.6-year increase in life expectancy during 1993-2001 is attributable to

the increase in drug utilization.

        Estimates of a model of hospital discharges implied that increased utilization of HIV

drugs caused hospital utilization to decline by .25 to .29 discharges per person per year. About
                                                                                                    16


one-third of the total decline in hospital utilization during 1993-2001 is attributable to the

increase in drug utilization, and 52% of the increase in HIV drug expenditure appears to have

been offset by a reduction in hospital expenditure.

        Two caveats apply to our hospitalization estimates. First, the HCUP data on HIV

hospital admissions may not be completely reliable: HIV hospital admissions were

geographically concentrated in a few major urban centers, particularly in earlier years of the HIV

epidemic, when HCUP also included data from fewer states. Second, due to measurement error

in estimating the number of HIV patients, our estimate of the reduction in hospital discharges is

likely to be conservative. Suppose that the number of patients living with AIDS is overestimated

in year t (e.g. due to failure of AIDSPIDS to distinguish between people who remain alive and

people who have died but whose date of death is unknown). This would cause both hospt and rxt

to be underestimated in year t, and induce a positive correlation between these two series.

        In 2000, average medical expenditure per HIV patient was $13,777, and his life

expectancy was 26.3 years, so (undiscounted) lifetime medical expenditure is projected to be

$362 thousand. If drug utilization had not increased from its 1993 level, average medical

expenditure in 2000 would have been $3530 lower, and life expectancy would have been 12.9

years, so lifetime medical expenditure would have been $132 thousand. Medical cost per

additional life-year is $17,175.

        Increased drug utilization may have reduced outpatient as well as inpatient costs. If there

would have been twice as many outpatient visits in 2000 absent the post-1993 increase in drug

utilization—12.8 rather than 6.4 visits per person—we estimate that cost per life-year is $16,007

instead of $17,175.

        Our estimates of mean lifetime expenditure (both actual and predicted under 1993 drug

utilization) are not discounted. The estimates of Duggan and Evans are also not discounted. To

produce accurate estimates of discounted expenditure, one needs to project the course (or growth

rate) of future annual medical expenditure over a patient’s remaining life, which is difficult to do.
                                                                                                    17


If the growth rate of annual medical expenditure exceeds the discount (interest) rate, then

discounted expenditure exceeds undiscounted expenditure. If the growth rate is lower than the

discount rate, then discounted expenditure is lower than undiscounted expenditure. It seems to us

that the growth rate could be either higher or lower than the discount rate, so that undiscounted

estimates need not either overstate or understate discounted estimates.

        These estimates are similar to those obtained in previous studies based on completely

different methods. Freedberg et al’s estimate of the (discounted) cost of three-drug therapy per

quality-adjusted year of life gained, derived from a mathematical simulation model of HIV

disease, ranged from $13,000 to $23,000. Duggan and Evans’ (2005) estimate of medical cost

per additional life-year, derived from individual-level pharmacy and medical claims data, was

$23,000. Both authors note that treatments that cost $23,000 per life-year gained are widely

considered to be cost-effective. Murphy and Topel [12] argue that the average value of a U.S.

statistical life may be on the order of $150,000.

        The overall consistency of our estimates with those from previous studies suggests that

analysis of aggregate data may be a useful alternative or additional approach to evaluating the

cost-effectiveness of new treatments.

        Our estimates, and those by previous authors, do not account for a potentially important

benefit of new HIV drugs: increased ability to work. The data shown in Table 9, computed from

the 1996-2001 waves of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey [13], indicate that the percent of

people with HIV who were unable to work due to illness has been declining. The difference in

percentages is significant at the 5.3% level. Moreover, the measured improvement in ability to

work may be underestimated because there were probably more early diagnoses of HIV between

1996 and 1998, possibly leading to a higher proportion of HIV-infected individuals in the MEPS

who knew that they were HIV-infected, were asymptomatic and were still able to work. It is

likely that increased drug utilization reduced inability to work among HIV patients.
                                                                                                       18


        The HIV drugs already approved by the FDA may be either less or more cost-effective in

the future than they have been in the past. Increasing resistance to these drugs would clearly

reduce their cost-effectiveness.   On the other hand, the patents on these drugs will eventually

expire. When they do, the cost-effectiveness of these drugs will increase dramatically, since

drug prices typically decline by about 80% following patent expiration. However, the impact of

patent expirations on total HIV drug expenditures is likely to be reduced as newer drugs that are

considered more effective or convenient or that have fewer side effects replace drugs closer to

patent expiration.

        Forecasting the future trajectory of HIV/AIDS treatment and outcomes is difficult. As

the philosopher Soren Kierkegaard observed, "life must be lived forwards, but can only be

understood backwards." But there is reason to expect further progress in the future. Just days

ago the FDA approved a new product that may have a significant impact. On July 12, 2006, the

FDA approved Atripla Tablets, a fixed-dose combination of three widely-used antiretroviral

drugs, in a single tablet taken once a day, alone or in combination with other antiretroviral

products for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults. Atripla, the first one-pill, once-a-day

product to treat HIV/AIDS, combines the active ingredients of Sustiva (efavirenz), Emtriva

(emtricitabine) and Viread (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate). Bristol-Myers Squibb and Gilead

Sciences have formed a joint venture to commercialize Atripla in the United States. The

collaboration is the first of its kind in the field of HIV/AIDS. In certain territories, Merck holds

the rights to efavirenz. All three companies will work together to ensure the product is available

to patients and physicians. "The approval of Atripla simplifies the treatment regimen for HIV-1

infected adults, and will potentially improve the ability of patients to adhere to treatment resulting

in long-term effective control of HIV-1. This offers a particularly important advantage for

patients in many countries that are most affected by the AIDS epidemic and will also have a

major impact in the U.S.," said Dr. Andrew C. von Eschenbach, the Acting Commissioner of

Food and Drugs.

        HIV/AIDS continues to be an active area of pharmaceutical R&D. According to the U.S.

government’s ClinicalTrials.gov website, which provides regularly updated information about

federally and privately supported clinical research in human volunteers, at present, there are 557

trials of HIV/AIDS drugs currently recruiting or planning to recruit patients; 1753 trials have

been completed or are no longer recruiting patients.
