Do Patent Pools Encourage Innovation? Evidence from 20 U.S. Industries under the New
Deal

                                              ABSTRACT

Patent pools, which allow competing firms to combine their patents, have emerged as a prominent
mechanism to resolve litigation when multiple firms own patents for the same technology. This paper
takes advantage of a window of regulatory tolerance under the New Deal to investigate the effects
of pools on innovation within 20 industries. Difference-in-differences regressions imply a 16 percent
decline in patenting in response to the creation of a pool. This decline is driven by technology fields
in which a pool combined patents for substitute technologies by competing firms, suggesting that unregulated
pools may discourage innovation by weakening competition to improve substitutes.

Patent pools, which allow competing firms to combine their patents as if they are a single
firm, have emerged as a prominent policy tool to address a key problem with the current
patent system: Imperfect boundaries of intellectual property rights allow multiple firms to
own mutually infringing patents for the same technology, which they use to threaten
litigation and prevent each other from producing the technologies. Patent pools can
mitigate this problem by allowing firms to combine their patents in a “pool” which all
firms can access to produce the technology and license it to outside firms. For example,
pools have been proposed to cover improvements in smart phones, tablet computers,
video compression technologies, malaria and HIV drugs, and diagnostic test kits for
breast cancer.
        Whether pools encourage or discourage innovation, however, is difficult to
predict without systematic empirical analyses. Pools are expected to strengthen
incentives to invest in R&D by reducing litigation risks (Shapiro 2001; Gilbert 2004) and
by lowering the transaction costs of licensing (Merges 2001). Pools may also encourage
the adoption of new technologies by preventing double-marginalization (or “royalty
stacking”), which occurs when individual firms charge excessive license fees for
complementary parts of the same technology (Merges 2001; Shapiro 2001, p. 134).1
Pools may, however, also discourage investments in R&D by pool members, because
returns to R&D will be shared, and members may choose to free ride on other members’
research efforts (Vaughan 1956; Lerner, Strojwas, and Tirole 2007).2
        Most importantly, perhaps, regulators caution, that in the absence of effective
antitrust policies, pools may form that harm competition: “participants in the pool might
be able to use it to collude, for example, by exchanging competitively sensitive
information, such as pricing, marketing, or R&D information through the mechanism of

  Pools may also enhance welfare if a subset of firms is vertically integrated, and the existence of a pool
allows upstream firms to coordinate input prices and internalize the impact on vertically integrated
downstream members (Kim 2004). Pools may, however, be unstable, if firms choose exit the pool instead
of contributing their technologies (Aoki and Nagaoka 2004).
2
  Vaughan (1956, p. 67) observes that the 1917 aircraft pool discouraged innovation by members because
“pooling all patents of members and giving each the right to use the inventions of the other took away each
member’s incentive for basic inventions.”




                                                                                                          1
the pool” (Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission 2007). Theoretically,
such changes in the intensity of competition may also discourage innovation by
weakening competition to improve substitute technologies, but empirical evidence is
scarce.
          Existing empirical analyses have been limited to less than a handful of individual
industries. Historical data on patents and alternative measures of innovation in the 19th-
century sewing machine industry indicate that the creation of a pool discouraged
innovation (Lampe and Moser 2010), and diverted firm entry towards technologically
inferior substitutes that did not compete directly with the pool (Lampe and Moser
2012a).3 By comparison, qualitative evidence for the CD industry, indicates an increase
in innovation (Flamm 2012), while data for optical disk drives suggest a decline in
innovation comparable with that for sewing machines (Joshi and Nerkar 2011; Flamm
2012). In the open source software industry, the creation of a pool was followed by a
modest increase in entry for technologies in which IBM contributed patents to the pool
(Ceccagnoli, Forman, and Wen 2012).
          This paper extends the empirical evidence with a systematic analysis of 20
industries under the New Deal. New Deal policies, such as the National Industrial
Recovery Act (NIRA, 1933-35), which exempted the majority of U.S. industries from
antitrust in exchange for higher wages (e.g., Haley 2001, p. 8), create a unique
opportunity to investigate pools that would form in the absence of effective antitrust.4
Under the New Deal, regulators allowed pools to form in the hope that they would

3
  This result is particularly striking given that the pool did reduce license fees for nine complementary
(essential) patents that were required to build a state-of-the-art sewing machine, confirming predictions
about pools as a mechanism to eliminate double-marginalization (e.g., Shapiro 2001). Importantly, the
pool created differential license fees and litigation risks, which introduced a wedge in production costs that
favored members (Lampe and Moser 2012a).

  Alchian (1970) conjectures that New Deal policies, which limited competition and increased the
bargaining power of unions, kept the economy depressed after 1933. A macro-economic model of intra-
industry bargaining between labor and firms, which allows insiders to choose the size of the worker cartel,
predicts persistent unemployment and high wages as a result of cartelization policies that limit product
market competition and increase the bargaining power of labor (Cole and Ohanian 2004). Field (2003 and
2011), however, documents productivity increases in telephones, electric utilities, railroads,
communications, public utilities, transportation, real estate, mining, trade, manufacturing, services,
construction, and finance/insurance.




                                                                                                             2
facilitate economic recovery from the Great Depression, arguing that “An interchange of
patent rights and a division of royalties…are frequently necessary if technical
advancement is not to be blocked by threatened litigation.”5 Enforcement resumed after
March 11, 1938, when President Roosevelt appointed Thurman Arnold to reorganize the
Department of Justice’s Antitrust Division.6 From 1940 to 1949, Justice brought 38
criminal antitrust cases per year, compared with 8.7 per year between 1930 and 1939
(Posner 1970, p. 376).7 In 1942, the U.S. Supreme Court broke up Hartford Empire, a
particularly pernicious pool in the glassware industry. Arguing for the majority decision,
Justice Hugo Black observed that “the history of this country has perhaps never
witnessed a more completely successful economic tyranny over any field of industry…”8
After Hartford Empire, few pools formed until the Department of Justice revised its
antitrust guidelines in 1995 and approved the MPEG and DVD standards pools between
1997 and 1999.9
         Empirical tests exploit this window of weak enforcement to investigate the
potential effects on innovation of pools that would form in the absence of effective
antitrust. Baseline specifications compare changes in the total number of U.S. patent
applications – by pool members and other firms – across related technologies within the
same industry that were differentially affected by the creation of a pool. This difference-
in-differences approach allows us to control for changes in demand and other
unobservable factors that may have influenced patenting at the industry level.

to include more than 600 patents for machinery, which produced 94 percent of U.S. glass containers, the
pool had imposed production quotas and prevented licensees from adopting competing technologies.

  The revised 1995 guidelines treat licensing agreements as pro-competitive unless they can be shown to
reduce competition, and allow the formation of pools that combine complementary patents that are
necessary to build a specific technology (Gallini 2011, pp. 14-15).




                                                                                                           3
Technologies are defined at the level of United States Patent Office (USPTO) subclasses.
Pool technologies are subclasses with at least one patent that was included in a pool; the
number of pool patents in a given subclass measures the intensity of exposure to the
creation of a pool.
        In the main specifications, cross-reference subclasses, which patent examiners
have identified as closely related to pool technologies, serve as the control group for pool
technologies. Cross-reference subclasses exhibit similar pre-trends in patenting to pool
technologies before the creation of a pool. This helps address a common concern with
difference-in-difference estimates, which is that observed effects may be due to
differential pre-trends. As closely related technologies, cross-reference subclasses may
be affected by the creation of a pool, which will lead us to underestimate the true effects
of a pool. Robustness checks repeat the analysis with broader and narrower definitions of
the control.
        Changes in patenting are measured relative to a pool-specific year of pool creation
(controlling for calendar year fixed effects), which helps address the issue that changes in
patenting over time may be due to unobservable policy changes.10 Regressions also
include subclass and year fixed effects, as well as separate linear and quadratic time
trends for pool subclasses, to control for variation in the correspondence between patents
and innovations across technologies and over time (e.g., Moser 2012).
        The main data consist of 75,396 patent applications across 20 industries between
1921 and 1948; these patent applications cover 1,261 subclasses, including 433 pool
subclasses and 828 cross-reference subclasses. Importantly, the large majority of
innovations, roughly 97 percent, originate from non-members, even though pool
members account for more than 60 percent of output in some industries.11 This suggests
that, to capture their full effects on innovation, analyses of patent pools must consider


10
   For example, variation in spending or work relief programs under the New Deal (e.g., Wright 1974) may
have triggered differential changes in patenting over time.

   E.g., variable condensers, which are used to select radio stations (United States v. General Instrument
Corp., 87 F. Supp. 157 (D.N.J. 1949)) and ready-made furniture slip covers (United States v. Krasnov, 143
F. Supp 184 (E.D. Pa 1956)).




                                                                                                         4
effects on outside firms as well as members, and investigate changes in innovation at the
industry level – including outsiders as well as member firms.12
        Baseline estimates indicate a 16 percent decline in industry-level patent
applications in pool subclasses compared with cross-reference subclasses after the
creation of a pool. This result is robust to the inclusion of subclass and year fixed effects,
separate linear and quadratic time trends for pool technologies, and interactions between
year and industry fixed effects, which flexibly control for industry-specific changes in
patenting over time (e.g., as a result of changes in innovation and patenting over the life-
cycle of an industry).
        Regressions that expand the control group to include all subclasses in the same
USPTO class yield slightly larger estimates, confirming that regressions with cross-
reference subclasses as the control may underestimate the true decline. Conditional
fixed-effects Poisson regressions, which address the count data characteristics of patents
and allow for correlation in the error term over time, suggest a smaller, albeit large and
statistically significant decline. Estimates are also robust to restricting the sample to
pools that formed before the NIRA became unconstitutional in 1935, and to dropping any
individual pool, or all patents by pool members from the sample.
        Another potential concern with the basic difference-in-differences estimate is that
the creation of a pool may be an endogenous response to changes in the speed of
innovation that precede the creation of a pool. To investigate this issue, we estimate
annual coefficients, allowing estimates for the pool “effect” to be different from zero
before the creation of a pool. This analysis reveals no significant decline for the pre-pool

12
  Existing analyses have focused almost exclusively on predicting effects on pool members. Desquiedt and
Versaevel (2012) examine the effects of anticipating a patent pool on firm’s incentives to patent. Llanes
and Trento (2012) show that innovators are less likely to join a pool with more members because revenue
would be shared with more firms. Jeitschko and Zhang (2012) demonstrate that pools of complementary
patents may weaken the incentive of downstream firms to invest in R&D if they create knowledge
spillovers that lead to a decline in product differentiation and thereby reduce firms’ profits. Lerner and
Tirole (2004) focus on differential welfare effects of pools that combine complementary compared with
substitute patents; their model does not include outside firms and includes only a brief discussion on
innovation. Brenner’s (2009) model implies that predictions in Lerner and Tirole (2004) depend on
members’ ability to prevent entry into the pool.




                                                                                                         5
period; annual coefficients gradually become more negative after a pool forms, and are
consistently negative and statistically significant six years after the creation of a pool.
         We also investigate whether part of the observed decline may be driven by a
reduction in lower-quality or “strategic” patents. For example, the creation of a pool may
reduce the need for member firms to create patent thickets by reducing the threat of
litigation (e.g., Shapiro 2001; Gilbert 2004).13 The prospect of a pool may also provoke a
wasteful race to patent before the creation of a pool (e.g., Baron and Pohlmann 2011;
Dequiedt and Versaevel 2012), so that patent applications that firms submit leading up to
the creation of a pool may be of lower quality.14 The creation of a pool may also increase
the quality of patents by pool members if pool members coordinate their research efforts
and avoid duplicative R&D (e.g. Kamien, Muller, and Zang 1992).
         To control for the quality of patented inventions, we extend the NBER data set on
patent citations after 1975 (Hall, Jaffe, and Trajtenberg 2001) to include patent citations
between 1921 and 1975. Previous research has shown that the size of the innovation that
is covered by a patent is highly correlated with the number of citations to that patent by
later patents (e.g., Trajtenberg 1990; Moser, Ohmstedt and Rhode 2011). Our data
collection yields 322,998 citations to 61,694 unique patents between 1921 and 2002,
which we use to construct citation-weighted patents to control for patent quality.
         Analyses of citation-weighted patents indicate a large, but substantially smaller
decline in quality-adjusted patents, implying a differential increase in the quality of
patented inventions for pool technologies after the creation of a pool. Subclasses with
one additional pool patent produced 8 percent fewer citation-weighted patents after the
creation of a pool, compared with a 16 percent decline in the main specifications. The


13
   Surveys of research labs indicate that many firms value patents for strategic reasons (Levin et al. 1987;
Cohen, Nelson, and Walsh 2000). In a sample of 95 publicly traded semiconductor firms, firms with large
capital investments increased their propensity to patent between 1979 and 1995 as a strategic response to
the threat of patent litigation and hold-up (Hall and Ziedonis 2001).
14
   Loury’s (1979) model of investment in R&D under uncertainty about the date when a rival will introduce
the technology implies that more firms enter than is socially optimal because they do not take account of
the parallel nature of R&D. A continuous time model of pools (Dequiedt and Versaevel 2012) implies that
the prospect of a pool may induce firms to overinvest in R&D.




                                                                                                          6
analysis, however, also indicates a substantial differential decline in patenting for pool
technologies after the creation of a pool, even controlling for the quality of patents.
         Were these changes limited to patenting or did they reflect a decline in the rate of
innovation? Archival evidence for the movie industry indicates that the creation of a pool
lead to a significant delay in the adoption of a cost-saving method to shoot movies in
color. In the early 1930s, Eastman Kodak and Technicolor pursued independent research
to produce the cost-effective monopack method of shooting movies in color, which was
to replace the expensive three-strip technology that had allowed Technicolor to dominate
the market. After Kodak and Technicolor pooled their patents in 1934, however, efforts
slowed to develop the monopack technology. When consent decrees dissolved the pool
in 1948 and 1950, Eastman Kodak introduced its monopack film Eastmancolor in 1950,
and a broad range of color processes emerged using Eastmancolor film. Fuelled by
substantial cost savings, the share of color movies increased from 19 percent in 1950 to
33 percent in 1952 and 58 percent in 1954.
         What are the mechanisms by which the creation of a patent pool may discourage
innovation? Intuitively, complementarities across pool patents should encourage
innovation, as the creation of a pool resolves blocking patents, mitigates litigation risks
for members, and reduces license fees and transaction costs for outside firms (e.g.,
Shapiro 2001; Lerner and Tirole 2004). The creation of a pool may, however, also
discourage innovation as it reduces competition among members to improve substitute
technologies.15 Regulators are particularly concerned that pools, which combine patents
for substitute technologies “are more likely to harm social welfare and than are pools of
complementary patents” (Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission 2007).
In practice, however, it is extremely difficult to identify pools of substitute patents.16

15
   At low levels of competition, an increase in competition may strengthen firms’ incentives to invent as a
means to avoid neck-and-neck competition (Aghion et al. 2001). Consistent with this prediction, an
analysis of U.K. patents by 311 firms between 1973 and 1994 suggests an inverted-U shape relationship
between competition and innovation (Aghion et al. 2005).
16
   E.g, Lerner, Strojwas, and Tirole (2007, p. 619) exploit the fact that regulators may be more likely to
litigate pools of substitute patents (which allow member firms to avoid Bertrand price competition) to use
the existence of litigation as an indicator for pools of substitute patents, but caution that litigation could be




                                                                                                                    7
         This paper addresses the problem empirically by exploiting the USPTO’s system
of classifying inventions into subclasses according to the function that they perform. If
technologies that perform the same function can act as substitutes for each other,
variation in the number of pool members across subclasses can be used to identify
technologies for which the creation of a pool combines patents for substitutes: In
subclasses with patents by one single member, all pool patents are owned by one firm and
the pool does not combine patents for substitutes. In these subclasses, the pool
technology benefits only from complementarities with other pool technologies, which
may increase incentives to invent after the creation of a pool. By comparison, in
subclasses with two or more firms, the creation of a pool combines patents for substitute
technologies by competing firms. In these subclasses, the pool technology benefits from
complementarities with other pool technologies, but is also affected by a decline in
competition to improve substitutes.
         Comparisons across pool subclasses with one versus more pool members
indicates that the differential decline in patenting is driven almost entirely by pool
subclasses in which the creation of a pool combines patents by competing firms. Results
are robust to controlling for the inclusion of year-industry interactions and for the quality
of patents. This suggests that pools, which form in the absence of effective antitrust,
would discourage innovation by weakening competition.


                                                  I. DATA
         To examine changes in patenting after the creation of a pool, we have collected a
new data set of 75,396 patent applications between 1921 and 1948, covering 10 years
before the first pool formed and 10 years after the last pool formed. These data include
433 pool subclasses and 828 control (cross-reference) subclasses without pool patents in
the same industry. To construct measures for the quality of patented inventions, we have
also collected information on 322,998 citations to these patents after 1921.
       These data extend existing data sets in three important ways. First, they include

triggered by other behaviors of pools, such as price-fixing.




                                                                                             8
application years in addition to grant years to more accurately measure the timing of
invention. The distinction between application and grant years is important because
grants can occur several years after application, depending on the workload of examiners
(e.g., Popp, Juhl, and Johnson 2004; Gans, Stern, and Hsu 2008). We extract application
years between 1921 and 1948 through a key word search, which yields application years
for 97.7 percent of 1,069,414 patents issued between 1921 and 1948.17 The mean lag
between application and grant is 2.5 years with a standard deviation of 1.9 years
(Appendix Figure A1).18
       Our data also include information on cross-reference subclasses (subsection B),
while standard data sets report only primary subclasses.19 The data also include
information on the number of pool members per subclass (subsection C), and extend
existing data to include citations from 1921 to 1975 (subsection D).


A. Pool Patents in 20 Industries, 1930-1938
         To construct the data, we first collected all mentions of patent pools from
Vaughan (1956), Gilbert (2004), and Lerner, Tirole, and Strojwas (2007), and then
searched the records of the National Archives in Chicago, Kansas City, New York, and
Riverside for lists of all patents that were included in these pools. For 13 pools, pool
patents are available from consent decrees at the National Archives; for 5 pools, pool
patents are included in licensing agreements; for 3 pools, patents are listed in written
complaints, and for another 3 pools, patents are included in the final judgments.20

17
   For example, we search the full text of patent grants for the words “iling” (for “Filing”) and “Ser.” (for
“Serial Number”) to recover the year associated with this block of text. In a random sample of 300 patents,
the algorithm correctly records application years for 296 patents.
18
   In comparison, Popp, Juhl, and Johnson (2004) find that the average U.S. patent between 1976 and 1996
was granted 28 months after the application (with a standard deviation of 20 months).
19
   An analysis of 118,350 patents in photography between 1980 and 2002 indicates that cross-reference
subclasses are useful proxy for technology space (Benner and Waldfogel 2008).
20
   For pools in railroad springs, Phillips screws, film, and eyeglasses, patents are listed in more than one
source. In comparison with Lerner, Strojwas, and Tirole (2007), our sample includes 8 additional pools
between 1930 and 1938 and omits 15 pools for which pool patents are not available. We also exclude a
pool for television and radio apparatus because it did not include any U.S. firms, a pool for male hormones
(1937-1941) because it was short-lived, and a “pool” for grinding hobs (1931-1943) because it combined
two patents by the Barber-Colman Company.




                                                                                                           9
         Pools covered a broad range of industries (Table 1) ranging from hydraulic pumps
(1933-52), machine tools (1933-55), Philips screws (1933-49), variable condensers to
select radio stations (1934-53), wrinkle finishes, enamels and paints (1937-55), fuse
cutouts (1938-48), and furniture slip covers (1938-49). Years of pool formation were
spread relatively evenly between 1931 and 1938, with 9 pools before 1934 and 11 pools
between 1934 and 1938. The average pool was active for 16 years and included pool
patents that were 4.2 years old when the pool formed, counting from the year of the
patent application.21


B. Patents per Year in Pool and Cross-reference Subclasses
         The main specifications compare changes in the number of patent applications per
year in 433 pool subclasses with changes in 828 cross-reference subclasses of related
technologies. For example, U.S. patent 1,908,080 (issued May 9, 1933) for a cross-
recessed (Phillips) “screw” belongs to the primary subclass 411/403 for “externally
threaded fastener elements,” which we define as a “pool subclass.”22 U.S. patent
1,908,080 is also assigned to three cross-reference subclasses: 411/919 (“screw having
driving contact”), 470/60 (“apparatus for making externally threaded fastener”), 470/9
(“threaded, headed fastener, or washer making: process-screw”), which form the control
in the main specifications.23 The average pool patent is assigned to 2.0 cross-reference
subclasses.
       Alternative specifications limit the control to cross-reference subclasses within the

21
   Sixteen pools included grant-back provisions, which required pool members to contribute new patents for
related technologies to the pool, and may have exacerbated pool members’ incentives to free ride on R&D
by other members (e.g., Aoki and Nagaoka 2004).
22
   Seven subclasses include patents by more than one pool; for them, we define the year of pool formation
using the earliest pool. One subclass (352/225) is listed as a pool subclass for two pools. Four subclasses
(340/524, 62/056, 524/594, and 174/152R) are pool and cross-reference subclasses; two subclasses
(417/426 and 200/56R) are cross-reference subclasses for two pools. We assign them to the pool that
formed first. For five pools (fuel injection, pharmaceuticals, railroad springs, lecithin, and aircraft
instruments), the pool years include a small number of years after the pool had dissolved. To be
conservative we include these years as pool years.
23
   A class-specific digest subclass (16/DIG.39), which “relates to a class but not to any particular subclass”
(http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/ido/oeip/taf/c_index/explan.htm) is dropped from the sample, along
with 14 other digest classes.




                                                                                                           10
same main class, and expand the control to include all subclasses in the main class (e.g.
class 411 “fasteners”).
        For 38 subclasses, the creation of a pool combined patents by two or more firms.
For example, a pool for wrinkle finishes combined Kay and Ess’ U.S. patent 2,077,112
for “imitation leather paper” with the Chadeloid Chemical Company’s patent 1,689,892
for “wrinkle finishes.” Both patents are assigned to USPTO subclass 427/257, which
covers inventions to produce an “irregular surface…by intentionally employing coating
materials which dry to a wrinkled appearance or which crack on drying to produce a
‘crackled’ finish.”


C. Citations by Patents after 1921 as a Control for Patent Quality
        Citations have emerged as the standard measure for the quality of patents. Unlike
references in academic journals, patent citations are checked by professional examiners
who remove false citations and add relevant citations that inventors may have missed.24
Trajtenberg (1990) shows that citation-weighted patent counts – calculated by adding the
number of citations that a patent receives to the count for each patent (i.e. each patent is
weighted as 1 + the number of citations it receives) – are correlated with the estimated
surplus of improvements in computed tomography (CT) scanners. Hall, Jaffe, and
Trajtenberg (2005) establish a positive correlation between the ratio of citations to a
firm’s patents and that firm’s stock market value. An analysis of field trial data for
patented inventions in hybrid corn reveals that citations are positively correlated with the
size of patented improvements in plants, measured as improvements in yields and other
characteristics of hybrid corn (Moser, Ohmstedt and Rhode 2011).
        To construct the citations data for this study, we searched the full text of patent
grants between January 4, 1921 and December 31, 1974 for mentions of 75,396 unique
patent numbers in our data. Until February 4, 1947, USPTO patent grants recorded
citations anywhere in the text of the patent document; to extract these citations, we search

24
  For U.S. patent grants between January 2001 and December 2002, patent examiners added between 21
and 32 percent of missing citations (Lampe 2012).




                                                                                                     11
the full text of patent grants. After February 4, 1947, the USPTO began to organize
citations in separate sections at the beginning or at the end of patent documents; we
extract citations directly from these sections.25 This search yields a total of 238,874
citations between January 4, 1921 and December 31, 1974, to which we add 84,124
citations between January 7, 1975 and December 31, 2002 from the NBER data set.
         A total of 61,694 patents (82 percent) are cited by at least one patent between
1921 and 2002. Conditional on being cited at least once, the average patent was cited 5.2
times. In comparison, 2,034,737 patents between 1975 and 2002 in the NBER data (77
percent) were cited by at least one other patent in the NBER data; conditional on being
cited, the average patent was cited 7.7 times.26


                                              II. RESULTS
       For pool technologies, patent applications declined after the creation of a pool, both
in absolute terms and relative to alternative definitions of the control. In pool subclasses,
patent applications declined from 2.54 per subclass and year before the creation of a pool
to 2.40 afterwards (Table 2), and from 2.80 to 2.48 within a 10-year window before and
after the creation of a pool (Figure 1). In cross-reference subclasses, patent applications
increased from 2.70 before the creation of a pool to 2.94 afterwards (Table 2), and from
2.94 to 3.02 within a 10-year window (Figure 1). In the broader control group that
includes all subclasses in the same class, patent applications increased from 1.00 per year
before the creation of a pool to 1.11 afterwards (Table 2).


A. Baseline estimates
       Baseline difference-in-differences regressions compare changes in the number of
25
   To evaluate the quality of these data, we examine page scans for 150 randomly chosen patents between
1947 and 1974 on Google Patents (www.google.com/patents). This check indicates that the algorithm
correctly identifies 636 of 741 (86 percent) of citations; 5 of 105 citations that the algorithm missed were
misread numbers (i.e. false positives) as a result of errors in the optical character recognition (OCR).
26
   68.2 percent of 4,524 randomly chosen patents grants in 1930 are cited in patent grants between 1947 and
2008 (Nicholas 2010, p. 63). Linking patents to citations with a long lag may, however, miss many
important citations. For example, Mehta, Rysman, and Simcoe (2010) find that patent citations in the
NBER are highly skewed and peak one year after the original grant.




                                                                                                         12
patent applications per subclass and year in pool subclasses with an additional pool patent
with cross-reference subclasses, controlling for differential time trends for pool
subclasses, as well as subclass and year fixed effects:

(1) Patentsct = α + β1 poolct * pool patentsc
                + β2 t * pool subclassc + β3 t2 * pool subclassc + fc + δt + εct

where pool patentsc counts the number of pool patents in subclass c, and poolct equals 1 if
subclass c includes at least one pool patent and year t is after the creation of a pool.
Under the assumption that changes in patent applications per year would be comparable
in pool and cross-reference subclasses if the pool had not formed, the coefficient for the
difference-in-differences estimator poolct * pool patentsc measures the causal effect of the
creation of a pool. (We will investigate this assumption in the following section.) Year
fixed effects δt and subclass-fixed effects fc, as well as separate linear and quadratic
trends t * pool subclassc and t2 * pool subclassc control for differential changes in
patenting between pool subclasses and the control that are independent of the creation of
a pool. The variable pool subclassc equals 1 if subclass c includes at least one pool
patent.
      Baseline estimates indicate that subclasses with one additional pool patent produced
0.39 fewer patents per year after the creation of a pool (significant at 1 percent, Table 3,
column 2). Compared with a mean of 2.47 patents per year in pool subclasses, this
represents a 15.79 percent decline in patenting after the creation of a pool.
      Regressions with interactions between year and industry dummies to flexibly
control for differential changes in patenting across industries and over time (e.g., as a
result of the industry life cycle) indicate that subclasses with one additional pool patent
produced 0.36 fewer patent applications per year after the creation of a pool (significant
at 1 percent, Table 3, column 3), implying a decline of 14.57 percent.
      Consistent with the low share of pool members in industry-level patents, excluding
all 2,058 patents by pool members leaves the estimates substantially unchanged. Pool
subclasses with an additional pool patent produced -0.36 fewer patents per year after the




                                                                                              13
creation of a pool (significant at 1 percent, Table 3, column 4), equivalent to a 15.45
percent decline.


B. Time varying estimates for the pre- and post pool period
       To test for differential pre-trends, which would violate the identifying assumption
of the baseline regressions, and more generally to investigate the timing of effects, we
estimate the effects of the creation of a pool separately for each year, allowing them to
begin before the creation of a pool:


(2) Patentsct = α + βk * pool patentsc + fc + δt + εct

where pool patentsc is defined as above, and k =-17,-16….17, 18 denotes years before
and after the creation of a pool forms; k=0 is the excluded period.
         Annual coefficients are not statistically significant in any year except t-1, when
estimates imply a 9.31 percent increase in patenting. This is consistent with the idea of a
(potentially wasteful) patent race leading up to the pool (e.g.,Baron and Pohlmann 2011;
Dequiedt and Versaevel 2012). We examine this in more detail in tests that control for
the quality of patents.
         Most importantly, however, estimates imply a decline in patenting that begins
after the creation of a pool and intensifies over time. Annual coefficients range from -
0.17 to -0.30, with an average -0.23 for the first five years, implying a decline of 9.31
percent, and from -0.34 to -0.69, with an average of -0.43 for years six and above,
implying a decline of 17.41 percent (significant at 5 percent in years one, three, four and
all years above five, Figure 2).27


27
   In regressions with industry-year interactions, annual coefficients are not statistically significant before
the creation of a pool. Estimates become statistically significant, with an estimate of -0.32 three years after
the creation of a pool, implying a decline of 12.96 percent, and remain significant through the sample, with
an estimate of -0.40 ten years after the creation of a pool, implying a decline of 16.19 percent (significant at
5 percent, Appendix Figure A2). Sanders’ (1962, p. 71) Patent Use Survey of a random 2 percent sample
of U.S. patents in 1938, 1948 and 1952 suggests that the average patent application occurs 9 months after a
firm has invested in related R&D. By comparison, Hall, Griliches, and Hausman’s (1986) find that patent




                                                                                                             14
B. Controlling for Patent Quality through Citations
         To control for the quality of patented inventions, we repeat the main
specifications using citation-weighted patents (Trajtenberg 1990):


(3) Citation-weighted patentsct = patents by application year 1921-1948ct
+ citations in patent grants 1921-2002 to patent applications 1921-1948ct

Because later patents are more likely to be cited, citation-weighted patents increase for
both pool and cross-reference subclasses over time, but the increase is substantially
smaller for pool subclasses. After the creation of a pool, the average pool subclass
produced 15.12 citation-weighted patents, compared with 9.89 before. By comparison,
the average cross-reference subclass produced 19.40 citation-weighted patents after the
creation of a pool, compared with 11.61 before (Table 2).
       Estimates with citation-weighted patents are large and statistically significant. But
they are also substantially smaller than the main estimates, which is consistent with the
idea that the creation of a pool may lead to a differential increase in the quality of
patented inventions for technologies that are covered by a pool. Subclasses with an
additional pool patent produced 1.03 fewer citation-weighted patents after the creation of
a pool (significant at 1 percent, Table 4, column 2), equivalent to an 8.25 percent
decline.28 Analyses that exclude member patents from the sample indicates that
subclasses with an additional pool patent produced 1.02 fewer citation-weighted patents
(significant at 1 percent, Table 4, column 4), implying an 8.61 percent decline in quality-
adjusted patents, which is slightly above the estimated decline for the full data set.


C. Investigating a Mechanism: Less Competition to Improve Substitutes


applications for 642 U.S. firms between 1972 and 1979 are most highly correlated with contemporaneous
R&D.
28
   Results are robust to alternative tests that remove patents that were not cited, and weight citation counts
by the average number of citations to patents issued in the same year.




                                                                                                             15
        Variation in the number of pool members across pool subclasses allows us to
investigate the mechanism by which the creation of a pool may discourage innovation. In
pool subclasses, which include pool patents by one single member, the pool technology
may benefit from complementarities with other pool technologies, but there is no change
in the intensity of competition, because pool patents were owned by a single firm before
the pool had formed. In pool subclasses, which include pool patents by two or more
members, the pool technology may benefit from complementarities, but it is also subject
to a decline in competition because the pool allows several firms to bundle their patents
for substitute technologies. 38 of 435 pool subclasses include patents by multiple
members.
        Summary statistics indicate that the decline in patenting is driven by subclasses in
which the creation of a pool combined patents by multiple members, with a mean of 4.20
patents per year before the creation of a pool, compared with 2.60 afterwards (Table 2),
and 4.43 within a 10-year window before the creation of a pool, compared with 2.73
patents afterwards (Figure 3). By comparison, subclasses with only one pool member
experienced a much smaller decline from 2.64 to 2.45 patents per year.
      Difference-in-differences analyses estimate interaction terms between the pool
variables (as defined above) and an indicator variable to measure variation across pool
subclasses in the number of member firms

(4) Patentsct = α + β1 poolct * pool patentsc * 1 firmc
                + β2 poolct * pool patentsc * > 1 firmc
                + β3 t * pool subclassc + β4 t2 * pool subclassc + fc + δt + εct


where 1 firmc equals 1 if subclass c includes patents by a single pool member, and > 1
firmc equals 1 if the creation of a pool combines patents by multiple firms.
      Difference-in-differences estimates indicate that each additional pool patent in
subclasses with multiple pool patents is associated with 0.44 fewer patents after the
creation of a pool (significant at 1 percent, Table 5, column 1), implying a 13.02 percent
decline relative to a mean of 3.38. By comparison, each pool patent in subclasses with a




                                                                                          16
single pool member is associated with 0.30 fewer patents, and the effect is not
statistically significant (Table 5, column 1).
       Citation-weighted counts confirm the differential decline for subclasses with
multiple member firms. Subclasses with pool patents by more than one member
produced 1.37 fewer citation-weighted patents after the creation of a pool (significant at 1
percent, Table 5, column 3), implying a decline of 9.15 percent relative to a mean of
14.98 patents per year. By comparison, subclasses with a single member produced only
0.49 fewer citation-weighted patents, and the effect is not statistically significant.


D. Robustness checks
         Robustness checks estimate the main specifications with alternative definitions of
the control, as Poisson regressions, and exclude pools that formed after 1935, as well as
any individual pool.
         The first test restricts the control group to 631 cross-reference classes in the same
108 main classes that include at least one of 433 pool subclasses; the restricted sample
includes 62,898 patents. Compared with cross-reference subclasses in the same main
class, pool subclasses with an additional pool patent produced 0.39 fewer patents per year
after the creation of a pool, implying a 15.79 percent decline, and 1.08 fewer citation-
weighted patents, implying a 8.65 percent decline (significant at 1 percent, Table 6,
columns 1 and 2).
         An alternative specification expands the control to include all 69,316 subclasses
without pool patents in 108 (main) classes with at least one pool subclass and in 61
classes with at least one cross-reference subclasses; this expands the sample to 807,326
patents.29 Estimates suggest that pool subclasses with an additional pool patent produced
0.41 fewer patents per year after the creation of a pool, implying a decline of 16.60




29
  In this test, 285 subclasses that did not produce any patents between 1921 and 1948 are dropped. In the
main specifications, these subclasses are excluded by construction, because only subclasses that at least one
patent lists as a primary or a cross-reference subclass are included in the sample.




                                                                                                          17
percent, and 0.89 fewer citation-weighed patents per year, implying a 7.13 percent
decline (significant at 1 percent, Table 6, columns 3 and 4).
        We also repeat the main specifications as conditional fixed-effects Poisson
regressions to control for the count data characteristics of patents, allowing for
correlation over time.30 Poisson estimates imply that subclasses with one additional pool
patent produced 8.42 percent fewer patents and 7.22 percent fewer citation-weighted
patents after the creation of a pool (significant at 1 percent, Table 6, columns 5 and 6).31
        An additional robustness check excludes two subclasses for aircraft instruments
and stamped metal wheels, with 12 and 10 pool patents, respectively.32 Estimates with
the restricted sample indicate that subclasses with an additional pool patents produced
0.30 fewer patents per year after the creation of a pool, implying a 12.30 percent decline,
and 0.99 fewer citation-weighted patents, implying a 7.99 percent decline (significant at 1
percent, Table 7, columns 1 and 2).
        Estimated effects are also robust to restricting the sample to pools that formed
before May 27, 1935, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that price and wage-fixing in
the poultry industry, which had been sanctioned under the NIRA, were unconstitutional.33
Regressions with the restricted sample indicate that pool subclasses with an additional
pool patent produced 0.40 fewer patents per year after the creation of a pool, implying a
15.67 percent decline, and 0.92 fewer citation-weighted patents, implying a 6.96 percent
decline (significant at 1 percent, Table 7, columns 3 and 4). These results are consistent
with historical analyses, which suggest that regulators continued to tolerate collusion and
price fixing in many industries until the late 1930s (Hawley 1966, p. 418). “By

30
   The Poisson model is robust to misspecifications of the distribution and to a disproportionate share of
zeros in the dependent variable. Wooldridge (1999) develops a quasi-maximum-likelihood estimator for
the fixed effects Poisson model that is also robust to correlation over time; Rysman and Simcoe (2008)
implement the estimator.
31
  Percentage changes are calculated as exp(-0.088)-1=-0.08 and exp(-0.075)-1=-0.07.
32
   USPTO subclass 261/41.5 for gas and liquid contact aircraft instruments produced 21.7 patents per year
before the creation of a pool and 8.4 afterwards. USPTO subclass 301/35.59 produced 3.8 patents per year
between 1927 and 1936, and no patents after a pool had formed in 1937.

                                                                                                        18

policy’ of cartelization under the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) — an
estimated 47.4 percent by value of all agricultural products and 86.9 percent of all
minerals produced are estimated to have been subject to cartel restrictions” (Haley 2001,
p. 8).
         A final robustness check estimates 20 separate regressions, excluding one of the
20 industries in each regression, to check whether the decline in patenting may be driven
by a single industry. Most importantly, the pool for color cinematography, which
included 143 pool patents, accounts for 263 of 1,261 (20.86 percent) subclasses in the
data. Results are robust to excluding this pool, with a coefficient of -0.42 for pool*pool
patents (significant at 1 percent, Table 8). Below we investigate alternative (non-patent)
measures of innovation for this pool.
         Estimates remain large and statistically significant when excluding any remaining
industry. Excluding aircraft instruments has the largest effect; estimates remain at -0.31
(significant at 1 percent, Table 8), implying a 13.84 percent decline, compared with an
average of 2.24. A government complaint of 1942 suggests that this pool was
particularly aggressive in curtailing competition. For example, a January 31, 1935
pooling agreement between Bendix and four European firms stipulated that Bendix
would not sell carburetors in Europe; in return, European firms would not sell carburetors
in the United States and Canada.34 By 1940, such agreements included 17 foreign
producers.
         Excluding a pool for variable condensers has the second largest effect, but
coefficients remain large at -0.34, implying a 13.71 percent decline (significant at 5
percent, Table 8), compared with an average of 2.48. This pool combined patents by the
General Instrument Corporation, the Radio Condenser Company, and the Dejur-Amsco
Corporation, which jointly produced more than 75 percent of variable condensers for
American radios. Their agreement combined eight patents by two firms each in two

E. A Pool Delays the Adoption of Color Film
        Archival records for the movie industry – which accounts for the largest number
of patents in our sample – suggest that the creation of a pool delayed technical progress
and the transition from black-and-white to color film. In the early 1930s, Technicolor
had dominated the market for professional color cinematography with a method that
simultaneously ran three separate strips of film, which covered different parts of the color
spectrum, through a specialized camera. Technicolor’s three-strip process produced an
exceptionally vivid color scheme but was expensive to rent, with Technicolor in complete
control of the market.
        At the time, Technicolor and its competitor Kodak pursued parallel and
independent research to develop an alternative method to produce color film, which ran a
single strip of celluloid on regular black-and-white cameras.36 Less cumbersome and
costly than the three-strip process, the “monopack” technology threatened Technicolor’s
monopoly.
        On June 25, 1934, Technicolor and Eastman Kodak agreed to pool their patents.
In 1941, Technicolor introduced a monopack film, which, however, was too grainy for
studio work, and was only used for outdoor shots that the company’s bulky 3-strip
cameras could not reach (Haines 1993, p. 28; Basten 2005, p. 127). On December 14,
1945, Technicolor and Eastman Kodak amended their agreement to remove a covenant
that Kodak “refrain from engaging in the commercial processing of wide ‘monopack’
film.” A government complaint in 1947, however, observed that Kodak “continued to
refrain from the commercial processing of wide ‘monopack’ film, from licensing others

to engage in such processing, and, with minor exceptions, from selling such film with the
right to process to customers other than Technicolor…the development of the art of
professional color cinematography by others than Technicolor has been retarded, to the
detriment of the general public, the motion picture industry, and the film manufacturing
industry.37
         Data on patent applications confirm a decline in the speed of innovation in film-
making. An estimate of -0.14 for the baseline specification (significant at 5 percent,
Table 7, column 5) implies an 8.43 percent decline compared with a mean of 1.66 patents
per pool subclass in the film industry. Regressions that control for the quality of patented
inventions yield an estimate of -0.99 (with a p-value of 5.6, Table 7 column 6), implying
a 10.86 percent decline compared with a mean of 9.12.
         To investigate the shift from black-and-white to color movies, we collect data on
the color scheme of 1,900 feature-length movies from the catalogues of the American
Film Institute (AFI) between 1930 and 1960.38 These data indicate that, for as long as the
pool was active, the majority of movies continued to be filmed in black-and-white
(Figure 4). Exceptional movies that were shot in color – such as "Gone with the Wind"
and "The Wizard of Oz" (both 1939) – were produced at high costs because they
continued to depend on Technicolor’s cumbersome and expensive three-strip method.
         Rates of innovation recovered after the Department of Justice filed a complaint
against Technicolor and Eastman Kodak on August 18, 1947. In 1948 alone, Eastman
Kodak invested more than $3 million in R&D to improve its offerings of color film. By
comparison, the company had spent a total of $15 million to improve color film between
1921 and 1948 (Frost and Oppenheim 1960, p. 124).
         On November 24, 1948, a consent decree made Kodak’s patents available for
compulsory licensing to outside firms. A second consent decree on February 28, 1950

required Technicolor to license its patents to outside firms and terminate arrangements
that forced producers to use Technicolor’s three-strip cameras.
         In the same year, Eastman Kodak introduced Eastmancolor, a monopack film that
was fine-grained enough for commercial filmmakers.39 In December 1951, Canada’s
National Film Board released its documentary “Royal Journey,” the first professional-
quality film in Eastmancolor. In 1952, Kodak introduced an improved monopack
technology with higher emulsion speed and better grain structure that allowed its
technology to meet the standards of the major Hollywood studios.40 Based on
Eastmancolor film a spade of new color processes emerged in the 1950s (Basten 2005, p.
128).
         Buoyed by substantial costs savings, the number of U.S. color movies increased
from 122 in 1952 to 174 in 1954 (Figure 4). As a share of all U.S. movies, color films
increased from 2 percent in the 1930s to 33 percent in 1952 and 58 percent in 1954.
Universal Pictures’ “Foxfire,” released in 1955, was the last live-action American film
that used the three-strip method (Basten 2005, p. 129).


                                           III. CONCLUSIONS
         Patent pools have emerged as a prominent policy tool to mitigate threats of
crippling litigation and ensure the production of new technologies for which competing
firms own overlapping patents. Regulators, however, caution that pools, which form in
the absence of effective antitrust, may harm competition and discourage innovation (e.g.,
Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission 2007).

   Haines (1993, p. 28) describes the monopack technology: “The Monopack stock contained silver halides
which were exposed through thin layers of filters during principal photography. The filters allowed light to
pass through each layer to generate black and white latent image of the red, green and blue records. During
development, the film went through three bleaches that contained ‘dye couplers.’ Dye couplers were tiny
color globules, which replicated the latent silver image of each record. After the dyes were “coupled” with
the latent image of each layer, the silver was washed away. The end result was a three color positive image
with each hue represented by a think layer of dye couplers.” The principle of colored dye couplers (U.S.
patents 2,428,054 and 2,449,054) was made operational in Eastmancolor (Frost and Oppenheim 1960, p.
115-116).

       This paper has taken advantage of a unique window of regulatory tolerance under
the New Deal, which effectively suspended antitrust, to investigate how pools that would
form in the absence of effective antitrust might affect innovation. Baseline difference-in-
differences regressions indicate that the creation of a pool caused a 16 percent decline in
patent applications. Results are robust to alternative definitions of the control group,
various controls for differential changes in patenting across technologies and at the
industry level, Poisson regressions, and to dropping individual pools, subclasses, pool
member patents, or groups of pools from the sample.
       Archival evidence for the movie industry indicates that the creation of a pool for
the monopack technology served to protect its costly and cumbersome predecessor, the
three-strip technology, for which one of the pool members was a monopolist. Innovation
slowed during the pool and only increased again after the pool had dissolved, delaying
the switch from black-and-white to color film.
       Analyses, which use citations by later patents to control for the quality of patents,
confirm the differential decline in patenting for pool technologies. Estimates with
citation-weighted patents are, however, noticeably smaller, indicating that firms produced
fewer low quality or strategic patents in pool technologies after the creation of a pool.
This decline may be due to a welfare-improving reduction in duplicative research efforts
as a result of the pool (e.g., Kamien, Muller, and Zang 1992), or it may reflect a socially
wasteful race to patent technologies before the creation of a pool (e.g., Baron and
Pohlmann 2011; Dequiedt and Versaevel 2012). A temporary spike in patent
applications immediately before the creation of the pool is consistent with the idea of a
patent race.
       What are the mechanisms by which the creation of a pool may discourage
innovation? Regulators are concerned that pools, which combine patents for substitute
technologies, may harm competition and discourage innovation. It has, however, proven
exceedingly difficult to identify pools that combine substitutes. This paper has used a
simple test, which exploits the USPTO classification system to identify substitutes at the
level of technologies, rather than industries. Patent examiners classify inventions into




                                                                                            23
subclasses based on the function that they perform, so that, by definition, patents in the
same subclass are more likely to act as substitutes for each other. For subclasses in
which a single pool member owns all pool patents before the creation of a pool, the pool
has no direct effect on competition. By comparison, for subclasses in which two or more
pool members patent before the creation of a pool, the pool reduces competition by
combining patents for substitute technologies.
       Difference-in-differences comparisons reveal that the observed decline in
patenting was driven almost exclusively by subclasses in which a pool combined patents
by two or more member firms. This result lends empirical support to theoretical
predictions that pools, which combine patents for substitute technologies are likely to
harm competition and discourage innovation.

Notes: Pool subclasses include at least one pool patent that lists this subclass as the primary
subclass. Cross-reference subclasses are subclasses without pool patents that patent
examiners have identified as related technologies. All other subclasses in the same class are
subclasses in the same main class as a pool or cross-reference subclass. Citation-weighted
patents are constructed as 1+ # of citations by later patents (Trajtenberg 1990). We collect
citations by searching the full text of patent grants 1921-1974 for all patent numbers in our
data, adding citations from patent grants 1975-2002 from (Jaffe, Hall, Trajtenberg 2001).

Notes: The dependent variable counts patents per subclass and year. The timing of
invention is measured by the application year for granted patents. The variable pool
equals 1 after a pool forms. Pool patents counts patents that were included in the initial
pooling agreement and list subclass c as their primary subclass. 433 pool subclasses
include one or more pool patents; 828 cross-reference subclasses, which patent examiners
have identified as related technologies, form the control.

Notes: Kodak and Technicolor pooled their patents for the monopack method on June 25,
1934. Consent decrees made pool patents available in 1948 and 1950. Eastman
introduced Eastmancolor, the first monopack film suitable for studio work, in 1952. Data
cover 1,900 U.S. movies from the American Film Institute (www.afi.com, accessed on
July 9, 2011). Data on Technicolor films from Haines (2003).

Notes: Patents per year of application and grant for granted U.S. patents. We collected
data on filing years through a key word search of the full text of patent grants between
1920 and 1975, available at www.google.com/patents. This graph reveals truncation bias
for patent applications before 1921; to avoid truncation bias, the empirical tests use data
on applications between 1921 and 1948. The average lag between applications and
grants is 2.5 years with a standard deviation of 1.9.

Notes: t =0 denotes the year when a pool forms; the timing of invention is measured at
the year of the patent application. Estimates for βk in the regression Patentscit = α + βk *
Pool Patentsc + fc + ic*δt where k =-17, ….17, 18, counts years before and after a pool
forms, and ic*δt represents interactions between industry and year fixed effects. The
variable Pool Patentsc counts patents that were included in the initial pooling agreement
and that list subclass c as their primary subclass.
