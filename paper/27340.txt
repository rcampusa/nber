                                         ABSTRACT

This note develops a framework for thinking about the following question: What is the maximum
amount of consumption that a utilitarian welfare function would be willing to trade off to avoid
the deaths associated with the pandemic? The answer depends crucially on the mortality rate
associated with the coronavirus. If the mortality rate averages 0.81%, taken from the Imperial
College London study, our answer is 41% of one year's consumption. If the mortality rate instead
averages 0.44% across age groups, our answer is 28%.

              This note develops a framework for thinking about the following question: What
           is the maximum amount of consumption that a utilitarian welfare function would
           be willing to trade off to avoid the deaths associated with the pandemic? The an-
           swer depends crucially on the mortality rate associated with the coronavirus. If the
           mortality rate averages 0.81%, taken from the Imperial College London study, our
           answer is 41% of one year’s consumption. If the mortality rate instead averages
           0.44% across age groups, our answer is 28%.



1.        Introduction

Economies throughout the world are faced with a terrible question: how should we
trade off large declines in consumption and GDP versus deaths from the pandemic
caused by the coronavirus? As is well appreciated in economics, individuals make life-
and-death decisions every day when deciding what job to take or whether to drive
across town. We apply the basic framework used to evaluate these kinds of individ-
ual decisions to a utilitarian social welfare function to help us think about trading off
consumption of survivors versus deaths from the pandemic.2
         To see our basic result, suppose that, absent any actions, the pandemic would lead
to an increased mortality at the rate δ among the population, and that people have
an average remaining life expectancy of LE years. Let v denote the value of a year of
life measured in years of per capita consumption. The basic result of our calculation

     Classic references include Schelling (1968) and Usher (1973). Arthur (1981), Shepard and Zeckhauser
(1984), and Murphy and Topel, eds (2003) estimate the willingness to pay to reduce mortality risk and cal-
culate the value of life. Nordhaus (2003) and Becker, Philipson and Soares (2005) conclude that increases
in longevity have been roughly as important to welfare as increases in non-health consumption, both for
the United States and for the world as a whole. Hall and Jones (2007) use a related framework to study
the rise in health spending as a share of GDP. Jones and Klenow (2016) construct consumption-equivalent
welfare measures across countries and over time for combining consumption, life expectancy, leisure, and
inequality. Adler, Ferranna, Hammitt and Treich (2019) advocate a social welfare approach to these types
of questions.

is that, to avoid this risk, society would be willing to give up a fraction of one year’s
consumption given by


                                          α ≈ δ · v · LE.                                        (1)


The right hand side of (1) is the value of the lost life-years relative to annual consump-
tion. The intuition for this result is straightforward. The “value of a year of life” v is
the price of life in units of annual consumption: each year of life lost is equivalent to v
years of consumption. The fraction of consumption society is willing to forego is sim-
ply this price multiplied by the expected quantity (per capita) of life years lost due to
the pandemic.
        To illustrate quantitatively, suppose that δ = 0.81% (consistent with the early esti-
mates from the Imperial College London study); suppose v = 6 so that a year of life
is worth 6 times annual consumption (based on EPA value of life numbers); and sup-
pose LE for victims is 14.5 years (again based on the Imperial College London study).
According to the formula, this would make society willing to give up 70.5% of consump-
tion for a full year to avoid the elevated mortality associated with the pandemic.
        We think this figure is too high for two reasons. First, since the Imperial College Lon-
don study, some estimates of the mortality rate from the pandemic have been lower. A
defensible lower estimate might be 0.44% for δ based on a seroprevalence study in In-
diana.3 For the same v and LE, our estimate of the equivalent consumption loss is 38%
with this lower mortality rate rather than 70.5%.
        Second, the approximation in (1) involves linearizing the utility function. Taking
into account curvature will naturally make society less willing to cut consumption. The
more consumption is reduced, the higher the marginal pain of reducing it further. With
the original v, LE and δ, taking into account diminishing marginal utility lowers the
equivalent consumption loss from 70.5% to 41.3%. If we also take into account a lower
death rate we arrive at a willingness to curtail consumption by 28% (down from 38%)
for one year to avoid coronavirus-related deaths.

2.     Model


Suppose lifetime utility for a person of age a is

                                       ∞
                                       X
                                Va =         β t S̄a,t u(ct ) = u(c0 ) + βSa+1 Va+1                       (2)
                                       t=0


where Sa+1 is the probability a person age a survives to a + 1 and S̄a,t = Sa+1 · Sa+2 · . . . ·
Sa+t is the probability a person age a survives for the next t years; 0 < β < 1 is the pure
time discount factor; and u(c) is flow (current year) utility from consumption c.
  Suppose the population initially contains Na people of age a and a total population
    P
N =   a Na . And suppose that the pandemic means that the survival rate for each
group falls from Sa+1 to Sa+1 − δa+1 for one year. Our question is: what fraction α of
consumption in the initial year is everyone willing to give up to avoid this risk?
     Let λ ≡ 1 − α and, to simplify, let’s assume that consumption is the same for all
individuals. Motivated by (2), consider the following variations on lifetime utility:


                               Va (λ, δ) = u(λc) + β(Sa+1 − δa+1 )Va+1 (1, 0)


where Va (λ, δ) is the lifetime utility of a person age a whose consumption is reduced by
factor λ in the current year and whose mortality rate increases by δa+1 for the year. After
the year is over their consumption and mortality revert back (λ = 1, δ = 0).
     Let W (λ, δ) denote utilitarian social welfare across all ages and δ the vector of death
rates from the pandemic:

                       X                                        X
          W (λ, δ) =            Na Va (λ, δ) = N u(λc) + β            (Sa+1 − δa+1 )Na Va+1 (1, 0).
                           a                                      a


     The equivalent variation we have in mind satisfies W (λ, 0) = W (1, δ):

                     X                                                X
       N u(λc) + β         Sa+1 Na Va+1 (1, 0) = N u(c) + β                (Sa+1 − δa+1 )Na Va+1 (1, 0)
                       a                                               a
                                                          X
                               ⇒ u(c) − u(λc) = β              δa+1 ωa Va+1 (1, 0)                        (3)
                                                           a


where ωa ≡ Na /N is the initial population share of group a.
4


    Now, take a Taylor expansion around λ = 1 to see that


                                 u(λc) ≈ u(c) + u0 (c)c(λ − 1).


Plugging this into (3) gives

                                                  X
                                α≡1−λ≈β                   δa+1 ωa Vea+1                       (4)
                                                      a


where Vea+1 ≡ Va+1 (1, 0)/[u0 (c)c] is the value of life at age a + 1 relative to the flow of con-
sumption c. The division by the marginal utility of consumption, u0 (c), converts utils
into consumption units. Note that α ≡ 1 − λ, so that α is the fraction of consumption
you give up (a number like 20%).
    Expression (4) has a nice intuition: the fraction of consumption that society is will-
ing to give up is the sum of the expected number of deaths from the pandemic δa ωa at
each age, weighted by the value of life at those ages as a share of consumption.
    One more simplification is useful. When β = 1 so there is no time discounting apart
from mortality, equation (2) implies

                                                ∞
                                                X
                             Va (1, 0) = u(c)         S̄a,t = u(c) · LEa
                                                t=0


where the last expression comes from the well-known result in demography that the
sum of survival probabilities is the (cross-sectional) measure of life expectancy. That
is, lifetime expected utility is the product of flow utility and life expectancy. Under this
assumption,
                                            u(c)
                                    Vea+1 = 0     · LEa+1
                                           u (c)c
Letting v ≡ u(c)/[u0 (c)c] denote the value of a year of life relative to consumption (e.g. a
number like 6) and substituting into equation (4), we have, when β = 1,

                                         X
                                    α≈        ωa v δa+1 LEa+1                                 (5)
                                          a


    There are two examples of this formula that are helpful for intuition. First, suppose
there is only a single representative agent in the economy. In this case, the equivalent
                                                                                                 5


variation describes how the consumer herself trades off her own mortality and her own
consumption and gives the simple formula


                                         α ≈ δ · v · LE                                        (6)


This formula is the source of equation (1) given in the Introduction.
     Alternatively, suppose there are two groups: the old, who face mortality risk from
the pandemic, and the young, who do not face any risk at all. Moreover, suppose the
old are the fraction 1/N of the population. In this case, a utilitarian planner would be
willing to reduce everyone’s consumption to avoid the extra mortality by

                                              δ · v · LEo
                                         α≈                                                    (7)
                                                   N

     In all three cases, the intuition is the same. The “exchange rate” between consump-
tion and a year of life is v ≡ u(c)/[u0 (c)c]. This is the price of life in the equation, and it is
multiplied by the quantity of life years lost in order to arrive at the equivalent variation
by α% in everyone’s consumption.


3.     Calibration

3.1.    A Representative Agent Calibration

To get started, we first consider a calibration in which there is only a single agent in the
economy, rather than two or more groups. In terms of the model just described, we set
N = 1 so that everyone is effectively in the “old” group that faces the pandemic mor-
tality risk and everyone chooses to give up some fraction of one-year’s consumption to
avoid that risk.
     According to the Imperial College London study by Ferguson et al. (2020), the ele-
vated death rate for all ages would be 0.81% without mitigation efforts. This is the prod-
uct of their age-specific mortality rates (which aggregate to 1.1% for the age-weighted
entire population) and the assumption that 75% of all age groups contract the virus in
the absence of mitigation. Early estimates of the infection fatality rate (IFR) may end
up being too high. As random testing of the type advocated by Stock (2020) continues
6


to come in, some of the estimates are in line with the Imperial College London IFR of
1.1% and other estimates are lower.4
    Estimates of the value of a year of life used in the literature typically range from
$100,000 to $400,000.5 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (2020) recommends
$7.4 million for the value of remaining life in 2006 dollars for those age 25 to 55. Given
life expectancy at age forty of just about 40 years in 2006, this implies a value of each
year of remaining life equal to around $7.4m/40=$185,000. With consumption per per-
son in the U.S. of $31,000 in 2006, this implies that a year of life is worth 6 times annual
consumption. We therefore take v = 6 as our benchmark value. In terms of current
consumption per person of $45,000 per year, this implies a VSLY (Value of a Statistical
Life Year) of $270,000 and a VSL of $10.8 million.
    Based on the Imperial College London death rates by age combined with the U.S.
population distribution by age and life expectancy by age, we estimate the average life
remaining of victims to be 14.5 years.6 The age distribution of U.S. deaths from the pan-
demic so far have implied an average life expectancy of victims of 14.1 years.7 A recent
study by Hanlon et al. (2020) emphasizes that those dying from coronavirus compli-
cations often suffer from comorbidities that would have lowered their life expectancy.
They find relatively small effects, however: using the Hanlon et al. estimates reduces
the remaining life years of victims to 13 years instead of 14.1.
    Taking the product of the parameters in the linearized equation (6) with the base-
line death rate of 0.81% yields α = 0.705. With the lower death rate of 0.44%, we get
α = 0.384. Thus a representative agent would be willing to sacrifice 70% of a year’s con-
sumption with the high death rate and 38% of consumption with the low death rate to
avoid deaths from the pandemic. As we will see, assuming the marginal utility of con-
sumption is constant in this Taylor approximation leads these numbers to overstate the
exact calculation.

     As mentioned above, the IFR in Indiana was estimated at 0.58%.               In New York City a
seroprevalence study implied a IFR of 0.85%, according to Wilson (2020).             And in Spain the
IFR implied by a serology study was 1.1%.           See https://english.elpais.com/society/2020-05-14/

3.2.   Calibrating the Full Model

Here we use formula (5) with all age groups. More specifically, we use population shares
by age from the U.S. Census source mentioned above, age-specific mortality rates in
the Imperial College London study, and remaining years of life expectancy by age from
the Social Security Administration data referenced above. Figure 1 displays the mor-
tality rates, which rise sharply with age. Interestingly, they rise at a fairly stable 11%
rate with age. Goldstein and Lee (2020), using data from several countries, report this
same slope for how mortality changes with age. Figure 2 plots expected years of life re-
maining, which naturally fall with age. With these two ingredients, we incorporate that
those at greatest risk of dying from the pandemic are those with the fewest years of life
remaining. This means fewer life years are at stake than if the virus struck down all ages
with the same probability, or if the virus was particularly lethal for younger people (as
was the case with the Spanish flu).
   Table 1 provides our estimates using all ages. The first panel is based on the simple
formulas that linearize the utility function, equations (4) and (5) above. With v = 6
and δ = 0.81%, we calculate α = 0.705, or 70%. When using the lower δ = 0.44%,
we obtain 38%. Due to the linearity of (4), these numbers turn out to be the same as
we calculated for the representative agent. The second panel in Table 1 shows exact
results using CRRA utility with γ = 2 rather than the linear approximation. When we
incorporate diminishing marginal utility, society would be willing to sacrifice notably
less, namely 41% of one year’s consumption when δ = 0.81% and 28% when δ = 0.44%.
The Table provides estimates for higher and lower values of v, as well, as there is of
course uncertainty about the value of a year of life. As one would expect, the higher the
value of life the bigger the sacrifice society should be willing to make to save life years.
   Figure 3 breaks down the contribution to α from each age group in the linearized
case. It is not obvious a priori what this graph would look like. Mortality rates are low
for younger people, but years of life remaining are high. The low mortality rate turns
out to dominate at low ages, while the low remaining life expectancy dominates at high
ages. The largest contributions come from the groups aged 60 to 74, where mortality
and years of life remaining are both moderately high. With our more exact formula in-
corporating diminishing marginal utility, there is greater reason to sacrifice consump-
tion to avoid mortality at young ages.

itarian planner would give up for one year in order to avoid the deaths from
the pandemic in that year. The first panel reports the results using equation (5)
with age-specific death rates using the Taylor approximation for u(c). The sec-
ond panel is exact but requires us to specify a utility function. We assume
u(c) = ū + c1−γ /(1 − γ). The formula, going back to equation (3), then becomes

αfull = 1 − λfull .

                           Under 75                         34.3%
                           Under All                        41.3%

  Note: Each entry is the equivalent % drop in consumption for all individuals equivalent to the
  deaths for the age group given. Under 65, for example, is all deaths for those under age 65. The cal-
  culations are based on age-specific death rates consistent with an unconditional aggregate death
  rate of δ = 0.81%. The estimates use CRRA utility with γ = 2.




   We can also express the loss of consumption (for individuals of all ages) equivalent
to the mortality from the pandemic for individuals under 20, under 30, and so on. Ta-
ble 2 reports our estimates using the exact formula with CRRA utility. Even though the
median age of victims is around 75, saving the lives of victims below 75 comprises 34 of
the 41 percentage point total. And 23 of the 41 percentage point total stem from saving
the lives of victims under 65. This is relevant for assessing strategies, such as Sweden’s,
for isolating the elderly population most at risk from the coronavirus. Acemoglu, Cher-
nozhukov, Werning and Whinston (2020) provide a normative analysis in this vein.


3.3.   Comparison to other estimates

If we apply our estimate of 41% of consumption to $14.7 trillion in consumption at an
annual rate in the fourth quarter of 2019, we get $6.1 trillion. Greenstone and Nigam
(2020) arrive at a number of $7.9 trillion. They used a lower mortality rate than our
0.81%, so deaths in their calculations were 1.7 million vs. our 2.7 million. Based on age-
12


specific values from Murphy and Topel (2006), they assume a VSLY of $315,000 per life
year lost vs. our $270,000. The biggest difference, however, is our use of diminishing
marginal utility, which accounts for more than the entire difference in our estimates.
     Zingales (2020) came up with a much larger estimate of $65 trillion for the value of
lost lives. He assumed many more deaths (7.2 million vs. our 2.7 million) and many
more years of life remaining for victims (50 years vs. our 14.5 years). Like Greenstone
and Nigam, his estimate does not incorporate diminishing marginal utility.
     Thunström, Newbold, Finnoff, Ashworth and Shogren (2020) use the entire EPA
value of life for victims, adjusted upward for inflation, or $10 million. This is tanta-
mount to assuming 40 years of remaining life per victim. They multiply this by an es-
timate of 1.24 million lives saved by social distancing to arrive at an aggregate value of
$12.4 trillion. We arrive at a much lower number of $6.1 trillion due a lower number of
years remaining per victim and diminishing marginal utility.


3.4.    Additional factors one could try to incorporate

Our simple framework neglects many complicating factors. Here is a partial list:
     GDP and consumption are of course distinct. One could imagine slashing con-
sumption and leaving investment unchanged as we have implicitly done. Then the
drop in GDP and consumption would be equal. But it might be optimal to cut invest-
ment and spread the loss of consumption over time. This would presumably lead to
intermediate number between our linearized and exact calculations.
     Another issue is how consumption, earnings and leisure vary by age. Victims from
the pandemic are predominantly elderly. Their earnings are low, and their nonlabor in-
come stems in part from capital income that would be bequeathed to survivors. On the
other hand their leisure is high. Murphy and Topel (2006) take these complications into
account when they estimate the value of life years by age. Despite the fall in earnings
at later ages, Murphy and Topel assign a high value to later life years. This would not
change our estimates by a large amount.
     A complete accounting would incorporate the impact of avoiding coronavirus-related
deaths on mortality from other sources. It is not clear which way this would go on net.
Social distancing may reduce deaths from traffic accidents and (eventually) air pollu-
tion. But it also may lead to delayed preventive care and worsened mental health.
                                                                                          13


   For every person who dies from coronavirus complications many more are hospi-
talized. The short and long run impact on quality-adjusted life years for survivors is un-
clear. Even if, say, one half of those infected are asymptomatic, there would be 49 peo-
ple with symptoms of varying severity for every person who dies from the pandemic.
Thus the morbidity costs could conceivably be of the same order of magnitude as the
mortality costs.
   Social distancing might other costs. The quality of leisure time may be adversely
affected. Keeping children home from school may lower human capital investment if
online instruction is not of similar quality. This may also increase in the inequality of
such investments across children.
   Early evidence suggests that lower earners have been hit harder by social distancing
in the U.S. Cajner et al. (2020) is one such study. Following Jones and Klenow (2016),
one could quantify the loss in welfare from rising consumption inequality. In the CRRA
case, if consumption is distributed lognormally across individuals with variance σ 2 ,
then a one percentage point increase in the variance of consumption is equivalent to
a γ/2 percentage point reduction in consumption for everyone. When γ = 2, each
percentage point increase in the variance of log consumption would be equivalent to
reducing aggregate consumption by 1%. Thus, if mitigation efforts raise consumption
inequality, this will cut into how much one would be willing to sacrifice average con-
sumption to avoid coronavirus-related mortality.
   Mortality from the pandemic has differed not only by age but also by education and
race. See Gross et al. (2020) for evidence of substantially higher mortality rate for blacks
and Latinx relative to whites. Optimal mitigation efforts would take into account not
only consumption inequality but also inequality of mortality and morbidity.
