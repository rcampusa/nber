I. Introduction

           Does saving in 401(k) and similar tax-deferred retirement accounts really lower

your lifetime taxes? If average and marginal tax rates were independent of income and

didn‚Äôt change through time, the answer would be an unambiguous yes. But tax rates may

be higher when withdrawals occur, either because one moves into a higher tax bracket or

because the government raises tax rates. In addition, reducing tax brackets when young,

at the price of higher tax brackets when old, may reduce the value of mortgage

deductions, since these are primarily taken when young. Finally and very importantly,

shifting taxable income from youth to old age can substantially increase the share of

Social Security benefits subject to income taxation.

           These concerns about 401(k) participation raising taxes are, with one exception,

inapplicable to those with high incomes. Such households are in high tax brackets and

face the maximum degree of taxation of their Social Security benefits regardless of the

extent of their tax-deferred saving. The one exception is the possibility that tax rates will

be raised at the time these and other households withdraw their tax-favored savings.

           This paper studies the impact on lifetime taxes of participating in a 401(k) plan. It

does so using Economic Security Planner (ESPlanner) ‚Äì a life-cycle personal financial

planning program that makes highly detailed federal income tax, state income tax, and

Social Security benefit calculations.1 The paper considers stylized young couples who,

together with their employers, contribute the maximum amounts stipulated by typical

401(k) plans. We measure the benefit from 401(k) participation in two ways ‚Äì in terms

of the percentage reduction in lifetime taxes and in terms of the percentage increase in

lifetime spending financed by the tax break.2 We find that low- and middle-income

households (those earning up to $50,000 per year) who earn a real pre-tax return of 6

percent or more subject themselves to higher lifetime taxes by fully participating in the

typical 401(k) plan.

        In the case of a young couple with $50,000 in initial annual earnings that earns a 6

percent real return, partaking fully in the typical 401(k) plan raises lifetime tax payments

by 1.1 percent and lowers lifetime expenditures by 0.4 percent. The lifetime tax hike is

6.4 percent and the lifetime spending reduction is 1.7 percent for such households if they

receive an 8 percent real rate of return. These figures rise to 7.3 percent and 2.3 percent,

respectively, if taxes are increased by 20 percent when the couple retires.

        These findings are driven, in large part, by the additional Social Security benefit

taxation induced by 401(k) withdrawals. For example, absent Social Security benefit

taxation the $50,000 couple earning a 6 percent real return would lower their lifetime

taxes by 2.2 percent and raise their lifetime spending by 0.5 percent by participating fully

in a 401(k).

        The picture is quite different for high-income young couples with so much

income that 401(k) participation cannot a) lower and then raise their marginal income tax

rates or b) raise the share of their Social Security benefits that is taxable. For such

couples 401(k) participation means major lifetime tax savings. At a 6 percent real return,

a couple earning at the rate of $300,000 per year enjoys a 6.7 percent lifetime tax break,

which translates into a 3.8 percent increase in lifetime spending. These couples‚Äô continue




2
  The terms ‚Äúlifetime taxes‚Äù and ‚Äúlifetime spending‚Äù refer to present values of these flows where
discounting is done using the real rate of return assumed in each experiment.

to garner a major lifetime subsidy even if tax rates are raised by as much as a fifth when

they retire.

        The paper proceeds by showing the ambiguous sign of the tax benefit to 401(k)

participation. It then describes ESPlanner and the stylized young households used in our

analysis. Next come the findings, which are presented under a range of alternative

assumptions about rates of return, wage growth, and future tax rates. These findings raise

a number of policy questions, many of which are taken up in the conclusion.



II. The Ambiguous Tax Advantage to 401(k) Participation

        To see the ambiguous nature of the lifetime tax effect of participating in a 401(k),

consider an agent who lives for two periods, earning a wage of W when young and facing

a rate of return of r. Suppose the agent contributes an amount H to her 401(k) plan when

young. Then her lifetime budget constraint is given by:

(1)            Cy + Co/(1+r) = W ‚Äì Ty[W‚ÄìH‚ÄìDy] ‚Äì To[Yo +M(B,Yo)]/(1+r) ,

where Yo stands of taxable income in old age apart from Social Security benefits, i.e.,

               Yo = (W‚ÄìTy(W‚ÄìH‚ÄìDy) ‚ÄìH‚ÄìCy)r + H(1+r) ‚Äì Do ,

Cy and Co stand for consumption when young and old, respectively, M(B,Yo) stands for

the amount of taxable Social Security benefits, Dy and Do, stand for deductions when

young and old, respectively, and Ty( ) and To( ) are tax functions determining income-

tax payments when young and old. Note that taxable income when young is computed by

deducting 401(k) contributions, whereas taxable income when old is computed by

including principal plus interest earned on the contribution.




                                             4
           If Social Security benefits were not subject to taxation (M(B,Yo)=0) and both tax

functions were a fixed tax rate, œÑ, times their respective tax bases, the household‚Äôs

lifetime budget constraint would equal

(2) Cy + Co/(1+r) = W ‚àí œÑ(W‚àíH‚àíDy) ‚àí œÑ [(W‚àíœÑ(W‚àíH‚àíDy)‚àíH‚àíCy)r+(1+r)H‚àíDo]/(1+r)]

The right-hand side of (2) is wages less the present value of lifetime tax payments.

Collecting terms gives

(3) Cy + Co/(1+r) = W‚àí[œÑW‚àíœÑDy+ œÑ [(W(1‚àíœÑ)+œÑDy‚àíCy)r‚àíDo]/(1+r)‚àí œÑ(1‚àíœÑ)Hr/(1+r)]

Lifetime net taxes are now written as the lifetime taxes that would be paid absent 401(k)

contributions less the lifetime tax benefit of contributing to the 401(k). Holding Cy fixed,

the larger is H the smaller is the agent‚Äôs lifetime tax payment. Thus if tax rates are

constant and additional taxable income in old age doesn‚Äôt trigger additional taxation of

Social Security benefits, the direct impact of contributing to a 401(k) plan is a reduction

in lifetime taxes.

           Such contributions may also indirectly lower lifetime taxes through their effect on

consumption when young. Specifically, if the household is doing positive saving outside

of the 401(k), 401(k) contributions will be intra-marginal. In this case, the reduction in

lifetime taxes from 401(k) contributions will likely be spent, in part, on more

consumption when young. This will lower non-401(k) saving and the income taxes paid

when old on non-401(k) asset income. If all saving is done through the 401(k), non-

401(k) saving, (W‚àíœÑ(W‚àíH‚àíDy)‚àíH‚àíCy), will equal zero, and lifetime taxes will consist

solely of taxes on labor earnings net of deductions.3




3
    This is the well established point that 401(k) tax treatment effectively eliminates capital income taxation.


                                                         5
       Next consider equation (2) under the assumption that tax rates are invariant to the

tax base, but different when the agent is young and old. In this case,

(4) Cy+Co/(1+r)=W‚àí{œÑy(W‚àíH‚àíDy) +œÑo[(W‚àíœÑy(W‚àíH‚àíDy)‚àíH‚àíCy)r+H(1+r)‚àíDo]/(1+r)},

or

(5) Cy+Co/(1+r) =

     W‚àí {œÑy(W‚àíDy) +œÑo[(W‚àíœÑy(W‚àíDy)‚àíCy)r‚àíDo]/(1+r)‚àí[œÑo(1‚àíœÑy)rH/(1+r)+(œÑy‚àíœÑo)H]}

From (5) it‚Äôs clear that lifetime taxes can be increased by contributing to a 401(k) if the

tax rate when old, œÑo, is sufficiently high compared with the tax rate when young, œÑy.

       In the U.S. federal income tax, there are five marginal tax brackets with rates of

15 percent, 28 percent, 31 percent, 36 percent, and 39.6 percent. In the case of married

couple filing jointly, the corresponding taxable income tax brackets are $0 to $43,850,

$43,850 to $105,950, $105,950 to $161,450, $161,450 to $288,350, and $288,350 plus.

These bracket amounts are indexed to inflation. The Massachusetts state income tax rate,

which we consider here, is 5.95 on every dollar of taxable income.              Of course,

exemptions and deductions can make federal or state taxable income negative, in which

case no tax is assessed, although the household may receive refundable tax credits of

various kinds.

       While the current U.S. federal income tax provides low- and middle-income

households with lots of scope for moving into higher tax brackets, compound interest is a

very powerful force, and one might expect that in a multi-period model the value of tax

deferral would outweigh most increases in marginal tax rates that a 401(k) contributor

might experience. However, the progressivity of the tax schedule is only one reason that

a 401(k) contributor, particularly those in low tax brackets, might wonder about the size



                                             6
of their ultimate tax savings. Another reason is the value of tax deductions. Although

we‚Äôve left it out of the notation, the tax rates œÑy and œÑo are themselves increasing functions

of their respective tax bases.4 Hence, the larger is H, the smaller will be œÑy and the larger

will be œÑo. If Dy>Do, raising H may lower the value of the tax deductions; it will

definitely do so if Do equals zero. Since mortgage interest deductions are generally the

largest deduction for those who itemize and since such deductions are concentrated in

youth, 401(k) participation has the potential to reduce the value of tax deductions.

        A final and very important factor in assessing the tax implications of 401(k)

participation is the taxation of Social Security benefits. If the function determining the

amount of Social Security benefits that are included in taxable income, M(B,Yo), is

increasing in Yo, larger contributions to 401(k) plans will raise Yo and, thereby, raise the

amount of taxes paid on Social Security benefits.

        How much of Social Security benefits are included in federal AGI (adjusted gross

income) depends upon a pair of dollar limits--call them X1 and X2. For single filers

these limits are $25,000 and $34,000 respectively. For joint filers they are $32,000 and

$44,000 respectively. These limits are not indexed for inflation, meaning that as nominal

incomes rise, an ever-larger share of benefits become subject to income taxation.5

        To determine the amount of Social Security benefits that must be included in

federal AGI, we first calculate provisional income--which is modified AGI (non-Social

Security income including tax-exempt interest) plus half of the Social Security benefit. If

provisional income exceeds X1, but not X2, half of the excess over X1 or half of the


4
  Or, at least, non-decreasing functions.
5
  The non-indexation of these limits appears to be the brainchild of David Stockman, President Reagan‚Äôs
first Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Stockman viewed this as a way of making
necessary cuts in net benefits through time without anyone noticing.


                                                  7
Social Security benefit, whichever is smaller, is included in AGI. If provisional income

exceeds X2, then the amount to be included equals the smaller of two items: A) 50

percent of benefits or $6000, whichever is smaller, plus 85 percent of the excess of

provisional income over X2 and B) 85 percent of benefits.

       This is a rather complicated formula. To understand its implications, Table 1 and

Figure 1 present the share of Social Security that are taxable for different combinations of

Social Security benefits and the non-Social Security component of AGI (other income).

The table and figure incorporate high nominal values of Social Security benefits because

when currently young workers begin receiving their benefits, their nominal values will be

substantially higher than they are today. For example, assuming a 3 percent rate of

inflation, the equivalent of a $25,000 benefit in 2001 dollars would be $81,551 in 2040.

The share of Social Security benefits subject to taxation is highly sensitive to the level of

other income and somewhat sensitive to the level of benefits. Also note that, for the

range of nominal Social Security benefits shown, the taxable share of benefits equals its

maximum value of 85 percent for levels of other income of $100,000 or more. However,

because of Social Security's taxable earnings ceiling, benefits are capped for very high

earners. Hence, there‚Äôs no scope for 401(k) participation to increase benefit taxation for

very high-income households.

       With progressive taxes, multiple periods of life, the option to itemize deductions,

exemptions, tax credits, and the federal and, in some cases, state taxation of Social

Security benefits, deriving an explicit formula for lifetime tax payments becomes

intractable. But one can use ESPlanner to calculate annual tax payments and form their

present value.     Furthermore, one can run ESPlanner with and without 401(k)




                                             8
contributions to determine the change in lifetime taxes from 401(k) participation as well

as its impact on the present value of lifetime spending.



III. ESPlanner

       ESPlanner is designed to smooth a household‚Äôs living standard over its life cycle

to the extent possible without having the household go into debt. The Appendix details

ESPlanner‚Äôs federal income- and state income-tax calculators, Social Security‚Äôs payroll

tax calculator, and Social Security benefit calculator.      The income-tax calculators

determine whether households should itemize their deductions, computes deductions and

exemptions, deducts from taxable income contributions to tax-deferred retirement

accounts, includes in taxable income withdrawals from such accounts as well as the

taxable component of Social Security benefits, and calculates total tax liabilities. These

tax calculations are made separately for each year that the couple is alive as well as for

each year a survivor may be alive.

       The program also takes into account a variety of additional factors involved in

life-cycle consumption planning, including the non-fungible nature of housing, bequest

plans, and the desire of households to make ‚Äúoff-the-top‚Äù expenditures on college tuition,

weddings, and other special expenses.         ESPlanner recognizes that a household‚Äôs

expenditures do not directly translate into its standard of living. Adjustments are made

for household composition and household ‚Äúeconomies of scale‚Äù -- the fact that people can

live more cheaply together than apart.6 To be more precise, ESPlanner has a household

provide for children until they reach age 19, and considers that children may cost more or




                                             9
less than adults and that the relative costs of children can vary by age. It also adjusts for

the number of adult equivalents based on a user-specified degree of economies to scale in

shared living. Finally, ESPlanner simultaneously calculates the amounts of life insurance

needed by each spouse to guarantee that potential survivors suffer no decline in their

living standards compared with what would otherwise be the case.7

         ESPlanner‚Äôs principal outputs are recommended time-paths of consumption

expenditure, taxable saving, and term-life insurance holdings. All outputs are displayed

in today‚Äôs dollars. Consumption in this context is everything the household gets to spend

after paying for its ‚Äúoff-the-top‚Äù expenditures ‚Äì its housing expenses, special

expenditures, life insurance premiums, special bequests, taxes, and net contributions to

tax-favored accounts.          As mentioned, the amount of recommended consumption

expenditures varies from year to year in response to changes in the household‚Äôs

composition. It also rises when the household moves from a situation of being borrowing

constrained to one of being unconstrained.                       Finally, recommended household

consumption will change over time if users intentionally specify that they want their

living standard to change. For example, if users specify that they desire a 10 percent

higher living standard after a certain year in the future, the software will incorporate that

preference in making its recommendations, provided that it does not violate a borrowing

constraint.


6
   From the perspective of economic theory, the household is viewed as maximizing a Leontief
intertemporal utility function with year-specific time preference and demographic weights subject to
borrowing constraints and non-negativity constraints on life insurance.
7
  ESPlanner‚Äôs recommendations for annual term insurance are either positive or zero. If recommended term
insurance is positive for a particular potential decedent (the household head or, if married, spouse) in a
particular year and if the decedent dies at the end of that year, the surviving household will have precisely
the same living standard as the household would have had absent the decedent‚Äôs premature death. If the
potential decedent‚Äôs recommended insurance in a particular year is zero, the surviving household will have
the same or higher living standard if the decedent dies in that year.


                                                     10
       ESPlanner‚Äôs recommended saving in a particular year equals the household‚Äôs total

income (non-asset plus asset income) in that year minus that year‚Äôs sum of (a)

recommended spending on consumption and insurance premiums, (b) specified spending

on housing and special expenditures, (c) taxes, and (d) net contributions to tax-favored

accounts (contributions less withdrawals).        Given the household‚Äôs data inputs,

preferences, and borrowing constraints, ESPlanner recommends the highest and

smoothest possible living standard over time, leaving the household with zero terminal

assets apart from the equity in homes that the user has indicated would not be sold.



IV. Defining Our Stylized Couples

       Our stylized couples consist of a husband and wife who are both age 25 and live

at most to age 95. Each spouse works to age 65 and earns half of the household‚Äôs total

earnings, which range from $25,000 to $1 million per year when they are 25. Real

earnings grow annually by 1 percent. The couples live in Massachusetts and have no

initial assets apart from their homes. Each couple has two children. The first is born

when the couple is age 25 and the second when the couple is age 30. The market value of

each couple‚Äôs house is set at three times household labor earnings as of age 25.

       Each couple purchases its house at age 25 by paying 20 percent down and

borrowing the remainder at 8 percent for 30 years. Annual homeowner‚Äôs insurance,

property taxes, and maintenance are set at 0.17 percent, 1 percent, and 1 percent of house

value, respectively. Each child attends college for four years. A couple earning $25,000

per year spends, by assumption, $7,500 per child for each year of college. This college

expense is set at $15,000 for couples earning $50,000 and $30,000 for couples earning




                                            11
$100,000 or $150,000. For couples earning $200,000 or more per year, annual college

expenses are capped at $35,000. There are no bequests apart from the value of home

equity, which the couple chooses not to sell.

       Our calculations assume elective employee contributions and employer matching

contributions equal to the average of maximum contributions permitted by employer-

provided defined contribution plans. The household‚Äôs elective contribution is set at 13.5

percent of earnings and the employer-matching contribution is set at 3 percent of

earnings, bringing the total 401(k) contribution to 16.5 percent of earnings. At this

contribution rate, the dollar contribution ceiling limits the household‚Äôs contribution to

$60,000 at earnings exceeding of $363,636.36.8

       Our method of determining the lifetime net tax benefit of 401(k) participation is

to compare lifetime taxes and spending with and without such participation. But to make

the comparison meaningful, we need to ensure that the couple‚Äôs gross income is the same

in both cases. To do so we increase each spouse‚Äôs earnings in the case they don‚Äôt

contribute to a 401(k) plan by the amount the employer contributes to their plan in the

case that they do contribute. Hence, in the no-401(k) participation case, this additional

income is subject to immediate federal and state income taxation as well as to payroll

taxation.



V. Findings

       Table 2 shows life-cycle profiles of spending, consumption, income (net of 401(k)

contributions, but gross of withdrawals), taxes, and regular assets for the couple with

$50,000 in initial earnings ($25,000 per spouse). Spending refers to all expenditures on




                                            12
consumption, life insurance premiums, housing, and tuition. The table assumes a 6

percent real rate of return. These profiles are calculated for the two cases that the spouses

do and do not contribute to 401(k) plans. Changes over time in the level of consumption

in the two cases reflect the arrival and exit of children from the household and the

binding force of borrowing constraints.

           The table shows dramatic differences between the two cases.         With 401(k)

participation the couple is severely borrowing constrained (a point stressed in Gokhale,

Kotlikoff, and Warshawsky, 2000) and must reduce its consumption dramatically when

young in order to make its 401(k) contributions.               Indeed, the couple‚Äôs age-25

consumption declines by 24 percent due to participation. However, this sacrifice in

consumption when young permits a 277 percent greater level of consumption in old age

than would otherwise be the case. Participation in the 401(k) also tilts the couple‚Äôs age-

income profile. With participation, income at age 25 is 19 percent less and income at age

65 is 241 percent greater than in the no-participation case. Since this income is taxable,

taxes are lower when the couple is young and higher, indeed much higher, when the

couple is old.

           Note that the couple is borrowing constrained when young even in the absence of

401(k) participation. And the couple‚Äôs regular asset accumulation, once it begins, is

relatively modest. The explanation is that the couple is contributing so heavily to Social

Security and is receiving sufficiently large benefits from that program that it has little

need and wherewithal to do additional saving. This picture, writ large, goes a long way

in explaining Americans‚Äô low rate of personal saving.



8
    We assume this ceiling grows at 1 percent real per year.


                                                       13
         Table 3 shows the impact of 401(k) participation on lifetime taxes and spending

assuming the couple earns either a 4, 6, or 8 percent real rate of return on its regular as

well as 401(k) assets. For each case, the present values of lifetime taxes and spending are

formed using the same rate of return assumed in generating the data. The figures in the

table report the percentage changes in lifetime taxes and spending. Because U.S. federal

tax rate schedules are progressive (average tax rates rise with taxable income), a given

percentage change in taxes translates into a higher percentage change in spending (with

the opposite sign) for high-income individuals than for low-income individuals.9



Gains and Losses from 401(k) Participation

         Table 3, which considers the gains from 401(k) participation, contains a number

of striking findings. Of foremost interest are the results for low-income households who

earn 6 and 8 percent real on their investments. For these households, 401(k) participation

raises lifetime taxes and lowers lifetime spending. Take the couple with $50,000 per year

in earnings that receives a 6 percent real return on its assets.                    401(k) participation

translates into 1.1 percent higher lifetime net taxes and a 0.39 percent reduction in

lifetime spending. If the couple earns 8, rather than 6 percent real on its assets, the tax

hike is 6.4 percent and the spending reduction is 1.7 percent. If, on the other hand, the

couple earns a 4 percent real return, 401(k) participation leads to a 3.3 percent reduction

in lifetime taxes and a 0.7 percent increase in lifetime spending.

         Consider next Table 3‚Äôs finding for upper income households. Households with

incomes of $200,000 or more enjoy a tax reduction from 401(k) participation regardless

 Let S stand for the spending, E for earnings, T for taxes, and B for benefits, all measured in present value.
Then ‚àÜS/S = (T/(E+B-T))‚àÜT/T.


                                                     14
of the rate of return. However, the percentage reductions in lifetime taxes are not as large

for the couple that initially earns $1,000,000 as they are for other upper-income

households because combined employee-employer 401(k) contributions are limited by

law to the lesser of 25 percent of earnings or $30,000.

       Why, according to Table 3, is 401(k) participation worse if a couple earns an 8

rather than a 6 percent real rate of return? Since participating in 401k plans reduces

capital income taxes, a higher rate of return would seemingly increase the benefit from

participating. However, a higher rate of return implies greater asset accumulation within

the 401k plan and larger plan withdrawals. For middle- and low-income households this

means being pushed into higher marginal rate brackets in retirement and/or finding that

more of one‚Äôs Social Security benefits are subject to taxation.         For upper income

households, who rely much less on Social Security to finance their retirements, earning a

higher rate of return significantly raises one‚Äôs taxable capital income and therefore one‚Äôs

lifetime tax payments. Hence, 401(k) participation has a smaller percentage impact on

lifetime tax payments and, therefore, on lifetime spending.

       Table 4 sheds some more light on why 401(k) participation can be a costly

experience for low-income couples. It considers the couple with $50,000 in initial labor

income and access to a 6 percent real return. It then successively adds Social Security,

housing, children, and college tuition to the case. If the couple did not participate in

Social Security, had no home, had no children, and faced no tuition expenses, 401(k)

participation would provide a tremendous subsidy; it would reduce lifetime taxes by over

one quarter and increase lifetime spending by almost 9 percent!




                                            15
       Starting from this position, forcing the couple to contribute to Social Security

dramatically lowers its 401(k) lifetime tax reduction (to less than 5 percent) and its

spending increase (to less than 2 percent). The addition to the case of housing, including

a deductible mortgage, leaves the household essentially indifferent between participating

and not participating in a 401(k). This, of course, assumes the household cares only

about the present value of spending, not the timing of its spending. For, as we‚Äôve seen,

participating in a 401(k) plan comes at the price of a major reduction in consumption

when young relative to old.

       With the addition of children and their college tuition needs, 401(k) participation

no longer saves taxes. It raises them. With children come additional tax exemptions. The

tax savings from these exemptions will be reduced by 401(k) participation if such

participation lowers the household‚Äôs tax bracket when young. Spending down regular

assets for college tuition leads the household to enter retirement with relatively little

income other than Social Security benefits. Consequently, it is in a position to have the

taxation of its Social Security benefits greatly influenced by the amount of its 401(k)

withdrawals.



401(k) Participation and Marginal Tax Rates

       Table 5 explores the changes in marginal tax brackets that the $50,000 couple

experiences from 401(k) participation. It shows changes in federal, state, and payroll

taxes when ESPlanner is rerun after incrementing the household's earnings by $100 at

selected ages. The smoothing of lifetime consumption in response to receiving an extra

$100 in a future year, say t, raises consumption in earlier years and induces the household




                                            16
to accumulate fewer assets through year t. Hence, year-t taxable income increases by less

than $100. For example, if the household is in the 15 percent federal income tax bracket

in year t, those taxes rise by slightly less than $15.

        Table 5 shows that 401(k) participation lowers the couple‚Äôs federal marginal tax

rate during middle age, but raises it after retirement.10 Without 401(k) participation, the

household is nominally in the 15 percent federal income-tax bracket after age 65, but an

additional $100 of earnings at this age generates an additional tax liability of $27; i.e., the

effective marginal tax rate is 27 percent. This occurs because less than 85 percent of the

household's Social Security benefits are subject to taxation and an increment to earnings

triggers an increase in the amount of taxable benefits, making the increment to taxable

earnings $180.

        With participation, 401(k)-plan withdrawals are so large that taxable Social

Security benefits are already at their upper limit of 85 percent. So, the increase in Social

Security benefit taxation from 401(k) participation is purely intra-marginal: An increase

in other income pulls in additional Social Security benefits into taxable income. For the

$50,000 household considered earlier, the effective marginal tax rate in retirement is

roughly 10 percentage points higher with 401(k) participation than without. This is

because the effective federal marginal rate rises from 27 percent to 31 percent and the

effective state marginal tax rate rises from zero to 5.5 percent.                  Its large 401(k)

withdrawals shifts the household from the 15 to the 31 percent federal statutory marginal

rate bracket and from the 0 to the 5.95 state statutory rate bracket.




10
  This table ignores employer-paid payroll taxes. Our subsequent analysis takes such tax payments into
account in recognizing that employer contributions to 401(k) plans are not subject to payroll taxation.


                                                  17
       Table 5's change in state marginal tax rate across the no-participation and

participation cases deserves further discussion: Without participation, there is a slight

decline in the State tax liability when age-65 earnings are increased by $100.

Massachusetts allows exemptions and deductions only on non-asset income (earnings,

pensions, and annuities). Without participation, age-65 non-asset income (including the

$100 increment) net of allowable exemptions and deductions is zero. This makes asset

income the only source of taxable income and, again, the $100 increment induces the

household to accumulate fewer assets through age 65. With participation, however, non-

asset income net of exemptions and deductions is positive. Now, an increment of $100

triggers an additional tax liability of $5.49‚Äîagain slightly less than the statutory

marginal tax of $5.95 percent because of smaller asset accumulation through age-65.

The induced change in asset accumulation also lowers the federal marginal tax recorded

in the table from the statutory rate of 31 percent.



The Impact of Changing Social Security Benefit Taxation

       How would the gains from 401(k) participation change were Congress to index

for inflation the dollar limits, X1 and X2, which determine taxable Social Security

benefits? Table 6 provides the answer. For the $50,000 household, inflation indexing

raises the nominal value of X1 and eliminates Social Security benefit taxation in the no-

participation case. But with participation, indexing the limits makes no difference to

Social Security benefit taxation. The reason is that the 401(k) withdrawals are so large

that non-Social Security taxable income exceeds the top limit even if that limit is inflation




                                              18
indexed. Indeed, despite the indexation of the thresholds, the full 85 percent of Social

Security benefits remains taxable.

       Given that the policy of indexing the limits lowers the taxes paid by the non

401(k) participating household and leaves unchanged the taxes paid by the 401(k)

participating household, indexation makes participating in a 401(k) an even worse choice.

Table 6 shows this. It's percentage increase in the present value of taxes and percentage

decline in the present value of spending are both larger with participation than without.

       At high earnings levels and/or high rates of return, the same reasoning explains

the smaller percentage increases in the present value of spending and smaller percentage

declines in the present value of taxes from participating in a 401(k) plan. Again, because

indexing the dollar limits reduces the amount of benefits subject to taxation only when

not participating, tax savings from participating are smaller in present value.         The

exception is the $25,000 household reaping a 4 percent real rate of return on assets. In

this case, 401(k) plan withdrawals are not large enough to trigger additional Social

Security taxes when the dollar limits are indexed. Hence, compared to Table 3, tax

savings and spending increases are larger with 401(k) participation. In general, indexing

the dollar limits that determine the taxable portion of Social Security benefits will help

those who do not participate in tax-favored saving plans, but will increase the lifetime

loss (lower the lifetime gain) from participating for all but the lowest earners.

       Table 7 shows the effect of eliminating Social Security benefit taxation altogether.

Now, participating in a 401(k) plan does not induce any intra-marginal increase in taxable

Social Security benefits. As a result, the lifetime tax liability decreases and the present

value of spending increases for the $50,000 household earning a 6 percent real return on




                                             19
assets. Indeed, all cases with a negative lifetime spending change in Table 6 now have a

positive or a smaller negative change in Table 7.



The Implications of Future Tax Increases and Bracket Adjustments

        Table 8 repeats Table 3 but assumes that federal income tax rates will be

increased by 20 percent when the couple reaches age 65. Compared with Table 3, Table

8 shows smaller percentage reductions in lifetime taxes from 401(k) participation at all

but the top income level. For a low-income ($25,000 per year of earnings) couple

earning 8 percent real, lifetime taxes are raised by almost 11 percent and lifetime

spending is reduced by just over 2 percent. In contrast, high-income households continue

to benefit substantially from their 401(k) saving program. For example, at a 4 percent

real return, a couple earning $300,000 enjoys an 8.2 percent reduction in lifetime taxes

that finances a 6.3 percent increase in lifetime spending. The gap in treatment between

these two couples is, then, 8 percent of lifetime spending.

        Table 9 considers an alternative assumption to indexing nominal tax brackets to

inflation, namely indexing them to nominal wages, which are assumed to grow at 4.03

percent.11 This assumption precludes real bracket creep and means that our stylized

households will be in lower tax brackets in retirement than with just inflation indexation.

As a comparison of Table 9 and Table 3 makes clear, this alternative assumption about

indexing tax brackets makes very little difference to calculated gains and losses from

401(k) participation. While indexing the tax system to wage growth lowers lifetime taxes




11
  One minus the product of one plus the assume 3 percent inflation rate times on plus the assumed 1

                                                20
and raises lifetime spending, it doesn‚Äôt alter by very much the percentage changes in

lifetime taxes and spending from participating fully in a 401(k) plan.



Alternative Assumptions

       Table 10 conducts our with- and without-401(k) comparison under the assumption

that the household desires a 10 percent higher living standard in retirement. Table 11

makes the opposite assumption, namely that the household‚Äôs living standard is 10 percent

lower during retirement. Relative to Table 3, Table 10 shows larger declines (or smaller

increases) in lifetime taxes and larger increases (or smaller declines) in lifetime spending

due to 401(k) participation across all earnings-rate-of-return combinations. Table 11

shows the opposite.



Lowering Contributions

       Table 3 demonstrates that fully participating in 401k plans may turn out to be

detrimental to low-income and moderate-income households.             What would be the

consequence of reducing contribution rates by 50 percent? Table 12 provides the answer.

At a 6 percent real rate of return, the household earning $50,000 per year now enjoys a

lifetime tax cut of 2.6 percent and a lifetime spending gain of 0.64 percent. These figures

correspond to the 1.1 percent increase in lifetime taxes and the 0.39 percent reduction in

lifetime spending reported for this couple if it contributes fully to the 401(k) plan. These

results show that low-income households may be better served by limiting their

contribution rates because doing so helps them avoid being taxed at higher rates during

the withdrawal phase of their lifetimes. Making smaller contributions delivers small but




                                            21
positive benefits if rates of return turn out to be low. If rates turn out to be high, such

households would break even at worst.

       The fact that low- and moderate-income workers are likely to do better

contributing less than the maximum allowable amounts together with the severe

borrowing constraints they are likely to face in making maximum contributions helps

explain the findings in Poterba, Venti, and Weiss (2001) that 401(k) participants typically

contribute only about 9 percent of their earnings to their plans.



Delaying or Shortening Contributions

       Table 13 reports results under the assumption that the household does not

commence participation until age 40. For low-income households, waiting until middle

age to begin full participation is beneficial relative to making maximum contributions

beginning at age 25. The same reasoning applies here as in the case of Table 12. Smaller

accumulations in a tax-deferred plan imply smaller future withdrawals. This prevents

taxation at a higher rate-bracket during retirement. Households earning less that $50,000

now enjoy significant lifetime tax savings and non-negligible increments to lifetime

spending from participation.

       Table 14 shows the results assuming that the household contributes only during

the first 25 years (as opposed to the last 25 years as in Table 13). Here, despite saving for

the same number of periods as in Table 13, the savings in 401(k) accounts accumulate

over a longer period of time and result in larger withdrawals upon retirement. This

exposes retirement income, including Social Security benefits, to higher tax rates‚Äîjust as




                                             22
in the case of Table 3. The patterns of tax- and spending-changes are similar to those in

Table 3.



Higher Real Wage Growth

       If real annual wage growth is 2 percent rather than 1 percent, higher future wages

may result in taxation at a higher marginal rate even without participation. After the first

rate bracket jump in marginal income tax rates (from 15 to 28 percent) subsequent

increments in income tax rates are much smaller (to 31, 36, and 39.6 percent). Moreover,

the dollar-range between brackets is wider after the second bracket of $43,850

(subsequent brackets are set at $105,950, $161,450, and $288,350). Hence, with higher

wage growth, participating in a tax-deferred saving plan reduces low-earners‚Äô likelihood

of being subject to higher marginal income tax rates because of large future plan

withdrawals. As Table 15 shows, low-income earners, whose earnings grow 2 percent

annually and whose investments earn a 6 percent real return, raise their lifetime spending

by a small margin by participating fully in a 401(k) plan.

       The dollar-distance between brackets is widest after $161,450, and the next rate

jump is just 3.6 percentage points (from 36 percent to 39.6 percent). This suggests that

the benefit from participation would be quite high for those earning around $150,000.

Earning $150,000 at age 25 with real wage growth at 1 percent per year makes age 65

earnings approximately $223,300 (measured in 2001 dollars) ‚Äîless than the next

bracket‚Äôs dollar amount. With 2 percent annual wage growth, however, age-65 earnings

become approximately $331,200 (measured in 2001 dollars) ‚Äîexceeding the highest rate

bracket.   Therefore, unlike the case where wage growth is 1 percent per year,




                                            23
participating under 2 percent wage growth does not further bump up the tax-rate bracket

during the withdrawal phase of the household‚Äôs lifetime. Table 15 shows that the lifetime

spending increase for the household earning $150,000 and investing at 6 percent real is

2.54 percent‚Äîconsiderably higher than the corresponding lifetime spending increase in

Table 3 of 1.15 percent.



Contributing to Regular and Roth IRAs

        Not all employers offer tax-deferred saving plans. For workers in such firms,

access to tax-sheltered saving plans is limited to regular or Roth IRAs. The contribution

limits to these saving vehicles are much lower: $2,000 per spouse per year. Table 16

shows the lifetime tax and spending advantage from investing up to the $2,000 limit in a

regular IRA throughout one‚Äôs working lifetime. The table assumes, counterfactually, that

high-income workers are able to contribute the same amount to a regular IRA. Table 17

repeats the exercise, but assumes an annual $5,000 contribution limit. This higher limit is

proposed in a bill now being considered by Congress.12 Table 16 shows that contributing

at the $2,000 limit is a tax saver for all couples except for the lowest earning couple that

invests at 8 percent real.

        In contrast, Table 17 shows that investing $5,000 per year to a regular IRA would

be a mistake for almost all couples earning $50,000 or less. Take the couple that initially

earns $25,000. If the couple invests $5,000 per year to a regular IRA and does so at an 8

percent real return, it will raise its lifetime taxes by almost 30 percent and lower its

lifetime spending by almost 5 percent. This is an extreme outcome as households earning




                                            24
$25,000 per year are unlikely to contribute save $5,000 in a traditional IRA. All upper

income households with comparable saving levels will gain on a lifetime basis if the IRA

saving limit were increased from $2,000 to $5,000.

        Tables 18 and 19 show the impact of contributing respectively $2,000 and $5,000

per year to Roth IRAs.        Saving in these plans is done on an after-tax basis with

withdrawals not subject to taxation. All within-plan accumulations are tax-free as well.

Roth IRAs also eliminate the risk that plan withdrawals will be subject to higher tax rates.

Hence, saving in these plans confers a tax and spending advantage at all income levels.

However, the pattern of gains remains regressive. Interestingly, raising the contribution

limit from $2,000 to $5,000 makes very little difference for couples earning $50,000 or

less, but roughly doubles the tax savings of those with higher incomes.



VI. Summary and Conclusion

        Participating fully in 401(k) and similar tax-deferred saving vehicles appears to

raise, rather than lower, the lifetime tax payments of most workers, namely those with

low and moderate incomes. While contributing to such retirement accounts lowers

current taxes, the increase in taxes paid on the withdrawal of accumulated contributions

can exceed the immediate tax reduction when measured in present value. There are three

forces at work. First, the size of the withdrawals can be large enough to place the

household in a higher tax bracket, both at federal and state levels. Second, the size of the

withdrawals can substantially raise the share of Social Security benefits subject to federal

income taxation. Third, the size of the contributions can lower tax brackets when young

12
  A pension reform bill sponsored by Representatives Rob Portman (R-OH) and Ben Cardin, (D-MD)
proposes these modifications. The current bill‚Äîthe ‚ÄúComprehensive Retirement Security and Pension



                                               25
and middle aged and, thereby, reduce the value of current mortgage and other tax

deductions.

        Calculations for married couples based on ESPlanner ‚Äì a detailed life-cycle

personal financial planning model ‚Äì show that contributing the maximum amounts

stipulated by typical 401(k) plans and investing these contributions at a moderate 6

percent real rate of return raises, rather than lowers, the lifetime tax payments of low- and

moderate-income couples.           Similar results hold for low- and moderate-income

households contributing annually the maximum permitted amount to a regular IRA.

        In contrast, high-income couples, who, at least under current law, cannot be

pushed into higher tax brackets and who face the maximum taxation of their Social

Security benefits regardless of their tax-deferred withdrawals, reap major lifetime tax

savings from 401(k) participation. At a 6 percent real return, a couple with annual

earnings of $300,000 reduces its lifetime taxes by almost 7 percent through full 401(k)

participation. This translates into close to a 4 percent increase in lifetime spending.

        The taxation of Social Security benefits appears to be the most important factor in

transforming full 401(k) participation from a good to a bad deal for most workers who

earn moderate to high rates of return on their savings. Indexing to inflation the nominal

thresholds at which this benefit taxation is activated might seem like a way to remedy this

situation. But such a policy would do more for non-401(k) participants than for 401(k)

participants. Indeed, because of the potential size of 401(k) withdrawals, indexing the

Social Security benefit income-tax thresholds would do little, if anything, to alter the

extent to which Social Security benefits are subject to taxation. Raising the nominal

thresholds at a faster pace than inflation is another option, but one that would leave more

of the middle class wishing, ex-post, that they hadn‚Äôt participated in a 401(k). A third

option is limiting the maximum share of Social Security benefits subject to taxation. In

this regard, it‚Äôs worth noting that some members of Congress are advocating returning to

pre-1993 provisions under which a maximum of 50 percent of Social Security benefits is

subject to federal income taxation. A fourth policy is leaving out retirement account

withdrawals from the calculation of the portion of Social Security benefits that are

subject to income taxation.

         Another policy that merits consideration in light of our findings is the repeal of

non-discrimination rules. According to these rules, the average of tax-deferred

contribution rates by a firm‚Äôs highly compensated employees cannot exceed the average

for non-highly compensated employees by more than a factor of 1.25.13 Such rules lead

firms to encourage their low-income employees to raise their contribution rates so that

highly compensated employees can increase their contribution rates as well.

         Tax policy with respect to 401(k) and similar tax-deferred saving vehicles is, of

course, only one component of a complex fiscal system. But it‚Äôs a remarkably regressive

component. The policy appears to raise the lifetime taxes of many of the poor, while

substantially lowering those of the rich, assuming they are a) lucky enough to work for an

employer with a generous 401(k) or similar plan and b) take full advantage of the

opportunity to contribute. The fact that employers have, at their discretion, the power to

convey such large tax breaks on their highly compensated workers and convey non trivial

   Alternatively, the average of tax-deferred contribution rates by HCE‚Äôs can exceed the average for NCEs
by a factor of 2 as long as this is not more than 2 percentage points above the NCE‚Äôs average tax-deferred
contribution rate. HCE‚Äôs include workers earning more than $85,000 or those in the top 20 percent of a
firms earners. More recently, ‚Äúsafe harbor‚Äù rules have been introduced that allow a firm to ignore non-
discrimination requirements. To do so, the firm must either a) make immediately vested matching
contributions of 100 percent up to the first 3 percent and 50 percent of the next 2 percent (alternatively 100

tax increases on their low and moderately compensated workers begs the question of

whether employers should be allowed to exercise such great control over their workers‚Äô

saving incentives. Indeed, the regressivity of tax-deferred saving incentives begs the

more general question of whether the limits on contributions to 401(k) and similar tax-

deferred saving vehicles should be lowered.                  Such a policy would, however, be

orthogonal to current Congressional intent.

        Assuming the government doesn‚Äôt alter its policies, are there steps employers and

their low- and moderate-income workers can take to respond to the findings presented

here? There are indeed. Employers seeking to lower rather than raise the lifetime tax

payments of such workers might consider abandoning their 401(k) plans in favor of

making direct contributions to Roth IRAs for their workers. Alternatively, they might

consider reducing the contributions they make on their workers‚Äô behalf to their 401(k)

plans and instead contributing the same amounts to Roth IRAs or to taxable saving

vehicles established in their employees‚Äô names.

        For individual low- and moderate-income workers who are unable to get their

employers to redirect their matching contribution, remaining in the company‚Äôs 401(k)

plan is likely to be better than withdrawing. The reason is that typical employer matches

exceed the lifetime tax increases computed here with respect to 401(k) participation. But

such workers should consider carefully whether they wish to contribute on their own to

the plan once their contribution is large enough to secure their employers‚Äô match.

Another issue is whether low- and moderate-income workers who participate in a 401(k)

should invest in lower yielding securities to limit their exposure to higher taxes in


percent of the first 4 percent) of workers‚Äô elective contributions, or b) provide immediately vested ‚Äòacross
the board‚Äô tax-deferred contributions of 3 percent of wages for all workers regardless of participation.

retirement. The answer here is "no." Given that the marginal tax on additional 401(k)

income neither equals nor exceeds 100 percent, earning a higher rate of return on one‚Äôs

401(k) assets is always better than earning a lower rate of return. Our point, instead, is

that many workers would do better to earn the same higher rate of return by saving in a

Roth IRA or in a taxable account.

       To conclude, the federal government has spent over a quarter of a Century

encouraging workers of all strips to save in tax-deferred retirement accounts.         In

promoting participation in such plans, the government has encouraged workers to believe

they would be saving taxes on a lifetime, rather than simply a short-term, basis. For

those at the upper end of the nation‚Äôs income distribution, tax-deferred saving does,

indeed, convey significant lifetime tax benefits. But for those at the lower end, 401(k)

participation may represent more of a tax trap than a tax shelter.

               ESPlanner‚Äôs Tax and Social Security Benefit Calculations

Federal Income Tax Calculations
ESPlanner‚Äôs calculations of federal income taxes in each future year take into account the
household‚Äôs year-specific marital status. Thus, in the case of married households, the
marital status is married when both spouses are alive and single when on is deceased.
Households that are married are assumed to file jointly. The tax schedules for each filing
status are taken from the federal income tax booklet for the latest available tax year‚Äî
usually the year prior to the ‚Äúcurrent‚Äù year entered by the user. The tax schedule is
applied to the program‚Äôs calculation of federal taxable income. Federal taxable income
equals federal Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) less personal exemptions and less the
standard or itemized deduction, whichever is larger.

AGI for each year includes projected incomes in current dollars from the following
sources: Labor income (wages and salaries), self-employment income, asset income
projected by the program based on user inputs of initial non-tax-favored net worth and
rates of return, and on the optimal spending plan computed by the program. AGI also
includes taxable asset income, taxable social security benefits, taxable special receipts,
taxable distributions from defined benefit pension plans and taxable withdrawals from
tax-favored saving plans. Each of these items is based upon the user‚Äôs inputs and
preferences. Non-taxable special receipts and withdrawals from non-deductible tax-
favored accounts are not included in AGI. Deductible contributions to tax-favored
retirement accounts are subtracted from income in calculating each year‚Äôs AGI.
Employer contributions to tax-favored retirement accounts are not included in AGI.
However, withdrawals from these accounts are included.

The Tax Schedule
The tax schedules for the two types of filing statuses implemented in ESPlanner are taken
from the federal income tax booklet for the 1998 tax year‚Äîthe latest year for which the
federal schedules are available. These schedules are as follows:
(1)                    (2)                    (3)                     (4)
If taxable                                                            of the
income                 but not                the tax                 amount

The Indexation of the Tax Schedule
Tax-rate brackets and infra-marginal tax amounts (all of the dollar amounts listed in the
tax schedules) are adjusted for inflation in each year over the household‚Äôs lifetime. This
is done to ensure that the schedule keeps pace with the growth of income in current
dollars. The indexation is done using the user-specified rate of inflation.

Adjustment for the current year
Because the tax schedules listed above are applicable for the 1998 tax year whereas the
user will enter 1999 as the current year, all tax brackets and infra-marginal tax amounts
[the dollar amounts shown in column (3) in the schedules listed above] are indexed for
inflation at the user-specified annual rate. This is done to avoid subjecting 1999 taxable
income to tax schedules appropriate for 1998‚Äîthat is, based on the wage and price levels
prevailing in 1998.

Standard Deductions and Exemptions
The standard deduction and personal exemption amounts are also taken from the tax year
prior to the ‚Äúcurrent‚Äù year (tax year 1998 in the current version). The amount subtracted
from AGI for each personal exemption was $2,700. The standard deductions were $7,100
for the ‚Äúmarried filing jointly‚Äù filing status and $4,250 for the ‚Äúsingle‚Äù filing status.
These amounts are also indexed for inflation for each future year based on the user-
specified future rate of inflation. The number of personal exemptions allowed equals 2
plus the number of children for ‚Äúmarried and filing jointly‚Äù and 1 plus the number of
children for the ‚Äúsingle‚Äù filing statuses. The personal exemption amount that can be
deducted from AGI in calculating taxable income is phased out if AGI is above certain
dollar limits depending upon the filing status. ESPlanner takes account of the phase-out
of personal exemptions based on these dollar limits indexed for inflation.

The Decision to Itemize
ESPlanner takes the maximum of the standard deduction or itemized deduction where the
latter includes mortgage interest payments, property taxes, state and local income tax
payments, and tax-deductible special expenditures that the user specifies‚Äîsuch as
alimony payments, charitable contributions, and deductible medical expenses. Note that
state and local income tax payments are deductible only if they are being withheld from
pay or the user makes estimated tax payments during the during the tax year. ESPlanner
assumes withholding or pre-payment in every case.

The Phase Out of Itemized Deductions
Federal income tax rules phase out itemized deductions for high income taxpayers (both,
married filing jointly and single payers). For the 1998 tax year, the amount of the



                                           42
deduction is reduced by 3¬¢ for every dollar of AGI in excess of $124,500 with the total
reduction limited to 80 percent of the original amount. The reduction does not apply to
certain components of the itemized deductions claimed‚Äîsuch as medical care expenses,
investment interest, and casualty and theft losses. Because ESPlanner does not
distinguish between these and other sources of itemized deductions, the phase-out rules
are applied to the entire itemized deduction.

The Child Tax Credit
The child tax credit equals $400 times the number of qualifying children in the
household. The tax credit is phased out if AGI is over the threshold of $110,000 for the
‚Äúmarried and filing jointly‚Äù status and of $75,000 for the ‚Äúsingle‚Äù filing status. The
phase-out rate is $50 for each $1000 of income in excess of the applicable threshold. The
amount of the child tax credit equals the computed amount or the federal income tax
liability net of the earned income tax credit, whichever is less. If the earned income tax
credit exceeds the federal income tax liability, the child tax credit is applied against the
payroll tax liability.

The Earned Income Credit
The program‚Äôs calculation of the earned income credit adheres to the EIC worksheet in
federal Form 1040. ESPlanner first checks for eligibility to take EIC based on
investment income and on taxable and non-taxable (employer contributions to 401(k)
plans, for example) earned income thresholds for households with no qualifying child and
those with at least one qualifying child (adopted, foster, step-and grand-children are
excluded in ESPlanner‚Äôs calculations). Next, EIC is computed based on the EIC schedule
for taxable and nontaxable income. If the EIC is non-zero, it applies if AGI is less than
certain dollar thresholds ($5600 for households without a qualifying child and $ 12,300
for households with at least 1 qualifying child). If AGI is greater than these dollar
amounts, EIC is based on the AGI.

Payroll Taxes
In each year, the payroll tax for a married household is the sum of the two spouses‚Äô
payroll taxes. Each spouse‚Äôs tax equals the employee share of the OASDI tax rate (6.2
percent) applied to labor earnings up to the taxable maximum level plus the employee
share of the HI tax rate (1.45 percent) applied to total labor earnings. If earnings from
self-employment are present, these are included in the calculation only to the extent that
labor earnings fall short of the taxable maximum limit for the OASDI tax. The entire
labor income from self-employment in taxed on account of the HI tax. In the case of self-
employment income, the employer plus employee tax rates for OASDI and HI are
applied.

The Taxation of Social Security Benefits
Social Security benefits are taxed by including these benefits in the federal income tax
base in the following manner. If the sum of AGI and 50 percent of Social Security
benefits falls short of $25,000 (adjusted for inflation for future years) if single and
$32,000 (same qualifier) if married, then none of the benefits are taxable. If the sum
exceeds the applicable dollar threshold, but the excess is less than $9,000 if single



                                            43
($12,000 if married), then the smaller of one-half of the excess or 50 percent of the
benefit is taxable and is included in the federal income tax base. In addition, if the
aforementioned excess is greater than the dollar thresholds, 85 percent of this excess or
85 percent of the benefit, whichever is smaller, is also added to the federal income tax
base.

State Income Tax Calculations
State income taxes are calculated for each state that imposes an income tax according to
the specific tax rules applicable in user‚Äôs state of residence. In most cases, the state
income tax base equals the federal AGI re-adjusted for taxable Social Security benefits.
State income tax calculations incorporate special features peculiar to each state: For
example, some states (such as Massachusetts) impose special taxes on asset incomes.
State-specific personal, spousal, and dependent exemptions (including additional
exemptions for the elderly) and the applicable standard deductions are used to calculate
the state taxable income. State taxes are calculated by applying the state‚Äôs tax rate
schedule to the taxable income.

Social Security Benefit Calculations
Retirement Benefits
Eligibility ‚Äì Before ESPlanner provides you (and your spouse if married) Social Security
retirement benefits, it checks that you are fully insured. Individuals must be fully insured
to receive retirement benefits based on their earnings records. Becoming fully insured
requires sufficient contributions at a job (including self-employment) covered by Social
Security. For those born after 1929, acquiring 40 credits prior to retirement suffices for
fully-insured status. Earnings between 1937 and 1951 are aggregated and divided by
$400, and the result (rounded down to an integer number) are the pre-1952 credits which
are added to the credits earned after 1950 in determining insured status. After 1951,
workers earn one credit for each quarter of the year they work in Social Security-covered
employment and earn above a specified minimum amount. The year of first eligibility for
retirement benefits is the year in which the individual becomes age 62. The individual is
entitled to retirement benefits after an application for benefits is submitted, but never
before age 62.

Determination of Primary Insurance Amount (PIA) -- The PIA is the basis for all benefit
payments made on a worker‚Äôs earnings record. There are several steps in computing the
PIA. Base years are computed as the years after 1950 up to the first month of entitlement
to retirement benefits begins. For survivor benefits, base years include the year of the
worker's death.

Elapsed years are computed as those years after 1950 (or after attainment of age 21,
whichever occurs later) up to (but not including) the year of first eligibility. The
maximum number of elapsed years for an earnings record is 40 (it could be shorter, for
purposes of calculating survivor benefits if the person dies prior to age 62).

Computation years are calculated as the number of elapsed years less 5, or 2, whichever
is greater. Earnings in base years (up to the maximum taxable limit in each year, and



                                            44
through age 60 or two years prior to death, whichever occurs earlier) are wage-indexed
according to economy-wide average wages. Of these, the highest earnings in years
equaling the number of computation years are added together and the sum is divided by
the number of months in computation years to yield Average Indexed Monthly Earnings
(AIME).

Bend Points -- The AIME is converted into a PIA using a formula with bend points. The
bend point formula is specified as 90 percent of the first X dollars of AIME plus 32
percent of the next Y dollars of AIME plus 15 percent of the AIME in excess of Y
dollars. The dollar amounts X and Y are also wage indexed and are different for different
eligibility years. The dollar amounts pertaining to the year of attaining age 60 (or, for
survivor benefits, the second year before death, whichever is earlier) are applied in
computing the PIA.

Benefits- A person who begins to collect benefits at his or her "normal retirement age"
(currently age 65) receives the PIA as the monthly retirement benefit. In subsequent
years, the monthly benefit is adjusted according to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to
maintain its purchasing power.

Increases in Normal Retirement Ages -- After 2003 normal retirement ages are scheduled
to increase by 2 months for every year that a person‚Äôs 65th birthday occurs later than the
year 2003. This progressive increase in the normal retirement age for those born later
ceases between the years 2008 through 2020; those attaining age 65 in these years have a
normal retirement age of 66. The postponement in retirement ages resumes after 2020
such that those born after 2025 have a normal retirement age of 67. All cohorts attaining
age 65 after that year have a normal retirement age of 67.

Reductions for Age -- A person who begins to collect retirement benefits earlier than the
normal retirement age receives a reduction for age. The reduction factor is 5/9 of 1
percent for each month of entitlement prior to the normal retirement age. The reduced
benefit payment (except for the inflation adjustment) continues even after the person
reaches or surpasses the normal retirement age. If the number of months of reduction
exceeds 36 months (for example, in case of entitlement at age 62 when the normal
retirement age is 67), then the reduction factor is 5/12 of 1 percent for every additional
month of early entitlement.

Delayed Retirement Credits--Those who begin to collect benefits after their normal
retirement age (up to age 70) receive delayed retirement credits. The amount of the
delayed retirement credit for each month of delayed entitlement depends on the year in
which a person attains normal retirement age. For example, those attaining age 65 in
1997 receive an additional 5 percent in monthly benefits for each year of delay in
entitlement. However, those attaining age 65 in the year 2008 will receive an additional 8
percent in benefits for each year of delayed entitlement.

Earnings Test -- If a person continues to work and earn after the month of entitlement,
benefits are reduced because of an earnings test. Beneficiaries under the normal



                                           45
retirement age, lose $1 for each $2 earned above an earnings limit. Those older than the
normal retirement age, lose $1 for each $3 earned above a higher earnings limit. The
earnings limits have already been specified through the year 2000 and are scheduled to
grow with average wages in subsequent years. All benefits payable on a worker‚Äôs
earnings record, including the worker‚Äôs own retirement benefits and spousal and child
dependent benefits, are proportionally reduced by the testing of the worker‚Äôs earnings.

Recomputation of Benefits -- Earnings in any year after entitlement to benefits are
automatically taken into account in a recomputation of the PIA for determining the
subsequent year's benefit amount. However, these earnings are not indexed before they
are included in the AIME calculation. If such earnings are higher than some prior year's
earnings (indexed earnings through age 60 or unindexed earnings after age 60), they
result in an increase in the PIA and benefit payable. If they are lower than all previous
year's earnings, they will not lower the PIA or benefits since only the highest earnings in
base years are included in the calculations.

Spousal and Child Dependent Benefits
Eligibility -- Wives and husbands of insured workers (including divorced spouses) are
entitled to spousal benefits if the couple was married for at least 10 years at the time of
application for spousal benefits, the spouse is over age 62 or has in care a child under age
16 entitled to benefits under the insured worker's record, and the insured worker is
collecting retirement benefits. Children of insured workers under age 16 are entitled to
child dependent benefits if the child is unmarried and the worker is collecting retirement
benefits.

Benefits -- Spousal and child benefits equal 50 percent of the insured worker's PIA
(each). Child dependent benefits may be lower only if the family maximum applies.
Spousal benefits may be lower due to the family maximum, a reduction for age, the
application of the earnings test, or the spouse‚Äôs receipt of retirement benefits based or her
or his own earnings record.

Family Maximum -- All benefits paid under a worker's record (except retirement benefits
or divorced spousal benefits) are reduced proportionately to bring them within the family
maximum benefit level. The maximum benefits payable on a worker's earnings record is
determined by applying a bend point formula to the PIA similar to that applied to the
AIME in calculating the PIA. For example, the family maximum equals 150 percent of
the first $X of PIA plus 272 percent of the next $Y of the PIA plus 134 percent of the
next $Z of the PIA plus 175 percent of the PIA greater than $X+$Y+$Z. The values X,
Y, and Z are adjusted for each year of the calculation according to the growth in
economy-wide average wages. In case the spousal benefit is eliminated for any reason,
the benefits payable on the insured worker's record are subjected to the family maximum
test again, treating the spouse as though he/she were not eligible for spousal benefits.
This may result in higher benefits for children who may be eligible for dependent benefits
under the worker's record.

Reduction of Spousal Benefits for Age -- Spouses eligible for the spousal benefit may
elect to receive (may become entitled for) their benefits before normal retirement age. In
this case the spousal benefit is reduced by 25/36 of 1 percent for each month of
entitlement prior to normal retirement age. If the number of months of reduction exceeds
36 months (for example, in case of entitlement at age 62 when the normal retirement age
is 67), then the reduction factor is 5/12 of 1 percent for every additional month of early
entitlement.

Earnings Testing and Redefinition of Spousal Benefits -- If a spouse is earning above the
amount allowed by the earnings test, the spousal benefits he or she is eligible to receive
will be earnings tested according to the pre- and post-normal retirement schedule
described above. If a spouse is already collecting retirement benefits, the spousal benefit
is redefined as the greater of the excess of the spousal benefit over the spouse's own
retirement benefit or zero.

Survivor Benefits (Widow(er), Father/Mother, and Children)
Eligibility-- The surviving spouse of a deceased worker is eligible for widow(er) benefits
if the widow(er) is at least age 60, is entitled (has applied for widow[er] benefits), the
worker died fully insured, and the widow(er) was married to the deceased worker for at
least 9 months. The widow(er) of a deceased worker is eligible for father/mother benefits
if the widow(er) is entitled to benefits (has applied), the worker died fully insured, the
widower has in care a child of the worker. A surviving child is eligible for child survivor
benefits on the deceased worker's record if the child is under age 18 and is entitled (an
application has been filed) and the worker was fully insured.

Survivor Benefits-- Monthly benefits equal 100 percent of the worker's PIA for a
widow(er); they equal 75 percent of the PIA for father/mother and child survivor benefits.
Widow(er) and child survivor benefits may be lower only if the family maximum applies.
Widow(er)s may become entitled to (elect to receive) survivor benefits earlier than
normal retirement age, but not earlier than age 60. In this case the reduction is 19/40 of 1
percent for each month of entitlement prior to normal retirement age. After the widow(er)
is 62, he or she is may become entitled to (elect to receive) retirement benefits based on
her own past covered earnings record. In this case the widow(er) benefits are redefined as
the excess over own retirement benefit or zero, whichever is greater. Finally, widow(er)
survivor and own retirement benefits are also subject to the earnings test. If the deceased
worker was already collecting a reduced retirement insurance benefit, the widow(er)'s
benefit cannot be greater than the reduced widow(er) benefit or the greater of 82.5
percent of the worker's PIA or the worker's own retirement benefit. If the deceased
worker was already collecting a retirement insurance benefit greater than the PIA because
of delayed retirement, the widow(er) or is granted the full dollar amount of the delayed
retirement credit over and above the (reduced) widow(er) benefit. Father/mother benefits
are not similarly augmented by delayed retirement credits that the deceased worker may
have been receiving.

Father/Mother Benefits -- These benefits may be reduced if the family maximum applies
or if the father or mother is entitled to the own retirement benefit. In this case the



                                            47
father/mother benefit is redefined as the excess over the father or mother‚Äôs own
retirement benefit or zero, whichever is greater. Father /mother benefits are also subject
to the earnings test. On the other hand, they are not reduced for age. For those eligible to
receive both widow(er) and father/mother benefits, the program calculates both and takes
the larger benefit.

Calculation of a Deceased Worker's PIA -- The calculation of survivor benefits in the
case of a widow(er) benefits uses the larger of two alternative calculation‚Äôs of the
deceased worker's PIA. These are the "wage indexing" method and the "re-indexing"
method. Moreover, the year up to which the worker's wages are indexed may be different
depending upon whether the deceased worker would have become age 62 before or after
the widow(er) attains age 60.

The wage-indexing method -- the last year for indexing earnings is the earlier of a) the
year the worker dies minus 2 years or b) the year worker would have attained age 60.
Bend point formula dollar amounts are taken from the earlier of the year the worker dies
or the year the worker would have attained age 62. The PIA thus calculated is inflated by
the CPI up to the year the widow(er) turns age 60 (if later) to obtain the PIA value on
which widower benefits would be based. Where applicable, these benefits are then
adjusted for the family maximum, reduction for age, delayed retirement credits, and the
earnings test.

The reindexing method -- The worker's original earnings are indexed up to the earlier of
the year the widow(er) attains age 58 or b) the year the worker attains age 60. The
elapsed years are computed as the number of years from 1951 (or the worker's age 22 if
later) through the year the widow(er) attains age 60. The computation years equal elapsed
years minus 5 years (computation years cannot be less than 2). Bend point formula dollar
values are applied from the year the widow(er) attains age 60. There is no subsequent
indexing of the PIA for inflation.

The Sequencing of Widow(er) Benefit Calculations -- Widow(er) benefit reductions
follow these steps: First the widow(er) plus children's benefits are subjected to the family
maximum. Second, the widow(er) benefit is reduced for early entitlement (of the
widow(er) prior to normal retirement age). Third, the widow(er) benefit is compared to
the widow(er) own retirement benefit if entitled to the latter. Fourth, the widow(er)
benefit is redefined as the excess over own benefit if own benefit is positive. Finally the
earnings test is applied, first to the widow(er)'s own benefit and then to the widow(er)
benefit that is in excess of own benefit. If the widow(er) benefit is eliminated as a result
of these tests, the benefits payable on the insured worker's record are subjected to the
family maximum test again, treating the widow(er) as though he/she were not eligible for
the widow(er) benefit. This procedure can potentially increase children's benefits if the
family maximum limit was binding the first time through.
