Fiscal Space and the Aftermath of Financial Crises: How It Matters and Why

                                         ABSTRACT

In OECD countries over the period 1980–2017, countries with lower debt-to-GDP ratios
responded to financial distress with much more expansionary fiscal policy and suffered much less
severe aftermaths. Two lines of evidence together suggest that the relationship between the debt
ratio and the policy response is driven partly by problems with sovereign market access, but even
more so by the choices of domestic and international policymakers. First, although there is some
relationship between more direct measures of market access and the fiscal response to distress,
incorporating the direct measures attenuates the link between the debt ratio and the policy
response only slightly. Second, contemporaneous accounts of the policymaking process in
episodes of major financial distress show a number of cases where shifts to austerity were driven
by problems with market access, but at least as many where the shifts resulted from
policymakers’ choices despite an absence of difficulties with market access. These results may
have implications for the conduct of policy both in normal times and in the wake of a financial
crisis.

      There is enormous variation in macroeconomic performance in the aftermath of financial

crises. Recent research finds that the amount of fiscal space countries have before a crisis—that

is, the room policymakers have to take action—appears to be an important source of this

variation. Countries with low debt-to-GDP ratios when a crisis strikes typically face only modest

downturns, while countries with high debt ratios generally suffer large and long-lasting output

losses (Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor 2016; Romer and Romer 2018). The apparent mechanism

behind this correlation is the obvious one: countries that begin a crisis with ample fiscal space

take much more aggressive fiscal action. This includes both financial rescue—bank bailouts, loan

and deposit guarantees, and recapitalization of financial institutions—and conventional fiscal

stimulus—tax cuts and spending increases (Romer and Romer 2018).

      Our primary goal in this paper is to understand why a country’s fiscal response to a crisis

depends on it prior debt-to-GDP ratio. One possibility is that it reflects constraints imposed by

market access. Countries with a higher debt ratio may be less able to take aggressive fiscal action

or must move more quickly to austerity than lower-debt countries because investors push

sovereign yields to prohibitive levels or refuse to lend to them entirely. Alternatively, the link

between the fiscal response to a crisis and a country’s debt-to-GDP ratio may reflect choices by

the country or international organizations. For example, policymakers’ ideas may lead them to

tighten fiscal policy after a crisis if the debt ratio is high, but not otherwise. Likewise, the views

of international organizations such as the European Union (EU) or the International Monetary

Fund (IMF) may be tied to the debt ratio, and may drive fiscal policy after a crisis either

indirectly (say, through standing EU rules) or directly (through bailout conditionality).

      We investigate this issue using both statistical and narrative evidence for thirty

Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) countries for the period

since 1980. Our finding is that both market access and policymakers’ choices played important

roles in the fiscal response to crises over the past 40 years, but choices were somewhat more

central.
                                                                                               2


      A crucial input into our analysis is the indicator of financial distress derived from

narrative documents for 24 OECD countries described in Romer and Romer (2017). We extend

the indicator through 2017 and incorporate the six additional countries that entered the OECD

between 1973 and 2000. We thereby increase the number of observations covered by our

measure by more than 20 percent, and the number where our measure shows positive levels of

distress by 50 percent. In addition, the inclusion of countries such as Mexico, South Korea, and

Hungary allows us to see if less advanced economies fare differently following crises than more

mature ones. Extending the series through 2017 enables a much more complete analysis of the

aftermath of the global financial crisis than was possible in our previous study (which ended in

2012). For the most part, we find that the extended series yields results similar to those in our

previous paper. The average aftermath of a crisis remains negative, highly persistent, and of

moderate severity. Contrary to what one might expect, the aftermath of crises is somewhat less

severe on average in less advanced economies. Consistent with our previous study, we also find

that there is tremendous variation in the aftermaths of crises. Indeed, if anything, including a

wider range of countries and more years following the 2008 global financial crisis makes the

variation even starker.

      To document the importance of fiscal space for the aftermath of crises and the fiscal

response, we run panel regressions of output and the high-employment surplus at various

horizons after time t on financial distress at t, including an interaction between distress and

prior debt-to-GDP ratio. The interaction term is consistently highly significant and of the

expected sign: high-debt countries have larger output losses following a crisis and undertake

fiscal contraction rather than expansion. The extensive literature on the impact of tax changes

and government spending on output suggests there is a likely causal relationship between these

two developments. Likewise, focusing on the 22 episodes of high financial distress in our sample

confirms a strong correlation between the size of the fiscal expansion following a crisis and the

prior debt-to-GDP ratio.
                                                                                                    3


      The possibility that the debt ratio matters for the fiscal response to crises because it affects

sovereign market access (or because it proxies for market access) can be investigated

empirically. Interest rates on government debt, sovereign CDS spreads, and credit-agency

ratings are all direct indicators of market access. Likewise, being subject to an IMF or other

bailout program likely reflects severe problems with obtaining sovereign funding in private

markets. If a country’s debt-to-GDP ratio affects the fiscal response to a crisis through market

constraints, including such direct measures of market access (interacted with financial distress)

in the panel regressions should greatly weaken or eliminate the predictive power of debt for the

fiscal response. It does not. While some of the direct measures of market access do seem to

affect the fiscal response to a crisis, the effects are generally moderate and only marginally

significant. The interaction effect with the debt ratio, on the other hand, remains significant and

quantitatively important when the direct measures of market access are included. That is,

countries with little fiscal space as measured by their debt-to-GDP ratio undertake less fiscal

expansion following a crisis than their lower-debt counterparts, even controlling for the interest

rates on their debt and other obvious indicators of market access. This supports the view that

choices play an important role in countries’ fiscal decisions around crises.

      More evidence on the nature and determinants of the fiscal response to crises can be

obtained from narrative sources. In particular, we read the Country Reports of the Economist

Intelligence Unit (EIU) for the four years following the start of high financial distress in the 22

crisis episodes in our sample. The EIU reports provide a blend of political and policy

information that is particularly useful for deducing the motivation for fiscal actions around

financial crises. A systematic reading of the reports shows that in some cases, problems with

market access unquestionably led to fiscal contraction despite severe post-crisis recessions. This

is the case, for example, in Spain and Italy following the 2008 global financial crisis. Sometimes

severe market access problems led to an international bailout, where fiscal policy in the affected

countries was then driven partly by the views of the rescue organizations; this was the case, for
                                                                                                 4


example, with Mexico following its crisis in the mid-1990s and with Portugal and Greece

following the global financial crisis. In many other cases, however, the EIU suggests that the

fiscal response to a crisis was driven by the choices of domestic policymakers, and, in the case of

some EU countries, by EU rules and ideas. This is always true of post-crisis fiscal expansions,

which are inherently discretionary. But choices were also often central to post-crisis austerity,

such as in the United Kingdom and Austria following the global financial crisis. Indeed, in

roughly half the cases of post-crisis fiscal austerity, the EIU indicates that policymakers’ ideas

were more important than market access. The EIU Country Reports also provide substantial

narrative evidence that both market access and policymaker choices were related to the debt-to-

GDP ratio.

      Our analysis of the role of fiscal space in the aftermath of financial crises is organized as

follows. Section I discusses the extension of our narrative measure of financial distress, and

revisits our basic findings about the average aftermath of a financial crisis and the variation in

outcomes. Section II presents statistical results on the role of the debt-to-GDP ratio in

explaining the variation in the aftermath of crises. Section III discusses quantitative evidence on

whether the debt-to-GDP ratio matters for the fiscal response to crises because it works through

or proxies for market access. Section IV provides narrative evidence on the determinants of the

fiscal response following a financial crisis. Finally, Section V discusses our conclusions and the

potential implications of our findings for economic policy.

      Our study builds on several lines of work. First, it is obviously related to the large, but

differently focused, literature on the aftermath of financial crises (for example, Bordo et al.

2001; Reinhart and Rogoff 2009; Romer and Romer 2017; and Baron, Verner, and Xiong 2018).

Second, Bohn (1998), Mendoza and Ostry (2008), Ghosh et al. (2013), and others investigate

how the conduct of fiscal policy varies with the debt-to-GDP ratio. These papers, however, do

not address either how the debt ratio affects the policy response to financial crises or the

mechanisms through which the debt ratio affects the conduct of policy. Third, work defining and
                                                                                                        5


measuring fiscal space (for example, Ghosh et al. 2013 and Kose et al. 2017) is also somewhat

relevant to the issues we study. Relatedly, Obstfeld (2013), Elmendorf (2016), and other

observers argue that having greater fiscal space can be very valuable in the event of a financial

crisis. Our analysis lends strong support to that view.

      Our work is clearly also related to the voluminous literature on the output effects of fiscal

policy (see Ramey 2016 for a recent survey). The subset of this literature that examines whether

fiscal multipliers are larger when the debt-to-GDP ratio is lower (for example, Perotti 1999 and

Ilzetzki, Mendoza, and Végh 2013) is closer to the issues we address. However, our finding that

the fiscal policy response to financial crises is expansionary at low debt ratios and

contractionary at high debt ratios means that the mechanism through which debt affects

outcomes in our analysis is different than in those papers.

      Finally, the two papers most closely related to our contribution are those by Jordà,

Schularick, and Taylor (2016) and Romer and Romer (2018). Both find that the aftermaths of

financial crises are far worse in countries with high levels of government debt, and Romer and

Romer (2018) find that a likely mechanism behind this link is that the policy response is far

more contractionary in high-debt countries. 1 One contribution of this paper is to extend and

amplify these findings. But our main focus, which these papers do not address, is on the reasons

for the dependence of the policy response on the level of debt.



I. PRELIMINARIES

      In order to analyze the aftermath of financial crises, one needs a reliable indicator of when

crises occurred in various countries. We use the scaled index of financial distress in OECD

countries derived from narrative records described in Romer and Romer (2017). For this paper,


1 Bernardini and Forni (2018) extend this analysis to consider both the level of government debt and its

rate of change. They find that when both variables are unusually high prior to a recession that is
associated with a financial crisis, the recession is unusually severe and real per capita government
spending falls rather than rises. They also show that reliance on IMF credit rises more than usual in such
cases, which is suggestive of problems with market access.
                                                                                                 6


we extend the index through 2017 and incorporate six additional countries. This section

describes the extension and briefly discusses its impact on some of our previous results.


A. Extending the Measure of Financial Distress

      Our measure of financial distress has three defining characteristics. One is that it is

derived from contemporaneous narrative sources. In particular, it is based on the OECD

Economic Outlook, a semiannual review of economic and financial conditions in each OECD

country. Since the Economic Outlook is available beginning in 1967, our series on financial

distress also begins then. There are two observations per year (corresponding to the two issues

of the Economic Outlook), dated approximately June and December.

      Second, we take as our definition of financial distress Bernanke’s (1983) concept of a rise

in the cost of credit intermediation: something makes it more costly for financial institutions to

supply credit at a given level of the safe interest rate. It could be an increased external cost of

funds due to a widespread loss of confidence; increased costs of monitoring borrowers; or an

increased internal cost of funds because of rising loan defaults.

      Third, we scale financial distress along a continuum. This reflects the reality that, like

most things, financial distress is not a 0-1 variable. To do this, we define our measure from 0 (no

distress) to 15 (extreme crisis; widespread chaos and paralysis in the financial system). Values of

7 and above roughly correspond to what the IMF and other chronologies would identify as a

systemic financial crisis (Laeven and Valencia 2014). In our analysis, we therefore often pay

particular attention to episodes where distress reached 7 or more.

      To construct our measure, we specify detailed criteria for translating OECD analysts’

words into our numerical scale. Since the OECD does not typically talk in terms of the cost of

credit intermediation, this involves looking for sensible proxies in the narrative accounts. Does

the Economic Outlook discuss funding difficulties for banks, a breakdown in intermediation, or

creditworthy borrowers having difficulty getting loans? Does it describe the problems as
                                                                                                      7


relatively minor (or perhaps affecting just a small sector of the economy), or severe and

widespread? Does it believe that troubles in the banking system are just a risk to the forecast, or

central to the outlook? In Romer and Romer (2017, online Appendix A), we describe the criteria

for different levels of distress in detail, and provide a summary of the reasoning (and the related

quotations from the OECD Economic Outlook) for the observations we scale greater than zero.

      Our original index covered the period 1967 to 2012. We also limited our analysis to the 24

countries in the OECD as of 1973. For this paper, we continue the narrative analysis through

2017. We also add the six countries that entered the OECD between 1973 and 2000: the Czech

Republic, Hungary, Korea, Mexico, Poland, and the Slovak Republic.

      We use the same criteria and approach as we did for the original study. The one difference

is that previously we used key word searches (for terms such as crisis or bank) to narrow down

the number of country entries we needed to read word for word. Because most countries were

still recovering from the global financial crisis between 2012 and 2017, we found it simpler to

just read every entry in this period. Likewise, for the added countries, we felt it prudent to read

all of their entries in the Economic Outlook because some (particularly the former communist

countries) only gradually developed the market-based financial systems that fit into our

classification system. For these countries, we do not define our measure of financial distress

until the descriptions in the Economic Outlook make clear that the financial system was largely

privatized, and that credit availability was therefore mainly determined by market forces. 2

      Table 1 shows the non-zero values of our measure of financial distress for all 30 countries

for the period 2013:1 to 2017:2. It also shows all of the non-zero values for the six added

countries for all years that information is available. Online Appendix A contains our reasoning

for all of the observations added to the sample that we classify as having a positive level of

2 The starting dates for our measure for these countries are 2003:2 for the Czech Republic (which joined
the OECD in December 1995 and first appeared in the 1996:2 issue of the Economic Outlook); 1998:1 for
Hungary (May 1996 and 1996:1); 1998:1 for Poland (November 1996 and 1996:2); and 2003:2 for the
Slovak Republic (December 2000 and 2000:2). For Korea and Mexico, we define our measure starting
when they first appeared in the Economic Outlook (1996:2 for Korea and 1994:1 for Mexico). Online
Appendix A discusses the narrative evidence for the appropriate start date for the added countries.
                                                                                                 8


financial distress. The inclusion of five more years and six additional countries increases the

number of observations covered by our measure by 21 percent. However, because there was

almost no financial distress in the first two decades of our sample, the amount of distress

covered by the measure increases by much more: the number of observations where our

measure is strictly positive rises by 50 percent.

      Figure 1 shows the expanded measure of financial distress for the 30 countries for 1980–

2017, which is the period we focus on in this paper. Panel (a) shows the measure from the start

of the period through 2005, when financial distress never affected more than a few countries

simultaneously. Panel (b) shows the series for 2006 through the end of the sample, when every

country in our sample experienced at least some distress. Relative to our previous sample, there

are now two additional episodes of high distress in the 1990s, one in Mexico and one in South

Korea. Expanding the sample of countries and going through 2017 also provides a more

complete picture of the global financial crisis. Panel (b) of the figure shows that there is

tremendous variation in how quickly financial distress faded following 2008. Some countries

where the crisis was initially very severe, such as the United States and the United Kingdom,

were largely free of distress within a few years. On the other hand, Greece, Ireland, Italy, and

Portugal still had some financial distress at the end of 2017. Furthermore, while all of the added

countries experienced some distress following 2008, only Hungary experienced distress of 7 or

above on our scale (a lower-level moderate crisis).


B. The Average Aftermath of Financial Crises

      Since we have expanded the sample substantially, a useful first step is to see if using the

new sample alters our original findings on the average aftermath of financial crises. To

investigate the average aftermath, we estimate the following Jordà local projection panel

regression:

(1)               𝑦𝑗,𝑡+ℎ = 𝛼𝑗ℎ + 𝛾𝑡ℎ + 𝛽 ℎ 𝐹𝑗,𝑡 + ∑4𝑘=1 𝜑𝑘ℎ 𝐹𝑗,𝑡−𝑘 + ∑4𝑘=1 𝜃𝑘ℎ 𝑦𝑗,𝑡−𝑘 + 𝑒𝑗,𝑡
                                                                                         ℎ
                                                                                             ,
                                                                                                          9


where the j subscripts index countries, the t subscripts index time, and the h subscripts and

superscripts denote the horizon (half-years after time t). yj,t+h is the logarithm of real GDP in

country j at time t+h. Fj,t is the financial distress variable for country j at time t. The α’s are

country fixed effects and the γ’s are time fixed effects. We include four lags of both output and

distress to account for the usual dynamics of these series.

      We estimate (1) separately for horizons 0 to 10 (that is, up through five years after time t).

The sequence of β h ’s from these eleven regressions provides a nonparametric estimate of the

impulse response function of output to an innovation in financial distress of one step. To get a

sense of the aftermath of a “crisis,” we multiply the point estimates by 7, which is the number on

our scale corresponding to the start of the “moderate crisis” category. Importantly, the

specification includes as part of the average aftermath of distress any contemporaneous

relationship between output and distress. Because distress is almost surely at least somewhat

endogenous, the estimated impulse response function should thus be viewed as an upper bound

of any causal effect of distress on economic activity. 3 The GDP data are from the OECD. 4 For

consistency with our subsequent empirical work, which uses fiscal data that only begin in 1980,

we restrict all of the data used in the estimation to the period 1980–2017.

      Panel (a) of Figure 2 shows the estimated impulse response function (along with the two-

standard-error confidence bands) using our full set of 30 OECD countries. The figure also shows

the results for our original sample of 24 countries. For the full sample of countries, the



3 Romer and Romer (2017) provide an extensive discussion of causation and timing. We find that
excluding the contemporaneous relationship between output and financial distress reduces the negative
aftermath of crisis by nearly half. This suggests that endogeneity issues are indeed important, and that the
true causal impact of financial distress is substantially smaller than the aftermath as estimated in
equation (1). Unfortunately, our narrative source is not adequate for identifying genuinely exogenous
episodes of financial distress or determining if such episodes even exist in the postwar period.
4 https://stats.oecd.org, downloaded 11/11/2018. The data are from the Quarterly National Accounts

Dataset, series VPVOBARSA. GDP data are missing for a few countries in certain years. Because the
financial distress variable is semiannual (corresponding to June and December), we convert the GDP data
to semiannual as well (using the observations for the second and fourth quarters of each year). Ireland’s
GDP jumped more than 20 percent in 2015Q1, due largely to the relocation of many companies’
intellectual property to Ireland. Because this is such an extreme observation and is unrelated to the
normal determinants of output movements, we do not use Irish data after 2014Q4.
                                                                                                          10


aftermath of a realization of financial distress of a 7 on our scale is a substantial and persistent

decline in real GDP. The peak fall in output following a crisis is a decline of just over 4%, and is

highly significant (t = −4.1). 5

      This estimated aftermath is noticeably less severe than we found in Romer and Romer

(2017), which was a decline of 6.0%. 6 There are three changes in the estimation relative to the

previous paper: a larger sample of countries; a different time period (the original time period

was 1967–2012); and revisions to the GDP data. Figure 2a shows that considering only the

original sample of 24 countries (but for the 1980–2017 time period) results in a decline in GDP

following a crisis of 5.2% (t = −3.7). Thus, the new sample of countries is an important source of

the difference between the new estimates and the original ones.

      Because the added countries are at the lower end of the spectrum of per capita GDP, it is

useful to consider where there are systematic differences in the aftermath of financial crises

between richer and poorer countries. Since Greece is an influential observation in whatever

sample it is in, it is natural to use it as the dividing line between richer and poorer countries, and

to leave it out of either sample. To classify countries, we therefore compare their per capita GDP

in 1992 (the first year for which there is annual data on GDP per capita for all thirty countries) to

that of Greece. 7 Eight countries had a lower GDP per capita than Greece: the Czech Republic,

Hungary, Korea, Mexico, Poland, Portugal, the Slovak Republic, and Turkey.

      Panel (b) of Figure 2 shows the estimated impulse response functions for richer and


5  Throughout, we report results based on heteroskedasticity-corrected standard errors, which are
generally considerably larger than the conventional standard errors from our regressions. We have also
examined various ways of correcting the standard errors for serial correlation (Newey-West and Hansen-
Hodrick standard errors and clustering by country), as well as clustering by time period. However,
because of the inclusion of lags in our regressions, we are focusing on responses to innovations in our
variables (in this case, financial distress), which are by construction roughly serially uncorrelated. As a
result, one would not expect serial correlation of the residuals to cause important bias in the standard
errors. And indeed, the various alternatives do not change the standard errors systematically relative to
the heteroskedasticity-corrected ones.
6 As in Romer and Romer (2017), if we exclude the contemporaneous relationship between output and

financial distress in the estimated aftermath, the average aftermath of a crisis is substantially less severe
than the baseline estimates. Using the expanded sample considered in this paper, the peak fall in output is
just over 2% (t = −1.8).

poorer countries. Both types of countries have a smaller negative aftermath of crises than the

full sample, consistent with the notion that Greece’s terrible downturn following the global

financial crisis pulls down the average aftermath in the full sample noticeably. 8 The point

estimates for the two types of countries, however, are quite different. The aftermath of crises is

more negative and more persistent in richer countries than in poorer ones. Indeed, for poorer

countries, the negative aftermath is completely undone within five years of the crisis, whereas

for richer countries it is not undone at all. Not surprisingly, given the smaller sample, the two-

standard-error bands are very wide for the poorer country sample. Nevertheless, the finding that

the negative aftermath of crises appears milder in less advanced countries goes against the

common view that crises are more devastating in developing economies.


C. Variation in Aftermaths

      The variation in aftermaths following a crisis between richer and poorer countries is

consistent with the finding in Romer and Romer (2017) that there is, in general, substantial

variation in aftermaths across crisis episodes. One way to show this variation is to focus on the

22 episodes of high financial distress (which we define as a reading of 7 or greater on our scale of

0 to 15) in our sample. We consider forecasts of real GDP in each episode based on the estimates

of equation (1). In forming the forecasts, we use the realization of the distress variable up

through the half-year that it reaches 7 or higher, and actual GDP up through one half-year

before that occurs. We then calculate forecast residuals as actual GDP minus the forecast, so

negative residuals correspond to actual GDP being lower than the forecast.

      Because we include actual distress up through the start of the forecast, the forecasts take

into account that these are all crisis episodes. As a result, the forecast errors are approximately

8 While it does not make sense to ignore the evidence from Greece’s experience following the global
financial crisis entirely, the fall in its output was so extreme that it natural to wonder if Greece could be
driving our results. We have therefore re-estimated all of our key equations excluding Greece from the
sample. The general pattern is that dropping Greece weakens the results somewhat, but does not change
them qualitatively. Perhaps the most interesting exception is that in some of the regressions in Section III,
excluding Greece actually slightly strengthens the relationship between direct measures of market access
and the fiscal policy response to financial distress.

mean zero across episodes. Nevertheless, there is substantial variation in the errors across the

episodes. 9 This variation is the result of differences both in how financial distress itself evolves

in each episode, and in how GDP responds to a given level of distress.

      Figure 3 shows the forecast errors in the various episodes. We divide them into the cases

with very small negative or positive forecast errors and those with substantial negative forecast

errors. Even within these two groups, there is a wide range of outcomes. Among the episodes of

relatively small or positive forecast errors shown in panel (a), there are cases like Sweden

following its 1993 crisis, where the forecast errors are small and negative in the immediate

aftermath, but small and positive thereafter. On the other hand, Mexico (following its 1996

crisis), Norway (following its 1991 crisis), and Finland (following its 1993 crisis) all experienced

actual growth much higher than the forecast during almost all of the five years following the

start of high distress.

      There is even greater variation in aftermaths among the episodes of substantial negative

forecast errors shown in panel (b) of Figure 3. Greece following its crisis in 2009:1 experienced

GDP declines far worse and more persistent than those predicted using equation (1). Likewise,

Spain, Portugal, and Italy (following the global financial crisis) and Japan (following its 1997

crisis) experienced severe and persistent negative forecast errors. Two of the poorer countries in

this group (Turkey following its 2001 crisis and Hungary following its 2009 crisis) show another

interesting pattern. There is a short-run drop in output greater than the forecast (in the case of

Turkey, dramatically greater), but then substantial recovery. Indeed, after its catastrophic initial

decline, Turkey experienced growth almost equally dramatically above the forecast.



II. THE IMPORTANCE OF FISCAL SPACE

      The evidence in the preceding section shows that while the aftermath of financial crises is

in general quite negative, there is tremendous variation in the severity and persistence of the

9In this exercise, South Korea is excluded. Its crisis in 1997 occurred just a year after South Korea entered
the OECD. As a result, it lacks the four lags of the distress variable needed to construct the forecast.

output declines following high financial distress. We turn now to the role that fiscal space plays

in explaining this variation. The analysis in this section largely extends some of the findings in

Romer and Romer (2018) using our larger number of countries and longer time period. Sections

III and IV consider the issue of why space matters.


A. Definition of Fiscal Space

      We think of fiscal space as the room a country has to use fiscal policy to stimulate the

economy or to undertake a bailout and recapitalization of its financial sector. For our analysis,

we define fiscal space as the negative of the ratio of gross government debt to GDP. Thus, it is a

continuous measure, with fiscal space declining linearly with the debt-to-GDP ratio.

      There are obviously many other ways to define fiscal space. For example, in Romer and

Romer (2018), we consider using net debt in place of gross debt, and investigate replacing the

linear specification with more complicated threshold-type formulations. 10 Later in this section,

we consider whether the prior budget surplus might be an added component of fiscal space.

And, in Section III, we explore whether more direct indicators of sovereign market access

dominate the gross debt-to-GDP ratio in determining the post-crisis behavior of fiscal policy.

But, a country’s gross debt load is a fundamental and intuitive way to conceptualize fiscal space.

      A virtue of the (negative of the) debt-t0-GDP ratio as the measure of fiscal space is that it

is determined in large part by past policy decisions and more long-run features of a country’s

policymaking process. It captures the fact that some countries (like Greece and Italy) perennially

run deficits, while others (like South Korea and Germany) typically pursue balanced budgets. It

obviously also responds somewhat to movements in output and fiscal policy around financial

crises, but it is typically slower-moving and less cyclically-sensitive than indicators like the

budget surplus or interest rates. To further strengthen the exogeneity of the debt-to-GDP ratio

to policy decisions around crises, in the regressions that follow we always use the ratio at the


10We find that these variations have little effect on our estimates of the role of fiscal space, and so do not
repeat them in this study.
                                                                                                             14


end of the previous calendar year. 11

      Fiscal data are generally not available on a comparable basis for a wide range of countries

before 1980. As a result, our analysis focuses on the period 1980–2017. Data on gross

government debt for our sample of countries for most of the period starting in 1980 are available

from the IMF World Economic Outlook (WEO) database. 12 When values going all the way back

to 1980 are not available from the IMF, we extend the series back using data from the OECD

when possible. 13 The resulting debt series covers 95 percent of the observations since 1980 for

which our measure of financial distress is available.


B. Fiscal Space and the Response of GDP to Financial Distress

      To see if fiscal space explains some of the variation in the aftermath of financial crises, we

augment equation (1) to include an interaction term between financial distress and the negative

of the debt-to-GDP ratio at the end of the previous year. The coefficients on this interaction term

measure how the response of output to distress varies with fiscal space. In addition to the

interaction term, we also include (the negative of) the debt ratio alone, again as of the end of the

previous year. Thus, we estimate:

(2)                          𝑦𝑗,𝑡+ℎ = 𝛼𝑗ℎ + 𝛾𝑡ℎ + 𝜗 ℎ 𝑆𝑗,𝑡 + 𝛽 ℎ 𝐹𝑗,𝑡 + 𝛿 ℎ (𝐹𝑗,𝑡 ∙ 𝑆𝑗,𝑡 )
                                                                                                     ℎ
          + ∑4𝑘=1 𝜌𝑘ℎ 𝑆𝑗,𝑡−𝑘 + ∑4𝑘=1 𝜑𝑘ℎ 𝐹𝑗,𝑡−𝑘 + ∑4𝑘=1 𝜔𝑘ℎ (𝐹𝑗,𝑡−𝑘 ∙ 𝑆𝑗,𝑡−𝑘 ) + ∑4𝑘=1 𝜃𝑘ℎ 𝑦𝑗,𝑡−𝑘 + 𝑒𝑗,𝑡 ,


where 𝑆𝑗,𝑡 is our measure of fiscal space in country j in half-year t, and all other variables are as

before. We again estimate the relationship for the horizons h = 0 to 10.


11 The reason for using the debt-to-GDP ratio at the end of the previous year is that the debt-to-GDP ratio
data are annual, end-of-year values. Thus we use the debt ratio at the end period t – 1 when period t
corresponds to the first half of the year, and the ratio at the end of period t – 2 when period t corresponds
to the second half of the year.
12 We use the data from the October 2018 edition of the database,

https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2018/02/weodata/index.aspx, downloaded 11/11/2018.
13 The OECD data are available from https://stats.oecd.org/, downloaded 11/11/2018. For a few countries,

gross debt data for early years of the sample are available in earlier published editions of the OECD
Economic Outlook, but not from the OECD website. In such cases, we use those data (specifically, data
from the December 2002 and December 1996 editions of the Economic Outlook). We join the series using
splices in levels, working backward in time through the various sources.
                                                                                                  15


      Figure 4a shows the estimated coefficient on the interaction term (𝛿 ℎ ) at the various

horizons, together with the two-standard-error bands. To make it easier to interpret the

coefficients, we multiply them by a realization of the interaction term of twice the standard

deviation of the gross debt-to-GDP ratio in our sample (which is roughly 35 percentage points),

times 7. The factor of 7 accounts for the fact that we are interested in the impact of a fairly

substantial rise in financial distress (a crisis of some sort). Thus the reported numbers can be

interpreted as how the behavior of output following a financial crisis varies with a two-standard

deviation increase in fiscal space.

      The figure shows that the scaled coefficient on the interaction term is positive at all

horizons and statistically significant after horizon 1 (with a maximum t-statistic over 3). The fact

that the coefficients are positive means that the fall in GDP following a crisis is smaller when the

negative of the debt-to-GDP ratio is less negative—that is, when there is more fiscal space.

      Figure 4b presents another way of visualizing the implications of the estimates for the

importance of fiscal space. It shows the impulse response function of GDP based on equation (2)

to an innovation in financial distress of 7 including both the direct effect of distress (the 𝛽 ℎ ’s)

and the interaction effect (the 𝛿 ℎ ’s) for two cases: when the debt-to-GDP ratio is one standard

deviation above the sample mean (“less fiscal space”), and when it is one standard deviation

below the sample mean (“more fiscal space”). These correspond to debt ratios of roughly 25 and

95 percent.

      Figure 4b shows that the aftermath of a financial crisis is dramatically different in the two

cases. GDP typically falls about 7 percent following a realization of 7 on our scale of financial

distress when the debt-to-GDP ratio is one standard deviation above the mean, but by less than

1 percent when the debt ratio is one standard deviation below the mean. While these two cases

represent a sizeable difference in the debt ratio, the difference is by no means extreme. And,

because space is assumed to decline linearly with the debt-to-GDP ratio, a smaller or larger

difference would imply a proportionally smaller or larger estimated difference in the aftermath
                                                                                                                 16


of a crisis.

       The two cases presented in panel (b) explain the logic in the construction of panel (a) of

multiplying the estimated interaction term by twice the sample standard deviation of the debt

ratio, and then by 7. By doing this, we show precisely the difference in the impulse response

functions of output to a financial crisis (defined as an innovation of 7 in our measure) between

the cases of more and less fiscal space. That is, panel (a) shows the difference between the two

impulse responses functions presented in panel (b), together with the two-standard-error bands.


C. Fiscal Space and the Response of Fiscal Policy to Financial Distress

       The most obvious mechanism by which fiscal space could affect the aftermath of crises is

by enabling or limiting fiscal stimulus and financial rescue. It is therefore natural to examine

how the behavior of fiscal policy following crises varies with fiscal space.

      To do this, we run interaction regressions like those for GDP, but using a measure of the

change in the high-employment surplus as the dependent variable. Official estimates of the

high-employment surplus are available on a consistent basis for a large number of countries in

our sample only for relatively recent years. For this reason, we consider an approximation. For

each horizon (h) that we consider, we use as the left-hand side variable the change in the actual

budget surplus (as a share of GDP) from t – 1 to t + h, minus the percent change in real GDP

times an estimate of the cyclical sensitivity of the surplus to GDP. That is, we estimate

(3)      �𝐵𝑗,𝑡+ℎ − 𝐵𝑗,𝑡−1 � − 𝜏 ∙ (𝑦𝑗,𝑡+ℎ − 𝑦𝑗,𝑡−1 ) = 𝛼𝑗ℎ + 𝛾𝑡ℎ + 𝜗 ℎ 𝑆𝑗,𝑡 + 𝛽 ℎ 𝐹𝑗,𝑡 + 𝛿 ℎ (𝐹𝑗,𝑡 ∙ 𝑆𝑗,𝑡 )
                                                                                                              ℎ
 + ∑4𝑘=1 𝜌𝑘ℎ 𝑆𝑗,𝑡−𝑘 + ∑4𝑘=1 𝜑𝑘ℎ 𝐹𝑗,𝑡−𝑘 + ∑4𝑘=1 𝜔𝑘ℎ (𝐹𝑗,𝑡−𝑘 ∙ 𝑆𝑗,𝑡−𝑘 ) + ∑4𝑘=1 𝜃𝑘ℎ (∆𝐵𝑗,𝑡−𝑘 − 𝜏 ∙ ∆𝑦𝑗,𝑡−𝑘 ) + 𝑒𝑗,𝑡 ,


where 𝐵𝑗,𝑡 is the budget surplus as a share of GDP in country j in period t, and τ is the assumed

sensitivity of the budget surplus to real activity. We estimate (3) for horizons h = 0 to 10.

       This specification omits the growth of potential output. That is, it leaves out a 𝜏 ∙ (𝑦�𝑗,𝑡+ℎ −

𝑦�𝑗,𝑡−1 ) term in the calculation of the change in the high-employment surplus, where 𝑦� is

potential output. If trend growth in each country is constant over our sample period, however,
                                                                                                       17


that term will be captured by the country fixed effects (the 𝛼𝑗ℎ ’s). Thus, this method of estimating

the change in the high-employment surplus makes sense as long as trend or potential growth for

each country does not change greatly over our sample period. Based on the evidence in Girouard

and André (2005), a reasonable estimate of τ for OECD countries is 0.4. Finally, note that since

we consider the change in the high-employment surplus over progressively longer horizons, the

estimates from (3) inherently show how the cumulative response of the high-employment

surplus depends on financial distress and its interaction with fiscal space. 14

      We obtain data on the budget surplus from the same sources as our data on the debt-to-

GDP ratio. Specifically, the data are from the IMF WEO database when available, supplemented

with data from the OECD when those go back further. 15 The resulting series covers 97 percent of

the observations since 1980 for which our measure of financial distress is available.

      The results are shown in Figure 5. Panel (a) shows the estimates of the 𝛿 ℎ ’s, the

coefficients on the interaction term. We again multiply the estimates by 7 and by two times the

standard deviation of the debt-to-GDP ratio to aid interpretation. The estimates are negative

and highly statistically significant. The fact that the estimates are negative means that countries

with lower debt ratios (and so with more fiscal space) respond to financial distress with lower

(or more negative) high-employment surpluses. That is, they run more expansionary fiscal

policy.

      Panel (b) shows the implications of the estimates for the behavior of the high-employment

surplus following an innovation of 7 in the new measure of financial distress including both the

direct impact of distress and the interaction term. We again consider the cases where the debt-

14 We also examine the effects of allowing τ to vary across countries using the estimates from Girouard

and André (2005, Table 9). Because Girouard and André do not report τ’s for Mexico and Turkey, we are
forced to drop these two countries from our sample. In all cases, the results are extremely similar to our
baseline ones for the same sample, although they are typically very slightly stronger.
15 All data were downloaded 11/11/2018, and the data from earlier published versions of the OECD

Economic Outlook are again from the December 2002 and December 1996 editions. For the IMF data, we
use the series “General government net lending/borrowing,” and for the Economic Outlook, we use the
series “Financial balance.” We again join the various series using splices in levels, working backward in
time through the sources. One small difference from our series for the debt-to-GDP ratio is that we do not
use any current OECD data from https://stats.oecd.org/.
                                                                                                   18


to-GDP ratio is one standard deviation below its mean (“more fiscal space”) and where it is one

standard deviation above the mean (“less fiscal space”). The figure shows just how important the

interaction with fiscal space is. A country facing high financial distress with a debt-to-GDP ratio

one standard deviation below the mean cuts its high-employment surplus by 2 to 3 percent of

GDP; a country facing high distress with a debt ratio one standard deviation above the mean

runs contractionary fiscal policy, with its high-employment surplus rising by 3 percent of GDP.

      Given that both GDP and the high-employment surplus following crises vary strongly with

the prior debt-to-GDP ratio, it is natural to think that there is a link between the two. A large

literature finds that changes in taxes and government spending have powerful effects on real

output (for example, Fisher and Peters 2010; Romer and Romer 2010; Ramey 2011; and

Guajardo, Leigh, and Pescatori 2014). 16 Thus, it is highly likely that output declines following

crises are larger when a country faces a crisis with high debt because low-debt countries use

fiscal policy aggressively to mitigate the impact of the crisis and rescue the financial system,

while high-debt countries pursue contractionary fiscal policy.


D. The Role of the Prior Budget Surplus

      Another variable that may affect a country’s ability or willingness to use expansionary

fiscal policy in response to financial distress is the level of its budget surplus before the distress

occurs. For a given degree of fiscal expansion, the resulting deficit will be larger when the prior

surplus is smaller. To the extent a larger deficit increases difficulties with market access or

makes policymakers want to pursue less expansionary policy, a smaller prior surplus could

therefore lead to a less expansionary response to distress.




16 Another large literature uses cross-section data to investigate the impact of changes in government
spending on output and employment (for example, Nakamura and Steinsson 2014, Chodorow-Reich et al.
2010, and Suárez Serrato and Wingender 2016). These cross-section studies typically find a fiscal
multiplier of around 1.5. Chodorow-Reich (forthcoming) argues that the cross-section multiplier is an
approximate lower bound on the aggregate multiplier for cases where monetary policy does not respond
to fiscal policy (which applies to many of the crises in our sample).
                                                                                                         19


      To investigate this issue, we estimate variants of equation (3) using the surplus as a share

of GDP in the previous year in place of, or in addition to, the (negative of the) previous year’s

debt-to-GDP ratio. 17 The results show a strong relationship between the prior surplus and the

fiscal policy response to financial distress. When we use the prior surplus in place of the

(negative) debt ratio, it is highly significant and quantitatively important. The t-statistic on the

interaction term between distress and the previous year’s surplus ranges from 2.5 to 3.7 (with

the exception of horizon 0, when it is 1.8), and the point estimates indicate that an improvement

of two standard deviations in the prior surplus (roughly 9 percentage points) is associated with a

more expansionary response of the high-employment surplus to an innovation of 7 in distress

that is smaller than what we find for a two-standard-deviation improvement in the prior debt

ratio, but still large—2 to 3 percent of GDP.

      When we include both measures, the point estimates on both are quantitatively large, and

both are statistically significant. The point estimates suggest that the prior debt ratio is

moderately more important quantitatively than the prior surplus; however, the prior surplus is

somewhat more statistically significant. The null hypothesis that neither variable is related to

the fiscal response to distress is overwhelmingly rejected, with p values less than 0.001 at most

horizons. Thus, bringing the prior surplus into the analysis strengthens the finding that there is

a powerful relationship between a country’s fiscal situation and its fiscal response to financial

distress.

      At the same time, we are reluctant to place too much weight on the findings involving the

prior budget surplus. As discussed above, the debt ratio is determined largely by long-term

forces. The prior surplus, in contrast, is heavily influenced by recent policy decisions. One

concrete concern is that if policymakers have information about current or prospective financial

distress before the distress is reflected in our measure, they may pursue fiscal expansion, and so

17When we use the prior surplus in place of the prior debt-to-GDP ratio, we replace the negative of the
debt ratio in the prior year (S) with the surplus-to-GDP ratio in the prior year whenever it appears in (3).
When we use it in addition to the debt ratio, we add the corresponding variable using the prior surplus-to-
GDP ratio whenever a variable using the prior debt-to-GDP ratio appears in (3).
                                                                                                           20


run large deficits, before our measure of distress rises. If so, the finding that a smaller prior

surplus is associated with a less expansionary response to distress could reflect not a causal

impact of the prior surplus, but merely the fact that countries that act before our measure of

distress rises pursue less additional expansion when the increase in our measure occurs.

Because of the potential difficulties with interpretations of correlations involving the prior

surplus, in the remainder of the paper we continue to focus on just the prior debt ratio. 18


E. Looking at Episodes of High Distress

      One way to get a sense of the sources of the baseline fiscal space regression results and to

have more confidence that they reflect genuine patterns in the data is look at the behavior of

debt, the high-employment surplus, and financial distress in the episodes of high distress in our

sample. Specifically, we look at the 22 cases where distress reached 7 or more. 19

      Figure 6 shows two cases where the overall patterns fit straightforwardly with the

regression results concerning the relationship between fiscal space and the fiscal policy response

to distress. The first, Italy in the global financial crisis (panel a), is one where a high-debt

country swung strongly to fiscal contraction following a crisis. The second, Norway in the early

1990s (panel b), is a clear example of the opposite pattern: in this case, a country with low debt

ran highly expansionary policy following a crisis.

      The two cases in Figure 6 are ones where debt and fiscal policy both behave relatively

consistently throughout the episode. Perhaps more telling are some of the cases where debt and



18 For completeness, we have examined the effects of using the prior surplus either in place of or in
addition to the prior debt ratio in all of the empirical exercises reported in the paper. Throughout, the
results are qualitatively similar to what we find here. The prior surplus enters in ways that are statistically
and quantitatively significant; when both variables are included, the statistical significance of the debt
ratio is reduced somewhat, but it remains marginally to very significant, and it has a quantitatively more
important role than the prior surplus; and the null hypothesis that neither variable enters is
overwhelmingly rejected.
19 To form estimates of the change in the high-employment surplus, we need an estimate of trend growth

by country; that is, we need an estimate of the 𝜏 ∙ Δ𝑦� term that we are able to omit in estimating equation
(3). We use each country’s average growth over the full sample period 1980:1–2017:2 as our estimate of
the growth rate of potential output in the country. For countries where we do not have GDP data for the
full period, we use the average growth rate over the period for which we have data.
                                                                                                21


fiscal policy evolved over the course of the episode. Two such cases are shown in Figure 7.

Ireland (panel a) began its 2009 crisis with a low debt-to-GDP ratio, and it initially responded to

high distress by undertaking extreme spending measures to stabilize its financial system.

However, as its debt ratio rose and distress continued, Ireland swung strongly to fiscal

contraction. The other case, Portugal in the 2008 crisis (panel b), shows a similar (though less

extreme) pattern. Because the regressions always consider the recent (but prior) level of the debt

ratio, cases where distress continued and fiscal policy swung toward contraction as debt rose fit

the regression finding that the policy response to distress is more contractionary when debt is

higher.

      The cases shown in Figures 6 and 7 help ground the regression results. They show that the

estimates are consistent with the behavior of debt and the high-employment surplus in several

key crisis episodes. But, obviously, not every episode cleanly matches the regression findings.

For example, Korea following its 1997 crisis had ample fiscal space as measured by its debt-to-

GDP ratio, but nevertheless pursued austerity. And, the United States following its crisis in 2007

is an example of a country with somewhat high debt that nevertheless pursued aggressive fiscal

stimulus and financial rescue. Such nonconforming cases are reflected in the standard errors of

the regression estimates.



III. STATISTICAL EVIDENCE ON WHY FISCAL SPACE MATTERS FOR THE POLICY RESPONSE

      The previous section shows that the fiscal policy response to financial distress varies

dramatically with a country’s prior debt-to-GDP ratio. Countries with low debt-to-GDP ratios on

the eve of financial distress expand aggressively, while countries with high debt-to-GDP ratios

tighten sharply. The obvious question is why.


A. Possible Explanations

      One possibility is that the link between fiscal policy after crises and the debt-to-GDP ratio
                                                                                                   22


reflects variation in sovereign market access. Perhaps investors in government bonds are

sensitive to a country’s fiscal space. In this case, countries with a higher debt-to-GDP ratio may

experience larger rises in interest rates following financial distress, and so be less able or willing

to engage in fiscal expansion. Indeed, in extreme cases, market access may be so constrained

that higher-debt countries may find themselves forced to undertake extreme austerity because

they are unable to borrow. Lower-debt countries, on the other hand, may have better market

access and so be able to run very expansionary policy.

      The broad alternative explanation for the link between the fiscal response to a crisis and

fiscal space involves policymakers’ choices. Perhaps policymakers have views about the

desirability of fiscal expansion or austerity that vary with the debt-to-GDP ratio. For example,

policymakers may believe that financial rescue and countercyclical stimulus are appropriate

when the debt ratio is low, but not when it is high. Likewise, they may believe that post-crisis

austerity is called for when the debt load is heavy, but not when it is light. As a result, a higher-

debt country might choose to expand little or pursue austerity following a financial crisis, while

a lower-debt country may choose to expand aggressively, even if neither country faces pressure

from markets.

      The policymakers making such choices are not necessarily those within the country. For

example, countries in the European Union (or wishing to join the EU or the euro zone) agree to

certain standing rules about debt and deficit levels. Thus, the fiscal response of such countries to

a financial crisis may vary with their debt-to-GDP ratio because of the ideas and rules of the EU.

Countries with a higher debt-to-GDP ratio may find themselves pressured by the EU to conduct

austerity following a crisis, while those with a lower debt ratio remain free to conduct financial

rescue and countercyclical stimulus.

      The fiscal conditionality imposed by the IMF and other international organizations as part

of a bailout reflects a sort of hybrid between the market access and policymaker choice

explanations. Countries typically only turn to the IMF when there is an extreme lack of market
                                                                                                 23


access. Thus being subject to IMF conditionality is in a fundamental sense an indicator of severe

market constraints. If market access depends on fiscal space, then being subject to IMF

conditionality could be thought of as the mechanism by which fiscal space affects the fiscal

response to financial distress. However, the nature of the bailout conditionality, such as the

severity of the required austerity and the speed with which the IMF seeks to return countries to

private borrowing, depends on the ideas of IMF policymakers about appropriate fiscal policy,

and those may also be affected by countries’ fiscal space. In the extreme, a country that is forced

to go to the IMF for reasons unrelated to its debt load could nevertheless have its fiscal response

be related to its debt-to-GDP ratio purely because of IMF ideas.

        The main goal of this section and the next is to obtain evidence about the relative roles of

sovereign market access and policymakers’ choices in accounting for the link between the fiscal

response to financial distress and the debt-to-GDP ratio. This section considers statistical

evidence. As we describe below, there are various direct measures of market access, such as

sovereign bond rates and credit ratings. If market access is key, these variables should be better

predictors of the fiscal policy response to a crisis than the debt-to-GDP ratio. Indeed, if market

access is crucial and the direct measures are good indicators, the debt ratio would have little or

no predictive power once these measures are included. On the other hand, if market access is

not crucial and policymakers emphasize the debt ratio in making choices about fiscal policy,

then including direct measures of market access should have little impact on the predictive

power of the debt ratio for the policy response.


B. Measures of Sovereign Market Access

        We consider four relatively direct measures of sovereign market access. The first is the

spread on credit default swaps (CDS) for government debt. Concretely, we use the spread on 5-

year senior government debt. 20 Since a CDS contract is insurance against default, in principle



20   The data are originally from Credit Market Analysis (CMA) and Thomson Reuters, downloaded from
                                                                                                            24


the CDS spread should be an excellent measure of the premium a country must pay to borrow

because of fears about its solvency. Thus, it should be a good measure of market access.

      In practice, however, CDS spreads have several drawbacks. First, the contracts did not

exist at all until the 1990s, and our data for most countries do not begin until 2004. Second, the

markets are often thin, and in some cases inoperative. For example, the reported CDS spread for

Greece shows literally no change from February 2012 to March 2017. Third, the observation for

Greece over this period (14,904.36 basis points) is so extreme that using the raw data would

effectively amount to just including a dummy variable for Greece in this period. We therefore

drop Greece from regressions including the CDS spread. Finally, the CDS spread on a bond of

one specific maturity is an imperfect measure of a government’s access to bond markets at other

maturities, and CDS spreads omit some important risks lenders face, notably restructuring

designed to not trigger CDS contracts and the inflating away of debt. 21

      Our second measure is simpler: long-term interest rates on sovereign debt. In particular,

we use the nominal rate on long-term (roughly 10-year) government bonds. 22 These data have

the advantages of being available for a large fraction of our sample, coming from relatively thick


DATASTREAM 12/3/2018. We use the average of the daily observations for the last month of the half-
year to construct our semiannual observations. We link the CMA and Thompson Reuters data by splicing
in the last half-year where there is overlap. The contracts are denominated either in euros or U.S. dollars,
with the exception of those for Japan, which are in yen.
21 We make two adjustments to the CDS data. First, in the handful of cases where the splicing implies a

small negative spread, we set the spread to zero. Second, although data for most of the countries in our
sample begin in 2004, for some countries whose debt was regarded as extremely safe, they do not begin
until later. In order to mitigate somewhat the loss of observations from using the CDS data, we set the
spread for these countries from 2004 until it is first available to zero. The result is a series that covers 29
of the 30 countries in our sample for 2004–2017. (The missing country is Luxembourg, which did not
issue long-term debt over this period.) Using the data without these adjustments yields very similar
results.
22 We begin with IMF data on long-term government bond rates (downloaded from International

Financial Statistics, data.imf.org/IFS , 12/2/2018). When those are not available, we use the long-term
rates from the OECD (downloaded from Federal Reserve Economic Data, https://fred.stlouisfed.org/,
12/2/2018), splicing the two series (in levels) at the point of overlap. The data are generally for bonds with
maturities of approximately ten years. For Mexico until 2001 and Turkey, however, the data are for bonds
with maturities of roughly two years. We use the observations for the last month of the half-year. For the
handful of cases where the data for the last month of the half-year are not available, we use the
observation for the previous month. Finally, although the IMF reports data for Luxembourg, the
documentation notes that Luxembourg stopped issuing long-term debt in January 1985 and that the
reported data are for private debt (IMF 2018). We therefore treat the observations for Luxembourg
starting in 1985 as missing.
                                                                                                         25


markets, and, as with CDS spreads, reflecting market-based assessments of the riskiness of

countries’ debt. However, they are affected by factors other than riskiness, notably short-run

monetary policy and trend inflation. And, as with the CDS spread, the long-term interest rate on

a 10-year bond is an imperfect measure of the premium a government must pay at other

maturities. 23

      Our third measure is Standard & Poor’s (S&P) sovereign bond ratings. We convert S&P’s

letter grades into numerical scores by making the step between each grade of equal size, with

higher letter grades corresponding to higher scores. 24 This is arguably our most preferred

measure of market access: it is continuous, available for most of our sample, and reflects

professional assessments of a wide range of information about the riskiness of countries’ debt.

At the same time, S&P’s assessments are necessarily imperfect, market access may not be linear

in S&P’s letter grades, and no single measure can capture market access over the full range of

maturities of a country’s bonds.

      Our final measure of market access is a dummy variable for whether a country is subject to

an IMF stand-by arrangement or extended fund facility. 25 As discussed above, countries

generally turn to the IMF only when they face severe difficulties in borrowing in private

markets. Thus, being under an IMF program is a strong indicator of very limited market access.

At the same time, however, this variable is also an indicator of being subject to IMF


23 We also consider the spread between a country’s long-term rate and the German rate (or the lower of

the German and U.S. rates), rather than the long-term rate. The relationship between the spread and the
policy response is slightly stronger than that between the long-term rate and the policy response when we
do not include the debt-to-GDP ratio, but slightly weaker when we include the debt ratio. Using the
spread rather than the long-term rate has no discernible effect on the relationship between the debt ratio
and the policy response.
24 The data are from

te=20281001-19:20:54, downloaded 11/18/2018. We use the rating as of the end of the half-year. We
assign a value of 30 to a AAA rating, 27 to AA, and so on down to 3 to D (although the lowest rating for the
countries in our sample is CC, to which our scale assigns a 9). We add a point when the rating is
accompanied by a plus and subtract a point when it is accompanied by a minus.
25 Information on IMF programs is from https://www.imf.org/external/np/fin/tad/extarr1.aspx,

downloaded 1/2/2019. Our measure is a dummy variable for whether a country was subject to a program
at the end of the half-year.

policymakers’ views. As a result, the interpretation of any estimated impact is inherently

complicated.

      With all four indicators of market access, we specify the variable so that a larger value

corresponds to more access. Specifically, we multiply the CDS spread, the sovereign bond rate,

and the IMF dummy (but not the credit rating variable) by negative one.


C. Does Sovereign Market Access Affect the Fiscal Response to a Crisis?

      We begin by considering the predictive power of the various direct measures of sovereign

market access for the response of the high-employment surplus to financial distress. These

regressions can show if better market access appears to be associated with a more aggressive

fiscal response to a crisis.

      For this exercise, we estimate regressions analogous to equation (3) with the debt ratio

replaced by one of the measures of market access:

(4)      �𝐵𝑗,𝑡+ℎ − 𝐵𝑗,𝑡−1 � − 𝜏 ∙ (𝑦𝑗,𝑡+ℎ − 𝑦𝑗,𝑡−1 ) = 𝛼𝑗ℎ + 𝛾𝑡ℎ + 𝜂 ℎ 𝑀𝑗,𝑡 + 𝛽 ℎ 𝐹𝑗,𝑡 + 𝜆ℎ (𝐹𝑗,𝑡 ∙ 𝑀𝑗,𝑡 )
                                                                                                              ℎ
 + ∑4𝑘=1 𝜌𝑘ℎ 𝑀𝑗,𝑡−𝑘 + ∑4𝑘=1 𝜑𝑘ℎ 𝐹𝑗,𝑡−𝑘 + ∑4𝑘=1 𝜔𝑘ℎ (𝐹𝑗,𝑡−𝑘 ∙ 𝑀𝑗,𝑡−𝑘 ) + ∑4𝑘=1 𝜃𝑘ℎ �∆𝐵𝑗,𝑡−𝑘 − 𝜏 ∙ ∆𝑦𝑗,𝑡−𝑘 � + 𝑒𝑗,𝑡 .


Here 𝑀𝑗,𝑡 is a measure of sovereign market access and the other variables are as before. Our

main interest is in the sequence of estimates of 𝜆ℎ , which show how the fiscal response to

distress varies with market access.

      Throughout, the measure of market access in period t is based on information as of the

end of the previous half-year. Thus, for example, we use information on the long-term interest

rate or the S&P rating at the end of the half-year before period t in constructing 𝑀𝑗,𝑡 . We are

therefore asking whether the fiscal policy response to financial distress varies with the degree of

market access the country faced prior to distress. This timing puts the measures of market

access on roughly the same footing as the debt-to-GDP ratio in the regressions in the previous
                                                                                                       27


section. 26

      One concern is that previous market access may be a less good predictor of current market

access than the previous debt ratio is of the current ratio. This could make the estimated

interaction effect for the market access variables less comparable to that for the debt ratio in the

previous section. As a simple test for this, we regress each market access variable on country and

time fixed effects, and four half-yearly lags of itself. The sum of the coefficients on the lag terms

range from 0.76 for the IMF dummy to 0.94 for the S&P rating. The comparable sum of the lag

terms for the debt ratio is 0.96. 27 The sum of the lag coefficients is overwhelmingly significant in

all cases. These findings suggest there is some validity to this concern, but it may not cause large

incomparabilities. Moreover, we are hesitant to adjust the timing to use the more nearly

contemporaneous measures of market access because of endogeneity concerns. Without the lag

in timing, it is impossible to distinguish between market access in times of distress affecting the

fiscal response to a crisis, and the fiscal response to a crisis affecting the contemporaneous state

of market access.

      Including the Measures of Market Access One at a Time. Figure 8 shows the

results of estimating equation (4) including the measures of market access one at a time. There

are four panels; each corresponds to a different measure of market access. Paralleling panel (a)

of Figure 5, each panel shows the sequence of estimates of the interaction term, scaled for ease

of interpretation. As discussed above, we specify the measures of market access in such a way

that a negative coefficient on the interaction term means that better market access is associated

with a smaller value of the change in the high-employment surplus, and hence with a more

expansionary fiscal policy response. We also always multiply the coefficients on the interaction

term by 7 so that we are focusing on substantial financial distress. For the IMF dummy, we make

26 Because the market access measures are high frequency, while the debt ratio is annual, the market
access variables are slightly less lagged than the debt variable. For the second observation of each year,
the debt variable corresponds to the end of the previous calendar year, whereas the market access
variables correspond to the end of June.
27 Because there are not true semiannual observations for the debt data (we simply repeat the value for

both half-years), we run the regression for the debt-to-GDP ratio at an annual frequency.
                                                                                                 28


no further adjustment, so what is shown is simply the difference in the policy response between

a country not subject to an IMF program and a country subject to one. For the other three

measures (the CDS spread, the long-term interest rate, and the S&P rating), we also multiply the

estimated coefficients on the interaction term by twice the standard deviation of the measure,

which is analogous to our treatment of the debt-to-GDP ratio in Figure 5. In short, each panel

shows the estimated difference in the response of the high-employment surplus as a percent of

GDP to an innovation in financial distress of 7 in a country with better market access versus a

country with worse market access.

      Panel (a) of the figure shows that there is basically no correlation between a country’s CDS

spread and its fiscal response to financial distress. The estimated impact of having a spread that

is two standard deviations lower (roughly 230 basis points) on the response of policy to an

innovation of 7 in financial distress is of irregular sign, quantitatively small, and never close to

statistically significant. The confidence intervals include moderately negative and moderately

positive values, but do not include large values.

      For the other three measures, better market access is associated with a more expansionary

fiscal response to financial distress. The results are strongest for the IMF program dummy

(panel d). The point estimates imply that the response of the high-employment surplus in a

country that is not subject to an IMF program to an innovation in distress of 7 is more

expansionary by up to 6 percent of GDP. The null hypothesis that the responses do not differ

between a country not subject to a program and a country subject to one is decisively rejected,

with a maximum t-statistic over 4.

      The results for the other two measures are not as overwhelming, but still strong. For the

interest rate on long-term government debt (panel b), having a sovereign yield two standard

deviations lower (8.6 percentage points) is associated with a substantially more expansionary

fiscal policy response to a financial crisis (often exceeding 2 percent of GDP), but with wide
                                                                                                        29


confidence intervals and a maximum t-statistic of only 2.2. 28 A two-standard-deviation

improvement in a country’s S&P rating (roughly 8 points on our numerical scale, for example

from B to A−) is associated with a more expansionary policy response of similar size (2 percent

of GDP or more) and is highly statistically significant at short horizons, with a maximum t-

statistic of 3.3.

      Including Multiple Measures of Market Access. Each of the direct measures of

market access captures slightly different features of a country’s ability to borrow. Moreover,

each measure has unique strengths and limitations. Thus, it is sensible to see if the measures

considered jointly have more substantial predictive power for the fiscal response to a financial

crisis than each considered separately. To do this, we expand equation (4) to include the level

and interaction with distress (as well as the appropriate lags) of three measures of market

access: the long-term government bond rate, the S&P sovereign rating, and the dummy for being

under an IMF program. We exclude the CDS spread because its inclusion limits the sample

period so severely.

      For each horizon of the impulse response function, we consider the point estimate and

statistical significance of the sum of the interaction of each measure of market access with

financial distress times twice its standard deviation. As in Figure 8, we also multiply the

weighted sum of the interaction terms by 7. Thus it shows how the response to an innovation of

7 in financial distress changes with an improvement of two standard deviations in all three

measures of market access.

      Figure 9 shows the results. The point estimates of the weighted sum of the interaction

terms are negative for the first 2½ years following crisis. This suggests that countries with better

market access engage in more expansionary fiscal policy following a crisis than countries with


28 The value we use for the standard deviation of the long-term interest rate excludes Turkey. Our data for

the long-term rate include only a handful of values for Turkey, but not enough consecutive data points for
any observations from Turkey to enter the regression. In addition, the values of the long rate for Turkey
are so extreme (generally close to 100 percent) that including them would almost double the overall
standard deviation.
                                                                                                                    30


worse market access. The point estimates after 2½ years are very close to zero (until year 5,

when they fluctuate substantially). Perhaps more important than the point estimates is the

statistical significance of the weighted sum. The standard errors of the sum of the interaction

effects are substantial, particularly at longer horizons. As a result, the impact of market access

on the fiscal response to a crisis is statistically significant at only one horizon (horizon 2). That

the three measures of market access considered jointly have a less precisely estimated impact on

the fiscal response to a crisis than two of the measures considered individually (the S&P rating

and the IMF dummy) reflects both changes in the sample caused by including all three measures

and interactions between the various measures.


D. Does the Debt Ratio Affect the Fiscal Response through Market Access?

       The previous regressions show whether direct measures of sovereign market access

predict the fiscal policy response to financial crises. They do not, however, answer the question

raised by the results in Section II, which is why the debt-to-GDP ratio appears to matter. This

issue can be addressed by testing whether including direct measures of market access drives out

the predictive power of the debt ratio.

       Including the Measures of Market Access One at a Time. To do this we estimate

regressions along the lines of equations (3) and (4), but now including both (the negative of) the

debt ratio and a measure of market access:

(5) �𝐵𝑗,𝑡+ℎ − 𝐵𝑗,𝑡−1 � – 𝜏 ∙ (𝑦𝑗,𝑡+ℎ − 𝑦𝑗,𝑡−1 ) = 𝛼𝑗ℎ + 𝛾𝑡ℎ + 𝜗 ℎ 𝑆𝑗,𝑡 + 𝜂 ℎ 𝑀𝑗,𝑡 + 𝛽 ℎ 𝐹𝑗,𝑡 + 𝛿 ℎ (𝐹𝑗,𝑡 ∙ 𝑆𝑗,𝑡 )
      + 𝜆ℎ (𝐹𝑗,𝑡 ∙ 𝑀𝑗,𝑡 ) + ∑4𝑘=1 𝜌𝑘ℎ 𝑆𝑗,𝑡−𝑘 + ∑4𝑘=1 𝜌𝑘ℎ 𝑀𝑗,𝑡−𝑘 + ∑4𝑘=1 𝜑𝑘ℎ 𝐹𝑗,𝑡−𝑘 + ∑4𝑘=1 𝜔𝑘ℎ (𝐹𝑗,𝑡−𝑘 ∙ 𝑆𝑗,𝑡−𝑘 )
                                                                                            ℎ
                     + ∑4𝑘=1 𝜇𝑘ℎ (𝐹𝑗,𝑡−𝑘 ∙ 𝑀𝑗,𝑡−𝑘 ) + ∑4𝑘=1 𝜃𝑘ℎ �∆𝐵𝑗,𝑡−𝑘 − 𝜏 ∙ ∆𝑦𝑗,𝑡−𝑘 � + 𝑒𝑗,𝑡 .


Thus, this regression includes both the interaction between financial distress and the debt ratio

and the interaction between distress and a direct measure of market access. We first include the

measures of market access one at a time.

       Figure 10 shows the results. Each panel considers a different measure of market access.
                                                                                                 31


The panels show two sets of estimates of differences between the fiscal policy responses to an

innovation of 7 in financial distress: between countries with better and worse market access

(with the differences measured in the same way as in Figure 8), and between countries with

smaller and larger debt-to-GDP ratios (with the difference equal to two standard deviations, or

roughly 70 percentage points, as in Figure 5a). Since the key question is whether including the

measures of market access weakens the predictive power of the debt ratio, we also include the

point estimate of the scaled interaction term for the debt ratio from the specification that

excludes the market access measures (equation (3)). The sample period used to estimate the

specification excluding the market access measure is adjusted to match that for the specification

including the market access measure in each case. Thus the two estimates of the interaction

effect for the debt ratio given in a panel differ only because of the inclusion of the market access

measure. The differences in the sample period also explain why the estimate of the debt

interaction excluding market access differs across the panels and from the baseline results given

in Figure 5a. To keep the figures readable, we do not show the interaction effect for the market

access variable from the specification excluding the debt ratio (equation (4)), but we do discuss

how this effect changes as well.

      The basic message of the figure is that including the direct measures of sovereign market

access attenuates the estimated effect of the debt-to-GDP ratio on the fiscal response to a crisis

by at most a moderate amount (and usually just a very small amount), while including the debt

ratio often has a large impact on the estimated effects of the measures of market access. Panel

(a) considers the case where the CDS spread is used to measure market access. The estimate of

the interaction effect for the debt ratio from the expanded specification is shown in dark blue;

that from the specification excluding the measure of market access (but using the same very

short sample for which the CDS spread is available) is shown in light blue. Including the

interaction with the CDS spread reduces the interaction with the debt ratio a moderate amount

at very short horizons, but increases it at longer horizons. That is, fiscal policy following a
                                                                                                32


financial crisis is somewhat less responsive to the debt ratio when the CDS spread is included,

but only at short horizons. And even in this smaller sample, the impact of the debt ratio on the

fiscal response at short and medium horizons is large, though only marginally significant. In

contrast, including the debt ratio makes the results for the CDS spread even weaker than before.

The estimates are generally wrong-signed, and at long horizons (with, as just noted, small

sample sizes), marginally significant.

      Panel (b) shows that including the interest rate on long-term government debt has

essentially no effect on the estimated impact of the debt-to-GDP ratio on the fiscal policy

response to financial distress. It also shows that including the debt ratio noticeably weakens the

predictive power of the long-term rate for the policy response. The estimated impact remains

negative at short horizons, but is now at most weakly significant; and it is now positive, though

statistically insignificant, at longer horizons. Panel (c) shows that when the S&P rating is

included, the estimated impact of the debt ratio on the fiscal response to a crisis weakens by

about 20 percent, but remains large and often statistically significant. It is also shows that

including the debt ratio has a larger effect on the estimated impact of the S&P rating. Its

estimated effect remains consistently negative, but is somewhat smaller than before and

statistically significant only at horizon 2.

      Finally, panel (d) shows the results for the dummy for being subject to an IMF program.

The inclusion of a measure of market access again reduces the estimates of the effect of the debt-

to-GDP ratio on the response to financial distress by about 20 percent, though they are still large

and often significant. And again, the inclusion of the debt ratio has a larger effect on the

estimates of the effects of the measure of market access. At short horizons, the estimated effect

continues to be large and overwhelmingly significant, though it is noticeably weaker than before.

But at medium horizons, the effects move from very large and highly significant to moderate and

not significant; and at long horizons, they become positive, though not significant.

       Including Multiple Measures of Market Access. We again consider a more
                                                                                                  33


extreme test. We allow the fiscal policy response to financial distress to depend on the debt-to-

GDP ratio and on three measures of sovereign market access: the long-term government bond

rate, the S&P rating, and the IMF dummy. That is, we expand equation (5) to include three

measures of market access (and their interactions with financial distress), rather than just one.

(We again do not include the CDS spread, on the grounds that doing so would entail a very large

reduction in the sample size and that the previous results find essentially no effect of the

spread.)

      Figure 11 shows two scaled estimates of the interaction effect with financial distress for

various horizons: that for the debt ratio and that for the weighted sum of the three direct

measures of market access (calculated as in Figure 9). As in Figure 10, we also show the

interaction effect for the debt ratio from equation (3) (where the measures of market access are

excluded), but for the same sample period as those from expanded specification.

      The figure shows that the estimated sensitivity of the fiscal response to a crisis to the debt-

to-GDP ratio is only mildly affected by the simultaneous inclusion of multiple direct measures of

market access. The impact remains large and generally statistically significant; the inclusion of

the multiple measures of market access reduces the point estimates by about 20% relative to our

baseline estimates. Thus, the debt-to-GDP ratio appears to matter substantially for the fiscal

response to a crisis, even when one takes into account the behavior of the three direct measures

of market access. As in Figure 9, the weighted sum of the interaction terms for the three

measures of market access is initially negative, but it is only marginally significant at one

horizon (horizon 2). The weighted sum of the interaction effects then turns positive, with very

large standard errors.


E. Discussion

      The statistical results advance our understanding of the fiscal policy response to financial

distress in two ways. First, they provide some evidence that market access matters. There is a
                                                                                                  34


moderately large, moderately significant, and relatively robust relationship between the rating

on a country’s sovereign debt and its fiscal policy response to distress; and there is a large,

highly significant, and very robust relationship between a country being subject to an IMF

program and its short-run fiscal response. Countries with higher-rated debt respond more

aggressively to distress, and the immediate response of countries that are subject to an IMF

program is far more contractionary than that of countries that are not. In addition, countries

respond less aggressively to distress when the interest rate on their long-term debt is higher,

and they respond less aggressively at longer horizons when they are subject to an IMF program.

However, these relationships are not as consistent as those for the rating and for the immediate

impact of being under an IMF program.

      Second, we find that including direct measures of sovereign market access does not

eliminate the estimated impact of the debt-to-GDP ratio on the fiscal response to financial

crises. Indeed, using a range of measures (both singly and in combination) of market access only

slightly attenuates the correlation between the debt-to-GDP ratio and the fiscal policy response.

This suggests that an important part of the relationship between the debt ratio and the fiscal

response to a crisis is working through channels other than market access. The natural

alternative is that those other channels involve choices by policymakers.



IV. NARRATIVE EVIDENCE ON THE MOTIVATION FOR FISCAL POLICY FOLLOWING CRISES

      In this section, we turn from statistical to narrative evidence. There are several reasons

that the broader, more qualitative evidence provided by narrative sources may be able to provide

important additional information about the determinants of the fiscal policy response to

financial distress. First, and most obviously, our interest is in the motivations for policy actions.

Thus, there is likely to be valuable evidence from policymakers’ statements, news accounts, and

other descriptions of the policymaking process available to informed contemporary observers.
                                                                                                   35


      Second, all of our direct measures of sovereign market access are imperfect. As a result,

the statistical relationship between the measures and the fiscal policy response to financial

distress may understate the importance of market access. It is therefore useful to examine

whether analysts making more holistic judgments about the drivers of policy decisions perceived

a greater role for problems with market access than comes through in our statistical analysis.

      Third, and closely related, problems with market access may involve large and

complicated nonlinearities that would be extremely difficult to detect statistically. For example,

suppose that there is some level of fiscal expansion that would trigger a sudden, sharp rise in

interest rate spreads and severe problems with market access, and that this level varies across

situations. If policymakers are aware of these limits and careful not to breach them, concerns

about possible imminent loss of market access could be driving fiscal policy without showing up

in our measures. But such considerations might be apparent to observers monitoring countries’

decision-making.

      Motivated by these considerations, in this section we seek to provide narrative evidence on

the relative importance of market access and policymaker choices in driving fiscal policy actions

around crises. We also investigate the degree to which government debt ratios appear to

underlie or influence market access and policymaker choices. The narrative analysis focuses on

the 22 episodes of high distress in our sample.


A. Source and Approach

      The source that we use for this analysis is the Economist Intelligence Unit’s Country

Reports. 29 The EIU is a subscription service providing information on political and economic

developments in a wide range of countries. The reports are aimed at investors and other market

professionals, and appear to be of reasonably high quality. Each one is around 25 pages, and

makes frequent reference to data, legislative debates, and political developments. The service

29 The EIU Country Reports after 1996 are available from EIU.com; those before 1996 are available from

the Economist Intelligence Unit Country Reports Archive through ProQuest. Binder (2018) uses the
Country Reports as a narrative source to study political pressure on central banks.
                                                                                                      36


relies, in part, on the reporters and analysts working for the Economist magazine for its

information. Because the reports focus particularly on policy actions, we find them to be a

plentiful source on the motivations for those actions.

      The EIU Country Reports are available quarterly until early 2000, and monthly

thereafter. The reports for the first quarter (which came out in early January) and the third

quarter (which came out in early July) are roughly comparable in timing to the OECD Economic

Outlook, from which we derive our measure of financial distress (the Economic Outlook comes

out in December and June). When the reports become monthly, we treat those for January and

July as the parallel to the OECD volumes. 30 Our approach is to read the EIU Reports for a

country corresponding in timing to the OECD Economic Outlook starting in the half-year before

financial distress reached 7 or above. We read nine issues for each episode of high distress—two

a year from one-half year before the crisis to four years after.

      We look for what the EIU Reports say about four questions:

            1. What is the current and/or prospective stance of fiscal policy?
            2. What is the motivation given for the fiscal developments?
            3. Does the EIU mention the debt-to-GDP ratio as a concern or as an underlying
               motivation?
            4. Is there anything else of note relevant to fiscal policy actions?

      From the answers to question (1), we identify whether fiscal policy at the time was

perceived by the EIU to have been on net expansionary or contractionary, and whether the net

movement was large or small. The overall direction of fiscal policy is usually stated quite

directly. To categorize size, we rely mainly on adjectives. Fiscal moves described with works like

“mild,” “minor,” and “small” are classified as small; those described with words like “enormous,”

“unprecedented,” and “extreme” are classified as large. This scaling is obviously rough. In the

tables that summarize the narrative evidence, we therefore note cases that are marginal for a

30 We do this in part for consistency with the early years of the EIU Reports, and in part because, for a
transition period, the December and June issues are updates rather than full reports. In addition, there
are a few irregularities in which EIU reports we consider. For example, the report for Sweden for 1994Q1
is not available from ProQuest. Similarly, in a few cases in the early 2000s, the January and July issues
are updates and the December and June issues are full reports. In such cases, we use a rule of reason and
read the obvious alternative report.
                                                                                                37


category.

      In classifying the motivation given by the EIU for fiscal actions (question 2), we are open

to nuance and multiple motivations. For fiscal expansions, we identify three possible

motivations:

            a. Financial rescue.
            b. Countercyclical stimulus.
            c. Politics.

The EIU typically says why some fiscal action was taken, not why some other action was not

taken. That is, the counterfactual is implicitly or explicitly neutral fiscal policy. As a result,

market access is inherently not an explanation for fiscal expansions, and all of the possible

motivations correspond to policymaker choices. Actions taken for countercyclical stimulus or

financial rescue can be thought of as reflecting policymakers’ ideas: policymakers take the

actions because they believe the policies will be helpful. “Politics” (category c) refers to fiscal

stimulus taken to try to help win an election.

      For fiscal contractions we consider five possible motivations:

            d.   Market access.
            e.   Conditionality imposed as part of a bailout.
            f.   Policymaker ideas.
            g.   European Union fiscal rules.
            h.   Countercyclical austerity.

“Market access” captures austerity that the EIU identifies as being driven by very high sovereign

spreads, inability to borrow, or other problems with private sovereign funding. The final three

motivations correspond to policymaker choices. As described above, policymaker ideas and EU

rules largely differ in whose ideas are mattering—those of domestic policymakers or EU officials.

“Countercyclical austerity” (category h) refers to contractionary fiscal actions taken to prevent

overheating, and can again be thought of as a special form of policymaker ideas. Finally,

“conditionality” is the hybrid of market access and IMF (or other bailout organization) choices
                                                                                                     38


discussed above. 31

      Question (3) reflects both information about policymakers’ concerns about the debt-to-

GDP ratio in an episode and the EIU’s perspective. We take note of the EIU’s assessment on the

grounds that when we do not have direct information on policymakers’ views, it at least provides

the assessment of one contemporary informed observer of whether debt was important.

However, we put the main emphasis on the information the EIU provides about policymakers’

views. We pay particular attention to whether the EIU believes that the debt-to-GDP ratio is

driving the proximate motivation—for example, whether it cites the debt-to-GDP ratio as

something that is affecting market access or policymakers’ ideas.

      Online Appendix B provides our detailed notes and selected quotations for each EIU

country report that we read, organized around the four questions discussed above. Table 2

provides the topline summary of what the EIU says about the net direction, size, and motivation

for fiscal actions in each of the 22 episodes of high financial distress.


B. Post-Crisis Fiscal Expansions

      Table 3 summarizes the narrative evidence from the EIU on net fiscal expansions

following high financial distress. According to the EIU, in almost all of the 22 crisis episodes in

our sample there was at least a short period of deliberate net fiscal expansion following the start

of high distress. The only exceptions are Mexico (in the mid-1990s) and Hungary (in 2009). In

both cases, high financial distress followed extreme exchange rate fluctuations, and the country

was already participating in an IMF stabilization program at the time of severe problems in the

financial sector. South Korea followed a similar pattern, with very early austerity as part of an

IMF program to deal with its 1998 crisis. However, unlike Mexico and Hungary, Korea

undertook fiscal expansion after conditions stabilized. The much more typical pattern is for the

fiscal expansions to occur early in the post-crisis period.


31Not surprisingly, the motivations given in the EIU Country Reports occasionally do not fit into one of
the eight categories we identify. In these cases, we note an “other” motivation.
                                                                                                39


      Panel (a) of Table 3 divides the net fiscal expansions into those that were described by the

EIU as small and those described as large. As can be seen, small expansions were more common

than large ones. Panel (b) shows the motivations given by the EIU for the net fiscal expansion in

each case. As discussed above, the three possible motivations—financial rescue, countercyclical

stimulus, and politics—all correspond to policymaker choices. Each line in panel (b)

corresponds to an episode, so that it is easy to see multiple motivations by episode.

      Financial Rescue (a). One thing that jumps out from Table 3 is that financial rescue is

nearly universal. Of the 20 cases of deliberate net fiscal expansion, the EIU identified financial

rescue as a motivation in 19 of them. The only case where it was not given as a motivation is the

United States following its 1990 crisis; however, in this case there was a bailout of the savings

and loan industry that occurred before our narrative source identified substantial financial

distress. Even in the two cases where there was no net fiscal expansion (Mexico and Hungary),

the EIU reported substantial support for the financial system. This suggests remarkable

agreement across policymakers from different countries that financial rescue is valuable and

appropriate in times of high financial distress.

      There is also an obvious correlation between the EIU’s perceived size of the fiscal

expansion and financial rescue. All 8 of the countries described as taking large post-crisis fiscal

expansions are also described as being strongly motivated by financial rescue. For example, of

Finland following its 1993 crisis, the EIU wrote: “parliament approved a motion saying it would

grant sufficient funds and authorising the government to use them to secure ‘under all

circumstances’ the continued operation of Finland’s banks” (1st quarter 1993, p. 8). Likewise, the

EIU discussed that in Iceland following the 2008 crisis, “gross government debt is forecast by

the IMF to increase from 29% at the end of 2007 to 109% of GDP in 2009, as a result of meeting

the obligations of the former three main Icelandic banks now taken into public ownership and

the injection of new funds to recapitalise them” (January 2009, p. 9). That the largest fiscal

expansions involved very aggressive financial rescue also suggests that policymakers viewed
                                                                                                 40


such rescues as a valuable use of public funds following a financial crisis.

      Countercyclical Stimulus (b). A desire to stimulate aggregate demand and counter

the contractionary consequences of a financial crisis is a less frequently cited motivation for

post-crisis fiscal expansion. The EIU listed it as a motivation in 14 of the 20 cases of net

expansion (and in 4 of those it was only a minor motivation). This could suggest that the idea

that fiscal stimulus is helpful and appropriate following a financial crisis was less widely held

among policymakers than a belief in the efficacy and appropriateness of financial rescue.

      The EIU descriptions provide interesting insight into the interaction between the financial

rescue and countercyclical motivations. Some countries appear to have embraced both

motivations strongly. For example, the EIU said of Japan following its 1998 crisis both that the

“government … is now focusing on a bail-out of the financial sector” (1st quarter 1998, p. 3), and

“in mid-November the government unveiled a new package of proposals designed to stimulate

economic recovery” (1st quarter 1999, p. 17). The United States following the 2008 crisis was

similarly described as acting with gusto because of both motivations: “Mr Obama has already

made it clear that he will do everything to contain the crisis and that he is backing another fiscal

stimulus package” (January 2009, p. 4).

      Other countries appear to have embraced the financial rescue motivation strongly, but

believed that they should do little or no conventional fiscal stimulus. For example, the EIU

described the United Kingdom following the 2008 crisis as undertaking “unprecedented moves

last year to support the banking sector” (January 2009, p. 4), but only a “£20bn (US$30bn)

fiscal stimulus package (the main element of which is a temporary cut in the rate of value-added

tax (VAT) from 17.5% to 15% until end-2009)” (January 2009, p. 5). Indeed, at least three

countries were described as believing in aggressive financial rescue and conventional fiscal

austerity simultaneously (Sweden in the early 1990s, and Iceland and Ireland after the global

financial crisis). For example, Ireland is described by the EIU as “taking all possible measures to

support the financial system” (July 2009, p. 5), while at nearly the same time “[p]ublic spending
                                                                                                    41


is being cut as the government attempts to control an exploding budget deficit” (January 2010,

p. 8).

         Still other countries appear to have been relatively unmotivated by either financial rescue

or countercyclical purposes, and therefore undertook only modest net fiscal expansion. This was

the case with France and Italy following the 2008 crisis. For example, the EIU described the

Italian government as taking “some modest anti-cyclical measures” (January 2009, p. 12), and

having “guaranteed deposits up to about €100,000 and allowed banks to negotiate state help in

recapitalisation, although no major Italian bank is at present in urgent need of state support”

(January 2009, p. 4).

         Politics (c). A final fact evident from panel (b) of Table 3 is that the EIU rarely attributed

fiscal expansion following a financial crisis to political motives. One case where it did so was

Portugal following the 2008 crisis. The EIU wrote: “The 2009 budget marked a break from the

previous fiscal consolidation efforts, partly as a result of the economic slowdown, but also in

light of the upcoming general election” (January 2009, p. 4). Even when political expediency

was mentioned as a motivation, it was typically identified as a minor factor and was often seen

as driving the precise timing of fiscal expansion rather than the overall direction. For example,

in the case of Japan following its 1998 crisis, the EIU said: “With the possibility of a difficult

lower house election and little sign of the hoped-for self-sustaining recovery in private-sector

demand, the government will have little choice but to maintain a broadly accommodating fiscal

policy in 2000-01” (1st quarter 2000, p. 8). That political considerations were rarely mentioned

is perhaps not surprising given that after financial crises there were often more proximate and

obvious motivations for the EIU to discuss.


C. Post-Crisis Austerity

         Table 4 summarizes the narrative evidence from the EIU on deliberate moves to net

austerity during crisis episodes. Panel (a) shows that, according to the EIU, in 19 of the 22
                                                                                                   42


episodes of high financial distress, governments eventually switched to net austerity. Most of

these fiscal contractions were described as large, and typically occurred at least a year or two

after the start of high distress. The only episodes where the EIU did not describe a deliberate

move to net austerity were Japan following its 1998 crisis, and Sweden and Norway following

the 2008 crisis.

      Panel (b) shows the motivations for austerity given by the EIU in each episode. As

discussed above, the motivations reflect a mixture of market access constraints and policymaker

choices. Again, each line corresponds to an episode, so that multiple motivations are obvious.

      Market Access (d). Problems with sovereign market access were cited as a motivation

for fiscal contraction in 14 of the 19 moves to austerity. While in some of these instances market

access was a minor motivation or just one of several motivations, in at least half of them the EIU

described market access as the primary or overarching motivation for austerity. This finding is

somewhat at odds with the empirical evidence in Section III. While the statistical analysis found

some role for market access in driving the fiscal response to crises, it was relatively minor and

decidedly smaller than that of policymaker choices. Overall, the EIU appeared to rank market

access roughly on par with policymaker choices in driving post-crisis austerity.

      The EIU identified market access as a motivation for austerity in a wide range of

situations. For example, it wrote of Sweden following its 1993 crisis: “The government is aware

that the key is to reduce the budget deficit, as only then will it be able to obtain favourable credit

conditions and reduce its public debt” (3rd quarter 1995, p. 11). In this case, market access

problems sound reasonably minor, and the government was undertaking austerity proactively to

reduce interest rates on government bonds. The EIU described a more pressing market access

motivation for Italy following the 2008 crisis: “The minister of the economy, Giulio Tremonti,

appears determined to keep Italy’s public finances under control, fearing that a severe

deterioration would lead to a further sharp widening of interest rate spreads on Italy’s

government debt” (January 2009, p. 4). At the more extreme end of the spectrum is the case of
                                                                                                    43


Portugal following the 2008 crisis. The EIU wrote: “The Socialist Party (PS) government faces a

major challenge to reduce the budget deficit, under severe pressure from financial markets”

(July 2010, p. 3).

      Bailout Conditionality (e). When market access problems became severe, as they did

in Portugal during the global financial crisis, countries were typically forced to turn to the IMF

or other international bailout organizations. The EIU identified 8 cases where a country was

forced to adopt austerity as a condition for international aid. For example, the EIU said of

Portugal in 2011: “The bail-out … will depend on implementation of a severe fiscal squeeze, in

order to reduce the government’s budget deficit to below 3% of GDP and beyond” (July 2011, p.

5). Similarly, the EIU wrote of Ireland: “The government’s economic policy will remain focused

on implementing the austerity and financial and structural reforms agreed in exchange for

access to a €85bn EU/IMF lending facility” (January 2011, p. 3).

      As can be seen from Table 4, the cases where market access problems were severe enough

to lead to an IMF rescue typically involved large net fiscal contractions. For example, the EIU

wrote of Greece: “In May 2010 Greece signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with

representatives of the European Commission, European Central Bank (ECB) and IMF (the

‘troika’), which committed it to a draconian programme of fiscal consolidation and economic

reform” (July 2011, p. 5). The one exception to this pattern was South Korea following its 1998

crisis. Korea was described by the EIU as following required austerity only for a relatively short

time. It is perhaps not a coincidence that the EIU reports also contained frequent mentions of

the fact that “South Korea’s public finances are sound compared with those of many other OECD

countries. Gross government debt stands at around 10% of GDP” (August 2001, p. 11).

      Ideas (f). While the EIU clearly believed that market access problems and bailout

conditionality were motivations for post-crisis austerity in a number of cases, it suggested that

policymakers’ choices also played an important role. The EIU identified domestic policymakers’

ideas as a motivation for austerity in 13 of the 19 cases of deliberate post-crisis fiscal contraction.
                                                                                                 44


      In some cases, the EIU was quite explicit about the role of ideas in motivating austerity.

For example, according to the EIU, Finland adopted austerity following its 1993 crisis because

the “centre-right government” believed it would “reduce unemployment by stimulating the

private sector” (3rd quarter 1993, p. 9). Later in this episode, the EIU confirmed the role of ideas

when it reported that the president “has been quick to reassert that the problem [of high

unemployment] cannot be combated by more state borrowing” (3rd quarter 1994, p. 15).

Likewise, after engaging in both financial rescue and fiscal stimulus in the immediate aftermath

of the 2008 crisis, policymakers in Denmark switched to austerity in mid-2010. According to the

EIU, the prime minister “used his final New Year address before the next general election to

highlight the need for deeper structural reform of the welfare system to prepare Denmark for the

future fiscal challenges of population ageing” (January 2011, p. 13).

      The EIU’s descriptions of the United Kingdom’s move to austerity in mid-2010 provide a

somewhat more circumstantial case that ideas were a key motivation. The EIU reported that

“[t]he chancellor justified the extent of the fiscal squeeze on the grounds that it was needed in

order to retain the confidence of the markets.” It then went on to say, however, that “[d]espite

record issuance, the UK bond market has been one of the strongest in industrialised economies

this year” (July 2010, p. 16). The juxtaposition of the stated fear of market access problems and

benign actual conditions suggests that ideas about the harms of deficits and high debt were key.

The EIU’s statement that “the Conservative chancellor of the exchequer, George Osborne, insists

that weak economic activity will not deflect the coalition from its aggressive deficit-reduction

plans” (July 2011, p. 13) could also suggest an ideological motivation for the austerity.

      The case of the United Kingdom makes it clear that even large fiscal contractions following

a financial crisis can be motivated by ideas. The EIU said of British policy in 2010: “The scale of

fiscal consolidation implied in the budget is immense. Total discretionary tightening of £113bn

(US$170bn) a year is planned by 2014/15 (April-March), compared with current levels,

equivalent to 6.5% of projected GDP” (July 2010, p. 6). Austria is another case where substantial
                                                                                                         45


austerity was driven by ideas (and EU rules). The EIU repeated described contractionary moves

of 2% of GDP or more despite no issues with market access (see, for example, July 2010, p. 9,

and July 2012, p. 4).

      Unfortunately, the EIU did not provide much information about the precise ideas that

motivated policymakers’ choices to adopt austerity. One idea that it sometimes cited was

concern about long-run market access. For example, in discussing the switch to austerity in the

United States in 2011, it reported, “Although there is no immediate pressure on the

government’s finances, Washington appears set on tackling the deficit aggressively” (July 2011,

p. 4). It also said, “The government faces no funding pressures at present …. However, … [h]igh

debt levels create the risk of an eventual rise in US bond yields that would increase borrowing

costs” (p. 6). Another example is provided by Sweden’s decision to pursue contraction in terms

of conventional fiscal policy after its banking crisis in the early 199os. In the context of a

discussion of falling long-term interest rates, the need to attract capital foreign, and the

government’s contractionary fiscal policy, the EIU said, “The central government wants to keep

up this level of enthusiasm. Luckily, its credit rating is still good and should remain so” (3rd

quarter 1993, p. 12). The United Kingdom’s shift to austerity in 2010 also appears to largely fit

into this category. As described above, the government cited the need to maintain market access

as a key motivation for austerity despite exceptionally low long-term interest rates. Indeed, the

only potentially imminent issue with market access the EIU reported in this entire episode was a

possible downgrade of the United Kingdom’s sovereign bond rating from AAA (July 2009, p. 6;

January 2010, p. 3). Thus the concerns involving market access appear to have been largely

long-term. 32

      Concerns about future market access are related to the idea that a financial crisis can lead


32 The one piece of evidence in the other direction is that the EIU reported, “The budget’s austere tone has

reduced near-term market concerns over fiscal sustainability” (July 2010, p. 6). However, since this
discussion came soon after the fears of the possible downgrade, and since the EIU also reported that
“there is no indication that investors are shunning UK gilts” (p. 16), it appears that the EIU was referring
to the potential downgrade, not the possibility of severe loss of market access.
                                                                                                46


to a sovereign debt crisis (for example, Reinhart and Rogoff 2009). Following the global

financial crisis, two other ideas that received considerable attention are that crossing a specific

debt threshold can greatly harm growth (for example, Reinhart and Rogoff 2010), and that

austerity can be expansionary, particularly if it focuses on spending cuts (for example, Alesina

and Ardagna 2010). However, these ideas barely registered in the EIU Country Reports. The

closest the EIU came to discussing a debt threshold came in its analysis of France, where it often

mentioned the possibility that debt would reach the 90% of GDP level emphasized by Reinhart

and Rogoff. Its strongest statement was, “With public debt forecast to rise to close to 90% of

GDP by 2012, an additional risk is that France could lose its AAA rating on sovereign debt,

which would push up interest costs” (January 2011, p. 8). But this idea did not appear in other

episodes. And even in the case of France, the EIU was not explicit that it attached particular

importance to the 90% figure, rather than just using it as a convenient round number to

describe the trajectory of France’s debt.

      Similarly, ideas related to Alesina and Ardagna’s work received only a few passing

mentions. For example, at one point the EIU attributed the composition of fiscal policy in

Ireland, but not its overall direction, to these ideas. In explaining why a budget consolidation

was “to be achieved almost exclusively by expenditure reductions,” it said, “the government has

explicitly acknowledged that international evidence points to spending cuts being a more

effective route to consolidation than tax increases” (January 2010, pp. 5–6). Similarly, the EIU

implicitly cited this line of work in giving its own views of fiscal policy in the United Kingdom,

but it did not attribute this view to policymakers. It said, “The government has been criticised in

some quarters for targeting too rapid a pace of deficit reduction at a time of economic

uncertainty and minimal funding pressures, but there is no accepted orthodoxy on the impact

that fiscal austerity will have on economic activity” (January 2011, p. 7).

      Most often, however, the EIU did not provide specific information about the ideas that

motivated policymakers’ choices to pursue austerity. Instead, it simply reported that
                                                                                                47


policymakers viewed high debt or deficits as problems that needed to be addressed. For

example, in discussing Norway’s shift to austerity in the wake of its banking crisis in the early

1990s, it said, “policymakers are having to concentrate on potential long-term problems. One of

these is the budget deficit” (3rd quarter 1994, p. 6). Similarly, in discussing Denmark move to

austerity following the global financial crisis, the EIU referred to “[t]he need for budgetary

consolidation” without explaining the reasons for the need (January 2010, p. 5). And it reported,

“the deterioration in the public finances has also made the electorate aware of the long-term

costs of sustaining Denmark’s welfare benefits” (p. 4). Another example comes from the EIU’s

discussion of France’s turn to austerity in the wake of its crisis in 2008. It said simply that one

“legacy of the 2008-09 downturn” is “a need for fiscal tightening,” without explaining why (July

2011, p. 8).

      European Union Fiscal Rules (g). A motivation for austerity following financial

distress also related to ideas involved the fiscal rules set by the EU. As discussed above, such

rules can be thought of as reflecting the ideas of EU policymakers. This is especially true given

that the EU appears to have had substantial leeway in how aggressively it pressured member

countries to conform to the guidelines. There was also a role for domestic policymakers’ ideas in

how willingly they acceded to EU wishes. This was especially true in cases where countries

worked to meet the guidelines out of a desire to qualify for membership.

      The EIU mentioned EU fiscal rules as a motivation for fiscal actions in 11 of the 19 cases of

post-crisis austerity in our sample. Four of these cases involved countries taking actions in

advance of participation in an EU program. The EIU wrote of Sweden in 1995: “The government

is bullish about the fiscal outlook. Its EMU [Economic and Monetary Union] convergence plan

presented in June includes new savings measures to be introduced, if needed, from 1997” (3rd

quarter 1995, p. 1). Finland following its 1993 crisis was also described as undertaking austerity

to satisfy EMU criteria (3rd quarter 1995, p. 5). Likewise, both Turkey’s and Hungary’s post-

crisis austerity was partly attributed to desire to join the EU. For example, the EIU said of
                                                                                                48


Turkey: “The IMF will provide the extra lending in return for government abidance by a

programme of tight fiscal policy backed by privatisation and structural reforms …. This

programme had already been set out in the three-year Pre-Accession Economic Programme

(PEP) drawn up for the EU on November 30th” (January 2005, p. 19).

      The other cases where the EIU mentioned EU rules as a motivation for post-crisis

austerity involve existing EU members. For example, it wrote of Austria following the 2008

crisis: “The coalition has agreed in principle with the European Commission in its 2010-13

Stability Programme to act to reduce the government deficit to below 3% of GDP by 2013” (July

2011, p. 5). Similarly, for France following the global financial crisis, the EIU wrote that

“Germany will press for more intrusive budget monitoring of euro area members, which would

be likely to stoke further tension with France, given the country’s poor fiscal record and habit of

flouting the euro area’s fiscal rules when these conflict with its domestic priorities” (July 2010,

p. 5). This statement makes it clear that EU rules and actions sometimes reflected the ideas of

foreign policymakers.

      Countercyclical austerity (h). Very rarely, the EIU described countries as

undertaking austerity at some point after a crisis for countercyclical purposes. That is,

policymakers tightened fiscal policy to prevent the economy from overheating. The most obvious

case involved Norway following its crisis in the early 1990s. As can be seen from Figure 3a,

Norway grew much more rapidly following its crisis than one would have predicted based on its

previous history. The EIU wrote: “as growth accelerates the government will continue to

introduce spending cuts in a counter-cyclical fashion,” and, “as growth is picking up it finds

itself in a position to make the necessary cuts, while at the same time overseeing a reduction, if

not the eradication, of the budget deficit” (1st quarter 1995, pp. 5 and 11).

      Overall, the EIU’s discussion of the motivation for post-crisis austerity paints a mixed

picture. The EIU clearly saw an important role for market access problems, often accompanied

by an IMF bailout and conditionality, in driving austerity. At the same time, domestic
                                                                                                            49


policymakers’ ideas, often interacting with EU rules and ideas, were also seen as an important

factor. Thus, the EIU provides narrative evidence that post-crisis austerity was often at least

partly a choice.


D. Narrative Evidence on the Role of Debt in Driving the Fiscal Response to Crises

      A central finding from our statistical work is that the debt-to-GDP ratio has substantial

predictive power for the fiscal policy response to financial distress, and that this is true even

controlling for more direct measures of market access. It therefore makes sense to ask what our

narrative analysis shows about the link between debt and the fiscal policy response to a crisis.

      In examining the EIU Reports for evidence about this issue, we look for cases where the

EIU explicitly cited countries’ debt as mattering, as opposed to more general comments about

influences from countries’ fiscal situations. And we focus on cases where the EIU saw debt as

affecting the views and behavior of investors, policymakers, and international organizations,

rather than ones where it appeared to be just expressing its own concerns. Of course, the EIU

probably did not report every instance where debt influenced the policy response. But we take

discussion of the role of debt in the Country Reports as an indication that debt was important.

      The first finding is that the EIU often described debt as affecting the fiscal policy response

to crises. In 18 of our 22 episodes of high distress, the EIU believed that debt had at least some

impact on the policy response. 33

      In two of those episodes (Norway and Sweden following the 2008 crisis), the EIU saw low

debt as an important factor behind fiscal expansion. For example, in explaining Sweden’s

continued expansionary policy well after the peak of its financial distress, the EIU said: “With


33 The four episodes where the EIU did not describe a link are Norway (1991), Mexico, Korea, and Ireland.
The EIU’s discussion of policy in Norway following its crisis included one reference to the possibility of
net debt becoming positive, and of this development having the potential to affect policy (3rd quarter 1992,
p. 5). But the EIU did not attribute this view to policymakers or tie it to actual policy. In the cases of Korea
and Mexico, the EIU reported severe problems with market access, but did not connect them with the
level or trajectory or debt. And in the case of Ireland, the EIU viewed the large deficits arising from its
massive financial rescue as an important source of its adoption of austerity, but again did not assign a role
to debt.
                                                                                                  50


public debt and the government deficit low, the coalition has been able to introduce some

stimulus measures” (January 2012, p. 3).

      In the remaining 16 cases, the EIU described high or rising debt as a force fostering fiscal

austerity or limiting expansion. The information about the channels through which the EIU

described debt as affecting policy in these episodes is summarized in Table 5. The most common

channel was through the views of domestic policymakers. The level or increase of debt was

frequently invoked as a reason to limit expansion or switch to contraction, and altering the path

of the debt-to-GDP ratio was often an explicit goal of policy. For example, the EIU reported that

a contractionary budget in Finland following its 1993 crisis was “intended as part of a drive to

ensure that state debt does not rise beyond 70% of GDP” (3rd quarter 1993, p. 4). Similarly, the

EIU described how, soon after Austria’s 2008 crisis, the vice-chancellor “indicated that the

government will begin to unwind its fiscal stimulus measures as it seeks to prepare for austerity

measures,” and that he “rejected a third stimulus package, claiming that Austria must focus on

reining in its rising government deficit and public debt” (January 2010, pp. 5 and 11). In some of

the cases, the apparent link between debt and idea-driven policy is more tenuous. For example,

in analyzing the U.S. response to its 2007 crisis, the EIU reported: “the rise in federal debt … is

… a serious concern” (January 2010, p. 6), and, “US public debt has risen sharply in recent years

…. Washington appears set on tackling the deficit aggressively” (July 2011, p. 4). But it did not

clearly tie these views to specific policy actions.

      Table 5 also shows that in a few cases, direct concern about the level of debt had

substantial effects through EU fiscal rules. In describing fiscal policy in Finland a few years after

its crisis, for example, the EIU said: “Economic policy will be driven by the government’s

determination to take part in the third stage of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) …. The

most immediate threat to Finland’s qualifying for inclusion is its public debt …. Fiscal policy will

therefore remain tight” (3rd quarter 1995, p. 5).
                                                                                                51


      Importantly, debt also played a significant role through its influence on market access. In

many cases, the link was direct: debt was a source of concern to investors, and so led to

problems with market access. For example, the EIU reported that in Italy following the global

financial crisis: “The spread of the Greek debt crisis since the end of 2009 forced Italy … to

reduce [its] budget deficits and government debt burdens in order to prevent a further loss of

investor confidence” (July 2010, p. 6). As another example, in describing Turkish fiscal policy in

the wake of its 2001 crisis, the EIU linked the government’s austerity to a desire to avoid a

sovereign debt crisis, and linked the possibility of such a crisis to investors’ concerns about

Turkey’s high debt ratio: “A tighter 2003 budget than initially expected [and other factors] …

should be enough for Turkey to avoid a crisis this year. But because of the sheer size of Turkey’s

government debt (about 85% of GDP at end-2002), the widening current-account deficit and

Turkey’s vulnerability to sudden shifts of investor sentiment, the risk of a financial crisis will

remain high during the outlook period” (July 2003, p. 9).

      In several cases, the EIU discussed loss of market access leading countries to turn to

international organizations for help, which then imposed conditionality that put considerable

emphasis on the behavior of debt. One example of such conditionality is provided by Portugal

following its crisis. The EIU stated: “A bail-out from the joint EU/IMF emergency credit facility

will entail strict fiscal consolidation,” a key goal of which would be “to stabilise public debt by

2013” (July 2011, pp. 4 and 6). Another example comes from Hungary after its crisis, where the

EIU reported: “The [European] Commission and the IMF both called for an exact timetable on

Hungary’s path towards a state debt ceiling of 50% of GDP” (July 2011, p. 13).

      A final finding, which is not shown in Table 5, concerns the type of fiscal policy that the

EIU viewed as being influenced by debt: in every case where the EIU perceived debt as

promoting austerity or limiting expansion, it was through its influence on conventional fiscal

policy. That is, there were no cases where the EIU reported that government debt limited the

extent of financial rescue. The closest was a hypothetical about Italy: “In the event of a collapse
                                                                                                            52


of the banking sector …, the Italian state would have less credibility than Germany, France or

the UK if it were to intervene in a dramatic way, since public debt is over 100% of GDP”

(January 2009, p. 4). But even in this case, the EIU did not view debt as limiting financial

rescue. This reinforces the evidence for near-universal support for rescue in the event of severe

financial distress.

      The strong evidence from the narrative analysis that debt was often a driver of the fiscal

policy response to a crisis is consistent with—and helps explain—the finding from our statistical

work that the debt-to-GDP ratio is a powerful predictor of the policy response, even controlling

for what are arguably more direct measures of market access. The narrative analysis finds that

not just investors, but domestic policymakers, the EU, and the IMF, used the level of debt and

its changes as important markers of countries’ financial health and an important guide to policy.

Thus, it is not surprising that we find that the debt-to-GDP ratio appears to be an important

determinant of how countries respond to financial distress, and that it appears to matter even

controlling for direct measures of market access.


E. The EIU’s Assessments of the Fiscal Response to a Crisis and Data on the Prior
   Debt Ratio

      Our final exercise is to examine the relationship between the EIU’s descriptions of the

fiscal response to financial distress and countries’ prior debt-to-GDP ratios. Specifically, for each

of the various groups of episodes reported in Tables 3, 4, and 5, we find the average debt ratio

across the episodes in the group. In this way, we are blending the narrative evidence on the size

and motivations of the fiscal response to crises with actual data on the debt-to-GDP ratio. As in

our statistical work, to avoid direct reverse causation from fiscal policy to debt, we use figures

for debt as of the end of the year before when the EIU first described a development. 34 If debt is


34 Recall that we use the first EIU report of a year largely to gain insight into developments late in the year

before. For developments first reported in these reports, we therefore use the debt number from the end
of the calendar year two years before that of the report. Thus, for example, for the U.S. financial rescue,
which was first reported in the January 2009 report, we use the debt number for 2007. When we report
debt numbers for cases where the EIU did not describe a development (such as episodes where the EIU
                                                                                                         53


an important determinant of how fiscal policymakers respond to financial distress, one would

expect to see a connection between the prior debt-to-GDP ratio and the EIU’s accounts of the

nature and determinants of fiscal policy following crises. At the same time, because the number

of observations in each category is small and the EIU’s general descriptions of fiscal policy are

presumably less precise than our data, we do not view this evidence as central to our analysis.

      Table 6 presents the results. The patterns go in the directions one would expect, but not

overwhelmingly so. Debt was on average slightly lower in situations where the EIU saw the

adoption of highly expansionary policy following high financial distress than in cases where it

saw a move to only small (or no) expansion; and debt was noticeably higher when the EIU

reported the adoption of sharp austerity than when it reported a shift to only mild austerity.35

The debt ratio was typically 10 to 15 percentage points higher in situations where the EIU first

reported a given motivation for austerity than when it first saw a given motivation for

expansion; this is what one would expect if debt affects the direction of the policy response. And,

consistent with our findings that debt affects the policy response to financial distress through

multiple channels, the average debt ratio varied little across cases with different motivations for

expansion, or across cases with different motivations for austerity.

      The results are stronger when we turn to cases where the EIU reported an impact of debt

on policy—perhaps not surprisingly, the EIU perceived debt as having a more contractionary

influence on policy when the debt-to-GDP ratio was larger. Most notably, debt was much lower

in the cases where the EIU reported that debt fostered expansionary policy, or when it never

described an influence of debt, than in the cases where it saw debt contributing to austerity. 36

And looking across the various channels through which the EIU reported that debt affected

austerity, the average debt ratio was relatively high for all of them. It was highest when debt

never saw austerity), we use the figures from the year before distress first reached 7. Finally, because our
debt data for Mexico do not begin until 1996, the figures we report do not include Mexico’s crisis episode.
35 As an accounting matter, the reason the average debt ratio is quite high for the three countries with no

austerity is that one of them (Japan) had very high debt.
36 The reason the entry for “No role mentioned” is based on three observations rather than four is that as

described above, we do not have debt data for Mexico’s crisis episode.
                                                                                                 54


affected austerity through conditionality and market access, and lowest when its effects operated

through the ideas of domestic policymakers. Thus, the relationship between the EIU’s

descriptions of the fiscal policy response to a crisis and the actual debt ratio provides some

additional support for the findings that debt affects the policy response to financial distress, and

that it does so both via market access and through other mechanisms.



V. CONCLUSIONS

      Summary. There is compelling evidence that a country’s fiscal response to a crisis is

correlated with its prior debt-to-GDP ratio. Countries that face a crisis with lower debt pursue

more expansionary fiscal policy than countries that face a crisis with higher debt. Indeed, our

estimates based on data for 30 OECD countries since 1980 suggest that facing a crisis with a

debt ratio one standard deviation below the sample average is associated with a high-

employment surplus in the aftermath of a crisis that is roughly 4 percentage points smaller (that

is, more expansionary) than facing a crisis with a debt ratio one standard deviation above the

average. Moreover, this large difference in the policy response is associated with a large

difference in the aftermath: low-debt countries experience much milder downturns following a

crisis than high-debt countries.

      This paper seeks to understand why the prior debt-to-GDP ratio appears to matter for the

fiscal response to crises. We find that including direct measures of sovereign market access,

such as long-term government bond rates or sovereign credit ratings, does not eliminate, or

even greatly attenuate, the estimated impact of the debt-to-GDP ratio on the high-employment

surplus following crises. This strongly suggests that the debt ratio does not matter simply

through its impact on current market access or because it is a proxy for market access. Rather,

an important part of why it matters appears to be through its impact on policymaker choices.

      Narrative evidence from the Economist Intelligence Unit suggests a somewhat larger role

for market access in driving the fiscal response to crises than the statistical evidence. This is
                                                                                                  55


especially true if IMF fiscal conditionality is thought of as an extension of market access

problems. But, the evidence from the EIU also indicates that policymakers’ choices were often

important. In at least half of the cases of post-crisis austerity, the EIU assigned a central role to

the ideas of domestic policymakers or European Union fiscal rules. Moreover, the EIU provides

evidence that policymakers’ choices depend in substantial part on the debt-to-GDP ratio. Thus,

it confirms that the debt ratio matters in considerable part through those choices.

      Taken together, the statistical and narrative evidence suggests that both sovereign market

access and policymakers’ choices help account for the observed correlation between a country’s

debt-to-GDP ratio and the fiscal response to crises. The combined weight of the two types of

evidence, however, points to policymakers’ choices as somewhat more central.

      Possible Policy Implications. There are two directions one might be tempted to go in

drawing policy implications from these findings. The first would be to argue that the fact that a

high debt-to-GDP ratio is clearly associated with worse post-crisis outcomes is a compelling

reason for countries to keep their debt ratio in check if they want to avoid extended periods of

poor economic performance. By doing so, a country could reduce the chance that it would face

severe market access problems that forced it to respond to a crisis with austerity. It would also

mean that domestic policymakers would be less likely to choose counterproductive austerity

following a crisis or face pressure from external organizations to do so.

      But our finding that the debt ratio matters for the post-crisis fiscal response in substantial

part through policymakers’ choices suggests a second possibility. Policymakers in countries with

good market access could choose not to base post-crisis fiscal policy on the debt ratio. That is,

rather than respond to the evidence that debt matters for the fiscal response by reducing debt

proactively, policymakers could change their ideas about the desirable fiscal response to a

financial crisis when the debt ratio is high. Similarly, the EU could adopt a more flexible set of

fiscal rules that allowed member countries to expand aggressively following crises, regardless of

debt levels. Even the IMF, which is only called in when market access disappears, could adopt
                                                                                                  56


less rigid fiscal constraints as a condition for its assistance.

      Importantly, since we find that debt matters for the fiscal response to crises through both

market access and policymakers’ choices, these two possibilities are not mutually exclusive.

Countries could work to keep debt low as an insurance policy for future crises and to minimize

market risks. But, confronted with high financial distress, domestic policymakers and leaders of

international organizations could not let debt loads drive the fiscal response unnecessarily.

      Such a combined strategy would obviously involve important dynamic considerations. If

high-debt countries did not choose tight fiscal policy following a crisis, it is possible that market

access problems would eventually develop. But this possibility does not mean that the status quo

of high-debt countries with ample market access choosing austerity following a crisis is

necessarily optimal. An alternative is a new policymaker consensus that stresses running

responsible fiscal policy in ordinary times, and undertaking aggressive fiscal expansion if at all

possible in response to a financial crisis.

Notes: The figures show the forecast errors for real GDP based on estimation of equation (1) over the period 1980:1–
2017:2. Forecast errors are shown for the 21 episodes where distress reached 7 or above and sufficient lags are
available to construct the forecasts. The forecasts use the realization of the distress variable up through the half-year
that it reached 7 or higher, and actual GDP up through one half-year before that occurs. The dates given are when
distress first reached 7 or above.

values of 𝛿 ℎ for different values of h, scaled by 7 times twice the sample standard deviation of the gross debt-to-GDP
ratio. Panel (b) shows the implied impulse response functions of real GDP to an impulse of 7 in financial distress for a
country with a debt-to-GDP ratio in the previous calendar year one standard deviation below the sample mean (“with
more fiscal space”), and for a country with a debt ratio one standard deviation above the sample mean (“with less
fiscal space”). The dotted lines show the two-standard-error confidence bands.

Notes: The figure is based on estimates of equation (3) over the period 1980:1–2017:2. Panel (a) shows the estimated
values of 𝛿 ℎ for different values of h, scaled by 7 times twice the sample standard deviation of the gross debt-to-GDP
ratio. Panel (b) shows the implied impulse response functions of the high-employment surplus to an impulse of 7 in
financial distress for a country with a debt-to-GDP ratio in the previous calendar year one standard deviation below
the sample mean (“with more fiscal space”), and for a country with a debt ratio one standard deviation above the
sample mean (“with less fiscal space”). The dotted lines show the two-standard-error confidence bands.

Notes: The figure shows the behavior in selected episodes of high financial distress of financial distress (green line,
left axis), the change in the estimated high-employment surplus from its value two half-years before distress reached
7 or more (blue bars, left axis), and the debt-to-GDP ratio (red line, right axis). Panel (a) shows a case where debt was
high throughout the episode; panel (b) shows a case where it was low throughout the episode.

Notes: The figure shows the behavior in selected episodes of high financial distress of financial distress (green line,
left axis), the change in the estimated high-employment surplus from its value two half-years before distress reached
7 or more (blue bars, left axis), and the debt-to-GDP ratio (red line, right axis). The two cases shown are ones where
the debt-to-GDP ratio rose over the course of the episode and fiscal policy was first expansionary and then moved in a
contractionary direction.

Notes: The panels show how the response of fiscal policy to financial distress varies with individual direct measures
sovereign market access. Each panel is based on estimates of equation (4) over the period 1980:1–2017:2 using a
different measure of market access. Panels (a), (b), and (c) show the estimated values of 𝜆ℎ for different values of h,
scaled by 7 times twice the sample standard deviation of the relevant measure of market access. Thus, they show how
the response to an innovation of 7 in financial distress changes with an improvement of two standard deviations in
the indicated measure of access. Panel (d) shows the estimated values of 𝜆ℎ for different values of h, scaled by 7.
Thus, it shows how the response differs between a country not subject to an IMF program and a country subject to a
program. The dotted lines show the two-standard-error confidence bands.

Notes: The figure shows the how the response of fiscal policy to financial distress varies with sovereign market access
when several measures of market access are considered jointly. It is based on estimates of equation (4) over the
period 1980:1–2017:2 including three measures of market access (the long-term government bond rate, the S&P
rating, and a dummy variable for not being under an IMF program). The figure plots the sum of the interaction term
for each measure of market access times twice its standard deviation. The sum is then multiplied by 7 so that it shows
how the response to an innovation of 7 in financial distress changes with an improvement of two standard deviations
in all three measures of market access. The dotted lines show the two-standard-error confidence bands.

Notes: The panels show how the response of fiscal policy to financial distress varies with individual direct measures
of sovereign market access, based on a specification that also includes the debt-to-GDP ratio and its interaction with
financial distress. Each panel is based on estimates of equation (5) over the period 1980:1–2017:2 using a different
measure of market access. Panels (a), (b), and (c) show the estimated values of 𝜆ℎ for different values of h, scaled by 7
times twice the sample standard deviation of the relevant measure of market access. Thus, they show how the
response to an innovation of 7 in financial distress changes with an improvement of two standard deviations in the
indicated measure of access. Panel (d) shows the estimated values of 𝜆ℎ for different values of h, scaled by 7. Thus, it
shows how the response differs between a country not subject to an IMF program and a country subject to a program.
Each panel also shows the estimated values of 𝛿 ℎ for different values of h, scaled by 7 times twice the sample
standard deviation of the debt ratio. Thus it shows how the response changes with a decline of two standard
deviations in the debt-to-GDP in the specification including the indicated measure of market access and its
interaction with financial distress. The pale line denoted “baseline debt-to-GDP” shows how the response changes
with a decline of two standard deviations in the debt-to-GDP ratio in the specification excluding the measure of
market access (but using the same sample period as the expanded regression). The dotted lines show the two-
standard-error confidence bands.

Notes: The figure shows how the response of fiscal policy to financial distress varies with measures of sovereign
market access when several measures of market access are considered jointly, and the specification also includes the
debt-to-GDP ratio and its interaction with financial distress. The figure is based on estimates of equation (5) over the
period 1980:1–2017:2 including three measures of market access (the long-term government bond rate, the S&P
rating, and the dummy variable for not being under an IMF program). The figure plots the sum of the interaction
term for each measure of market access times twice its standard deviation. The sum is then multiplied by 7 so that it
shows how the response to an innovation of 7 in financial distress changes with an improvement of two standard
deviations in all three measures of market access. The figure also shows how the response changes with a decline of
two standard deviations in the debt-to-GDP in the specification including the three measures of market access and
their interaction with financial distress. The pale line denoted “baseline debt-to-GDP” shows how the response
changes with a decline of two standard deviations in the debt-to-GDP ratio in the specification excluding the
measures of market access (but using the same sample period as the expanded regression). The dotted lines show the
two-standard-error confidence bands.

            Summary of the Motivations for Fiscal Actions Following Financial Crises
               as Described in the Economist Intelligence Unit Country Reports

                                  (Crisis episodes in chronological order;
              date given is the half-year in which financial distress first reached 7 or above)

United States (1990:2)
Fiscal policy in the U.S. was basically moderately contractionary throughout. It was driven by two ideas of
domestic policymakers. One was that deficits and debt were bad and that the deficit needed to be reduced.
The other was that short-run stabilization was best left to monetary policy, which freed fiscal policy to
focus on the long-run fiscal outlook and other long-run issues. There was a tiny bit of fiscal expansion in
1992 driven by countercyclical and political motivations.

Norway (1991:2)
Norway undertook moderately expansionary fiscal policy until well after the crisis for countercyclical
purposes and financial rescue. Policy then turned mildly contractionary. The shift was partly the result of
policymakers’ belief that fiscal rectitude was desirable (despite Norway’s extremely strong fiscal position),
and partly a countercyclical response to strong growth.

Finland (1993:1)
Finland initially undertook a large fiscal expansion for financial rescue. Otherwise, fiscal policy was
contractionary throughout, often strongly so. The first contractionary moves stemmed from policymakers’
beliefs that deficit reduction and low debt were beneficial. Later, a desire to join the EMU was also
important. Market access was mentioned, but was confined to two reports and emphasized only in one.

Sweden (1993:1)
There was much fiscal expansion in Sweden for financial rescue early on. This expansion was partly
counterbalanced by austerity on other fronts owing to a mixture of ideas (the Conservative-led
government wanted to shrink the welfare state) and concern about spreads (so a form of market access).
Fiscal policy then switched to net austerity. Ideas played a role after the change in government in 1994:
the new government also supported getting the budget under control and the electorate seemed to
support that. Later on, a desire to meet EU criteria was an important motivation for continued austerity.

Mexico (1996:1)
There was substantial financial rescue in Mexico, but on net fiscal policy was contractionary throughout,
at times strongly so. The main motivation for the austerity was a blend of market access and IMF
conditionality. Market access was a substantial problem and the government was trying to regain the
confidence of investors and satisfy the IMF. There was also an element of ideas at the end of the period.
The outgoing president wanted to prevent a crisis at the handover of government in 2000, and so wanted
to run careful policy to prevent trouble.

Japan (1997:2)
Japan engaged in at least modest fiscal expansion throughout the post-crisis period. Initially, it undertook
some fiscal stimulus for countercyclical reasons and financial rescue (though ideas about the importance
of fiscal rectitude may have limited actions). In mid-1998, a new government came in and did more
aggressive stimulus and financial rescue. There was a little concern about market access that may have
restrained stimulus, but it did not lead to austerity. Political considerations and countercyclical aims were
the main motivations for continued fiscal expansion later in the post-crisis period.

Korea (1997:2)
Korea initially engaged in some fiscal contraction due to IMF conditionality and problems with market
access. Pretty quickly there was a move toward modest fiscal expansion driven by countercyclical aims,
financial rescue, and political considerations. Eventually the government shifted to roughly neutral fiscal
policy as the economy recovered.
                                                                                                           73


Turkey (2001:1)
Turkey engaged in substantial financial rescue, especially early on. But, this was followed by strong
austerity. It is hard to separate market access and IMF conditionality as the motivation for the austerity.
Lack of market access led to the IMF program; once in place, the IMF conditionality was strictly enforced
(both by the IMF and by markets). At times politics and ideas led policymakers to suggest less austerity.
Later in the analysis period, Turkey’s desire to join the EU was also a driving force for fiscal contraction.

United States (2007:2)
Fiscal policy in the U.S. was initially highly expansionary for countercyclical purposes and financial
rescue. It then leveled out and finally turned slightly contractionary. Policymakers’ ideas about the harms
of the debt and deficits in their own right, plus some concerns about market access (specifically, long-term
interest rates and bond ratings), limited the expansionary actions and prompted the ultimate move to
contraction.

Iceland (2008:1)
Iceland initially engaged in a large fiscal expansion related to financial rescue. Then, there was substantial
fiscal contraction due to loss of market access and subsequent IMF and Nordic conditionality. The IMF,
however, did not force much contraction in 2009, when the recession was at its worst. There was a small
continuing role for market access in fostering austerity because ratings on sovereign debt affected
borrowing costs of municipalities and companies. Also there may have been a small role for domestic
policymakers’ own ideas—at times the government seemed to go further with austerity than the IMF
required. In addition, there was a fight within the governing coalition, suggesting again that ideas
mattered.

United Kingdom (2008:1)
The U.K. spent a substantial amount on financial rescue, but did only a very small amount of fiscal
stimulus. With Cameron’s election in May 2010, the government switched to extreme austerity. The
government said that future market access was the reason, but the EIU emphasized that actual market
access was excellent. This juxtaposition may suggest an important role for ideas.

Austria (2008:2)
Fiscal policy in Austria was initially mildly expansionary for countercyclical reasons and financial rescue,
but there was then a switch to substantial austerity. The change appeared to result roughly equally from
EU rules and from domestic policymakers’ ideas about the benefits of fiscal rectitude.

France (2008:2)
France initially undertook mildly expansionary fiscal policy for countercyclical purposes and financial
rescue. But the size was limited, and policy soon switched to austerity and then remained mildly
contractionary. The limitations on the size of the initial expansion and the initial move to austerity were
driven mainly by domestic policymakers’ ideas about the benefits of fiscal restraint. But market access
issues and EU rules both played nontrivial roles in the continued austerity.

Italy (2008:2)
Italy engaged in only trivial fiscal stimulus and little financial rescue in the post-crisis period. This was
followed by moderate austerity for a number of years. A key reason for the austerity was problems with
market access and rising sovereign spreads. EU rules and pressure were another factor, and there was
perhaps a small role for domestic ideas toward the end of the analysis period.

Norway (2008:2)
Policymakers in Norway undertook moderate fiscal expansion in response to the crisis, motivated by both
countercyclical aims and financial rescue. The EIU thought Norway’s oil revenues and low debt were
reasons it could do this. The government then scaled back the stimulus in response to recovery to prevent
the economy from overheating, but it never switched to net austerity.
                                                                                                            74


Portugal (2008:2)
Portugal initially engaged in mildly expansionary policy for countercyclical purposes (with just a small
amount of financial rescue). Political considerations in the run-up to the election also played a role in
driving fiscal expansion. EU rules and actions were a factor in the early moves toward austerity. Starting
in mid-2010, Portugal lost the confidence of foreign investors. Lack of market access followed by IMF
conditionality led to extreme austerity. The austerity and conditionality continued through the end of the
analysis period.

Spain (2008:2)
Spain initially engaged in mildly expansionary fiscal policy for countercyclical reasons and financial
rescue. But policy then turned strongly contractionary and remained so. The main reason was market
access, as Spain faced high sovereign spreads and ratings downgrades. Toward the end of the period, the
problems with market access led to the possibility of Spain needing to turn to outside help, which created
additional pressures for austerity. There were some indications of a role for domestic policymakers’ ideas,
but those were never central.

Sweden (2008:2)
Despite its comparatively small-government, supply-side ideology, the Swedish government pursued
moderately expansionary fiscal policy throughout, for both financial rescue and, especially,
countercyclical reasons. The EIU thought that Sweden’s initial surplus and low debt were important
reasons such expansion was feasible. The degree of stimulus was adjusted (in both directions) in response
to the state of the economy.

Denmark (2009:1)
Denmark initially pursued slightly expansionary fiscal policy for countercyclical reasons and financial
rescue. But policy then turned generally moderately contractionary. The switch stemmed mainly from
policymakers’ ideas about the benefits of fiscal responsibility, with a secondary role for EU rules. There
was only one minor mention of concern about market access.

Greece (2009:1)
Greece’s initial fiscal policy response consisted of a small expansion for financial rescue and small
conventional fiscal actions in both directions driven by a range of motivations, with at most a small net
fiscal expansion. But policy soon turned to austerity, which became increasingly severe over time. The
initial turn to austerity stemmed from a combination of EU rules and issues with market access, with
hints of a role for domestic policymakers’ ideas. The later, harsher austerity came about as Greece lost
market access and then turned to international organizations for aid, which came with strong
conditionality.

Hungary (2009:1)
Despite a small initial bank rescue, fiscal policy in Hungary was on net contractionary throughout, often
strongly so. It was initially driven mainly by conditionality associated with an IMF-led program that
predated the crisis. Later, it was driven mainly by concerns about market access, with some role for
attempting to obtain renewed IMF support. A desire to comply with EU rules in order to join the euro
played a role at times, but was never central.

Ireland (2009:1)
Ireland initially engaged in extreme financial rescue, partially counteracted by austerity in other areas. A
loss of market access then led to extreme overall austerity. This was followed by continued austerity to
comply with the conditionality of the IMF/EU bailout. Conditionality remained central through the end of
the analysis period.
