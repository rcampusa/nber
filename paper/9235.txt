       The paper estimates a long-run demand function for M1, using U.S. data for 1959-1993.
This paper interprets deviations from this long-run relation with Goldfeld’s partial adjustment
model. A key innovation is the choice of the interest rate in the money demand function. Most
previous work uses a short-term market rate, but this paper uses the average return on “near monies”
– close substitutes for M1 such as savings accounts and money market mutual funds. This approach
yields a predicted path of M1 velocity that closely matches the data. The volatility of velocity after
1980 is explained by volatility in the returns on near monies.
