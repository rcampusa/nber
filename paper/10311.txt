Changes in the Disparities in Chronic Disease during the Course of the Twentieth Century

                                           ABSTRACT

Longitudinal studies support the proposition that the extent and severity of chronic conditions in

middle and late ages are to a large extent the outcome of environmental insults at early ages,

including in utero. Data from the Early Indicators program project undertaken at the Center for

Population Economics suggest that the range of differences in exposure to disease has narrowed

greatly over the course of the twentieth century, that age-specific prevalence rates of chronic

diseases were much lower at the end of the twentieth century than they were at the beginning of the

last century or during the last half of the nineteenth century, and that there has been a significant

delay in the onset of chronic diseases over the course of the twentieth century. These trends appear

to be related to changes in levels of environmental hazards and in body size. These findings have

led investigators to posit a synergism between technological and physiological improvements. This

synergism has contributed to reductions in inequality in real income, body size, and life expectancy

during the twentieth century.

       The main proposition of my talk today is that the extent and severity of chronic

conditions in middle and late ages are to a large extent the outcome of environmental

insults at early ages, including in utero. Chronic diseases at middle and late ages are due

to a large extent to the toll taken by infectious diseases at young ages. Evidence to

support this proposition comes partly from the study being conducted here at Chicago

and elsewhere on the aging of the Union Army Veterans, and I’ll refer to that study as the

Early Indicators Project (EI). But it is also supported by other longitudinal studies in the

U.S. and abroad.

       Some recent studies indicate two-generation effects among humans. Perhaps the

most widely case involves women who were born or were in gestation during the Dutch

famine, which lasted about eight or nine months toward the end World War II and was

precipitated by sharp reductions in rations. Although this famine resulted in an elevated

perinatal death rate, it was for a long time thought that women who survived and were

subsequently well-fed were just as healthy as women who were born before the famine or

afterwards. However when these famine women began giving birth, their children had

elevated perinatal death rates. Of course we will still have to wait to see what the effects

of the famine will be on the rate of increase in chronic conditions and on longevity at

older ages. However, there is evidence that children of mothers who were in the first

trimester of gestation when the famine struck and who survived infancy have elevated

prevalence of coronary heart disease now that they are in their mid-fifties (Roseboom et

al. 2000).

       Environmental conditions were far more severe in 1900 than in recent decades.

There are many ways this can be measured. One of them is the infant death rate. Figure !
                                                                                              3

presents some results of an ongoing study of changes in disparities in infant mortality

during the twentieth century by the neighborhoods of the 24 largest U.S. cities in 1900.

At the present time we are using wards averaging about 30,000 people as the unit of

observation. But such large units tend to mask disparities since they tend to combine both

rich and poor neighborhoods. We hope eventually to conduct the analyses at the level of

census districts, which average about 8,000 individuals, and are more homogenous with

respect to socioeconomic status and health conditions than wards.

       However, even when the analysis is conducted at the ward level, the results are

striking, as is shown by Figure 1. In this figure, the y-axis is the infant death rate, and the

x-axis is year. There are three sets of observations: The maximum infant death rate across

about 120 wards of six large cities are clustered around the top line; the minimum infant

death rates are clustered around the bottom line; and the line in the middle represents the

average. The main point of this figure is how wide the range in infant death rates were at

the beginning of the period, 226 per thousand between the best and the worst wards in

1900. But by 1950 the differential between the best and the worst wards had declined to

about 38 per thousand. During the first half of the twentieth century the spread between

the best and the worst wards diminished by 83 percent.

       Hence, the first point to be noted about changes and disparities in the twentieth

century is that the range of differences in exposure to disease has narrowed greatly over

the course of the century. The disparities we observe today are much smaller than they

used to be. From the perspective of 1900 we are currently engaged in fine-tuning, not in

gross corrections of disparities.
                                                                                            4

        Many examples of how much wider disparities were among ethnic groups can be

presented. One example is from a paper by Todd Bridges (2002). The infant death rate

from diarrheal diseases during the summer months in Chicago in 1910 for foreign born

mothers was 9 times as high as the rate for native born mothers (Bridges 2003).

        I began this talk by focusing on infectious diseases, although my assignment is the

explanation for the decline in chronic diseases, because one of the principal findings of

the Early Indicators Project is that insults from infectious diseases at early ages has a

large impact on the prevalence rates of chronic diseases and disabilities in middle and late

ages.

        Another major finding of the early indicators project is that age-specific

prelevance rates of chronic diseases were much lower at the end of the twentieth century

than they were at the beginning of that century or during the last half of the nineteenth

century. The Union Army data reveal the ubiquity of chronic health conditions during

the century before World War II. Not only was the overall prevalence rate of these

diseases much higher among the elderly than today, but they afflicted the teens, young

adults and middle ages to a much greater extent than today. This fact is brought out by

Table 1, which shows that more than 80 percent of all males aged 16–19 in 1861 and

more than 70 percent of men ages 20–24 were examined for the Union Army. These

examinees were overwhelmingly volunteers (less than 4 percent were drafted), who

presumably thought they were fit enough to serve. Yet disability rates were higher than

today. Even among teenagers more than one of six was disabled, and among men aged

35–39, more than half were disabled. Despite their relatively young ages, cardiovascular

diseases (mainly rheumatic) accounted for 11 percent of the rejections; hernias another 12
                                                                                          5

percent; eye, ear, and nose diseases 7 percent; tuberculosis and other respiratory diseases

7 percent; tooth and gum diseases 8 percent. Most of the other rejections were due to

orthopedic conditions and general debility (Lee 2001).

       These findings about the early onset of chronic diseases cast new light on the

debate about the effect of increased longevity on the prevalence rates of chronic diseases.

Those who argued that the effect of increased longevity was to increase the average

duration of chronic disease assumed no delay in the average age of onset of these

diseases. They were also influenced by cross-sectional evidence that showed some

increases in disability rates during the 1970s and 1980s, despite the continuing decline in

mortality rates (Riley 1990, 1991; Wolfe and Haveman 1990). It seemed plausible that

various health interventions and environmental changes served to reduce the severity of

diseases and thus delayed death without providing cures, as has been the case with AIDS.

       However, as Table 2 shows, there has been a significant delay in the onset of

chronic diseases during the course of the twentieth century. Men age 50–54 were 24

percent more likely to be free of chronic conditions in 1994 than a century earlier. At age

60–64, white males today are two-and-a-half times more likely to be free of chronic

diseases than their counterparts a century ago. Further light is shed on the issue by

considering specific diseases (see Table 3). Arthritis began 11 years later among men

who turned 65 between 1983 and 1992 than those turned age 65 between 1895 and 1910.

The delay in the onset of a chronic condition was about 9 years for heart diseases, about

11 years for respiratory diseases (despite much higher rates of cigarette smoking), and

nearly 8 years for neoplasms.1
                                                                                          6

       Union Army veterans who endured poor health did not typically die quickly.

Veterans who lived to be at least age 50, and who entered the pension system before age

51, lived an average of 24 years past age 50. Moreover, at their last examination on or

before age 51, their average degree of disability was 58 percent, where 100 percent

indicates complete incapacity for manual labor. Between age 50 and 60 disability ratings

(controlled for age at death) continued to rise sharply, and then increased at a decreasing

rate. It is worth noting that of the veterans who lived to be age 50, about 29 percent lived

to be age 80 or more. For these “Old Old,” the level of disability for manual labor

averaged between 85 and 100 percent for a decade or more. Indeed, some survived with

such high levels of disability for as much as a quarter of a century (Helmchen 2003). As

Table 4 shows, survivors usually acquired more and more comorbidities as they aged.2

Those who lived past age 85 had twice as many comorbidities as those who died by age

55.

       Consideration of the sweep of the twentieth century puts the debate over the

relationship between the increase in life expectancy and the change in the burden of

chronic disease among the elderly in a new perspective. It now appears that the decline in

morbidity rates paralleled the decline in mortality rates. Indeed, the delay in the onset of

chronic disabilities between 1900 and the 1990s for those who lived to age 50 was greater

than the increase in life expectancy at age 50 over the same periods. The average delay in

the onset of chronic conditions over the century was more than 10 years (Helmchen

2003).3 However, the average increase in male life expectancy was about 6.6 years (Bell,

Wade, and Goss 1992).
                                                                                          7

       Public health policies before 1940 had a large impact on the decline in chronic

disability rates decades later. Dora Costa (2000) has estimated the impact of public health

and socioeconomic status factors at late developmental and young adult ages on risks of

incurring chronic conditions at middle and late ages. Significant predictors included

mortality rates in counties of enlistments, infectious diseases experienced during the Civil

War, and being a prisoner of war. She focused on a set of chronic conditions for which

clinical diagnoses were essentially the same in the early 1900s as today (such as lower

back pain, joint problems, decreased breath or adventitious sounds, irregular pulse, and

valvular heart disease). This procedure permitted her to estimate how much of the

observed decline in the prevalence rates of comparable conditions was due to the

reduction in specific risk factors. Prevalence rates for 1971–1980 were computed from

the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).

       She found that elimination of exposure to specific infectious diseases during

developmental and young adult ages explained between 10 and 25 percent of the declines

in the specified chronic diseases of middle and late ages between 1900–1910 and 1971–

1980. Occupational shifts were also important, accounting for 15 percent of the decline in

joint problems, 75 percent of the decline in back pains, and 25 percent of the decline in

respiratory diseases.

       Costa (2002) pushed this line of analysis further by documenting the decline in

functional limitations among U.S. men between ages 50 and 74 over the course of the

twentieth century. A central issue is the factoring of the decline in functional limitations

among three processes: the decline in the prevalence rates of specific chronic diseases,

the reduction in the debilitating sequelae of these diseases, and the influence of new
                                                                                              8

medical technologies that relieve and control the sequelae. Her analysis turned on five

functional limitations: difficulty walking, difficulty bending, paralysis, blindness in at

least one eye, and deafness in at least one ear. Prevalence rates of these limitations among

men aged 50–74 were computed for the Union Army, NHANES (1988–1994) and NHIS

(1988–1994).

       On average these five functional limitations declined by about 40 percent during

the course of the twentieth century. Using probit regressions, Costa attributed 24 percent

of the decline to reduction in the debilitating effect of chronic conditions and 37 percent

to the reduced rates of chronic conditions.



                       The Significance of Changes in Body Size

       The contribution of improvements in body size as measured by stature, BMI, and

other dimensions have run through the research of the Early Indicators project like a red

line. The discovery of correlations in time series going back to the colonial period

between changes in stature and changes in life expectancy for the U.S. were reported first

in 1986, although it was known as early as 1978.4 Pursuit of a variety of issues called

attention to the significance of changes in body size to the long-term decline in chronic

conditions and mortality. For example, Diane Lauderdale and Paul Rathouz (1999)

sought to investigate the impact of unhealthy environments on the genetic component of

height. They hypothesized that an unhealthy environment might attenuate the effects of

genotype. To test that hypothesis they constructed a sample of brothers who served in the

Union Army. Their analysis showed that brothers from unhealthy counties had both

higher variances in height and lower covariance in the heights of siblings than was
                                                                                          9

expected from standard equations for measuring genetic influences in the heights of

siblings. Study of the likelihood of developing specific diseases while in the service also

pointed to the importance of stature. For example, short recruits were more likely to

develop tuberculosis while in service than taller ones (Birchenall 2003. Cf. Lee 1997).

       In 1995 Dora Costa discovered a sample of 23,000 Union Army recruits who

were, for scientific reasons, more intensively examined than the typical recruit (Costa,

forthcoming). Benjamin A. Gould, a leading astronomer and one of the founders of the

National Academy of Sciences, who was in charge of the project, collected information

on waist and hip circumference, lifting strength, vital capacity of lungs, height, weight,

shoulder breadth, and chest circumference. The sample covered whites, blacks, and

Native Americans. Costa linked a subsample of 521 white recruits who survived to 1900

to their pension records. She also compared the Union Army soldiers with soldiers

measured in 1946–47, 1950, and 1988.

       Over a span of one hundred years men in the military became taller and heavier.

Their height increased by 5 cm and the BMIs of men aged 31–35 increased from 23 to

26. Controlling for BMI and age, the waist-hip and chest-shoulder ratios (both measures

of abdominal fat) were significantly greater in the Gould sample than in the 1950 and

1988 samples.

       Using an independent competing risk hazard model to estimate the effect of

changes in body shape on the risk of death from cerebrovascular and ischemic heart

disease at older ages, she found that a low waist to hip ratio increased mortality by 4.4

times relative to the mean and controlling for BMI, while a high waist-hip ratio increased

mortality risk by 2.9 times. Substituting the characteristics of soldiers in 1950, who
                                                                                          10

reached age 65 or over during the late 1980s, into her regression model produced a 15

percent decline in all cause mortality above age 64, implying that changes in frame size

explain about 47 percent of the total decline in all cause mortality at older ages between

the beginning and the end of the twentieth century.



                          The Theory of Technophysio Evolution

       Recognition of environmentally induced changes in human physiology during the

twentieth century that had a profound impact on the process of aging did not become

apparent to EI investigators until mid-1993. The key finding was that prevalence rates in

the main chronic diseases among Union Army veterans age 65 and older were much

higher in 1910 than among veterans of World War II of the same ages during the mid-to-

late 1980s. That finding was first set forth in a 1993 working paper and was elaborated

and subsequently characterized as a “theory of technophysio evolution.” The theory of

technophysio evolution arose out of intense discussion among the senior investigators,

consultants, and research assistants during 1993–1994, with the physicians providing

much of the intellectual leadership. This theory points to the existence of a synergism

between technological and physiological improvements that has produced a form of

human evolution that is biological but not genetic, rapid, culturally transmitted, and not

necessarily stable. The process is still ongoing in both rich and developing countries.

       Unlike the genetic theory of evolution through natural selection, which applies to

the whole history of life on earth, technophysio evolution applies only to the last 300

years of human history, and particularly to the last century.5 The theory of technophysio

evolution rests on the proposition that during the last 300 years, particularly during the
                                                                                         11

last century, human beings have gained an unprecedented degree of control over their

environment—a degree of control so great that is sets them apart not only from all other

species, but also from all previous generations of Homo sapiens. This new degree of

control has enabled Homo sapiens to increase its average body size by over 50 percent, to

increase its average longevity by more than 100 percent, and to greatly improve the

robustness and capacity of vital organ systems.6

       Figure 2 helps to point up how dramatic the change in the control of the

environment after 1700 has been. During its first 200,000 or so years, Homo sapiens

increased at an exceedingly slow rate. The discovery of agriculture about 11,000 years

ago broke the tight constraint on the food supply imposed by a hunting and gathering

technology, making it possible to release between 10 and 20 percent of the labor force

from the direct production of food and also giving rise to the first cities. The new

technology of food production was so superior to the old one that it was possible to

support a much higher rate of population increase than had existed prior to c. 9000 B.C.

Yet, as Figure 2 shows, the advances in the technology of food production after the

second Agricultural Revolution (which began about A.D. 1700) were far more dramatic

than the earlier breakthrough, since they permitted the population to increase at so high a

rate that the line of population appears to explode, rising almost vertically. The new

technological breakthroughs in manufacturing, transportation, trade, communications,

energy production, leisure-time services, and medical services were in many respects

even more striking than those in agriculture. Figure 2 emphasizes the huge acceleration in

both population and technological change during the twentieth century. The increase in
                                                                                       12

the world’s population between 1900 and 1990 was four times as great as the increase

during the whole previous history of humankind.



   The Contribution of Technophysio Evolution to the Remarkable Reduction in
                    Inequality during the Twentieth Century

       The twentieth century contrasts sharply with the record of the two preceding

centuries. In every measure that we have bearing on the standard of living, such as real

income, homelessness, life expectancy, and height, the gains of the lower classes have

been far greater than those experienced by the population as a whole, whose overall

standard of living has also improved.

       The “Gini ratio,” which is also called the “concentration ratio,” is the measure of

the inequality of the income distribution most widely used by economists.7 This measure

varies between 0 (perfect equality) and 1 (maximum inequality). In the case of England,

for example, which has the longest series of income distributions, the Gini ratio stood at

about 0.65 near the beginning of the eighteenth century, at about 0.55 near the beginning

of the twentieth century, and at 0.32 in 1973, when it bottomed out, not only in Britain,

but also in the United States and other rich nations.8 This measure indicates that over

two-thirds of the reduction in the inequality of income distributions between 1700 and

1973 took place during the twentieth century. The large decrease in such inequality,

coupled with the rapid increase in the average real income of the English population,

means that the per capita income of the lower classes was rising much more rapidly than

those of the middle or upper classes.9

       A similar conclusion is implied by the data on life expectancies. For the cohort

born about 1875, there was a gap of 17 years between the average length of life of the
                                                                                         13

British elite and of the population as a whole. There is still a social gap in life

expectancies among the British, but today the advantage of the richest classes over the

rest of the population is only about 4 years. Thus about three-quarters of the social gap in

longevity has disappeared. As a consequence, the life expectancy of the lower classes

increased from 41 years at birth in 1875 to about 74 years today, while the life

expectancy of the elite increased from 58 years at birth to about 78 years. If anything sets

the twentieth century apart from the past, it is this huge increase in the longevity of the

lower classes.10

       Data on stature also indicate the high degree of inequality during the nineteenth

century. At the close of the Napoleonic wars, a typical British male worker at maturity

was about 5 inches shorter than a mature male of upper class birth. There is still a gap in

stature between the workers and the elite of Britain, but now the gap is only on the order

of an inch. Height differentials by social class have virtually disappeared in Sweden and

Norway but not yet in the United States. Statistical analysis across a wide array of rich

and poor countries today shows a strong correlation between stature and the Gini ratio

(Steckel 1995; Rona, Swan, and Altman 1978).

       Weight is another important measure of inequality. Despite the great emphasis in

recent years on weight reduction, the world still suffers more from undernutrition and

underweight than from overweight, as the World Health Organization has repeatedly

pointed out. Although one should not minimize the afflictions caused by overnutrition, it

is important to recognize that even in rich countries such as the United States,

undernutrition remains a significant problem, especially among impoverished pregnant

women, children, and among the aged.
                                                                                         14

       The secular increase in body builds is due primarily to the great improvement in

socioeconomic conditions over the past several centuries, rather than to genetic factors, as

can be seen by considering Holland. The average height of young adult males was only

64 inches in that country during the middle of the nineteenth century. The corresponding

figure today is about 72 inches. An increase of 8 inches in just four generations cannot be

due to natural selection or genetic drift because such processes require much longer time

spans. Nor can it be attributed to heterosis (hybrid vigor) because Holland’s population

has remained relatively homogeneous and because the effects of heterosis in human

populations have been shown both empirically and theoretically to have been quite small.

It is hard to come up with credible explanations for the rapid increase in heights that do

not turn on environmental factors, especially improvements in nutrition and health. These

environmental factors appear to be still at work. Stature is still increasing, although at a

somewhat slower rate, and nations have not yet reached a mean height that represents the

biological limit of humankind under current biomedical technology (Fogel 1992; cf. van

Wieringen 1986; Drukker 1994; Drukker and Tassenaar 1997; Schmidt, Jorgenson, and

Michaelsen 1995).

       Homelessness is another indicator of the dramatic reduction in inequality during

the twentieth century. Down to the middle of the nineteenth century, between 10 and 20

percent of the population in Britain and on the Continent were homeless persons whom

officials classified as vagrants and paupers. Estimates of vagrancy and pauper rates in the

United States during the nineteenth century are less certain, but these rates appear to have

reached European levels in the major cities during the middle decades of that century.

When we speak of homelessness in the United States today, we are talking about rates
                                                                                          15

below 0.4 percent of the population. Many of the homeless today are mentally ill

individuals prematurely released from psychiatric institutions that are inadequately

funded. Many others are chronically poor and inadequately trained for the current job

market (Cipolla 1980; Laslett [1965] 1984; Himmelfarb 1983; Soltow 1968; Lindert and

Williamson 1982; Fogel 1987, 1989, 1993; Colquhoun 1814; Hannon 1984a, 1984b,

1985; Jencks 1994).

       The relatively generous poverty program developed in Britain during the second

half of the eighteenth century, and the bitter attacks on that program by Malthus and

others, have given the unwarranted impression that government transfers played a major

role in the secular decline in beggary and homelessness. Despite the relative generosity of

English poor relief between 1750 and 1834, beggary and homelessness fluctuated

between 10 to 20 percent. Despite the substantial reduction in the proportion of national

income transferred to the poor as a result of the poor laws of 1834 and later years,

homelessness declined sharply during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

       The fact is that government transfers were incapable of solving the problems of

beggary and homelessness during the eighteenth and much of the nineteenth centuries,

because the root cause of the problems was chronic malnutrition. Even during the most

generous phases of the relief program, the bottom fifth of the English population was so

severely malnourished that it lacked the energy for adequate levels of work (Fogel 1997;

Fogel, Floud and Harris n.d.).

       At the end of the eighteenth century British agriculture, even when supplemented

by imports, was simply not productive enough to provide more than 80 percent of the

potential labor force with enough calories to sustain regular manual labor. It was the huge
                                                                                            16

increases in English productivity during the later part of the nineteenth and the early

twentieth centuries that made it possible to feed even the poor at relatively high caloric

levels. Begging and homelessness were reduced to exceedingly low levels, by nineteenth-

century standards, only when the bottom fifth of the population acquired enough calories

to permit regular work. The principal way in which government policy contributed to that

achievement was through its public health programs. By reducing exposure to disease,

more of the calories that the poor ingested were made available for work.


                                  Concluding Comment

       Technophysio evolution implies that some theoretical propositions that underlie

some current economic models are misspecified because the initial endowments of health

capital of successive cohorts increased over the course of the twentieth century. The

common assumption that the endowment of human physiological capacity is fixed, so

that medical intervention can only slow down the rate of deterioration in the original

endowment, means that ways of forecasting future improvement in human physiology are

sometimes neglected and possible paths of increase in health endowments play little role

in forecasting future health care costs or longevity.11

       The theory of technophysio evolution implies that health endowments in a given

population change with the year of birth. It also points to complex interactions between

date of birth and the outcome of exposures to given risk factors. Hence, not all

improvements in the outcome of exposure to health risks between, say, 1970 and 1990

are due to health interventions during that period. Improvements in life expectancy may

depend only partly on the more effective medical technologies of those years. It could

also reflect the improved physiologies experienced by later birth cohorts that are due to
                                                                                            17

improved technologies in food production, public health practices, personal hygiene,

diets, and medical interventions put into place decades before 1970, and hence cannot be

attributed exclusively, perhaps even primarily, to health inputs between 1970 and 1990.12

Moreover, many health interventions which are effective at late ages today would not be

feasible if the level of physiological capital at late ages was as low today as it was at the

beginning of the twentieth century.

                                         Notes

1.   Since current diagnostic techniques make it possible to diagnose heart disease and

     neoplasms sooner in the development of these diseases than used to be the case c.

     1910, the figures given in the text should be considered lower bounds on the delay

     in the onset of these conditions.

2.   Comorbidity: the coexistence of two or more disease processes.

3.   The delay in the average age of onset in chronic diseases can be decomposed into

     two parts: (1) the shift in the age-specific disease schedule; (2) the change in the

     distribution of ages due to the increase in life expectancy and the decline in the

     fertility rate.   We have not yet completed this decomposition. However,

     preliminary estimates indicate that the contribution of the change in the age

     distribution was small.

4.   For reviews of earlier work dealing with the use of height, BMI and other

     anthropometric measures as indexes of changes in health and the standard of

     living over time, see Steckel 1995; Komlos and Cuff 1998.

5.   Costa and Fogel limit technophysio evolution to the last 300 years for two

     reasons. It was not until about 1700 that changes in technology permitted

     population growth far in excess of previous rates. Moreover, after 1700 body

     weight and stature increase to unprecedented levels. See Figure 1 in Fogel and

     Costa 1997.

6.   Although a considerable body of empirical evidence has accumulated indicating

     that a “good” environment both speeds up biological development at young ages

     and delays the onset of chronic conditions at middle and late ages, there is as yet
                                                                                           25



      no agreed upon theory about the cellular and molecular processes that explains

      these observations.

7.    Stature and Gini ratios are significantly correlated, but as the following discussion of

      height and BMI indicates, the anthropometric measures reveal important aspects of

      welfare that are not as apparent in the movement of Gini ratios.

8.    There has been a rise in the Gini ratio since 1973 in virtually all the rich nations for

      which such information is available. Cf. Fogel 2000.

9.    On trends in the Gini ratio between ca. 1690 and 1973 and the debate over this trend,

      see Soltow 1968; Feinstein 1988; Williamson 1985; Lindert and Williamson 1982,

      1984; Floud, Wachter, and Gregory 1990. Cf. Fogel 2000.

10.   Data for males are presented in Case et al. 1962; Hollingsworth 1977; Hattersley

      1999.

11.   Among the exceptions are Rosenzweig and Schultz 1988 and Dasgupta 1993.

12.   Much recent research indicates that waiting time to the onset of chronic diseases

      is a function of exposure to insults in utero and infancy. See Barker 1998;

      Scrimshaw 1997.
