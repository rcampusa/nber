The world is experiencing the second largest refugee crisis in a century, and one of the major
points of contention involves the possible adverse effects of incoming refugees on host
communities. We examine the effects of a large refugee influx into Florida public schools
following the Haitian earthquake of 2010 using unique matched birth and schooling records. We
find precise zero estimated effects of refugees on the educational outcomes of incumbent students
in the year of the earthquake or in the two years that follow, regardless of the socioeconomic
status, grade level, ethnicity, or birthplace of incumbent students.

       THE EFFECTS OF REFUGEES ON THE EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES OF
                         INCUMBENT STUDENTS
1. Introduction

       The world is experiencing a refugee crisis of a magnitude not seen since the end of World

War II. According to the figures released by the United Nations High Commissioner for

Refugees (UNCHR), as of the end of 2015, there were 65.3 million refugees and internally

displaced people around the globe – the largest number in history. More than a million Middle

Eastern refugees crossed into Europe in 2015, triggering a series of major political and

humanitarian crises as countries scramble to cope with the influx. The ripple effects of this new

wave of refugees are also felt across the Atlantic, with the number of asylum seekers from

Middle Eastern countries reaching record highs in the United States and Canada and sparking

spirited political debates. The main point of contention in debates on refugees is the possible

adverse effects of refugees on host communities; however, these debates mostly take place in

what is close to an empirical vacuum.

       In this study, we present the first evidence, to the best of our knowledge, on the effects of

a large influx of refugees on the educational outcomes of incumbent students. We focus

specifically on one of the largest recent inflows of refugees into the United States – those who

entered immediately following the devastating earthquake on January 12, 2010 that killed more

than 200,000 people and affected a third of the population in Haiti; approximately 60,000

earthquake survivors moved to the United States immediately following the earthquake. We

make use of rich, longitudinal education microdata from the Florida – host to two-thirds of the

Haitian refugees -- to study this question. These data are exceptionally detailed, allowing us to

investigate the effects of Haitian refugees on a variety of incumbent students, including non-

refugee Haitian immigrants, U.S.-born students of Haitian ancestry, other non-Haitian immigrant

                                                 1
students, and so on. Over 4,000 refugee students entered Florida public schools by the end of the

2009-10 school year, and the overwhelming majority of these students enrolled in four school

districts, generating a significant influx of refugee students in certain schools.

         A number of studies have examined the effects of immigrants on the labor market

outcomes of host communities 1, and there have been several recent analyses of the effects of

immigrants per se on the educational outcomes of incumbent students 2, though their conclusions

have been mixed. 3 But the effects of refugees might differ from the effects of immigrants on

native communities due to the fundamental differences between these two groups in the manner

in which they left their home countries. Immigrants typically make conscious choices to leave

their countries of origin seeking “a better life” elsewhere. On the other hand, the term “refugee”

refers to people who have to flee their countries due to an imminent threat to their lives such as

armed conflicts, persecution, and/or natural disasters, and hence are more likely to be




1
  Most studies investigating the effects of immigrants on the labor market outcomes of natives find little or no effect
(e.g., Dustmann et al. (2008), Borjas (2013)), yet some find significant negative effects of immigrant influxes on the
wages and employment rates of low-skilled natives (e.g., Card, 2001). For a brief overview of the existing literature
in this context, see Akgündüz et al. (2015).
2
  Using the large immigrant influx into Israel in the 1990s, Gould et al. (2009) exploit the cross-cohort, within-
school variation in immigrant concentration to study the effects of immigrants, and find a large adverse effect on the
high school dropout rates and high school matriculation test passing rates among native Israeli students. Similarly,
Jensen and Würtz-Rasmussen (2011) find negative effects of immigrant concentration on both native and immigrant
secondary school students in Denmark. In the United States, Betts and Fairlie (2003) and Cascio and Lewis (2012)
find that inflows of immigrants increase the native flight across school districts and from public schools into private
schools, especially among native-born white students in secondary grades. Further, using pooled 1980 and 1990
Census data, Betts (1998) finds a significant negative effect of immigrants on the likelihood of high school
graduation among black and Hispanic students in the United States. In contrast, there are several studies that find no
significant effect, or even a positive effect, of immigrants on the educational outcomes of native students. For
instance, Hunt (2012) finds that an increase in the immigrant share in the population increases the likelihood of high
school graduation among native-born black students in the United States. Similarly, Brunello and Rocco (2013) and
Geay et al. (2012) find small or no negative spillover effects of immigrants on natives, and Ohinata and Van Ours
(2013) and Schneeweis (2015) find large negative effects of immigrant concentration on the educational outcomes
of immigrant students, yet no significant effect on natives.
3
  A closely related line of research examines the effect of racial/ethnic diversity in schools on student outcomes in
the United States. For example, Hanushek et al. (2009) and Hoxby (2000) investigate the effects of school racial
composition on the educational outcomes of black and white students in Texas, and find that a higher percentage of
black peers reduces the achievement of black students, but the effect on whites is generally insignificant and smaller.
Angrist and Lang (2004) reach similar conclusions examining the school desegregation program in Boston.

                                                          2
representative of, or even less advantaged and more marginalized than, the general population in

their countries of origin (Cortes, 2004). Refugees generally are more impoverished with lower

earnings than economic migrants, and have lower levels of education and language skills when

they arrive (Connor, 2010; Potocky-Tripodi, 2004). 4 And while refugees ultimately – after a

period of six to ten years -- have higher labor force participation and employment rates, and have

similar welfare participation rates, relative to U.S.-born residents, they often enter the U.S. with

low human capital and language skills and have initially poor labor market outcomes and high

rates of welfare usage (Evans and Fitzgerald, 2017). Therefore, it is plausible to expect that

refugees might have a very different (and likely more adverse) effect on incumbent students as

school districts and schools shift resources away from native students to accommodate the needs

of refugees.

        The biggest challenge in revealing the causal effect of refugees on incumbent

communities is that refugee students are not randomly assigned to schools and communities. In

fact, prior research has shown that refugees, and recent immigrants in general, are more likely to

settle in neighborhoods with larger shares of immigrants from their country of origin (see, e.g.,

Card, 2001). To deal with this selection issue, we make use of the within-school, across-grade

variation in the volume of entering refugees to explore the effects on the educational outcomes of

existing students including test scores, disciplinary incidents, and student mobility across

schools. We also use the birth dates of refugee students as an instrument for their grade

placement to deal with the possible strategic placement of refugee students across grades within

schools. We find precisely estimated zero effects (with occasional positive estimates as well) of

refugees on the educational outcomes of incumbent students in the year of the earthquake or in

  Beaman (2012) shows that refugees perform better in the labor market when they reside in communities with
larger numbers of other refugees.

the two years that follow, regardless of the socioeconomic status, grade level, or the birthplace of

incumbent students.



2. The Haitian Earthquake of 2010

        A powerful 7.0-magnitude earthquake struck Haiti’s capital Port-au-Prince on January

10, 2010, killing more than 200,000 people and affecting more than three million people (almost

a third of the country’s entire population), more than a million of whom were left homeless.

After the earthquake, the United States granted 60,000 Haitian refugees temporary protected

status which provided relief from deportation and work authorization until January, 2016. Of

those 60,000 refugees, 38,000 settled in Florida. 5

        This influx of Haitian refugees also led to a sizeable refugee shock in Florida public

schools. In the first two months after the earthquake, more than 2,000 Haitian refugees entered

Florida public schools, and roughly 4,000 entered by the end of the spring semester in 2010. 6

Figure 1 portrays the distribution of Haitian immigrants entering Florida public schools during

the spring semesters between 2003-04 and 2011-12 school years, suggesting that the number of

Haitian immigrants entering the public school system in Florida more than quadrupled in Spring

2010, and reverted to its pre-2010 levels in the following year. Table 1 presents the number of

schools by refugee concentration, broken down by grade level, indicating that approximately 40

percent of the schools in Florida did not receive any Haitian refugees in Spring 2010 whereas the

share of Haitian refugees exceeded one percent of the student body in 100 schools in Florida.

Figure 2 maps these 100 schools, which we call “top refugee-receiving schools” in the remainder

(Broward, Miami-Dade, Orange, and Palm Beach).



3. Data and Empirical Strategy

       In this study, we use student-level administrative data from Florida that provide detailed

information about all students enrolled in a public school between 2002-03 and 2011-12. School

records contain reading and math scores on the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test (FCAT)

of all students between grades three and ten, along with a wealth of student characteristics

including student demographics (e.g., race/ethnicity, gender), free-or-reduced-priced lunch

(FRPL) eligibility, measures of English proficiency (limited English proficiency indicator and

language spoken at home), detailed information about disciplinary incidents (including the

precise date of the incident), and special education status. More importantly for the purposes of

this study, we observe the country of birth and the entry dates of all students to the schools they

attended in a given school year, which allow us to identify Haitian refugees who entered the

Florida public school system after the earthquake. We also observe home language, which allows

us to identify U.S.-born students of recent Haitian descent.

       For the purposes of this research agenda, the Florida Departments of Education and

Health linked these student-level administrative data with student birth records for every child

born in Florida between 1992 and 2002. Birth records offer background information not typically

seen in school records such as parental education, providing additional measures of student

socioeconomic status. Because the birth-school match is based on full name, exact date of birth,




                                                 5
and social security numbers, the birth and school records are virtually perfectly matched (Figlio

et al., 2014). 7

         Table 2 compares the characteristics of Haitian refugees (first column) with immigrants

who entered Florida public schools in Spring 2010 (second column) and Haitian immigrants who

entered the school system during spring semesters before the earthquake (third column).

Compared with Haitian immigrants in other years, Haitian refugees are significantly more likely

to be economically disadvantaged, and while they are just as likely to be non-native English

speakers, they are much more likely to be identified as limited English proficient upon entry into

the school system. In particular, almost 90 percent of Haitian refugees were eligible for free or

reduced price lunch (compared to 63 percent for other immigrants in Spring 2010 and 72 percent

for Haitian immigrants in other spring semesters), and 91 percent were limited English proficient

(compared to 74 percent for other immigrants in Spring 2010 and 52 percent for Haitian

immigrants in other spring semesters). Haitian refugees also are more economically

disadvantaged and have lower facility in English than are immigrants from other countries

arriving in Spring 2010. In sum, Haitian refugees are considerably more needy than other

immigrants – Haitian or otherwise.

         The previous literature has shown that recent immigrants are more likely to settle in

neighborhoods with larger shares of immigrants, typically from their countries of origin. 8 This is

also the case for Haitian refugees, as demonstrated in Table 3. Existing students in refugee-

receiving schools are significantly more likely to speak Haitian Creole, more likely to have been




7
  As Figlio et al. (2014) demonstrate, the match rate is essentially identical to that which would have been predicted
based on the American Community Survey data.
8
  Immigrants also tend to be concentrated in part because native students frequently leave schools when facing a
major immigrant influx (Schindler-Rangvid (2010), Gerdes (2010), Betts and Fairlie (2003), and Cascio and Lewis
(2012)).

                                                          6
born abroad, and in Haiti in particular, have significantly lower prior achievement levels, are

more likely to be FRPL eligible, less likely to be white, and more likely to be limited English

proficient. Florida-born students in these schools are also less likely to have educated mothers.

These stark differences in baseline characteristics imply that the observed differences in student

outcomes are likely to be contaminated by differences in unobserved student traits between

schools that received refugees versus others.

         To deal with this selection issue, following Gould et al. (2009), we rely on within-school,

across-grade variation in refugee concentration to study the effects of the refugee influx on

incumbent students. In particular, we estimate the following equation:

                                 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽𝑅𝑅𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝛿𝛿𝑠𝑠 + 𝜃𝜃𝑔𝑔 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖                                (1)


where 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the year t educational outcome of student i who attended school s and grade g in

Spring 2010, 𝑅𝑅𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 is the percentage of Haitian refugees in grade g and school s in Spring 2010, 𝛿𝛿𝑠𝑠

and 𝜃𝜃𝑔𝑔 are the fixed effects of the school and the grade that student i attended in Spring 2010

respectively. 9 As primary outcomes of interest we use test scores in reading and math

standardized to zero mean and unit variance at the grade-year level, an indicator for whether the

student was involved in a serious disciplinary incident resulting in a suspension, and student

mobility (i.e., whether the student moved to another school or left the Florida public school

system altogether by Fall 2010 or Fall 2011). We also create a performance index using the

estimated coefficients of test scores and disciplinary incidents in 8th grade in a regression where

we predict on-time high school graduation (Appendix Table A1 presents the means and standard




9
 In some specifications, we also include a vector of student characteristics (𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) including prior test scores,
disciplinary incidents, and student demographics to check the robustness of our findings. We adjust all standard
errors for clustering at the school level.

                                                                7
deviations of our outcome variables in Spring 2010 along with the two school years that follow

for refugee-receiving and top-refugee receiving schools in our sample). 10

         In our analysis, we focus on the within-cohort refugee concentration in Spring 2010

because it is less likely that incumbent students were able to respond to the unexpected refugee

influx (e.g., by changing schools) immediately after the earthquake. Therefore, it is more

plausible to expect that the cross-grade variation in refugee concentration in Spring 2010 is

uncorrelated with the observed and unobserved characteristics of existing students within

schools, which is the critical assumption behind our identification strategy here. Table 4 checks

the validity of this assumption by replacing student outcomes with student and teacher

characteristics (experience and level of education, averaged at the school-by-grade level) in

model (1) and estimating the equation with and without school fixed effects, for all schools and

top refugee-receiving schools separately. The findings reported in the first and third columns

reveal strong correlations between baseline characteristics and refugee concentration across

schools, yet these correlations vanish in almost all cases when school fixed effects are introduced

– at least for the top refugee-receiving schools that are the focus of our analysis.

         While these findings provide suggestive evidence that our identification assumption is

valid, it is still plausible that school administrators strategically place refugees in grades based on

unobservable factors. For this, we use the age distribution of entering refugees in each school as

an instrument for the refugee concentration. In particular, using 2SLS, we also estimate:

                                       𝑅𝑅𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 = 𝜙𝜙 + 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝛿𝛿𝑠𝑠 + 𝜃𝜃𝑔𝑔 + 𝜈𝜈𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠
                                        𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝜌𝜌 + 𝜇𝜇𝑅𝑅�𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝛿𝛿𝑠𝑠 + 𝜃𝜃𝑔𝑔 + 𝜗𝜗𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖                               (2)


10
   In particular, using 5 cohorts of first-time 9th graders between 2003 and 2007, we regress an indicator of whether
the student received a standard high school diploma in four years after entering the 9th grade for the first time on 8th
grade reading and math scores, and an indicator of whether the student was involved in a disciplinary incident in the
8th grade. Using the estimated coefficients (0.07 for reading, 0.10 for math, and -0.23 for disciplinary incident), we
construct a performance index for all students in our sample for whom test scores are available.

                                                             8
where 𝐴𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 is the number of refugees who entered school s and were age-appropriate for grade g,

divided by the number of existing students enrolled in the same school-grade. Appendix Table 2

presents the correlations between 𝐴𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 and student and teacher characteristics (once again

averaged at the school-by-grade level) for all schools and top-receiving schools, providing

further evidence supporting the exogeneity of the instrument. Especially when we restrict our

attention to the top refugee-receiving schools, which together account for 40 percent of the total

Haitian refugee population, there is little evidence of a within-school relationship between

covariates and the age distribution of refugees.

4. Results

        We next turn to investigating the relationship between refugee concentration and

incumbent student outcomes following the earthquake. We consider three years of post-

earthquake data: Spring 2010, when refugees were still entering the schools, 11 and in the 2010-11

and 2011-12 academic years, after the refugee absorption was essentially complete. Table 5

presents the effects of refugee concentration on incumbent student test scores in reading and

math, disciplinary incidents, and our index of performance, estimated using OLS for all refugee-

receiving schools and top refugee-receiving schools in Spring 2010 (first panel), 2010-11 school

year (second panel), and 2011-12 school year (third panel). Appendix Table 3 presents the same

effects estimated using IV models. In models without school fixed effects, it appears as if more

refugees are associated with worse student outcomes (negative relationships with test scores and

the performance index and positive relationships with disciplinary incidents), but this is entirely

driven by differential selection into the schools that Haitian refugees attend. Indeed, as soon as



11
  The FCAT was administered in Spring 2010 between March 9-19, only two months following the earthquake. At
that point, only around half of the Haitian refugees who would ultimate attend Florida public schools by the end of
that academic year had even entered the schools.

                                                         9
we control for school fixed effects and consider only the naturally-occurring variation in refugee

concentration across grades within the same school, the negative relationships disappear and the

estimates are invariably non-negative 12, and even positive with respect to reading test scores in

the top refugee-receiving schools where most of the refugees attend. In the top refugee-receiving

schools, our preferred estimates (those with both school fixed effects and student covariates

included) in Spring 2010 indicate that each percentage point increase in refugee concentration is

associated with 0.6 to 0.7 percent of a standard deviation increase in reading test scores and 0.3

to 0.4 percent of a standard deviation in math test scores, and 0.2 to 0.6 percentage points fewer

disciplinary incidents 13. The estimates are of approximately the same magnitudes in the 2010-11

and 2011-12 school years as well. These are very modest estimates, but none suggest a

deleterious effect of refugees on incumbent students in the initial year of the earthquake. Indeed,

the standard errors in our preferred models are sufficiently small that we could statistically detect

effects of smaller than one percent of a standard deviation changes in test scores (1.5 percent of a

standard deviation in the IV models) for every percentage point increase in the refugee

concentration. 14 Given that only four Florida schools had a refugee concentration of over five

percent of their school population, our take-away is that we have estimated precise zero (except

in the case in which we estimate precise but very modest positive) effects of refugees on the

incumbent population’s test scores and disciplinary problems.




12
   A negative coefficient when the dependent variable is the presence of a disciplinary incident is evidence of a
positive outcome.
13
   We tend to prefer the test score outcomes to those regarding disciplinary incidents, because classroom disciplinary
policies may be affected by student body composition but the tests, which are state-administered and centrally-
graded, are not influenced by student body composition.
14
   We also estimate models where we cluster standard deviations at the district level. Standard errors increase
modestly, but they are still sufficiently small to detect statistically significant effects as small as 1.5 – 2 percent of a
standard deviation in test scores for every percentage point increase in the refugee concentration.

                                                            10
         Appendix Table 4 examines the extent to which the second and third year effects

observed in Table 5 are driven by differential student attrition from the sample. In this exercise,

we re-estimate (using our preferred specification that includes school fixed effects and student

covariates) the effects of refugee concentration on student test scores, disciplinary incidents, and

the performance index using all students (columns labeled as (I)), using students who remained

in the sample in 2010-11 school year (columns labeled as (II)), and using students who remained

in the sample in 2011-12. The first year effects remain unchanged, providing evidence that

differential attrition is not a major issue for our second and third year estimates. 15

         Table 6 examines the effects of refugee concentration on the likelihood of incumbent

student mobility in the following two years, estimated using OLS (IV results are presented in

Appendix Table 5). While models that do not include school fixed effects provide some evidence

of increased incumbent student mobility across Florida public schools, most of these

relationships vanish when we account for differences in student mobility across schools. In our

preferred specification that includes school fixed effects and student covariates using top

refugee-receiving schools, OLS estimates suggest that one percentage point increase in refugee

concentration increases the likelihood of student movement to another public school by Fall

2010 by 0.1 percentage points while decreasing the likelihood of exiting the school system by the

same amount. Similarly, one percentage point increase in refugee concentration increases within-

school system student movement by 0.01 percentage points, and decreases the likelihood of

exiting the school system by 0.5 percentage points by Fall 2011. Of these estimates, only the


15
  We also conduct a bounding exercise (results are available upon request) to assess the extent of differential
student attrition. In this exercise, we assign each student who leaves the Florida public school system by Fall 2010
or Fall 2011 a test score that corresponds to the 5th percentile (lower bound) or the 95th percentile (upper bound) of
the test score distribution in reading and math, or a disciplinary incident value of zero (lower bound) or one (upper
bound), and re-estimate our preferred specification that includes school fixed effects and student covariates. In
summary, the overall evidence indicates that refugees had little negative – and potentially even positive – effects on
incumbent students’ outcomes in the two years following the earthquake.

                                                          11
effect on Florida public school system exit by Fall 2011 is statistically significant at conventional

levels, suggesting that more Haitian refugees might have decreased the likelihood that students

would leave affected schools, and again, the magnitudes of this difference are quite small.

         One possible mechanism behind these precisely estimated zero effects of refugees on

incumbent students is that refugees are placed in different classrooms within grades. To see

whether this is the case, columns labeled as (I) in Table 7 presents the differences in incumbent

student characteristics between refugee-receiving classrooms and others in refugee-receiving

schools and top refugee-receiving schools, controlling for school-by-grade fixed effects. The

results reveal significant differences between refugee-receiving classrooms and others although

refugee students were by no means completely isolated from incumbent students. For instance,

refugees are significantly more likely to be placed in classrooms with higher shares of Haitian-

born students (38 percent versus 12 percent in top refugee-receiving schools), Haitian-Creole

speakers (49 versus 30 percent), and higher shares of limited English proficient students (54

versus 12 percent). Given that 90 percent of all Haitian refugees were identified as limited

English proficient (LEP) upon entry into the Florida public school system, these discrepancies

might be explained by some schools instructing LEP students in separate classrooms than fluent

English speakers (i.e., sheltered classrooms). 16 Indeed, when we control for the LEP status of

incumbent students (in columns labeled as (II)), differences in classroom characteristics diminish

dramatically. For instance, incumbent students in refugee-receiving classrooms within top

  The Florida Department of Education uses several instructional models for English learners including (1)
sheltered models where English learners are placed in separate classrooms only for English courses; (2) sheltered
models where English learners are placed in separate classrooms for core/basic subject areas; (3)
mainstream/inclusion models where English learners are placed in the same classrooms with non-English learners
for English courses; (4) mainstream/inclusion models where English learners are placed in the same classrooms with
non-English learners for core/basic subject areas; (5) Maintenance and/or developmental bilingual education where
English learners are instructed in two languages in separate classrooms for all subjects; and (6) Dual language (two-
way developmental bilingual education) where all students are instructed in two languages for all subjects.
Throughout the rest of the paper, we call schools that use the first two models “schools with sheltered classrooms”.

                                                         12
refugee-receiving schools are 19 percentage points more likely to be Haitian Creole speakers

compared to incumbent students in other classrooms, yet this differences shrinks to 3 percentage

points once we control for the LEP status of the incumbent students.

         Refugees might have had different effects on different groups of incumbent students, and

the Florida data provide us with the opportunity to study these differential relationships along

several dimensions. This exercise is particularly important given the evidence that some student

groups were more likely to be subjected to refugees (e.g., LEP students, students in schools with

sheltered classrooms). First, we consider separately the effects of refugee concentration for

Haitian-born students (12 percent of the incumbent population of the top refugee-receiving

schools), other non-Haitian foreign-born students (9 percent), U.S.-born Haitian Creole speakers

(29 percent), U.S. born black students who are not Haitian Creole speakers (38 percent), other

nonblack U.S. born students (24 percent), LEP students (18 percent), and non-LEP students. We

present this breakdown in the first panel of Table 8, which, for the sake of brevity, presents the

estimated effects of refugee concentration on the performance index only 17, and check the

equivalence of incumbent student baseline characteristics for each student subgroup in Appendix

Table 6. (The first panel of Table 9 repeats the same analysis looking at incumbent student

mobility.) We observe that, across all groups of incumbent students, there is little evidence of a

negative effect of refugees on incumbent students’ test scores; while we observe the occasional

negative estimated relationship, there are many more positive estimated relationships regarding

student performance, and none of the performance estimates are distinguishable from zero. We

also find little evidence that more refugees let to increased out-migration of students. Our general

read of this evidence is that the concentration of refugees has no substantial negative effect on

the short-term outcomes of incumbent students regardless of place of birth, spoken language, or

race/ethnicity.

       For Florida-born students, we can investigate differences in outcomes by maternal

education levels, and we report these findings in the second panel of Table 8, with incumbent

student mobility results presented in the second panel of Table 9, and baseline equivalency

checks presented in Appendix Table 7. Because refugees tend to attend relatively low-SES

schools, we break down the Florida incumbent students into those whose mothers have not

completed their high school degrees, those whose mothers have a high school diploma but no

further education, and those whose mothers have at least some college education. Regardless of

maternal education level, we continue to find no evidence that refugee students substantially

harmed the educational outcomes of any group of incumbent students.

       Finally, the effects of a Haitian refugee influx on incumbent students might differ based

on the share of existing Haitian students in the school, by grade level, school size (above or

below the median size), or by the type of LEP instructional model the school employs. This

might arise, for instance, if schools with sizable Haitian student populations are more likely to

have established support systems for immigrants from Haiti such as Haitian-Creole speaking

counselors, which might ease the transitional burden for the incoming refugees. In the third

through sixth panels of Table 8, we break down the analysis by the share of existing Haitian-

Creole speakers (15 percent versus 40 percent, the 25th percentile versus the 75th percentile

among top refugee receiving schools) and grade level in top refugee receiving schools whereas

the third through sixth panels of Table 9 presents the mobility results and Appendix Table 8

checks the baseline equivalency of incumbent students. The estimated effects suggest no

discernable differences in the effects of refugee concentration on student outcomes by school



                                                14
characteristics. While the occasional estimated coefficient is significantly positive or negative,

the overall pattern of findings indicates a zero effect of refugees on incumbent students.

4.1. Robustness Checks

       To identify the causal effect of refugee concentration on student outcomes, we rely on the

within-school, across-grade variation in refugee concentration. An important challenge in this

approach is the possible strategic placement of refugees across grades by school administrators.

The findings we have presented thus far reveal that the OLS and IV estimators, the latter of

which deal with this possible endogeneity using the naturally-occurring age distribution of

entering refugees, yield comparable results, providing evidence that our OLS estimates are not

contaminated by strategic placement of refugees. To further investigate the strategic placement

of refugees across grades within schools, we also present a falsification exercise where we

estimate (1) using student outcomes during the two years prior to the earthquake. If the cross-

grade, within-school differences in refugee concentration were actually driven by endogenous

factors, one would expect to find a relationship between the refugee concentration in 2010 and

outcomes in 2007-08 and 2008-09. The findings, reported in Appendix Table 9, reveal no such

placebo effect, providing further evidence against strategic placement. Not only are the estimated

relationships between the would-be within-school refugee concentration in 2010 and pre-

earthquake outcomes not statistically significant at conventional levels, but they are also very

small in magnitude: For example, the estimates indicate that a one-percentage-point increase in

the refugee concentration in a given grade is associated with tiny fractions of a standard

deviation reductions in reading and math, respectively, in models that include school fixed

effects and student covariates.




                                                 15
         Another important challenge in our empirical approach is the possibility that there is

insufficient variation in refugee concentration across grades within schools, which would lead to

zero effects of refugee concentration on incumbent student outcomes. Appendix Figure 1

portrays the within-school, cross-grade range in refugee concentration in each top refugee-

receiving school, and shows that about a quarter of these schools (25 schools) have cross-grade

range of at least 5 percentage points in refugee concentration, and about one-tenth (9 schools)

have cross-grade range of at least 10 percentage points. Appendix Table 10 presents the OLS

estimates of the effects of refugee concentration on student test scores and misbehavior in the

first, second, and third year after the earthquake, estimated using school fixed effects and student

covariates, restricting the sample to these high-variance schools. Once again, the findings reveal

no adverse effect of refugees on the educational outcomes of incumbent students. In fact, when

we use the schools with largest cross-cohort range in refugee concentration, we find a

statistically significant positive effect of refugee concentration on incumbent student math scores

in the first two years. 18

         Finally, we employ two alternative empirical strategies to our within-school analysis to

check the robustness of our findings. First, in a difference-in-differences framework we explore

the relationship between refugee concentration and within-student variation in student test scores

and disciplinary incidents using student fixed effects, following individual students between the

2008-09 and 2011-12 school years. 19 In particular, using OLS we estimate:

                       𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝜐𝜐 + 𝜎𝜎𝑅𝑅𝑠𝑠𝑔𝑔 ∗ 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡 + 𝜙𝜙𝑡𝑡 + 𝛿𝛿𝑖𝑖 + 𝜃𝜃𝑔𝑔 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖                      (3)




18
   In Appendix Table 11, we also repeat the same analysis excluding outlier top refugee-receiving schools with
refugee concentrations larger than 5 percent, and reach the same conclusion.
19
   In this exercise, we restrict the sample to students that we observe in all 4 years between 2008-09 and 2011-12.
We lack power to estimate this model with multiple pre-earthquake years of data.

                                                                16
where 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡 is a vector of year dummies for Spring 2010, 2010-11, and 2011-12 school years,

and 𝜙𝜙𝑡𝑡 , 𝛿𝛿𝑖𝑖 , and 𝜃𝜃𝑔𝑔 are year, student, and grade fixed effects. Appendix Table 12 presents the

results, and shows that refugee concentration increases reading performance among incumbent

students, but it also leads to an increase in disciplinary incidents. We do not find any significant

effects of refugees on incumbent student math scores.

        Second, the birth-school match enables us to identify sets of siblings in our Florida-born

student sample, and we use these identifiers to estimate the effect of refugee concentration on

incumbent student outcomes in a family fixed effects framework. In particular, using the sample

of Florida born students who were attending a Florida public school in Fall 2009 and who had at

least one sibling in the school system, we estimate

                             𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽𝑅𝑅𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝛿𝛿𝑓𝑓 + 𝜃𝜃𝑔𝑔 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖                      (4)


where 𝛿𝛿𝑓𝑓 is family fixed effects. Appendix Table 13 presents the effects on incumbent student

outcomes in Spring 2010, 2010-11, and 2011-12 without family fixed effects and student

covariates (columns (I)), including family fixed effects (columns (II)), and including both family

fixed effects and student covariates (columns (III)). In our preferred specification where we

control for both family fixed effects and student covariates, we do not find any significant effect

of refugee concentration on student test scores or disciplinary incidents.

5. Concluding Remarks

        Understanding the effects of refugees on incumbent communities is more important than

ever as the world faces the second largest refugee crisis in a century. In this study, we present the

first evidence on the effects of a major refugee influx on the educational outcomes of incumbent

students using the wave of Haitian refugees who entered Florida public schools after the

devastating earthquake in January 2010. We find no significant adverse effect of refugees on the

                                                          17
educational outcomes of incumbent students including test scores, disciplinary incidents, and

student mobility across schools. While we tend to find many more positive estimates than

negative estimates, the weight of the evidence indicates that refugees have a precisely estimated

zero effect on incumbent students’ outcomes, both immediately following the arrival of refugees

and up to two years afterward.

       That said, there are several factors that might hinder the generalizability of our findings

to other contexts. There is an established and sizeable Haitian immigrant population in Florida

and as we have shown earlier Haitian refugees enrolled in schools with considerable Haitian

student populations. These schools might already have support systems in place to help recent

immigrants from Haiti such as Haitian Creole speaking counselors, and hence might be more

prepared to accommodate an influx of Haitian refugees, minimizing the adverse effects on

existing students. Such support systems might not exist in other contexts (such as the Syrian

refugee crisis in Europe) and hence the negative externalities of refugees on incumbent students

might be more severe. That said, recall that Haitian Creole speakers were still a small minority of

incumbent students in almost every refugee-receiving school prior to the 2010 earthquake. Just

six percent of the incumbent student body of the typical refugee-receiving school spoke Haitian

Creole, and only half of all Haitian immigrants (not counting native-born Haitian Creole

speakers) are considered limited English proficient. Limited English proficient Haitian Creole

speakers account for more than ten percent of the incumbent student body population in only 78

schools, and more than twenty percent of the incumbent student population in just 26 schools.

Therefore, it is unlikely that there existed substantial educational or social services for Haitian

immigrants in all but a relative handful of schools.




                                                 18
       In summary, there appears to be little evidence that a sizeable influx of refugees has

short-term negative consequences on native students. Taken together with new evidence by

Evans and Fitzgerald (2017) that after a period of adjustment, refugees have similar economic

outcomes, across several dimensions, to comparison U.S.-born natives, and ultimately pay more

in taxes than they receive in benefit, these findings indicate that the potential negative

externalities associated with refugee admissions are likely lower than some may worry.

Notes: Robust standard errors clustered at the school level are given in parentheses. Each entry represents the
estimated correlation between within-cohort refugee concentration and the corresponding student and average
teacher attribute at the grade level with (columns (I)) and without (columns (II)) school fixed effects. Regressions
using all refugee-receiving schools include 865,399 unique student observations, or 473,465 unique prior year test
scores, or 438,187 Florida born students for whom maternal characteristics are available, or 4,493 school-by-grade
average teacher characteristics. Regressions using the top refugee-receiving schools include 72,407 unique student
observations, or 39,678 unique prior year test scores, or 36,309 Florida born students for whom maternal
characteristics are available, or 524 school-by-grade average teacher characteristics. Novice teachers are defined as
teachers with no prior experience; early career teachers are identified as those with 1-3 years of experience; mid-
career teachers are identified as teachers with 4-10 years of experience, and late career teachers are teachers with
more than 10 years of experience. * p < 0.10, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01.

Notes: Robust standard errors clustered at the school level are given in parentheses. Each column represents the
effect of within-cohort refugee concentration in Spring 2010 on incumbent student mobility by Fall 2010 and Fall
2011, estimated using OLS, by existing student characteristics, maternal education, share of existing Haitian Creole
speakers, grade level, school size, school LEP instruction model. All regressions include school fixed effects and the
student characteristics (other than maternal attributes) listed in Table 4. * p < 0.10, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01.

Notes: Robust standard errors clustered at the school level are given in parentheses. Each entry represents the
estimated correlation between within-school age distribution of Haitian refugees and the corresponding student
attribute or teacher attribute. Regressions using all refugee-receiving schools include 865,399 unique student
observations, or 473,465 unique prior year test scores, or 438,187 Florida born students for whom maternal
characteristics are available, or 4,493 school-by-grade average teacher characteristics. Regressions using the top
refugee-receiving schools include 72,407 unique student observations, or 39,678 unique prior year test scores, or
36,309 Florida born students for whom maternal characteristics are available, or 524 school-by-grade average
teacher characteristics. Novice teachers are defined as teachers with no prior experience; early career teachers are
identified as those with 1-3 years of experience; mid-career teachers are identified as teachers with 4-10 years of
experience, and late career teachers are teachers with more than 10 years of experience. * p < 0.10, ** p < 0.05, *** p

Notes: Robust standard errors clustered at the school level are given in parentheses. In all regressions we restrict the
sample to students with at least one sibling in the school system. Numbers in brackets represent the number of
observations used in the corresponding specification. Each column represents the effect of within-cohort refugee
concentration in Spring 2010 on the test scores and disciplinary incidents of incumbent students in Spring 2010,
2010-11, and 2011-12, estimated using OLS. Columns labeled as (I) and (II) only include students with non-missing
lagged outcome variable for the outcome specified. Columns labeled as (III) introduce the student characteristics
(other than maternal attributes) listed in Table 4. * p < 0.10, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01.
