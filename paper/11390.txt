                                           ABSTRACT

A common practice in the fields of education, mental health, and juvenile justice is to segregate

problem youths in groups with deviant peers. Assignments of this sort, which concentrate deviant

youths, may facilitate deviant peer influence and lead to perverse outcomes. This possibility adds

to the list of arguments in support of "mainstreaming" whenever possible. But there are other

concerns that help justify segregated-group assignments, including efficiency of service delivery

and protection of the public. Our analysis organizes the discussion about the relevant tradeoffs.

First, the number of deviant youths (relative to the size of the relevant population, or to the

number of assignment locations) affects whether the harm-minimizing assignment calls for

diffusion or segregation. Second, the nature of the problematic behavior is relevant; behavior

which has a direct, detrimental effect on others who share the assignment makes a stronger case

for segregation. Third, the capacity for behavior control matters, and may make the difference in

a choice between segregation and integration. We briefly discuss the empirical literature, which

with some exceptions is inadequate to the task of providing clear guidance about harm-

minimizing assignment strategies. Finally, we reflect briefly on the medical-practice principle

"first do no harm," and contrast it with the claims of potential victims of deviants.

Introduction

       A common practice in the fields of education, mental health, and juvenile justice

is to segregate problem youths in groups with deviant peers. In education, disruptive or

delinquent youths may be assigned to self-contained classrooms for in-school detention,

or even to alternative schools. In mental health interventions, conduct-disordered youths

and drug abusers may be assigned to group therapy or placed with similar youths in

group homes and day-treatment programs. In the juvenile justice system youths are

placed with other offenders in camps, training schools, and detention centers. It is

entirely possible that assignments of this sort, which concentrate deviant youths, may

lead to perverse outcomes. Instead of helping their transition to a healthier, more

productive trajectory, these assignments may actually facilitate a greater commitment to

deviant behavior. The result may be an increase in the rate or seriousness of problem

behaviors, either during the course of the placement or in subsequent years (McCord,

2003; Dishion, McCord and Poulin, 2002).

       This possibility of an iatrogenic effect from interventions with troubled and

troublesome youths is relevant in designing policy, and adds to the list of arguments in

support of “mainstreaming” or diffusing them among other youths whenever possible.

But there are other concerns that help justify segregated-group assignments. Delivery of

treatment through specialized resources may be accomplished more efficiently in settings

dedicated to that purpose, and that may also be true in monitoring and controlling the

behavior of conduct-disordered youths. In any event, segregating such youths has the

desirable effect of insulating other youths and adults from them. And the threat of




                                                                                           3
assignment to in-school detention or a training school may have some deterrent effect on

bad behavior. In considering alternative assignment policies, the validity and strength of

these rationales should be weighed against the possible perverse results from

concentrating deviant youths.

        Our analysis is intended to help organize the discussion about these tradeoffs.

First, we show that the number of deviant youths (relative to the size of the relevant

population, or to the number of assignment options) may well determine whether the

harm-minimizing assignment calls for diffusion, segregation, or some of both. Second,

the way in which individual behavior cumulates to collective harm can be of considerable

relevance in characterizing the harm-minimizing assignment; in cases where bad

behavior has a direct, detrimental effect on others who share the assignment (including

youths who are not deviant), then there is a stronger case for segregation than when harm

occurs outside of the assignment location. Third, the capacity for behavior control

matters, and may make the difference in a choice between segregation and integration; an

innovation that enhances control over disruptive youths may make integration more

attractive.

        We briefly discuss the empirical literature, which is typically inadequate to the

task of providing clear guidance about harm-minimizing assignment strategies.

Empirical investigations often focus just on the behavior of deviant youths under

different assignments, without considering the effects on others or the overall social costs

of the assignments. There are some exceptional cases where the evidence, while limited,

may nonetheless be sufficient.




                                                                                            4
       Given the inherent complexity of the assignment problem and the limited

evidence, decisions will have to be made under uncertainty about costs and

consequences. Furthermore, alternative assignment possibilities are likely to bring into

conflict the interests of the deviant youths, other youths, and the taxpayers. Under these

circumstances, is there an ethical obligation to give priority to the interests of the group

that is to be directly acted on – the deviants? We reflect briefly on the medical-practice

principle “first do no harm,” and contrast it with the claims of potential victims of

deviants.

       The conceptual and methodological matters discussed here are also relevant to

most any policy dilemma involving sorting and mixing of different sorts of people across

locations. In what follows we do not always use deviant youth as the exemplar, but refer

to examples involving race and residential location of families in poverty.



Conceptual Issues

       Much of the relevant literature has been concerned with establishing whether the

decision of how to distribute deviant youths across locations (assignments) has an effect

on their behavior. That inference has proven quite challenging in practice, as we discuss

in a subsequent section. But even when this empirical effort produces reliable results, it

may leave us far short of having the information necessary to make a normative

judgment. To make that judgment, it is also necessary to make inferences about how the

assignment affects the quantity and distribution of total harm to anyone affected by the

assignment, including bystanders.




                                                                                               5
       One important distinction is whether the harm is limited to the individuals judged

to be at risk, or whether their behavior victimizes others as well. If there are victims, then

it is important to distinguish between cases where the victims are in the same assigned

location, or are outsiders. These distinctions suggest three logical cases: no other

victims, victims elsewhere, victims in the assigned location. In what follows we combine

the first two cases and contrast it with the third. The distinction, then, is whether the

behavior harms those who share the assigned location or not. The two types are labeled

“D” and “S.”

       Type D encompasses those behaviors that have an effect on others who share the

       assigned location, such as classroom disruption (hence the “D”) and bullying.



       Type S behaviors are those that do not have a direct impact on others who share

       the assignment. Included here are a variety of harms to the deviant youths

       themselves both during and after the particular assignment in question. Examples

       include smoking (the “S”), alcohol and drug abuse, and inattention to schoolwork.

       But this category is not limited to “victimless” behaviors. Also included are gang

       involvement and other criminal activity, as long as their impact is outside of the

       assigned location.

Of course it is quite possible that D and S behaviors are both affected by the assignment.

       To gain leverage on the assignment problem, we stipulate several simplifying

assumptions and refer specifically to the school official’s task of assigning students to

classrooms. The students are of two sorts, “non-deviants” (the As) and “deviants” (the

Bs); their identities are pre-determined and known to the official. There are a fixed




                                                                                             6
number of classrooms and teachers. The considerations relevant to the official’s decision

will depend on the nature of the problem behavior.

       The consequences within the classroom of Type D behavior are obviously

relevant in assigning students. Other considerations may also come to bear for both types

of students. Most interesting is the possibility of social influence among deviant peers.

The actual behavior of a deviant youth (either D or S) may well depend on whether there

are other deviant youths in the same classroom to serve as models, guides, accomplices,

or an appreciative audience.

       Also relevant is the capacity of teachers and other resources to influence bad

behavior in the classroom or outside it. If such influence is possible, whether exercised

through discipline or some sort of constructive (therapeutic) programming, then the

actual behavior of deviant youths will depend on the level of resources relative to the

“load” in the classroom. Resource considerations may lend weight to a prescription for

either diffusion or segregation of deviant youths, depending on what might be deemed the

“technology of control.”

       This conceptual setup provides the basis for developing some guidance for the

assignment problem. Of the various assumptions, the one that may seem most artificial is

that there are only two types of youths (A and B). One generalization is to assume that

youths form a continuum with respect to their propensity to engage in deviant behavior,

ranging from those who will initiate it under most any circumstance to those who require

a powerful stimulus, such as a complete breakdown of order. While this generalization is

more flexible and realistic, we stick with the more tractable assumption of a dichotomy

for now. Whether dichotomy or continuum, the mix of propensities can be understood as




                                                                                            7
producing aggregate behavior that is conditioned on peer influence and external social

control.

           Another note on the basic setup: While our discussion is for the most part

presented with reference to the problem of distributing students among classrooms, or

among schools, the logic is applicable to a variety of other assignment problems. For

example, the state of North Carolina is in the process of demolishing its large juvenile

corrections institutions and is building a series of smaller units. Among the relevant

questions are how large these new units should be and whether the protocol for assigning

juveniles among them call for concentrating the most serious delinquents or mixing them

in with the rest of the population. Other examples from the school context include those

facing a district school system: whether to start an alternative school for deviant students,

whether to locate ninth graders in middle school or high school, and whether to retain

large numbers of failing students for a repeat in grade.1 More broadly, it is relevant to

any scheme that re-sorts youths across neighborhoods or schools, including housing

relocation programs and school voucher programs. We return to these examples in the

empirical section.



Case I: Assignment when there is no contagion and no control

           If deviant peers do not influence others’ behavior, and the issue of concern is

limiting Type S behavior (smoking, crime outside the classroom, etc.), then the

assignment problem appears trivial: The amount of Type S behavior would not be

affected by how students are sorted among classrooms. Two exceptions should be noted:

First, in some cases the assignment to a segregated classroom is justified as punishment,
1
    Thanks to Al Blumstein for suggesting these examples.


                                                                                             8
as in the case of in-school detention. One rationale is that the threat of such an

assignment will deter bad behavior. Second is the possibility that deviant behavior is

influenced by the capacity of the teacher and other resources to influence such behavior.

A discussion of that possibility is left for the next section.

        For disruptive (Type D) behavior, the assignment matters even if there is no social

influence. In a recent theoretical article that analyzes this circumstance, Edward Lazear

(2001) provides a rationale for segregation. He postulates that any one student can

disrupt the productive teaching and learning activity in the classroom for a spell, and that

some students are more prone to being disruptive than others. Lazear sets up the analysis

by assuming two types of students: “A” students are non-disruptive all but a fraction of

the time given by (1-pA), while the “B” students are disruptive a larger fraction (1-pB) of

the time. Under the assumption that episodes of disruption are uncorrelated random

events, the total amount of productive, non-disrupted time is given by the product

pAa pBb, where the exponents a and b signify the number of A and B students respectively.

        The cumulative harm (assumed proportional to unproductive time) due to Type D

behavior in any one classroom is then

        1 - pAa pBb

and total harm associated with any given assignment of students to classrooms is the sum

over all classrooms.

        Under this setup, consider the marginal cost to the students in a classroom (in

terms of additional time lost to disruption) of replacing an A student with a B student in

that classroom. That marginal cost will be

        pAa pBb - pAa-1 pBb+1 = pAa pBb [ 1- pA-1 pB ],




                                                                                              9
which is a positive number because by assumption pA > pB. This marginal cost declines

as the number of B students, b, grows. The intuition here is simply that the marginal cost

of an extra B student is in the form of a proportional reduction in non-disrupted time. As

B increases, that proportion is applied to a shrinking base of productive teaching time,

pAa pBb. One more disruptive kid added to a classroom that is already mostly out of

control makes little difference to the amount of teaching and learning that takes place

there.

         The mathematical result under Lazear’s assumptions is that an assignment that

separates all the A students from the Bs, placing them in different classrooms, maximizes

the total amount of non-disrupted time, and hence minimizes total harm.2 If that is the

goal, then segregation is the answer. Of course, that segregated assignment may raise an

equity concern, since the B students will end up with a more meager educational

opportunity than the A students. That concern may be more compelling if the

“disruption” in question takes the form of epileptic seizures or failure to follow directions

due to ADHD, rather than to clowning or getting in fights; if the latter behaviors are

viewed (rightly or wrongly) as volitional and the former not, then we might be more

hesitant to assign the former group to an inferior placement. The question of whose

interests should have priority is a deep one, to which we return at the end of the paper.

         Other assumptions may lead to still different conclusions. The robust lesson from

this analysis is that social contagion is not the only mechanism that should be considered

in making assignments – the influence that youths’ behavior has on the productivity of

the classroom, or (more generally) the wellbeing of other students, may also be relevant.


2
  If there are not enough B students to fill a classroom, then they should still be assigned to the same room,
filling in with As.


                                                                                                            10
That set of concerns raises issues of both fairness and overall harm to the affected

population.



Case II: Assignment when resources matter

       In Case I, we assumed that the youths’ behavior is exogenous, not influenced by

the classroom context. A more realistic assumption is that the amount and quality of

behavior depends on the circumstances. A “deviant youth” can then be identified as one

that has relatively high potential for exhibiting deviant behavior, in the sense that it

doesn’t take much of a stimulus to set them off. In particular, the presence of other

deviant youths may facilitate this potential. Here we consider one mechanism by which

that may happen, the dilution of authority. The next section addresses another

mechanism of this sort, direct social influence.

       Assume each classroom has a teacher who exerts some control over the behavior

of the students. The focus here is again on disruptive (D) behavior. A teacher may be

able to “handle” one or two disruptive kids in her classroom, constraining their tendency

to disrupt the proceedings, but at some point the “load” on her will become too great.

Discipline will begin to break down, and the deviant (B) students’ disruptive tendencies

will be given greater scope.

       When authority is subject to dilution, then the best assignment of students to

classrooms will depend on the capacity of teachers – what “load” can they “handle” – and

the number of Type B youths relative to the total number of classrooms. For example, if

each teacher is capable of fully constraining one B student at most, and there are fewer B

students than classrooms, then the harm-minimizing assignment is to disperse the B




                                                                                           11
students so there is no more than one anywhere. Note that that assignment is not random,

but rather requires an explicit policy of identifying and assigning the Bs with an eye to

the load per teacher.3

         If there are more B students than classrooms, then the nature of the harm-

minimizing assignment may still be dispersion, or it may become segregation. In general

the answer will depend on how behavior and control capacity interact.

         The addition of another B into a classroom has both a direct and indirect effect on

total disruption in that classroom. The direct effect is whatever that new youth adds to

the total, given the circumstances. The indirect effect stems from the fact that the

addition of that youth changes the circumstances by diluting control capacity, with the

result that the behavior of all Bs in that classroom may deteriorate.

         This is a familiar dynamic in community youth programs, mental health

placements, and, most obviously, the criminal-justice area. If, for example, a new

criminal gang forms, its crimes will add to the load on the local police department and

court system. Unless there is excess capacity, the result is likely to be a reduction in the

probability and severity of punishment for any given crime. With the sanction threat

reduced, criminal activity will become more profitable, with the result of further

increases in the crime rate and further dilution of criminal-justice resources. The new

“equilibrium” may be characterized by a much higher crime rate than could be explained

in a direct sense by the formation of that new gang. This type of vicious cycle has been




3
  While systematic dispersion of Bs is ideal, it may not be feasible. In that case it is of interest to ask
whether random assignment would be better than segregation. The answer will depend on the shape of the
function relating concentration to disruption.


                                                                                                         12
used, for example, to explain the extraordinarily high rates of homicide in Columbia

(Gaviria, 2000).4

        While it is certainly possible to adapt the Lazear model (discussed under Case I)

to this new circumstance, there is not much to be learned, since the implications for the

harm-minimizing assignment will be sensitive to the specific assumptions about how

behavior responds to dilution of control.         Some qualitative statements can be made if we

stipulate a sharp threshold phenomenon with respect to “load.” First, if there are too

many Bs to keep every classroom inside this threshold, then some segregated classrooms

may be part of the harm-minimizing solution so that the other classrooms can remain

relatively calm. That is to say, the harm-minimizing solution will entail a combination of

diffusion and segregation. Second, if teachers differ in their capacity to handle Bs, then

the assignment should be adjusted accordingly. Similarly, if there are extra control

resources that can be allocated, then they should be assigned together with the students

with an eye to staying within threshold in as many classrooms as possible.

        If there is no threshold, but rather a pattern of steadily increasing disruption per B

as the number of Bs increases, then it might appear that equalizing the load across

classrooms would minimize harm. But the Lazear model makes clear that that is not

necessarily the case. The question becomes just how the behavior in question contributes

to total harm. If the concern (as in that model) is classroom time available for productive

activities, then there is a limit to just how bad things can be – namely, zero productive



4
 A related dynamic is in reference to the informal social control exerted by a community over its
miscreants. That capacity is also limited. One mechanism that may be relevant is the attenuation of norms
condemning bad behavior. As such behavior becomes more common, the result may be an implicit
downward shift in the cultural definition of deviance. Daniel Patrick Moynihan popularized this idea as
“defining deviance down.”


                                                                                                       13
time. So even an explosive growth in disruptiveness (resulting from the addition of Bs to

the classroom) will result in a muted growth in harm, asymptotic to the limit.

        In sum, if actual behavior depends on the relationship of load to control capacity,

then the total harm resulting from a given number of Bs may be quite sensitive to their

assignment among classrooms. The harm-minimizing assignment will depend on the

number of Bs relative to the number of classrooms and the capacity of ordinary

(unspecialized) teachers to assert control.5

        The capacity of a teacher to maintain control may be expanded through training

and adoption of effective innovations, which in turn could affect the harm-minimizing

assignment. One important example is the Good Behavior Game, developed in the 1960s

by Montrose Wolf, one of the founders of behavior analysis, with two graduate students

(Barrish, Saunders, and Wolf, 1969; Embry, 2002). This game adopts a simple

behavioral strategy to help maintain order in a classroom. The teacher divides the class

into teams and for pre-set intervals keeps a visible scorecard of “fouls” committed by

each team. Teams that behave well (fewer fouls than some pre-set limit) receive a prize.

This method has been subjected to extensive testing, including a large randomized trial

with first graders, the Baltimore Prevention Project, in 1985-6. The game was

demonstrated effective at reducing classroom disruption and increasing pedagogic

productivity; what’s more, and more surprising, it appears to have caused long-term

improvements in behavior, so that even in sixth grade the experimental students were

better behaved, less likely to smoke, and so forth (Kellam et al., 1998). Dennis Embry

5
  This summary suggests that another policy margin relevant to the segregation-integration choice is
classroom size. Smaller, more numerous classrooms provide an opportunity to separate deviant youths and
expand control capacity. General evidence that smaller classroom size is helpful to student learning is
provided, for example, by Alan Krueger in his analysis of Tennessee’s experiment with reduced classroom
size for students in kindergarten through third grade (Krueger, 1999).


                                                                                                    14
(2002) has nominated the Good Behavior Game as a “behavioral vaccine,” for its power

to reduce impulsive, disruptive behaviors and set deviant youths on a healthier course.

       Thus the Good Behavior Game provides teachers with the capacity to reduce both

Type D and Type S behaviors. The harm associated with having deviant youths in the

classroom is thereby reduced. If the game were difficult to implement (as suggested by

the fact that it is not currently used much in ordinary classrooms), it would provide an

impetus to segregate deviant youths into classrooms with teachers that do use the method.

On the other hand, if it were widely adopted, as suggested by advocates, then it would

reduce the costs of mainstreaming deviant youths.



Case III: Assignment when deviant peer influence is important

       As in Case II we assume that the behavior of deviant youths depends on the

circumstances, but now consider a different mechanism: youths may influence each other

directly, in addition to whatever indirect influence may occur via the dilution of

authority. Deviant peer influence of this sort is akin to the spread of a contagious disease,

and is often referred to as social contagion (Cook and Goss, 1996).

       We initially assume that contagious transmission for deviant behavior is limited to

those with a propensity for that behavior. Three recent studies from widely differing

contexts are among those that offer general support for this assumption. First, in the

Baltimore Prevention Project cited above, Kellam et al. (1998) found that first graders

with aggressive tendencies were the ones whose behavior was most affected by the

presence of other aggressive children in the classroom. Second an analysis of the

influence of randomly assigned roommates for first-year students at a university found




                                                                                           15
that males who had been drinkers in high school had a positive effect on the quantity of

drinking by their college room mates, but only if that room mate had also been a drinker

in high school (Boisjoly et al., 2003). Third, an analysis of the post-release behavior of

delinquents in Florida training schools found that the likelihood of post-release

recidivism was positively related to the concentration of youths who happened to be in

that reformatory with similar criminal histories; for example, auto thieves were more

likely to steal again following release if they had been locked up with a relatively high

number of other auto thieves (Bayer et al., 2003).

       In evaluating alternative assignment strategies, contagion is analytically similar to

the problem of authority dilution. The addition of a badly behaved individual to a

classroom adds to the total harm directly (by his own behavior), and also indirectly

through his influence on other deviants in the room. This process may exhibit a threshold

phenomenon. In the analysis of disease epidemics, a critical point occurs where there is

enough contact between infected contagious individuals and “susceptible” individuals so

that each case of infection results in more than one additional case -- initiating explosive

growth. The concentration of deviants required to produce this result is akin to the

capacity of a teacher to handle a load of disruption. And the two mechanisms may be

related substantively, as well as by analogy: the teacher’s ability to respond effectively to

disruption may be instrumental in stopping the spread of a contagious process.

       The possibility of social influence is not limited to Type D (disruption) behavior,

but also includes Type S. As with auto thieves in the training-school study mentioned

above, the behavior of a deviant youth outside of the immediate assignment may be

influenced by who was in the same location with him. But there is an important




                                                                                             16
difference between S and D behavior in evaluating alternative assignments. Much of the

harm from D-behavior may fall on non-deviant classmates, but by assumption the harm

from S-behavior is outside of that setting. Thus one of the main justifications for

segregation is absent in the case of S behavior.

   If S-behavior is the issue and social contagion a real possibility, then the best

assignment depends (as usual) on the number of deviants relative to classrooms, and the

shape of what might be called the “social-contagion function.” If there are fewer

deviants than classrooms, then no more than one per classroom is the harm-minimizing

solution. If there is more than one per classroom, it is important to know something

about how the behavior of Bs responds to the concentration of other deviants. Here are

two possibilities:

   •   If social influence is characterized by a threshold phenomenon, such that social

       amplification of S behavior does not begin until there are at least n+1 deviants in

       the classroom, then the key issue is how the ratio of deviants to classrooms relates

       to that threshold. If there are 10 classrooms and fewer than 10n deviants, then

       systematic diffusion is the harm-minimizing solution. If social influence is

       characterized by a threshold phenomenon, but there are more than 10n deviants to

       be divided among the 10 classrooms, then a mixed approach may be best, with

       some Ss assigned to “dilute” classrooms (n deviants) and others in classrooms that

       are more concentrated. In some cases the best assignment may include a few

       segregated classrooms with all Bs, and the rest integrated. But it may also work

       out that equal division is the harm-minimizing solution. Finding the best answer




                                                                                          17
       depends on knowing the shape of the relationship between harm and deviant

       concentration.

   •   Second is the possibility that there is contagion without a threshold, so that

       deviant influence grows stronger as the concentration of Bs in the classroom

       increases. In other words, suppose that the addition of another B to the classroom

       tends to make each of the others more committed to deviant behavior, and that

       effect increases monotonically with the number of Bs. In this case, the harm-

       minimizing solution is (once again) equal division of Bs among available

       classrooms.

       In the introduction, we noted that our analysis of sorting and mixing is relevant to

other domains besides deviant behavior. Consider a quite different domain, taken from

the influential Coleman Report of 1966. That report analyzed the effect of racial

segregation in schools. The empirical analysis was based on a national sample of

American schoolchildren. James S. Coleman and collaborators estimated the effect of the

racial makeup of the student’s school (percentage black) on his or her achievement test

score. His estimation procedure assumed that the effect was linear, and possibly different

for black than non-black students.

       To preserve as much of the previous notation as possible, we define the following

variables and analyze a representative school:

       a = number of non-black students in the school (type A)

       b= number of black students in the school (type B)

       k= total number of students in the school, k=a+b

       Yi = achievement test score of student of type i (i=A or B)




                                                                                          18
       pi= constant associated with student of type i

         i=   parameter indicating the effect of racial concentration

We follow Coleman in assuming a linear relationship which may differ between groups,

as follows:

       Yi=pi + ib/k

If the goal is to maximize the sum of achievement-test scores for the classroom, then the

maximand is:

       apa + a ab/k + bpb + b bb/k

or
                                            2
        apa +    ab(k-b)/k   + bpb +   bb   /k



       A couple of interesting cases come out of this setup. If the effect of the race mix

is the same on blacks and non-blacks, so that     a   =   b=   , then the expression simplifies to

       apa + bpb + b.

In this case, the number of black students in the school has a linear effect on total

achievement. If we then sum across all schools, all that is relevant is the total number of

black and non-black students – their distribution across schools has no effect. So in this

case, the decision of how to mix different types of students matters in the small (at the

level of the individual school) but not at the systems level. This point has been noted as

well by other analysts of peer and neighborhood effects (Jencks and Mayer, 1990;

Galster, Quercia and Cortes, 2000).




                                                                                                19
       Another possibility, made interesting by the fact that Coleman concluded that it

best fit the data, is that the black concentration in a school affects black scores but not

white scores. In that case, we have the total score in the school equal to:
                       2
       apa + bpb +   bb   /k

If we sum over all schools in the system, it turns out, assuming    b   < 0 (as found by

Coleman), that uniform integration is the policy that maximizes total scores.



Summary

       One lesson is that an evaluation of the effects of an assignment policy for deviant

youths should not be limited to the behavior of the youths in question. Also required is

an assessment of the harm to all who are affected by the assignment, including the

bystanders.

       A slight generalization of our analysis serves as a useful summary. The harm in

any one classroom is a function of the number of deviant youths. Total harm in the

system is the sum over the classrooms. Thus:

       Harm in classroom c = Hc = H(bc, ac)

       Total harm =        c   Hc

If Hc is a linear function of bc, then total harm is determined only by the total number of

Bs in the system. But under a variety of circumstances harm is decidedly not linear in bc

and the assignment does matter. We reviewed cases in which there was a limited

capacity to maintain order, existence of deviant peer influence, or harm that is not

proportional to bad behavior (as in the case of classroom disruption).




                                                                                              20
        A full analysis would also take account of the budget impact on the relevant

agencies, and other mechanisms that may be relevant – especially the deterrent effect of

the threat of assignment to a segregated classroom (or training school).



Empirical Issues

        In choosing an assignment policy, it would be useful to know the outcomes for all

youths in the system for each of the options under consideration. To keep things simple,

suppose that only two schemes are under consideration, one that segregates deviant youth

(T=1) and the other that “mainstreams” such youth into classrooms with non-deviant

youth (T=0). In a randomized experiment in which entire school systems are randomly

assigned to the segregated or integrated conditions, the net effect of the difference in

assignment schemes can be estimated by regressing outcomes for each youth on an

indicator for the system’s treatment assignment. In the equation below, a limited number

of parameters are to be estimated, allowing for different intercepts and response

coefficients for non-deviant (A) and deviant (B) youths. The residual terms       c   and   i


represent other characteristics of classrooms and individuals respectively that affect the

outcome; because of random assignment, the distribution of these characteristics will be

balanced across treatment conditions (that is, orthogonal to the assignment indicator T).

In this equation, the variable Ii is an indicator for whether the individual is type A (Ii=1)

or B (Ii=0).

        Yi =   + Ii +   A Ii*Ti   +   B   (1-Ii)*Ti +   c+ i




                                                                                                21
In this setup,   A provides   an estimate of the average effect on As of segregated

classrooms, while    B   provides the same information for the Bs. A weighted average of

these two coefficients would provide an overall estimate. The relationship between these

estimates and “harm” depends on the nature of the outcome measure. Positive s indicate

segregation is harmful if the outcome measure is crime, injury, absenteeism, or smoking.

If the outcome is an achievement test score, then a positive     indicates that segregation is

beneficial.

        In practice there may be a number of outcome measures that are deemed relevant.

A complete analysis would require combining them in some fashion to produce an

comprehensive measure of welfare (Nagin, 2001).

        This group assignment experiment highlights conditions under which analysts

could reliably compare two (or more) assignment practices. This ideal is rarely achieved

in practice. Among the limitations of available research literature are inadequate

measurement and uncertain interpretation.

        Measurement. Often, the outcome measures are limited to one or several

measures of the behavior of the target youth (usually the deviant youths). That approach

is inadequate if the behavior of other youths may also be affected by the assignment.

Furthermore, data on the behavior measures, even if collected for all youths, may not

adequately capture the effects on welfare, as in the case of classroom disruption, bullying,

and so forth.

        Adding up. A comprehensive assessment should consider the system-wide

effects, although that is not standard practice. For example, a finding that the behavior of

Bs tends to deteriorate in the presence of a high concentration of Bs may be presented as




                                                                                            22
evidence that Bs should be integrated. But that conclusion does not necessarily follow,

since it only looks at the costs of concentration, and not the possible benefits to those

classrooms and students that avoid contact with Bs in a concentrated assignment.

       Self-selection. The Coleman Report cited above provides one well-known

example of estimating peer effects on youth outcomes. Coleman’s estimates, like most

estimates of peer effects in the literature, were based on natural variation rather than

experimentally induced variation. In “nature,” students in integrated classrooms are

likely to differ in relevant ways from students in segregated classrooms. Coleman’s

analysis attempts to adjust for this problem by controlling for measures of family

background and other student characteristics available to him in his data set (the EEOC).

But those measures are far from comprehensive. Inevitably there remains the question:

Why do two observationally equivalent minority students wind up in very different types

of schools?

       Suppose, for example, that parents who choose an integrated school for their

children tend to have different attitudes toward race and education on average than those

who choose a more segregated school. (“Choice” in this case may be exercised by

choosing where to live or choosing between private and public schools.) If African-

American parents who are most committed to education are the ones who manage to

navigate their child’s way into an integrated setting, and parent competence and attitudes

cannot be “controlled for” (because they are not measured adequately), then Coleman’s

analysis and similar non-experimental estimates will confound the effects of unmeasured

parent attributes with the effects of school racial composition. Put differently, the self-

selection of families and youth into different educational or other social settings may




                                                                                              23
compromise the internal validity of estimates for peer effects on youth outcomes, causing

biased estimates.

       Self-selection could also affect the external validity (generalizability) of estimates

of peer effects if peer influences differ among settings. For example, suppose that in the

mid 1960’s, when the EEOS was collected, minority families who sent their children to

integrated school settings only did so in areas where the local white population was

relatively progressive and open to the idea of school desegregation. In this case the effect

of racial desegregation on whites in desegregated schools may be quite different from the

hypothetical effect on whites of integrating all-white schools. Introducing minority

students to all-white schools may have more negative effects on the whites in those

schools (and the newly introduced black students as well) than the estimates in the

Coleman Report would suggest. (For more on the issue of “local average treatment

effects,” see Imbens and Angrist, 1994, and Angrist, Imbens and Rubin, 1996).

       Classrooms, Control or Contagion? Even if, despite the self-selection problem,

the parameter estimates are valid, there remains the question of just what can be learned

from them. The parameters measuring peer context in a standard observational study do

not identify the causal mechanism that is responsible for the estimated effect. Possible

mechanisms include social contagion, the effects of “load” on control, and unmeasured or

poorly measured aspects of the classroom environment itself (Manski, 1993).

Understanding the mechanism is usually important in designing an appropriate

assignment and related policies.

       This discussion suggests that standard practice within the empirical literature on

peer effects is unlikely to be informative about the net impact of different assignment




                                                                                           24
processes within our public-school or juvenile-justice systems. But there is a growing

experimental literature that eliminates most of the self-selection problem and is helpful in

other respects as well. Here we review a small sample of such experiments.



First-year dormitory assignments

       Many residential colleges and universities assign some first-year students to

dormitory rooms more-or-less at random. That assignment scheme provides a natural

experiment for studying peer effects. Usually membership in social groupings is

influenced in part by individual choice, which makes it difficult to distinguish the effects

of the group from the characteristics of the people who tend to join that group. Random

assignment eliminates that problem. In one study, randomly assigned roommates at a

large mid- western university were found to influence each others drinking under some

circumstances (Boisjoly et al., 2003). The effect was only found for males, and only

when both roommates had been drinkers in high school – drinking in college by those

who had been abstainers in high school was not affected by first-year roommate

assignment. But when two drinkers were assigned to the same room, the effect (in the

male dorms) was to amplify their drinking.

       If the university’s goal were to reduce drinking by undergraduates, then these

results are sufficient to point the way. It would be advisable in making dormitory

assignments to match high-school abstainers with drinkers. That conclusion is strongest

if drinking is primarily a Type S behavior rather than a Type D behavior. If on the other

hand a roommate’s drinking tends to negatively affect the quality of life in the dorm

room (a Type D behavior), then the normative circumstance is more complicated. It




                                                                                          25
could be argued that the abstainers should be spared the disruptive influence of a drinking

roommate, even if the total prevalence of alcohol problems would be reduced by forced

integration.



Baltimore Prevention Project

       In the Baltimore Prevention Project, introduced above, first graders were assigned

to classrooms on a random basis. Sheppard Kellam and colleagues (Kellam et al., 1998)

evaluated the effects on behavior of this assignment (and the application of the Good

Behavior Game) years later, when the children were in sixth grade. One finding was that

the initial assignment had a long-term effect on the behavior of the most aggressive boys.

Those who were identified as aggressive in first grade behaved worse five years later if

they happened (by chance) to end up in a first-grade classroom with a relatively high

concentration of other aggressive boys.

       Because the initial assignment was made randomly, it can be concluded with

some confidence that Kellam’s finding reflects a causal process involving peer effects.

Perhaps the first-grade exposure to other aggressive boys exacerbated their tendencies, or

perhaps the first grade provided an opportunity for the aggressive boys to find each other

and become troublemaking companions thereafter.

       What does this finding imply about assigning aggressive children to first grade

classrooms? Assuming we only care about their subsequent behavior, and that behavior

translates into social harm in a straightforward (additive) manner, then the answer could

potentially be derived from the analysis of these data. Given an estimated relationship

between first-grade class composition and subsequent behavior, simulations could be run




                                                                                           26
to determine the total amount of trouble associated with different hypothetical

assignments. The best assignment may well be an even distribution of these boys among

classes, but not necessarily – if they are sufficiently prevalent, it may be best to

concentrate some of them and diffuse the rest. In any event, the “right” answer would

require that the objectives be identified explicitly.



Moving to Opportunity

       The best available evidence to date on the existence of “neighborhood effects” on

youth outcomes derives from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s

Moving to Opportunity (MTO) housing-voucher experiment. MTO overcame the self-

selection problem that plagued previous studies of neighborhood effects by randomly

assigning public housing families who volunteered for the demonstration into different

mobility treatment groups, two of which were offered housing vouchers to move to

lower-poverty areas and one of which – the control group – received no additional

services under the program.

       Short-term findings from MTO suggested that moving from high- to low-poverty

neighborhoods reduces youth involvement in problem behavior and may increase

achievement test scores (Kling, Katz and Liebman, 2001; Ludwig, Duncan and

Hirschfield, 2001; Ludwig, Ladd and Duncan, 2001; Goering and Feins, 2003).

Additional years’ worth of post-randomization data suggest that moving to a

neighborhood with less poverty produces lasting behavioral benefits among adolescent

girls but not boys (Kling and Liebman, 2004; Kling, Ludwig and Katz, 2004).




                                                                                         27
       Most relevant for our purposes, MTO tells us nothing about the effects of moving

youth across neighborhoods on those who reside in either the origin or destination

neighborhoods of MTO participants. The harms to neighbors of Type D behavior are

ignored. For that reason it is not possible to assess the net social benefit of the mobility

induced by the experimental intervention. Even more problematic is projecting what

would happen if housing vouchers were offered to all public-housing families under the

same terms as the MTO experimental group.



School Vouchers

       As another example, consider the case of school vouchers, which, like housing

vouchers, help move youths to new social settings. Much of the recent evidence comes

from local randomized housing-voucher experiments. The first and perhaps best-known

program comes from Milwaukee. While students in Milwaukee were not actually

randomly assigned to “voucher” or “no voucher” groups, as in a classical randomized

experiment, private schools in the program that had more applicants than slots were

required to admit students on the basis of a random lottery. In this sense the Milwaukee

voucher program provides a particularly credible natural experiment; the best available

study of Milwaukee suggests that attending private rather than public school produces

gains in math but not in reading (Rouse, 1998).

       More recent voucher programs in New York City, Washington, DC and Dayton,

Ohio use formal randomized experimental designs and yield suggestive evidence of

positive private-school effects, at least on some students in some grades, although the

experimental designs behind these programs is undermined somewhat by response rates




                                                                                           28
to the follow-up surveys used to measure student outcomes that are lower than one might

wish (Howell and Peterson, 2002; Howell, Wolf, Campbell and Peterson, 2002).6

         In all of these school-voucher experiments, the causal mechanism is not well

identified. It could be that the private schools offer better instruction on average, or that

the peer environment is more conducive to academic achievement. If the latter

mechanism is part of the mix, then the system-wide effects of a voucher program may be

quite different than the effects on those who take up the vouchers. For example, suppose

that those who volunteer for these voucher experiments are among the best students in

their old public schools but now among the weakest students in their new private schools.

In this case their take-up of the voucher offer leads to a reduction in average student

quality in both the origin and destination schools. If individual achievement is positively

influenced by the average quality of peers, then the result would be that the voucher

students would benefit (by association with better students) while all others – both public

and private – would lose. So once again we need a more comprehensive measure.



System-level studies

         The case of school vouchers provides a useful example of the distinction between

“mover” and “systems-level” studies. What would happen to the average achievement of

all American youth if our country adopted a large-scale school voucher program?



6
  If we were certain that the characteristics of non-respondents in the voucher treatment and control groups
were on average identical then relatively low response rates would reduce the statistical bias of the analysis
but not introduce bias. However as an incentive to participate in follow-up surveys, control group families
who responded to these surveys were entered into a new voucher lottery (Howell, Wolf, Campbell and
Peterson, 2002, p. 196). This raises the possibility that the voucher treatment group respondents may have
been the families who were most satisfied with their voucher experiences while the control responders
consisted disproportionately of those families who were least satisfied with their public school experience.
This response pattern would lead the analysis to overstate the effects of voucher receipt on achievement.


                                                                                                           29
Because no such system has ever been implemented in the United States, we cannot

answer this question directly. But intriguing evidence on this point comes from Chile,

which has offered students private-school vouchers for the past two decades.

       The number of new private schools that operate in Chile has increased

substantially over this time, with the growth in the size of the new private sector varying

considerably across metropolitan areas within Chile over time. Chang-Tai Hsieh and

Miguel Urquiola (2002) estimate the effects of this resorting program by comparing

trends in average student outcomes across metropolitan areas within Chile that

experienced differential growth in the local private school market.

       Their “difference-in-difference” analysis suggests that Chile’s school voucher

program has redistributed students from public to private schools. As a result, average

test scores have declined in the public schools and increased in private schools. That

pattern may in principle be the result of the concurrent effects of several mechanisms: the

direct effects and peer effects of changes in the quality of the public and private student

enrollees, as well as productivity changes in private and public schools. It is telling in

this respect that the aggregate effect of the growth in the private school market appears to

be nil – when public and private students are considered together, areas that had more

voucher-induced movement into private schools did no better than students in areas with

less movement. These results suggest that whatever gains the “switchers” enjoyed were

compensated by losses to those left behind in the public schools.

       The Chilean experience highlights the tradeoff between mover experiments and

systems-level studies. The former provide highly credible evidence on the effects of

assignment policies on a sub-set of youth within the social system of interest, but provide




                                                                                             30
limited information about systems-level effects. Studies conducted at the systems level,

on the other hand, capture the overall effects of changing assignment procedures within a

system. However these systems-level studies come at the cost of losing the experimental

variation that drives differences in peer settings in mover studies. In the case of Chile,

the private school sector developed more rapidly in large, urban, wealthy metropolitan

areas. Whether changes over time in student outcomes within smaller, rural areas of

Chile provides a good control group for large wealthy areas is not clear.



Recommendations for Research

       The main lesson from the analysis above is that when deviants’ behavior is either

influenced by social context, or victimizes bystanders, a complete evaluation may require

going well beyond observations on the deviants themselves. The study of first-year

dormitory assignments was especially illuminating because it included information on the

college drinking behavior of roommates who were “non deviant” in that they did not

drink in high school; the study may be considered deficient in that it did not include

measures of disruption within the dormitory setting. An important limitation of the MTO

study was that it lacked measures of the effects of those who relocated under the program

on either their new neighborhoods or their old neighborhoods.

       The problem, of course, is that a more comprehensive study tends to be more

costly to implement. Judging whether it is worthwhile to measure contextual effects in

any given evaluation project requires knowledge of when they are likely to be important.

The accumulation of such knowledge should be a goal of any long term research strategy.




                                                                                             31
Normative considerations

        Empirical evidence, even when reliable, is inevitably an incomplete guide to

formulating assignment policies for deviant youths. Also needed is a clear statement of

values. Here we offer several observations, focusing on how to take account of the

possibility of deviant peer contagion.

        If the welfare of the deviant youths is the benchmark for judging policy, then

negative effects from clustering such youths for the delivery of services are of great

concern. The possibility that an intervention would actually do harm to the group that it

was intended to help is not just ironic, but downright scandalous. That’s the power of

Joan McCord’s findings concerning the summer camps for the Cambridge-Somerville

Study’s delinquent youths; she concludes that by concentrating such youths for an

extended period, the camp experience not only did not set them straight, but actually

served to reinforce their deviant propensities (McCord, 2003).

        The Hippocratic stricture “First do no harm,” applies in this case: physicians are

to be especially sensitive to the possibility that their prescriptions will hurt rather than

help their patients. While the operational significance of this stricture is not clear, it may

be a useful check on the tendency to demonstrate professional know-how by offering

some active remedy, rather than let nature take its course. Of course, even well-advised

remedies may be harmful for some patients, but “evidence based medicine” is supposed

to be guided by the empirical probabilities, insisting on an expectation of benefit and the

informed consent of the patient or his or her guardians.

        While this standard is not irrelevant to assignment policies for deviant youths, it

should be noted that the choice between mainstreaming and some form of segregation




                                                                                               32
brings into play the welfare of other youths – those who would have more or less contact

with the deviant youths depending on the assignment – and, of course, cost. If

mainstreaming is good (on average) for the deviant youths, but harmful (on average) to

the others, then the welfare of the deviants alone may be deemed an inadequate standard

for making the judgment. But there is no consensus on this matter.

       Indeed, since the 1970’s those who favor mainstreaming children with mental and

physical disability have the dominant voice in school-assignment policies. Public Law

94-192 guaranteed children with disabilities the right to an education in a mainstreamed

setting with their peers, rather than in separate classrooms (Dodge, Kupersmidt, and

Fontaine, n.d., p. 42). In the Willie M case beginning in 1979, this right was extended by

a federal court to violent delinquents with mental health problems. Among the

advocates’ arguments are that first, mainstreaming is in the disabled youths’ interest, and

second, that their interest should be given priority over other considerations, including

financial cost and classroom management problems.

       Suppose that we accept the principle of a rebuttable presumption that deviant

youths should be mainstreamed. The rebuttal then might take one of several forms: first,

an argument that with available resources and technology, deviant youths would make

better progress in a segregated setting; second, that other youths would benefit from

removing certain deviant peers to segregated settings; or third, that a particular class of

deviant youths did not deserve the “mainstreaming” presumption because they should be

held culpable for their actions (rather than deemed “disabled”). The first two of these

arguments would be based on empirical evidence.

       Several observations about such arguments follow from the analysis in this paper:




                                                                                              33
       Since the evidence on the consequences of alternative assignment policies for

       deviant youths and other youths is typically incomplete or weak, rejecting the null

       hypothesis (rebuttable presumption) is going to be difficult in practice. Where

       mainstreaming is the norm, as in public schools, the presumption will be difficult

       to overcome, given the difficulties of inferring causal effects from available

       evidence. In those cases where there is experimental evidence, it is typically

       incomplete. So even when the preponderance of the evidence suggests that

       mainstreaming would cause more harm overall than segregation, that conclusion

       will not be beyond reasonable doubt.

               On the other hand, if there is no presumption of mainstreaming (as in

       public housing policy, for example, or with respect to youthful offenders who are

       not deemed disabled), then the preponderance of the evidence should rule, and the

       interests of all who are affected be taken into account. In that case the more

       complete analysis of harm suggested in our analysis above is relevant in principle,

       although still difficult in practice. A finding that concentrating deviant youths

       tends to facilitate negative peer influence makes a difference, but only as one of

       several relevant mechanisms.

       The complexities introduced by uncertainty about the effects of alternative

policies, and concerns about how those effects are distributed, can be illustrated by the

example of a school-system assignment policy that is to be guided by projected effects on

an end-of-grade achievement test. The hypothetical choice is between mainstreaming a

group of deviant students, and concentrating them in special classrooms or a separate

school. Evidence is available on how the choice of assignment will affect achievement




                                                                                            34
test scores for each group; the evidence yields probability distributions of results for

deviant students, other students, and overall. Here are several of the possible decision

rules, in order of increasing sensitivity to the welfare of the deviant group:

   1. Choose segregation unless Mainstreaming causes a higher expected achievement

       score for the non-deviant group.

               This standard might be considered if the deviant group in question were

               deemed to be criminals or otherwise blameworthy, and deserving of

               assignment to a segregated setting.

   2. Choose the assignment that has the higher overall expected average achievement

       score (averaging deviants with others).

   3. Choose Mainstreaming unless reliable evidence indicates that there is at least a

       95% chance that the deviant students will have higher average scores if separated.

               This standard is the implementation of the “rebuttable presumption” in

               favor of mainstreaming.

   4. Choose the assignment that has the higher expected average achievement score

       for the deviant students, regardless of the effect on the other students.

The interplay of values and statistical reasoning presents an interesting challenge for

policymakers in this case and similar cases in other domains.
