                                          ABSTRACT

Recent studies demonstrate that air quality improved during the coronavirus pandemic due to the
imposition of social lockdowns. We investigate the impact of COVID-19 on air pollution in the
two largest cities in Taiwan, which were not subject to economic or mobility restrictions. Using a
generalized difference-in-differences approach and real-time data on air quality and
transportation, we estimate that levels of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter
increased 5 - 12 percent relative to 2017 - 2019. We demonstrate that this counterintuitive finding
is likely due to a shift in preferences for mode of transport away from public transportation and
towards personal automobiles. Similar COVID-19 prevention behaviors in regions or countries
emerging from lockdowns could likewise result in an increase in air pollution.

1. Introduction

    In order to reduce the spread of COVID-19 many countries have implemented

significant restrictions on business operations and the mobility of consumers (Cheng

et al., 2020).1 For example, stay-at-home orders and social distancing reduce travel

and limit the ability of individuals to work and shop. The closure of restaurants, retail

establishments, and non-essential businesses likewise limit movement and reduce

economic output. There is significant interest in determining how these unprecedented

restrictions have affected air quality, as the associated findings have important

implications for public health and environmental policy.

      For many years, researchers have sought to determine how both transportation

and industrial activity affect air quality. This is particularly true in cities, where

emissions from internal combustion engines constitute the primary source of air

pollution (EU Science Hub, 2015). COVID-19 restrictions serve as a natural

experiment allowing researchers to link changes in air pollution to reductions in

automobile use, and formulate transportation and urban mobility policies to improve

air quality (Baldasano, 2020).

      Measurements of pollution reduction from restrictions are also important to the

evaluation of mobility limits and other policies intended to stop the spread of COVID-

19. Several recent studies have shown that short-term exposure to high levels of air

pollution is associated with higher COVID-19 mortality (e.g., Persico and Johnson,

2020; Isphording and Pestel, 2020). If restrictions are effective in reducing air

pollution they have the potential to not only directly reduce the likelihood of

infection, but indirectly reduce the severity of COVID-19 infections. 2

                                                   1
     Finally, measurements of the reduction in air pollution from COVID-19 and

associated mitigation strategies are important to the pursuit of the dual public health

goals of reducing morbidity and mortality from both viruses and modifiable

environmental factors. Between December 30, 2019 and July 8, 2020 there have been

545,728 (recorded) COVID-19 deaths worldwide, with annual deaths on pace to be

roughly double this number (JHU CSSE, 2020). In comparison, outdoor air pollution

causes approximately 3.4 million death per year (Ritchie and Roser, 2019). Therefore,

both COVID-19 and air pollution represent significant threats to global health, and it

is important to monitor the effects of both simultaneously so that policies designed to

mitigate one threat do not worsen the other. For example, there is concern that

rollbacks of environmental regulations intended to lesser the economic effects of

COVID-19 could lead to longer term worsening of deadly air pollution (Persico and

Johnson, 2020; Gardiner, 2020). In addition, industrial production could intensify

relative to pre-coronavirus as businesses seek to recover from COVID-19-related

production shocks, and pollution-related corporate social responsibility initiatives

might decrease (Gardiner, 2020). COVID-19 could also worsen pollution through

changes in individual behaviors, and these new sources of pollution should be taken

into account when formulating mitigation strategies (Brackett, 2020; Hinson, 2020).

     Recent studies that investigate the effect of the coronavirus pandemic on air

pollution generally find that the lockdowns imposed to combat the virus improved air

quality. However, these studies do not explore the specific mechanisms responsible

for the reduction in pollution 3 and they do not consider how individual prevention

behavior may affect levels of air pollution after the lockdowns are lifted. We seek to

fill this gap in the literature by investigating the impact of COVID-19 in Taiwan,

 An exception is Dang and Trinh (2020) which used Google Mobility Reports to show that mobility
was lower in places where government policies were more stringent.
                                                2
which did not impose any mobility restrictions on residents or mandate business

closures. Using real-time data on air quality and transportation in the two largest cities

in Taiwan, we find that reductions in the use of public transportation and increases in

automobile use worsened air quality during the COVID-19 pandemic.



2. Literature Review

    There is a fast-growing literature on the impact of COVID-19 on air pollution

across the world. Many studies analyze data from individual cities with air pollution

monitoring stations (Xu et al., 2020; He, Pan and Tanaka, 2020; Baldasano, 2020;

Almond, Du and Zhang, 2020; Collivignarelli et al., 2020; Brodeur, Cook and Wright,

2020; Mahato, Pal and Ghosh, 2020; Zangari et al., 2020, Cole, Elliot and Liu, 2020),

while others analyze satellite imagery over countries or broad regions of the globe

(Wang and Su, 2020; Shi and Brasseur, 2020; Fan et al., 2020; Bauwens et al., 2020).

Some studies focus on different measures of pollution, so it is useful to begin by

highlighting a few basic facts about air pollution.

      There are numerous potential measures of pollution, but some are considered to

be more closely related to human health than others. In the U.S., for example, the

Clean Air Act regulates six common air pollutants, including particulate matter (PM10

and PM2.5), ground-level ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2),

nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and lead. 4 The EU’s air quality standards impose limits on

these same pollutants (European Commission 2020).5 While all of the six pollutants

are harmful to humans and the environment, particle pollution and ground-level ozone

are the most widespread (U.S. EPA, 2020). Worldwide, particulate matter is


4
  PM10 and PM2.5 refer to atmospheric particles with a particle size of less than 10 and 2.5 ug,
respectively.
5
  Ozone regulation in the EU is through a target rather than a limit, but the EU additionally limits
benzene (European Commission, 2020).
                                                    3
responsible for more deaths than ozone (38.2/100K capita versus 6.2/100K capita in

2017), and consequently, many studies focus on measures such as PM2.5 (Ritchie and

Roser, 2019).

       All of the above mentioned pollutants except O3 and NO2 are “primary

pollutants” because they are emitted directly into the atmosphere from their source. In

contrast, NO2 is a “secondary pollutant” that is formed through the oxidation of NO

by oxygen in the air. Likewise, O3 is produced through chemical reactions between

nitrogen oxides (NOX) and volatile organic compounds (VOC) in sunlight and warm,

stagnant air. While nitrogen oxides are a precursor to O3, they can also suppress O3 in

colder weather (winter and nighttime) through NOX titration (Jhun et al., 2015). As a

result, there is sometimes an inverse relationship between nitrogen oxides, such as

NO2, and O3. There are many different sources of pollution, including industrial

production, vehicle emissions, the burning of fuel, and natural sources such as

volcanoes or wildfires. For example, among pollutants regulated under the Clean Air

Act, vehicle emissions contribute significantly to higher levels of CO, NO2, PM10 and

PM2.5 (Zhang and Batterman, 2013).6

       Because the coronavirus was first detected in China, and resulted in a strict

lockdown of Wuhan followed by mobility restrictions throughout the country, more

studies focus on air pollution in China than other countries. Xu et al. (2020), Wang

and Su (2020), Shi and Brasseur (2020), Cole, Elliott and Liu (2020), Fan et al.

(2020), and Almond, Du and Zhang (2020) all found that lockdowns and strict

restrictions on economic activities in the city of Wuhan and other regions of China

significantly reduced the level of major air pollutants. For example, Shi and Brasseur

(2020) calculated that surface PM2.5 and NO2 levels decreased by 35% and 60%,



6
    Other pollutants from vehicles include CO2, VOCs and hydrocarbons (Zhang and Batterman 2013).
                                                   4
respectively, in northern China during the COVID-19 pandemic. Such a large short-

term drop in air pollution is unprecedented in China, with only the strict regulations

put in place during the 2008 Beijing Olympics producing comparable reductions

(American Geophysical Union, 2020). However, most of these studies also found that

O3 increased by as much as a factor of 2 due to reductions in nitrogen oxides. Despite

the offsetting effects of these pollutants, He, Pan and Tanaka (2020) estimated that the

improvement in China’s air quality could lead to 24,000 – 36,000 fewer premature

deaths per month. Chen et al. (2020) estimated a smaller total of 8,911 avoided NO2-

related deaths and 3,214 fewer deaths from PM2.5 during the 34-day quarantine period

from February 10, 2020 – March 14, 2020.

     Studies in Europe (Baldasano, 2020; Menut et al., 2020; Bauwens et al., 2020;

Collivignarelli et al., 2020), South Korea (Bauwens et al., 2020) and India (Mahato,

Pal and Ghosh, 2020), all of which implemented some form of economic and mobility

restrictions, produced results that are generally consistent with those from China. For

example, Menut et al. (2020) estimated reductions in NO2 pollution across locations

in Western Europe of 30% - 50%, and reductions in particle concentrations (PM10 and

PM2.5) of 5% – 15%. Mahato, Pal and Ghosh (2020) found a 53% drop in NO2 and

reductions on 60% and 39% in PM10 and PM2.5, respectively, during the lockdown in

Delhi, India. In addition, Mahato, Pal and Ghosh (2020) found concomitant increases

in ground-level ozone in Delhi, as did Menut et al. (2020) in Western Europe.

     Estimates from U.S. data are more mixed than in other countries. Brodeur, Cook

and Wright (2020) used difference-in-differences methods to determine that stay-at-

home orders reduced levels of PM2.5 by 25% and Bauwens et al. (2020) reported

reductions of NO2 in the northeastern cities of New York, Philadelphia, and

Washington D.C. of 21% - 28% based on satellite readings. Cicala et al. (2020) also

predicted declines in primary air pollutants, but their estimates rely on simulations
                                            5
that extrapolate pollution reductions from measured decreases in traffic and electricity

consumption. In contrast, Bekbulat et al. (2020) did not find that PM2.5 and ozone

concentrations in the U.S. generally fall outside the normal range of statistical

variability. Zangari et al. (2020) likewise reported no significant differences in PM2.5

and NO2 in New York City (NYC), when using a linear time series model to compare

pollutant levels following the NYC shutdown to the same weeks in 2015 - 2019. One

consideration in the interpretation of estimates by Bekbulat at al. (2020) is that they

analyzed data from across the U.S., where restrictions and compliance with federal

directives was very heterogeneous.

     Finally, Dang and Trinh (2020) compiled data from 178 different countries and

confirmed the results from most individual country or city studies that lockdowns

decreased air pollution. They also found that decreases in mobility following the

lockdowns likely contributed to lower air pollution levels.



3. Data

   We compiled data from several administrative sources in order to conduct our

analysis. We collected data on confirmed cases of COVID-19 from the Taiwan Center

of the Disease Control (CDC); several air quality measures from the Environmental

Protection Agency (EPA); metro usage from the Taipei Rapid Transit Corporation;

and car traffic data from the Ministry of Communication.

3.1. COVID-19 case counts

   The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Taiwan was identified in Taipei City on

January 22, 2020. We compiled the number of the confirmed cases of COVID-19

registered in both Taipei and New Taipei City during each day between January 22,

2020 and March 31, 2020. Confirmed cases are those that have been validated by

medical testing, whereas unconfirmed cases are suspected by physicians to be
                                            6
COVID-19 based on patient-reported symptoms. We use the former because

confirmed cases are listed on the CDC website and reported to the public during CDC

press conferences. From these data we created two variables to measure COVID-19

cases. The first is a binary indicator for the period when confirmed COVID-19 cases

existed in Taiwan (=1 if January 22 - March 31 of 2020; =0 otherwise), while the

second is a continuous measure of the cumulative number of the confirmed cases in

each day of the sample period in each of the two cities.

   For the analysis of all outcome variables we defined treatment and control

periods. The treatment period corresponds to January 22 - March 31 of 2020 and the

control period includes these same dates in 2017, 2018 and 2019.

3.2. Air quality measures

   We obtained measures of air quality from 19 air quality monitoring stations

located across Taipei and New Taipei City. The stations monitor twelve different

pollutants, including particle levels, carbon oxides, nitrogen oxides, sodium dioxide,

ground-level ozone, and hydrocarbons. We analyzed the same pollutants regulated

under the U.S. Clean Air Act, with the exception of lead, which is not monitored.

These include PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2, CO, and O3. The level of each pollutant is

calculated as the average concentration at the given station over a 24-hour period. We

merged the COVID-19 variables into the air quality dataset using city and date. In

total, the air quality data consist of 5,119 station-day observations across both the

treatment and control periods, of which 1,330 occurred during the treatment period.

3.3. Metro usage

   The Taipei metro system includes 119 stations that serve all sections of Taipei and

New Taipei City. We excluded 11 stations from our analysis because they opened on

January 31, 2020, in the beginning to our treatment period. For each of the remaining

108 stations, we collected data on the number of people who departed from and exited
                                            7
the station on every day during our treatment and control periods. In total, our sample

of metro ridership contains 29,808 station-day observations, of which 7,452 occurred

during the treatment period.

    From the same metro database we created several indicator variables to measure

characteristics of the stations and their surroundings. These include variables that

indicate whether the station is a terminal station, connected to other metro lines, on an

airport route or at an airport, connected to a high speed rail station, and whether a

school or a traditional night market is near the station.

3.4. Car traffic

    There are 35 traffic monitoring stations along the main bridges that connect Taipei

and New Taipei City. Since many people live in New Taipei City and work in Taipei,

the monitors effectively capture commuting patterns by car. We collected information

on the number of cars that pass each traffic monitor during every four hours of the

treatment and control periods. In total, our sample contains 59,785 station-4-hour

period observations, of which 15,368 are in the treatment period.

3.5. Other variables

    We collected additional data on two district-level characteristics that may explain

variation in the outcome variables: the geographic area of each district and monthly

population. 7 For inclusion in our car traffic analysis we also collected information on

the daily gasoline price, and for the air pollution models we collected data on the

amount of coal used in power generation in metric tons per day. 8 Descriptive

statistics for all explanatory variables are listed in Appendix Table A1.

4. Econometric Analysis

      We use a generalization of the difference-in-differences model (DiD) to identify

the causal effect of confirmed COVID-19 cases on air quality and metro departures

using panel data (Wooldridge, 2010). Because both outcome variables are right-

skewed, we implemented the following log-linear specification:

(1) 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙�𝑦𝑦1𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 � = 𝛼𝛼1 + 𝛾𝛾1 ⋅ 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 + 𝛽𝛽1 ′ 𝑋𝑋1𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜐𝜐𝑗𝑗 + 𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚 + 𝑡𝑡𝑦𝑦 + 𝜀𝜀1𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ,

where 𝑦𝑦1𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the outcome variable for station 𝑖𝑖 in city 𝑗𝑗 during time 𝑡𝑡. Station is

either air monitoring station or metro station, and time is day. 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 is either our

discrete or continuous measure of confirmed COVID-19 cases in city 𝑗𝑗 at time 𝑡𝑡.

𝑋𝑋1𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a vector of the explanatory variables associated with the outcome variable,

𝜐𝜐𝑗𝑗 , 𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚 , and 𝑡𝑡𝑦𝑦 are fixed effects for city, month and year, and 𝜀𝜀1𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the random

error term.

        In the case of car traffic, all of the traffic monitoring stations are located on

bridges that connect Taipei and New Taipei City, which means that there is no city-

level variation in the dependent variable. In addition, the outcome variable has some

zero values, so we estimated the following linear model with time fixed effects:

(2)                  𝑦𝑦2𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼2 + 𝛾𝛾2 ⋅ 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡 + 𝛽𝛽2 ′ 𝑋𝑋2𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚 + 𝑡𝑡𝑦𝑦 + 𝜀𝜀2𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 .

In equation (2) the time index denotes the 4-hour period used to collect car traffic

data.

      In equation (1), 100 times the parameter 𝛾𝛾1 is a semi-elasticity that measures the

effect of COVID-19 on the outcome variable in percentage terms. The semi-elasticity

is identified by comparing differences in the outcome variable between the two cities

across the same month in the treatment and control periods. In equation (2), 𝛾𝛾2

measures the association between COVID-19 and 100s of cars per 4 hours travelling

between Taipei and New Taipei City. In this case, the parameter is identified by

comparing car travel during the COVID-19 period to car travel in the pre-COVID-19
                                                             9
period during the same calendar month. We computed the standard errors in all

models using the two-way-cluster-robust variance approach proposed by Cameron

and Miller (2015) to cluster on both station and day.



5. Results

      In Table 1 we compare the mean values of all of the outcome variables in the air

quality, metro usage and car traffic models in the COVID-19 treatment period (2020)

and pre-COVID-19 control period (2017-2019). The average level of car traffic was

27% higher in the former than the latter. In addition, metro usage decreased 18% in

2020 relative to the pre-COVID-19 period, suggesting a shift in transportation

preferences from public transport to personal car transport during the COVID-19

period. Despite the shift towards car travel, all six pollution measures decreased

between 2% and 26% from 2017-2019 to 2020. These unadjusted means, however,

could reflect long run decreases in air pollution over time (Cheng and Hsu, 2019).

5.1. COVID-19 and air quality

      We present semi-elasticity estimates from the generalized DiD model of air

quality in Table 2, and full estimation results for the SO2 equation in Appendix Table

A2. 9 The estimates in the left columns measure the change in air pollution during the

COVID-19 period relative to the pre-COVID-19 period, while the estimates in the

right columns measure the effect of an additional cumulative confirmed case of

COVID-19 on air pollution. Consistent with the unadjusted means, CO and O3 both

decreased as a result of COVID-19, but SO2, NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 all increased

during the COVID-19 period. Furthermore, the 5% - 12% increase among the latter

pollutants was larger in magnitude than the 3% increase in CO and O3. Estimates

from the models using the number of the cumulative COVID-19 cases are consistent

with the treatment effect models, although the impact of an additional case of

COVID-19 is not statistically significant in the CO model. While O3 decreased by 1%

with an additional COVID-19 case, SO2, NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 increased by 1.6%,

1.1%, 3.4% and 3.5%, respectively.

5.2. Car traffic and metro use under COVID-19

    The DiD estimates of the effect of COVID-19 on air pollution are more consistent

with the shift in transportation patterns identified in Table 1 than the unadjusted

differences in pollutants. In order to further explore changes in transportation as a

mechanism for the increase in air pollution, we turn to the car traffic model (Table 3).

The estimates in Panel A confirm that car traffic increased 34% in the COVID-19

period relative to the same calendar month in the pre-COVID-19 period, after

controlling for date variables, hour of travel, weekend day, and the price of gasoline

(see Appendix Table A3 for all coefficient estimates). Likewise, an additional

cumulative case of COVID-19 was associated with a 0.7% increase in car traffic,

ceteris paribus.

    In Panel B we present estimates from a model estimated on just weekend (i.e. non-

working) days, while Panels C and D contain analogous estimates for week (i.e.

working) days, divided into typical commuting and non-commuting hours. We specify

commuting hours as 6 – 10AM in the morning and 6 – 10PM in the evening.

Interestingly, there is no statistically significant increase in car traffic during

weekends in the COVID-19 period (the point estimate is negative), but a large

increase in car traffic during week days. In the treatment effect model the magnitude

of the increase during commuting hours (70%) is only marginally larger than the rest

of the day (65%). The models with a continuous measure of COVID-19 cases are

precisely estimated in Panels C and D, and they suggest that an additional case of
                                             11
COVID-19 is associated with a 0.7% - 0.8% increase in car traffic. While the

difference between the effect of COVID-19 in commuting and non-commuting hours

is less than anticipated, this may be due to policies by employers that rotate

employees across different shifts to achieve physical distancing.

     In the case of metro departures and exits, we are able to estimate the generalized

DiD model in equation (1). Panel A of Table 4 contains estimates for the full sample,

while in Panels B and C we break the sample into week days and weekend days,

respectively (Table A4 contains all coefficient estimates). Overall, metro use

decreased 6.5% during the COVID-19 period, or 0.3% per additional confirmed case.

While ridership was lower during both week days and weekends, the magnitude of the

effect was larger for the latter. In particular, metro use was 13.8% lower on weekends

due to COVID-19 and 3.6% lower during the work week. The analogous estimates for

cumulative case counts are a 0.5% reduction in metro station departures and exits per

case during weekends and a 0.2% decrease in departures and exits per case on week

days.

5.3. COVID-19 and air quality by day of the week

     Given that automobile use in the COVID-19 period only increased during week

days, in order for car traffic to be one of the drivers of higher levels of NO2, PM10 and

PM2.5, measures of these pollutants should also be higher during the work week. 10

We investigated this possibility by estimating our air pollution models separately on

the samples of week days and weekends. The estimates in Table 5 for week days

(Panel A) are all consistent in sign with those from the pooled sample in Table 2, but

they are generally larger in magnitude. For example, COVID-19 leads to a 5%

   Since vehicles also emit CO, the observed decrease in CO must be due to another reason. Likewise,
vehicle emissions are no longer a major source of SO2 (Australia Department of Agriculture, Water and
the Environment, 2020).

increase in NO2 in the pooled sample, but a 12% increase on week days. However,

there is no statistically significant change in most of the pollutants during weekends,

with the exception of SO2 and NO2 for which there is a statistically significant

decrease. Levels of SO2 drop by 7% from COVID-19 during weekends, and NO2

drops by 11%.

5.4. Robustness checks

    One concern with our main analysis is that trends in air quality could be

spuriously correlated with trends in the number of COVID-19 cases in our models.

Although we included both month and year fixed effects to capture aggregate-level

trends, we want to verify that the steady, long-term improvement in air quality is not

spuriously correlated with the increase in cases of COVID-19, net of these controls. If

such a correlation exists, it could increase the magnitude of the (negative) semi-

elasticities for CO and O3 or attenuate the (positive) semi-elasticity estimates for the

other air quality measures. We investigated the potential for a spurious correlation by

estimating our DiD models of air pollution using only the pre-COVID-19 period data

from 2017-2019 by assigning the number of COVID-19 cases observed in 2020 to the

same month and day in the 2017-2019 sample. The resulting semi-elasticity estimates,

reported in Table 6, are statistically insignificant when using either measure of

COVID-19, with the exception of the treatment effect in the NO2 model, which is

statistically significant at the 10% level.

     While the presence of COVID-19 is an exogenous event that we don’t expect to

be simultaneously determined with air quality, there could be omitted variables that

are correlated with the number of COVID-19 cases and the level of the air quality

measures. For example, it is possible that unobserved differences in COVID-19

prevention behaviors across communities may result in different levels of air

pollution. Such unobservables would need to vary over both time and place to bias
                                              13
our estimates since time-invariant factors across the two cities, and changes in

aggregate trends over time that are common to both cities should be captured by city

and time fixed effects.

   In order to investigate the potential for omitted variables to bias our estimates we

implemented the sensitivity analysis proposed by Oster (2019). Based on the

assumption that selection on unobservable factors is proportional to selection on

observable covariates, Oster (2019) derives an estimator, δ, for the degree of selection

of unobservables relative to observables necessary to drive the coefficient on the

treatment variable to a statistical null. We report estimates of δ in Table 7, which

range from 1.6 – 8.9 for the COVID-19 treatment effect and from 1.3 – 6.9 for the

cumulative number of confirmed cases. Across all models, the average level of δ is

3.6, suggesting a significant level of selection on unobservables would be needed to

invalidate our results.



6. Discussion and Conclusions

   We find that measures of four major pollutants (SO2, NO2, PM10 and PM2.5)

increased and two major pollutants (CO and O3) decreased in the two largest cities in

Taiwan as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The magnitude of the increase in

pollution among the former measures was, on average, roughly three times larger than

the decrease in pollution among the latter measures. Studies of the effect of COVID-

19 in China (Xu et al., 2020; Fan et al., 2020; Shi and Brasseur, 2020), Milan, Italy

(Collivignarelli et al., 2020) and Delhi, India (Mahato, Pal and Ghosh, 2020) have

also found increases in NO2 and other pollutants with concomitant reductions in O3

(Xu et al., 2020; Fan et al., 2020; Shi and Brasseur, 2020). Ground-level ozone can be

diminished by nitrogen oxides, so it is not uncommon to measure decreases in O3

when levels of NO2 rise (Jhun et al., 2015; Shi and Brasseur, 2020).
                                            14
      By examining data on transportation patterns, we find compelling evidence that a

shift from metro use to car ridership contributed to higher levels of NO2, PM10 and

PM2.5. Not only does car traffic increase with these pollution measures, but both the

increase in traffic and levels of NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 only occurred during the work

week. Because automobiles are no longer a significant source of sulfur oxides, the

increase in SO2 due to COVID-19 must have a different mechanism. In addition, it is

unclear why measures of CO decrease when car traffic increases. While the increase

in CO is relatively small, and only precisely estimated in the treatment effect model,

automobiles are a major source of CO pollution (Zhang and Batterman, 2013).11

      Given that the level of automobile use and reduction in metro ridership increased

with the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases, it is likely that the shift in mode of

transport was a strategy used by individuals to reduce their chances of contracting

COVID-19. Clearly, the likelihood of infection is far lower in a personal automobile

than the confined space of a metro car. Furthermore, the decrease in both metro use

and levels of SO2 and NO2 during weekends suggest that individuals were limiting

their mobility on weekends to avoid contracting COVID-19.

      Our findings have important implications for policy. Existing studies from China,

Europe and elsewhere almost exclusively show that air pollution improved under

government-mandated lockdowns. While Taiwan restricted international travel from

countries with high rates of infection, the promotion of social distancing and

mandatory use of masks were the only domestic policies imposed by the government

to limit the spread of the virus. As a result, the mobility of citizens within Taiwan was

relatively unaffected during the initial month of the coronavirus pandemic (Wang, Ng

11
   One possibility is that there are other shifts in transportation patterns that we do not observe. For
example, scooters and motorcycles emit more CO than cars (Platt et al., 2014; Carpenter, 2014). If
scooters are complementary to public transportation, then reductions in metro and scooter use could
have resulted and a shift in pollution that reduced CO. To the best of our knowledge, there are no
sources of administrative traffic data on scooters in Taiwan.
                                                       15
and Brook, 2020).

     Without the stricter lockdowns imposed in other parts of the world, we find that

pollution in Taiwan worsened due to COVID-19 prevention behaviors. In particular,

the fear of contracting COVID-19 while using public transportation appears to have

resulted in a significant increase in car traffic and associated air pollution. As other

regions or countries emerge from lockdowns, they should expect individuals to

exhibit similar preferences for personal automobile use, which could lead to

congestion and higher levels of pollution. Initiatives to improve the safety of public

transportation could help avoid the shift that we observe in Taiwan. Furthermore,

research suggests that individuals de-prioritize environmental protection following

periods of high unemployment (Kenny, 2019). Our findings suggests that scaling back

air pollution regulations due to a perceived tradeoff between environmental protection

and economic growth could compound the deterioration in air quality.

     In addition to having a direct negative impact on human health, higher levels of

air pollution also increase COVID-19 mortality (Persico and Johnson, 2020;

Isphording and Pestel, 2020). Our results imply that loosening mobility restrictions in

countries with high COVID-19 infection rates, such as the U.S., could make it more

difficult to reduce deaths from COVID-19 (all else equal) if individuals practice

similar prevention behaviors to those we identify in Taiwan.

     This study has several limitations that should be noted. Although we conducted

several robustness checks that are consistent with a lack of endogeneity bias in our

estimates, it is possible that there are omitted factors that are correlated with the

number of COVID-19 cases and air pollution levels that could affect our results. In

addition, we do not measure pollution from all sources, so we cannot identify

mechanisms that could be responsible for increases in air pollution other than a shift

from metro to automobile use. Finally, our results may not generalize to other regions
                                            16
or countries if COVID-19 prevention behaviors in Taiwan differ from those exhibited

elsewhere.

     Despite these limitations, we believe this study makes an important contribution

to the literature, as the first to find higher levels of several major air pollutants due to

COVID-19. Moreover, our results may help policy makers in countries emerging from

lockdowns to avoid spikes in air pollution by identifying a shift in preferred modes of

transport with important implications for pollution levels, congestion and energy use.
