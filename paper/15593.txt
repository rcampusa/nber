Measuring the Gains from Trade under Monopolistic Competition

                                              ABSTRACT

Three sources of gains from trade under monopolistic competition are: (i) new import varieties available
to consumers; (ii) enhanced efficiency as more productive firms begin exporting and less productive
firms exit; (iii) reduced markups charged by firms due to import competition. The first source of gains
can be measured as new goods in a CES utility function for consumers. We argue that the second source
is formally analogous to the producer gain from new goods, with a constant-elasticity transformation
curve for the economy. We suggest that the third source of gain can be measured using a translog expenditure
function for consumers, which in contrast to the CES case, allows for finite reservation prices for new
goods and endogenous markups.

1. Introduction

        One of the great achievements of international trade theory in the last three decades is the

incorporation of the monopolistic competition model. The need to include increasing returns to

scale in trade theory was recognized as early as Graham (1923; see also Ethier 1982), and in the

Canadian context, by Eastman and Stykolt (1967) and Melvin (1969). Still, it was not until the

formalization of the monopolistic competition model by Dixit and Stiglitz (1977), in parallel

with Spence (1976) and Lancaster (1979), that a set of global equilibrium conditions that avoided

the problems of large firms and multiple equilibria could be developed. That set of equilibrium

conditions was first written down by Krugman (1979, 1980, 1981).1

        There is no doubt that these developments have had important policy implications. For

example, the simulation results of Harris (1984a,b) demonstrated large gains to Canada from free

trade with the U.S., and were very influential in convincing policy makers to proceed with the

Canada-U.S. free trade agreement in 1989; that agreement in turn paved the way for the North

American free trade agreement in 1994. Subsequent empirical work for Canada by Trefler

(2004), as well as Head and Ries (1999, 2001), confirmed the efficiency gains for Canada due to

opening trade, though not in the manner predicted by Krugman’s work. But a comprehensive

empirical assessment of the gains from trade under monopolistic competition has not yet been

made. The goal of this paper is to describe how these gains can be measured, using methods that

draw heavily on duality theory from Diewert (1974, 1976).

        The monopolistic competition model predicts three sources of gains from trade that are

not present in traditional models. First, there are the consumer gains from having access to new

import varieties of differentiated products. Those gains have recently been measured for the

United States by Broda and Weinstein (2006), using the methods from Feenstra (1994), as

described in section 2. Their approach assumes a constant elasticity of substitution (CES) utility

function for consumers, in which case the import varieties are analogous to “new goods” in the

utility function. We show that the gains from trade depend on the import share and the elasticity

of substitution.

          The extension of the monopolistic competition model to allow for heterogeneous firms,

due to Melitz (2003), leads to a second source of gains from the self-selection of more efficient

firms into export markets. This activity drives out less efficient firms and therefore raises overall

productivity. This self-selection of firms was demonstrated for Canada by Trefler (2004)

following the free trade agreement with the U.S. We argue that this self-selection can still be

interpreted as a gain from product variety, but now on the export side of the economy rather than

for imports. Surprisingly, the consumer gains from new import varieties do not appear in this

case, because they cancel out with disappearing domestic varieties. This finding, demonstrated in

section 3, helps to explain the theoretical results of Arkolakis et al (2008a), where the gains from

trade depend on the import share but are otherwise independent of the elasticity of substitution in

consumption.2 Rather, the gains come from the production side of the economy, where the self-

selection of firms leads to a constant-elasticity transformation curve between domestic and

export varieties, with an elasticity depending on the Pareto parameter of productivity draws.

          Third, the monopolistic competition model also allows for gains from a reduction in firm

markups due to import competition. This third source of gains was stressed in Krugman (1979),

but has been absent from much of the later literature due to the assumption of CES preferences,

leading to constant markups. In section 4, I introduce the translog expenditure function into the

monopolistic competition model, and summarize current research in Bergin and Feenstra (2009)
2
    These results have been generalized in Arkolakis, Arnaud and Rodríguez-Clare (2009).

and Feenstra and Weinstein (2009). I argue that the translog unit-expenditure function is

tractable even as the number of product varieties is changing, as with monopolistic competition.

It can be expected to lead to estimable formulas for the gains from product variety and the effect

of imports on reducing markups. Conclusions are given in section 5.


2. Consumer Benefits from Import Variety

         We start with the consumer gains from import variety. From a technical point of view,

measuring the benefits of new import varieties is equivalent to the so-called “new goods”

problem in index number theory. That has always been a favorite problem of Erwin Diewert’s,

and arises because the price for a product before it is available is not observed, so we don’t know

what price to enter in an index number formula. The answer given many years ago by Hicks

(1940) was that the relevant price of a product before it is available is the “reservation price” for

consumers, namely, a price so high that demand is zero. Once the product appears on the market

then it has a lower price, determined by supply and demand. The fall in the price from its

“reservation” level to the actual price can be used in an index number formula to obtain the

consumer gains from the appearance of that new good.

         For the constant elasticity of substitution (CES) utility function, we immediately run into

a problem with implementing this suggestion because the reservation price for any good is

infinite: the demand curve approaches the vertical axis as the price approaches infinity.3 But

provided that the elasticity of substitution is greater than unity, then the area under the demand

curve is bounded above, as shown in Figure 1, where the ratio of areas A/B = 1/(σ – 1) is easily

calculated for a demand curve with elasticity σ. The second problem we run into is how to

express these consumer gains when there is not just one but many new goods available.
3
  Feenstra (2006) shows that an infinite reservation price leads to a well-behaved limit for the “quadratic mean of
order r” index number formula of Diewert (1976), providing an alternative proof of Theorem 1 below.

CES Utility Function

        To address this problem, we will work with the non-symmetric CES function,

                                                                                  σ /( σ −1)
                                                    ⎡                       ⎤
                             U t = U (q t , I t ) = ⎢ ∑ a it q (itσ −1) / σ ⎥                  , σ > 1,                       (1)
                                                    ⎢⎣i∈I t                 ⎥⎦

where ait > 0 are tastes parameters that can change over time, and It denotes the set of goods

available in period t at the prices pit. The minimum expenditure to obtain one unit of utility is,

                                                                              1 /(1− σ )
                                                          ⎡                ⎤
                                         e( p t , I t ) = ⎢ ∑ b it p1it− σ ⎥               , σ > 1, b it ≡ a itσ .            (2)
                                                          ⎢⎣i∈I t          ⎥⎦

For simplicity, first consider the case where It-1 = It = I, so there is no change in the set of goods,

and also bit-1 = bit, so there is no change in tastes. We assume that the observed purchases qit are

optimal for the prices and utility, that is, q it = U t (∂e / ∂p it ) . Then the index number due to Sato

(1976) and Vartia (1976) shows us how to measure the ratio of unit-expenditures:


Theorem 1 (Sato, 1976; Vartia, 1976)

If the set of goods available is fixed at It-1 = It = I, taste parameters are constant, bit-1 = bit, and

observed quantitites are optimal, then:

                                                                                                 w i (I)
                  e( p t , I )                                                    ⎛ p ⎞
                                  = PSV ( p t −1 , p t , q t −1 , q t , I ) ≡ ∏ ⎜⎜ it ⎟⎟                   ,                  (3)
                 e ( p t −1 , I )                                             i∈I ⎝ p it −1 ⎠


where the weights wi(I) are constructed from the expenditure shares sit(I) ≡ p it q it                               ∑i∈I pit q it   as,


                              ⎛ s it ( I ) – s it −1 ( I ) ⎞              ⎛     s ( I) – s          ( I) ⎞
                 w i ( I ) ≡ ⎜⎜                                  ⎟⎟   ∑ ⎜⎜ ln s it ( I) – lnit s−1            ⎟⎟ .            (4)
                              ⎝ ln s it ( I ) – ln s it −1 ( I ) ⎠    i∈I ⎝      it               it −1 ( I ) ⎠
                                                                  5


        The numerator in (4) is the “logarithmic mean” of the shares s it ( I ) and s it −1 ( I ) , and lies

in-between these two shares, while the denominator ensures that the weights w i ( I ) sum to unity.

The special formula for these weights in (4) is needed to precisely measure the ratio of unit-

expenditures in (3), but in practice the Sato-Vartia formula will give very similar results to using

other weights, such as w i ( I ) = 12 [sit ( I ) + s it −1 ( I )] , as used for the Törnqvist price index. In both

cases, the geometric mean formula in (3) applies. The important point from Theorem 1 is that

goods with high taste parameters ai will also tend to have high weights, so even without knowing

the true values of ai, the exact ratio of unit-expenditures is obtained.

        Now consider the case where the set of goods is changing over time, but some of the

goods are available in both periods, so that I t −1 ∩ I t ≠ ∅ . We again let e(p,I) denote the unit-

expenditure function defined over the goods within the set I, which is a non-empty subset of

those goods available both periods, I ⊆ I t −1 ∩ I t ≠ ∅ . We sometimes refer to the set I as the

“common set of goods.” Then the ratio e( p t , I ) / e( p t −1 , I ) is still measured by the Sato-Vartia

index in the above theorem. Our interest is in the ratio e( p t , I t ) / e( p t −1 , I t −1 ) , which can be

measured as follows:


Theorem 2 (Feenstra, 1994)

Assume that bit-1 = bit for i ∈ I ⊆ I t −1 ∩ I t ≠ ∅ , and that the observed quantities are optimal.

Then for σ > 1:
                                                                                                       1 /( σ −1)
                             e( p t , I t )                                               ⎛ λ (I) ⎞
                                                = PSV ( p t −1 , p t , q t −1 , q t , I )⎜⎜ t         ⎟⎟            ,            (5)
                           e( p t −1 , I t −1 )                                            λ
                                                                                          ⎝ t −1 ⎠
                                                                                                ( I )

where the weights wi(I) are constructed from the expenditure shares sit(I) ≡ p it q it                                  ∑i∈I pit q it   as

in (4), and the values λt(I) and λt-1(I) are constructed as:
                                                        6



                           ⎛                 ⎞      ⎛                         ⎞
                           ⎜ ∑ i∈I p iτ q iτ ⎟      ⎜ ∑ i∈I τ , i∉I p iτ q iτ ⎟
                λ τ ( I) = ⎜                 ⎟ = 1− ⎜                         ⎟ , τ = t-1,t.   (6)
                           ⎜ ∑ i∈I p iτ q iτ ⎟      ⎜ ∑ i∈I p iτ q iτ ⎟
                           ⎝      τ          ⎠      ⎝          τ              ⎠



       Each of the terms λτ(I) < 1 can be interpreted as the period τ expenditure on the good in

the common set I, relative to the period τ total expenditure. Alternatively, this can be interpreted

as one minus the period τ expenditure on “new” goods (not in the set I), relative to the period τ

total expenditure. When there is a greater number of new goods in period t, this will tend to

lower the value of λt(I), which leads to a greater fall in the ratio of unit costs in (5), by an amount

that depends on the elasticity of substitution.

       The importance of the elasticity of substitution can be seen from Figure 2, where we

suppose that the consumer minimizes the expenditure needed to obtain utility along the

indifference curve AD. If initially only good 1 is available, then the consumer chooses point A

with the budget line AB. When good 2 becomes available, the same level of utility can be

obtained with consumption at point C. Then the drop in the cost of living is measured by the

inward movement of the budget line from AB to the line through C, and this shift depends on the

convexity of the indifference curve, or the elasticity of substitution.


Krugman (1980) Model

       Turning to the international trade application, we will suppose that the utility function in

(1) applies to the purchases of a good from various source countries i ∈ I t . That is, the elasticity

of substitution we are interested in is the Armington (1969) elasticity between the source

countries for imports. We refer to the source countries as providing varieties of the differentiated
                                                         7

good, so the gains being measured in (5) are the gains from import variety. In this case, we can

compare the formula in (5) with the gain from trade obtained in the model of Krugman (1980), as

analyzed by Arkolakis et al (2008a).

         In particular, suppose there are any number of countries, where the representative

consumer in each has a CES utility function with elasticity σ > 1. Labor is the only factor of

production and there is a single monopolistically competitive sector, with no other goods.4 Firms

face a fixed cost of f to manufacture any good, and an iceberg transport cost to sell it abroad, but

no other fixed cost for exports. Then it is well known that with profit-maximization

and zero profits through free entry, the output of each firm is fixed at the amount:5

                                             q = ( σ − 1)fϕ ,                                               (7)

where ϕ is the productivity of the firm, i.e. the number of units of output per unit of labor. With

the population of L, the full-employment condition is then:

                                    L = N[(q / ϕ) + f ] = Nσf ,                                             (8)

which determines the number of product varieties produced in equilibrium as N = L / σf . This

condition holds under autarky or trade, so opening a country to trade has no impact on the

number of varieties produced within a country.

         The gains from opening trade can be measured by the ratio of real wages under free trade

and autarky. With labor as the only factor of production we can normalize wages at unity, so the

gains from trade are simply measured by the drop in the cost of living, which is the inverse of

(5). The “common” set of goods are those domestic varieties that are available both in autarky

and under trade. Then the Sato-Vartia index PSV is just the change in the price of the domestic

obtain a “home market” effect; see Krugman (1980).

   See Arkolakis et al (2008a, p. 3).

varieties, and with constant markups that is the change in home wages, which we have

normalized to unity. So the gains from trade are measured by (λ t / λ t −1 ) −1 /( σ −1) in (5). The

denominator of that ratio reflects the disappearance of domestic varieties, i.e. those varieties

available in period t-1 but not in period t. As we have shown above, there are no disappearing

domestic varieties in this model, so λt-1 = 1. The numerator λt measures the expenditure on the

domestic varieties relative to total expenditure with trade, or one minus the import share. The

gains from trade are therefore λ−t 1 /( σ −1) , which is precisely the formula obtained by Arkolakis et

al (2008b). While this formula is not too surprising, it will take on greater significance when we

compare it to the results from the Melitz (2003) model, in the next section.

          Broda and Weinstein (2006) measure these gains from trade for the U.S. They define a

good as a 10-digit Harmonized System (HS) category, or before 1989, as a 7-digit Tariff

Schedule of the United States (TSUSA) category. The imports from various source countries are

the varieties available for each good. The ratio (λ t / λ t −1 ) is constructed for each good, using the

expenditure on new and disappearing source countries. In addition, they estimate σ for each

good, using the GMM method from Feenstra (1994), which exploits heteroskedasticity across

countries to identify this elasticity. Putting these together, they measure (λ t / λ t −1 ) −1 /( σ −1) for

30,000 goods available in the HS and TSUSA data. For the TSUSA data they used 1972 as the

base year and measured the gains from new supply countries up to 1988, and then for the HS

data they used 1990 as the base year and measured the gains from new supplying countries up to

2001.6 Aggregating over goods, they obtain an estimate of the gains from trade for the US due to

the expansion of import varieties, which amount to 2.6% of GDP in 2001.

          Two features of Broda and Weinstein’s methods deserve special mention. First, by

measuring the expenditure on new supplying countries relative to a base year, they are following

the hypothesis of Theorem 2 that the “common” set of countries should be those with constant

taste parameters. In contrast, when countries first start exporting goods, it is reasonable to expect

that the demand curve in the importing country shifts out over some number of years, as

consumers become informed about the product. Broda and Weinstein are allowing for such shifts

for new and disappearing countries after the base year, and all such changes in demand for these

countries are incorporated into the λτ terms in Theorem 2. That is the correct way to measure the

gains from new import varieties.7

          Second, Broda and Weinstein (2006) did not incorporate any changes in the number of

U.S. varieties into their estimation, nor include the U.S. as a source country in the estimation of

the elasticity of substitution for each good. That is the correct approach only under the limited

case where the number of U.S. varieties is constant. While that is true under our assumptions in

the model of Krugman (1980), it is certainly not the case in more general models: we could

expect that increases in import variety would result in some reduction in domestic varieties. In

that case, the gains from import varieties would be offset by the welfare loss from reduced

domestic varieties. That potential loss was not addressed by Broda and Weinstein (2006), and we

shall begin to address it in the remainder of the paper.


3. Producer Benefits from Output Variety

          While we have so far restricted out attention to σ > 1 in the utility and expenditure

functions (1) and (2), a wider range of values for this elasticity can be considered. In particular, if


7
    In addition, countries that are suspected of selling a changing range of product varieties within each HS good
should be excluded from the set I, and instead included in the λτ terms.
                                                                     10


σ < 0 then instead of obtaining convex indifference curves from (1) for a fixed level of Ut, we

obtain a concave transformation curve as shown in Figure 3.8 The parameter Ut in this case

measures the resources devoted to production of the goods q it , i ∈ I t , and the elasticity of the

transformation curve (measured as a positive number) equals − σ . This reinterpretation of (1)

comes from Diewert (1976), who uses the general term “aggregator function” to refer to utility

functions, production function, or transformation functions for an economy.

         To make this reinterpretation explicit, when σ < 0 we will denote its positive value by

ω ≡ − σ , which is the elasticity of transformation. Then we will rewrite (1) using labor resources

Lt to replace utility Ut, obtaining:

                                                                 ω /( ω +1)
                                  ⎛                       ⎞
                            L t = ⎜ ∑ a it q (itω +1) / ω ⎟                   , a it > 0, ω > 0.                              (9)
                                  ⎜ i∈I                   ⎟
                                  ⎝ t                     ⎠

The maximum revenue obtained using one unit of labor resources, dual to (9), is then:

                                                                   1 /( ω +1)
                                             ⎡                 ⎤
                            e( p t , I t ) = ⎢ ∑ b it p itω +1 ⎥                ,         b it ≡ a it− ω , ω > 0.             (10)
                                             ⎢⎣i∈I t           ⎥⎦

With this reinterpretation, Theorem 2 continues to hold as:

                                                                                                            −1 /( ω +1)
                           e( p t , I t )                                               ⎛ λ ( I) ⎞
                                              = PSV ( p t −1 , p t , q t −1 , q t , I )⎜⎜ t            ⎟⎟                 ,   (11)
                        e ( p t −1 , I t −1 )                                           ⎝ λ t −1 ( I ) ⎠

where the exponent appearing on (λt/λt-1) is now negative. In other words, the appearance of

“new outputs,” so that λt < 1, will raise revenue on the producer side of the economy.

         To understand where this increase in revenue is coming from, consider the transformation


8
  Notice that the range 0 ≤ σ ≤1 cannot be considered, since then all goods are essential in (1), with a zero quantity
for any single good resulting in zero for the entire CES aggregate. In that case the welfare gain from a new good is
infinite.

curve in Figure 3. If only good 1 is available, then the economy would be producing at the

corner A, with revenue shown by the line AB. Then if good 2 becomes available to producers,

the new equilibrium will be at point C, with an increase in revenue. This illustrates the benefits

of output variety. In Figure 4 we illustrate the same idea in a partial equilibrium diagram, for a

supply curve with constant elasticity ω. When the good becomes available for production, there

is an effective price increase from the reservation price for producers (which is zero with a

constant-elasticity supply curve) to the actual price. The gain in producer surplus is area C, and

measured relative to total sales C+D, we can readily compute that C/(C+D) = 1/(ω+1).

       While this reinterpretation of our earlier consumer model is mathematically valid, there is

a problem in its application to international trade: the transformation curve between two outputs

is often taken to be linear rather than strictly concave. That is the case in the Ricardian model,

for example, or in the transformation curve (8) in Krugman’s (1980) model. In that case, the

gains from output variety vanish. So the question arises as to whether the strictly concave case

we illustrate in Figure 3 has any practical application?

       We will now argue that the case of a strictly concave transformation curve is indeed

relevant, and in fact, arises in the generalization of the monopolistic competition model due to

Melitz (2003). Melitz assumes that labor is the only factor of production, but he allows firms to

differ in their productivities ϕ . In the equilibrium with zero expected profits, only firms above

some cutoff productivity ϕ * survive; and of these, only firms with productivities above

ϕ*x > ϕ * actually export. We will argue that the endogenous determination of these cutoff

productivities leads to a strictly concave constant-elasticity transformation curve between

domestic and export varieties, adjusted for the quantity produced of each.

Melitz (2003) model

       We outline here a two country version of the Melitz (2003) model that does not assume

symmetry across the countries. We focus on the home country H, while denoting foreign

variables with the superscript F. At home there is a mass of M firms operating in equilibrium.

Each period, a fraction δ of these firms go bankrupt and are replaced by new entrants. Each new

entrant pays a fixed cost of fe to receive a draw ϕ of productivity from a cumulative distribution

G(ϕ), which gives rise to the marginal cost of w / ϕ , where w is the wage and labor is the only

factor of production. Only those firms with productivity above a cutoff level ϕ * find it

profitable to actually produce (the cutoff level will be determined below). Letting Me denote the

mass of new entrants, then [1 − G (ϕ*)]M e firms successfully produce. In a stationary equilibrium,

these should replace the firms going bankrupt, so that:

                                       [1 − G (ϕ*)]M e = δM .                                 (12)

Conditional on successful entry, the distribution of productivities for home firms is then:

                                       ⎧ g( ϕ)
                                       ⎪⎪ [1 − G (ϕ*)] if ϕ ≥ ϕ * ,
                               μ( ϕ) = ⎨                                                      (13)
                                        ⎪
                                        ⎪⎩ 0         otherwise,

where g(ϕ) = ∂G(ϕ) / ∂ϕ is the density function.

       Home and foreign consumers both have CES preferences that are symmetric over product

varieties. Given home expenditure of wL , the revenue earned by a home firm from selling at

the price p(ϕ) is:
                                                       1− σ
                                          ⎡ p( ϕ ) ⎤
                       r (ϕ) = p(ϕ)q(ϕ) = ⎢ H ⎥               wL ,   σ > 1,                   (14)
                                          ⎢⎣ P ⎥⎦
                                                     13


where q(ϕ) is the quantity sold and P H is the home CES price index. The profit-maximizing

price from selling in the domestic market is the usual constant markup over marginal costs:

                                                 ⎛ σ ⎞w
                                          p(ϕ) = ⎜      ⎟ .                                    (15)
                                                 ⎝ σ − 1⎠ ϕ

Using this, we can calculate variable profits from domestic sales as r (ϕ) − ( w / ϕ)q(ϕ) = r (ϕ) / σ .

The lowest productivity firm that just breaks even in the domestic market there satisfies the zero-

cutoff-profit (ZCP) condition:

                                 r (ϕ*) / σ = wf     ⇒      q(ϕ*) = (σ − 1)fϕ * ,              (16)

where f is the fixed labor cost. Note that this cutoff condition for the marginal firm is identical to

what is obtained in Krugman’s (1980) model, in (7), for all firms.

       While firms with productivities ϕ ≥ ϕ * find it profitable to produce for the domestic

market, only those with higher productivities ϕ ≥ ϕ*x > ϕ * find it profitable to export. A home

exporting firm faces the iceberg transport costs of τ ≥ 1 meaning that τ units must be sent in

order for one unit to arrive in the foreign country. Letting p x (ϕ) and q x (ϕ) denote the price

received and quantity shipped at the factory-gate, the revenue earned by the exporter is:

                                                              1− σ
                                                  ⎡ p ( ϕ) τ ⎤
                        rx (ϕ) = p x (ϕ)q x (ϕ) = ⎢ x F ⎥            w * L *,                  (17)
                                                  ⎢⎣ P       ⎥⎦


where P F is the aggregate CES price in the foreign country, and w*L* is foreign expenditure.

       Again, the optimal export price is a constant markup over marginal costs:

                                                     ⎛ σ ⎞w
                                          p x ( ϕ) = ⎜      ⎟ .                                (18)
                                                     ⎝ σ − 1⎠ ϕ
                                                     14


The variable profits from export sales are therefore rx (ϕ) − ( w / ϕ)q x (ϕ) = rx (ϕ) / σ , so the ZCP

condition for the exporting firm is:

                         rx (ϕ*x ) / σ = wf x ⇒ q x (ϕ*x ) = ( σ − 1)f x ϕ*x ,                      (19)

where fx is the additional fixed labor cost for exporting. Provided that rx (ϕ) / f x < r (ϕ) / f , which

we assume is the case, then the cutoff productivity for the exporting firm will exceed that for the

domestic firm, ϕ*x > ϕ * . Then the mass of exporting firms is computed as:

                                          ∞
                                 Mx ≡ ∫         Mμ(ϕ)dϕ < M .                                       (20)
                                         ϕ *x


        To close the model, we use the full employment condition and also zero expected profits

for any entrant. The labor needed for domestic sales for a firm with productivity ϕ is

[q(ϕ) / ϕ + f ] , and for export sales is [q x (ϕ) / ϕ + f x ] , so the full employment condition is:

                         ∞                                 ∞
        L = M e f e + M ∫ [q (ϕ) / ϕ + f ]μ(ϕ)dϕ + M x ∫ [q x (ϕ) / ϕ + f x ]μ x (ϕ)dϕ ,            (21)
                        ϕ*                                ϕ *x


where the distribution of productivities conditional on exporting is μ x (ϕ) ≡ g(ϕ) /[1 − G (ϕ*x )] if

ϕ ≥ ϕ*x , and zero otherwise. We can rewrite (21) by multiplying by w, and using the fact that

( w / ϕ)q(ϕ) = r (ϕ)( σ − 1) / σ , and likewise for exporters, to obtain:

                                                    ⎡ ∞                    ∞                ⎤
                                           ⎛ σ − 1 ⎞⎢
        wL = w (M e f e + Mf + M x f x ) + ⎜       ⎟ M ∫ r (ϕ)μ(ϕ)dϕ + M x ∫ rx (ϕ)μ x (ϕ)dϕ⎥
                                           ⎝ σ ⎠ ⎢ ϕ*                                       ⎥
                                                    ⎣                     ϕ *x              ⎦
                                          ⎛ σ − 1⎞
          = w (M e f e + Mf + M x f x ) + ⎜       ⎟ wL,
                                          ⎝ σ ⎠

where the second line is obtained using the definition of GDP, with zero expected profits. It

follows immediately that there is a linear transformation curve between the mass of entering,

domestic and exporting firms, that is:
                                                     15


                                L = σ(M e f e + Mf + M x f x ).                              (22)

       To obtain further results, we assume a Pareto distribution for productivities:

                               G (ϕ) = 1 − ϕ − θ , with θ > σ − 1 > 0 .                      (23)

In that case, it can be shown (see the Appendix) that the number of entering firms is proportional

to the labor force, M e = L( σ − 1) / σθf e , which was assumed by Chaney (2008), for example. So

the transformation curve between domestic and export varieties is further simplified as:

                                          σθ
                                L=                (Mf + M x f x ) .                          (24)
                                     ( θ − σ + 1)

       The fact that this transformation curve is linear between the mass of domestic and

exported varieties is similar to that found in the Krugman (1980) model, in (7). But this fact does

not tell us about the transformation curve between the economy’s outputs, because we also need

to take into account the quantity produced of each variety. In Krugman’s model, the quantity

produced by each firm is fixed, as in (6), so the transformation is also linear in the quantity

produced by any groups of firms. But in the Melitz (2003) model, only the zero-profit-cutoff

firm has output identical to that in Krugman’s model, and the cutoff productivity ϕ * itself is

endogenously determined. So to determine the transformation curve for the economy, we first

need to determine the correct measure of output used to adjust the varieties M and Mx.

       To determine the appropriate measure of quantity, it is convenient to invert the demand

curve and treat revenue as a function of quantity, so from (14) we obtain:

                                                                          1
                                            σ −1                   ⎛ wL ⎞ σ
                       r ( ϕ) = A d q (ϕ   ) σ ,   where A d ≡ P H ⎜ H ⎟ .                   (25)
                                                                   ⎜P ⎟
                                                                   ⎝    ⎠
                                                     16

We introduce the notation Ad as shift parameter in the demand curve facing home firms for their

domestic sales. It depends on the CES price index P H , and also on domestic expenditure wL.

Likewise, export revenue can be written as:
                                                                                   1
                                      σ −1
                                                         ⎛P   F   ⎞⎛ τ w * L *   ⎞ σ
                rx (ϕ) = A x q x   (ϕ) σ ,   where A x ≡ ⎜        ⎟⎜ i         ⎟ .                (26)
                                                         ⎜τ       ⎟⎜ P F ⎟
                                                         ⎝        ⎠⎝           ⎠

Integrating domestic and export revenue over firms, we obtain GDP:

                             ∞         σ −1                       ∞            σ −1
                wL = A d M ∫       q(ϕ) σ μ(ϕ)dϕ + A   xMx        ∫* q x   ( ϕ) σ μ   x (ϕ)dϕ .   (27)
                             ϕ*                               ϕx


Thus, in order to measure GDP the mass of domestic and export varieties are multiplied by the

quantities shown above. Feenstra and Kee (2008) demonstrate that the first-order conditions for

maximizing GDP subject to the resource constraint for the economy, taking A and Ax as given,

are precisely the monopolistic competition equilibrium conditions. So the quantities appearing in

this expression are the “right” way to adjust the mass of domestic and export varieties.

       We can simplify these quantities by noting that CES demand, combined with constant-

                                                                        ~ ) σ q (ϕ

        To simplify this expression for GDP further, we note that a property of the Pareto

integration. That is:

as obtained by evaluating the integral in (28), which is finite provided that θ > σ − 1 . The cutoff

productivity ϕ * is in turn related to the mass of firms by [1 − G(ϕ*)]M e = δM , and using the

mass of entering firms M e = L( σ − 1) / σθf e and the Pareto distribution, it follows that:

        Summing up, from the Melitz (2003) model we have obtained a constant-elasticity

                                                       θσ
transformation curve, with elasticity ω ≡            ( σ −1)

Our earlier results in Theorems 1 and 2 continue to apply to this transformation curve. In

particular, consider the problem of maximizing ( A d M + A x M x ) subject to this transformation

curve. This Lagrangian problem leads to the following solution, analogous to (10):


Theorem 3 (Feenstra and Kee, 2008)

Assume that the distribution of firm productivity in Pareto, as in (23). Then maximizing GDP

subject to the transformation curve (32) results in e( A d , A x ) L , where:

                                                                                                         1

                w = e( A d , A x ) ≡
                                              1            ⎡ A ω+1 f 1− ( σθ−1) + A ω+1 f 1− ( σθ−1) ⎤ ( ω +1) .   (33)
                                       k 2 f e1 /( ω +1)   ⎢⎣ d                    x      x          ⎥⎦



The function e( A d , A x ) is the revenue earned with L = 1 on the transformation curve, and

equals wages. Note that the exponents appearing on the fixed costs f and fx in (33) are obtained

as − [ω + (1 + ω ) (σσ−1) ] = 1 − (σθ−1) < 0. This expression also appears as the exponent on fixed costs

in the gravity equation of Chaney (2008).

        We can now apply Theorem 2 to compute the gain from trade. Denoting autarky by t–1 ,
                                                                        ~
the economy is at the corner of the transformation curve with A xt −1 = M xt −1 = 0 , as illustrated

by point A in Figure 5. Using t to denote the trade situation, under free trade we have
             ~
A xt > 0 and M xt > 0, as at point C. We can therefore evaluate the gain from trade as the ratio of

real wages in trade and under autarky:

where the first line follows from wages in Theorem 3; the second line follows from Theorem 2,

using the domestic “price” Ad as the common good available both periods, with spending on

domestic goods in period t of R dt ≡ A dt M t ; and the third line follows directly from the

definition of Ad in (25).

       We use this equation to solve for the ratio of real wages, obtaining the result:


Theorem 4 (Arkolakis, et al, 2008a)

The gains from trade in the Melitz (2003) model are:

where the final equality is obtained because ω ≡              θσ
                                                            ( σ −1)
                                                                      − 1 , so      1    ( ) = 1θ .

       Note that the ratio of domestic expenditure R dt to total income w t L t is equal to one

minus the import share, so this formula is identical to the gains from trade in the Krugman

                                                                  −1
(1980) model, except that we replace the exponent              ( σ −1)
                                                                          in that case with − 1θ in (35). This

result is precisely the result derived by Arkolakis et al (2008a), and remarkably, the elasticity of

substitution σ does not enter the formula at all (except insofar as it affects the import share). Our
                                                                20

derivation gives some intuition as to where this simple formula comes from. Namely, the

movement from a corner of the transformation curve A in Figure 5, with exports equal to zero, to

an interior position like C, gives rise to gains equal to one minus the import (or export) share

with the exponent      −1     , which is a straightforward application of Theorem 2 on the production
                    ( ω +1)


side of the economy. We might interpret these gains as due to export variety. These gains are

shown in the second line of (34), and reflect the increase in wages due to the productivity

improvement as the exporting firms drive out less productive domestic firms. But in addition,

this productivity improvement drives down prices, and therefore further increase real wages: that

is shown as we substitute for the endogenous value of Ad, and thereby solve for real wages in

(35). Through these two channels, the gains equal one minus the import (or export) share with

                                                      ( σ −1)
the exponent − 1θ , which exceeds          1
                                        ( ω +1)
                                                  =     θσ
                                                                in absolute value.

       But what about any further gain due to import variety? Now we must be careful, because

the Melitz model leads to the exit of domestic firms and therefore a reduction in domestic

varieties, which must be weighted against the increase in import variety. Baldwin and Forslid

(2004) argue that the total number of product varieties falls with trade liberalization, whereas

Arkolakis et al (2008) show that it can rise or fall. But simply counting the total number of

varieties is not the right way to evaluate the welfare gains: instead, we need to take the ratio

(λ t / λ t −1 ) −1 /( σ −1) on the consumption side of the economy, as in Theorem 2. As we now show,

this ratio turns out to be unity: the gains due to new import varieties are exactly offset for

reduced domestic varieties. Therefore, the production-side gains we have already identified in

Theorem 4 are all that is available.

       To obtain this result, we use the CES price index for the Melitz model:

where ϕ xF* denotes the zero-profit-cutoff for the foreign exporters, with prices p F (ϕ) . This CES

price index is conceptually identical to what we referred to as the unit-expenditure function in

(2). The average prices of domestic goods appearing in (36) are:

                                                       1

which uses the prices (15) together with the definition of average productivity in (28).

       When comparing autarky (denoted by t–1) with free trade (denoted by t), we need to take

into account the changing price of domestic goods and their changing variety, as in (37), along

with the fact the all imported goods are new. Applying Theorem 2 gives rise to the following

ratio of unit-expenditures:
                                                                                   1
                               PtH        ⎛ wt /ϕ     ~ ⎞⎛ R / w L               ⎞ −1
                                                                                  σ
                                       = ⎜⎜           ~
                                                        t ⎟⎜ dt
                                                              ⎟ ⎜
                                                                         t t     ⎟⎟     .       (38)
                               PtH−1      ⎝ w t − 1 / ϕ t − 1 ⎠ ⎝ M t / M t −1    ⎠

The first term appearing on the right of (38) is just the change in the average price of domestic

goods, reflecting the change in wages and in average productivity. The aggregate domestic good

is available in both periods, so the first term reflects the Sato-Vartia index PSV over the

“common” good in Theorem 2. The numerator of the second term on the right is the spending on

domestic goods relative to total spending in period t; this equals λt in Theorem 2, or one minus

the share of spending on new imported varieties. The denominator of the second term is λt-1 in

Theorem 2, and reflects the reduction in the number of domestic varieties, Mt < Mt-1.
                                                       22


        We now show that M t / M t −1 = R dt / w t L t in (38), so the reduction in the number of

domestic varieties just cancels with share of spending on new imported varieties, and there are

no further consumption gains. This result is obtained from the ZCP condition for domestic firms,

in (16). The second expression appearing in (16) is q(ϕ*) = ( σ − 1)fϕ * , which is familiar from

the Krugman model – see (7). We will combine this with the first expression appearing in (16),

r (ϕ*) / σ = wf , which can be rewritten using the inverse demand curve in (25), to obtain:

                                ⎡                 σ −1 ⎤
                                ⎢ A dt q(ϕ*t ) σ ⎥ ⎛ w t ⎞
                                ⎢                             =⎜
                                                      σ −1 ⎥ ⎜ w
                                                                       ⎟⎟ .
                                ⎢                      σ   ⎥   ⎝ t − 1  ⎠
                                ⎣⎢ A dt −1 q(ϕ t −1 )
                                              *
                                                           ⎦⎥

Using the definition A d ≡ P H ( wL / P H )1 / σ , we readily simplify this expression as:

                                ⎡ q(ϕ*t ) ⎤ ⎛ w t / PtH ⎞
                                ⎢              ⎥=⎜                  ⎟.
                                ⎢⎣ q(ϕ t −1 ) ⎥⎦ ⎜⎝ w t −1 / Pt −1 ⎟⎠
                                      *                        H



Now using the ZCP condition that q(ϕ*) = (σ − 1)fϕ * , we immediately obtain:

                                ⎛ ϕ*t ⎞ ⎛ w t / PtH ⎞
                                ⎜      ⎟=⎜           ⎟,                                          (39)
                                ⎜ ϕ* ⎟ ⎜ w / P H ⎟
                                ⎝ t −1 ⎠ ⎝ t −1 t −1 ⎠

so that the increase in real wages reflects the increase in the ZCP productivities. From (30) the
                                                                         ~ /ϕ
ratio of ZCP productivities equals the ratio of average productivities, (ϕ   ~ ) , then comparing
                                                                           t  t −1


(38) with (39) we immediately see that M t / M t −1 = R dt / w t L t , as we intended to show.

        This finding that there are no additional consumption gains from variety in the Melitz

(2003) model, which is implicit in Arkolakis et al (2008a), is discussed explicitly by di Giovanni

and Levchenko (2009), who argue that if the distribution of firm size follows Zipf’s Law then the

extensive margin of imports accounts for a vanishing small portion of the total gains from trade.

Their model differs somewhat from our discussion above because firms also use differentiated
                                                  23

intermediate inputs, but they still assume a Pareto distribution for productivities. This assumption

implies that the distribution of firms by size follows a power distribution, which correspond to

Zipf’s Law as θ → ( σ − 1). That is the case where they find that the extensive margin of imports

has a vanishing contribution to the gains from trade. In comparison, our results above are more

general because we show that the extensive margin of imports has a welfare contribution that just

cancels with the reduced extensive margin of domestic goods, and this result holds for all

θ > ( σ − 1).

        These results from the Melitz (2003) model obviously challenge the empirical finding of

Broda and Weinstein (2008), who treated domestic varieties as unchanged. In the next section,

we consider an alternative framework to CES that allows for changes in domestic varieties as

well as changes in the markups charged by firms. Changing markups have already been

introduced in theory by Melitz and Ottaviano (2008), using a quadratic utility function with an

additively separable numeraire good, leading to linear demand functions. As useful as that

framework is, its zero income elasticities suggest that in empirical application it is best suited for

partial equilibrium analysis. We will consider instead a translog expenditure function, which has

income elasticities of unity and price elasticities that are not constant.

        Before turning to the translog case, we conclude by noting that the gains from trade in the

Melitz (2003) model have been estimated on the production side of the economy. Intuitively,

movements along the transformation curve in Figure 5 due to greater export variety will be

associated with higher GDP and productivity. That hypothesis is strongly confirmed empirically

by Feenstra and Kee (2008). They analyze 48 countries exporting to the U.S. over 1980–2000,

and find that average export variety to the United States increases by 3.3% per year, so it nearly

doubles over these two decades. That total increase in export variety is associated with a
                                                            24

cumulative 3.3% productivity improvement for exporting countries, i.e. after two decades, GDP

is 3.3% higher than otherwise due to growth in export variety, on average. That estimate is

greater than the welfare gains for the U.S. found by Broda and Weinstein (2006), which was that

after 30 years, real GDP was 2.6% higher than otherwise due to growth in import variety. Of

course, because the U.S. has a low import share we might expect to find greater gains to

exporters, but these results still demonstrate that the gains on the production side of the economy

can be substantial.


4. Translog Expenditure Function

         We turn now to consider a translog unit-expenditure function. In a monopolistic

competition model we need to be explicit about which goods and available and which are not, so
    ~
let N denote the maximum number of goods conceivably available, which we treat as fixed. The

translog unit-expenditure function (Diewert ,1976) is defined as:9
                       ~                    ~ ~
                       N                    N N
         ln e = α 0 + ∑ α i ln p i +        ∑∑ γ ij ln pi ln p j , with γij = γji
                                        1
                                                                                    and αi > 0.             (40)
                                        2
                       i =1                 i =1 j =1


Note that the restriction that γij = γji is made without loss of generality. To ensure that the

expenditure function is homogenous of degree one, we add the conditions that:
                                    ~                            ~
                                    N                            N
                                    ∑ α i = 1 , and          ∑ γ ij = 0 .                                   (41)
                                    i =1                     i =1

         The share of each good in expenditure is obtained by differentiating (40) with

respect to ln p i , obtaining:
                                                        ~
                                                        N
                                    s i = α i + ∑ γ ij ln p j .                                             (42)
                                                    j=1


9
  The translog direct and indirect utility functions were introduced by Christensen, Jorgenson and Lau (1975), and
the expenditure function in (40) was proposed by Diewert (1976, p. 122).
                                                        25


These shares must be non-negative, of course, but we will allow for a subset of goods to have

zero shares because they are not available for purchase. To be precise, suppose that si > 0 for
                                   ~
i=1,…,N, while sj = 0 for j=N+1,…, N . Then for the latter goods, we set sj = 0 within the share
                                ~
equations (42), and use these ( N − N ) equations to solve for the reservation prices ~
                                                                                      pj ,
         ~
j=N+1,…, N , in terms of the observed prices pi, i=1,…,N.

        Solving for the reservation prices introduces a level of complexity that did not arise in the

CES case, where reservation prices are infinite: in the expenditure function (2), an infinite

reservation price raised to the negative power (1 − σ) simply vanishes. To solve for finite

reservation prices in the translog case, it is essential to simplify the translog by imposing the

additional “symmetry” requirements:

                                ~
                              ⎛ N − 1⎞               γ                                 ~
                  γ ii = − γ ⎜⎜ ~ ⎟⎟ < 0, and γ ij = ~ > 0 for i ≠ j, with i, j = 1,…, N .                (43)
                              ⎝ N ⎠                  N

It is readily confirmed that the restrictions in (43) satisfy the homogeneity conditions (41), and
                                                               ~
also guarantee that the reservation prices are finite. Because N is a fixed number, (43) simply

says that the Γ matrix has a negative constant on the diagonal, and a positive constant on the off-

diagonal, chosen so that the rows and columns sum to zero.

        The restrictions in (43) are not familiar from the translog literature, but are essential to

solve for reservation prices for goods not available. Note that we have not restricted the αi > 0

                                                                   ~
parameters, though they must sum to unity as in (41), so there are N − 1 free αi parameters. 10 In

addition, we have the free parameter α0 in (40) as well as γ > 0 in (43), so there are a total of
~
N + 1 free parameters in this “symmetric” translog function. That is the same number of free

10
  Feenstra (2003) adds an additional symmetry restriction on the αi parameters, but Bergin and Feenstra (2009)
show that Theorem 5 below can be obtained without that restriction.
                                                                    26

                                                                         ~
parameters in our “non-symmetric” CES function (1), where we allowed for N parameters ai > 0

(possibly changing over time) along with the elasticity σ > 1. So in describing the translog case

as “symmetric” we are comparing it to the empirical version that does not use (43); while in

describing the CES function as “non-symmetric” we are comparing it to the theoretical version in
                                                               ~
monopolistic competition models that assumes a i ≡ 1 , i = 1…, N . In fact, both the CES function

in (1) and the translog in (40) have the same number of free parameters, or degree of symmetry,

which we have chosen to be tractable in a monopolistic competition framework.

         The usefulness of the symmetric restrictions in (43) is shown by the following result:


Theorem 5 (Feenstra, 2003; Bergin and Feenstra, 2009)

Using the symmetry restrictions (43), suppose that only the goods i=1,…,N are available, so the
                                    ~
reservation prices ~
                   p j for j=N+1,…, N are used. Then the unit-expenditure function equals:

                                  N                     N N
                ln e = a 0 + ∑ a i ln p i +             ∑∑ bij ln pi ln p j ,

         Notice that the expenditure function in (44) looks like a conventional translog function

defined over the goods i=1,…,N, while the symmetry restrictions continue to hold in (45), but

are defined now using the number of available goods N, which can change over time. As N

grows, for example, we find that the price elasticity of demand also grows because goods are

closer substitutes. To interpret (46), it implies that each of the coefficient αi is increased by the

same amount to ensure that the coefficients ai sum to unity over i=1,…,N. The final term a0,

appearing in (47), incorporates the coefficients αi of the unavailable products. If the number of

available products N rise, then a0 falls, indicating a welfare gain from increasing the number of

available products.

          Theorem 5 is a promising start towards using the translog function in monopolistic

competition models. For theoretical work, this result is all that is needed and it shows that the

translog system can join the quadratic preferences used by Melitz and Ottaviano (2008) as being

tractable alternatives to the CES case. Furthermore, both the translog and quadratic preferences

allow for endogenous markups.11 The real advantage of the translog unit-expenditure function is

on empirical grounds. As argued by Diewert (1976), it has a number of convenient properties: it

is obtained from homothetic preferences, provides a second-order approximation to an arbitrary

expenditure function, and corresponds to the Törnqvist price index, which is very close to price

index formulas that are used in practice.

          Feenstra and Weinstein (2009) develop an alternative formula for the welfare gain from

new products, beyond Theorem 5, that depends on the observable expenditure shares on goods

and can therefore be implemented. The terms appearing in the formula for the welfare gain are

analogous to those appearing in (47), but using observable expenditure shares in place of αi : the

welfare gain from new products depends on the sum of squared shares, and on the square of the

sum of shares, of new products. The sum of squared product shares – or Herfindahl indexes –

also determine the average markups charged by firms in each market. Increased shares of

imports and reduced U.S. shares can lead to reduced U.S. markups, and also contribute to variety

gains. For these reasons, the translog case offers a promising theoretical and empirical

framework to assess the gains from import variety and the effect of imports on reducing

markups.


5. Conclusions

       This paper is about measurement: how to measure the gains from trade that arise in the

monopolistic competition model. The CES functional form, introduced into the monopolistic

competition model by Dixit and Stiglitz (1977) and adopted by Krugman (1980, 1981) and later

literature, is just as convenient in empirical work as it is in theory. Using this functional form,

Feenstra (1994) showed how the gains from new product varieties depend on their expenditure

share as well as on the elasticity of substitution. The expenditure on new imported products, or

more precisely, on new source countries for imports, are available from highly disaggregate

trade statistics. In addition, estimates of the elasticity of substitution between source countries for

imports can be obtained using the same disaggregate trade statistics over time, as described in

Feenstra (1994). Broda and Weinstein (2006) applied these methods to import data for the

United States, and find that the gains from new source countries for imports can be substantial:

by 2001, these gains amount to 2.6% of U.S. GDP.

       Recently, attention has shifted in the monopolistic competition literature to the

production side of the economy. Whereas Dixit and Stiglitz (1977) and Krugman (1980, 1981)

relied on the “symmetry” assumption that all firms are identical, Melitz (2003) was able to

introduce heterogeneity in the productivity of firms. This framework allows firms to have

stochastic draws of productivity, but still imposes that firm profits are zero ex ante, as required

by free entry into the industry. This extension to the monopolistic competition model is well-

grounded in empirical observations: it allows for only a subset of firms in the industry – the more
                                                 29

efficient firms – to be exporters. In the Canadian context, Trefler (2004) showed that the exit of

less-efficient firms led to a substantial increase in average industry productivity following the

Canada-U.S. free trade agreement, which supports the Melitz model.

         We have explored the industry-level implications of the Melitz model, and found that it

leads to a concave, constant-elasticity transformation curve between domestic and export

varieties, adjusting for the appropriate quantity of each. Analogous to the CES results on the

consumer side, the gains from trade depend on the share of revenue devoted to exports and on

the elasticity of transformation, which itself depends on the elasticity of substitution and on the

Pareto parameter for productivity draws. Remarkably, once we take into account the general

equilibrium increase in spending following trade liberalization (i.e. endogeneity of the shift

parameters Adt), then the gains from trade simplify so that they depend on the share of revenue

devoted to exports (or equivalently, imports), and on the Pareto parameter. This confirms the

very simple formula for the gains from trade found by Arkolakis et al (2008a,b). All these gains

come from the production side of the economy, and there are no further gains from product

variety on the consumption side: the gains from import varieties just cancel with the losses from

reduced domestic varieties. That results follows from having an “interior solution” where only a

fraction of the domestic firms are exporters: if all firms exported or no firms exported in some

industries, then we would expect to again see consumption gains from variety as in Krugman

(1980, 1981).

       The final topic we have discussed is the gains from trade due to reduced markups charged

by firms, as in Krugman (1979). It is worth emphasizing that these are social gains and not just a

transfer from firms to consumers. In Krugman (1979), reduced markups combined with zero

profits in equilibrium imply that firms are moving down their average cost curves, taking greater
                                                30

advantage of economies of scale. So the reduction in consumer prices due to reduced markups do

not come at the expense of firms profits. In order to measure these gains we must move beyond

the CES case, however, where markups are constant. In theory, the quadratic utility function

used by Melitz and Ottaviano (2008) offers a very useful form of endogenous markets. Because

this utility function uses an additively separable numeraire good, all other products all have

income elasticities of zero. On empirical grounds, we recommend instead the translog unit-

expenditure function, which corresponds to homothetic preferences (income elasticities of unity).

Unlike the CES case, goods then have finite reservation prices that must be solved for. Feenstra

(2003) and Bergin and Feenstra (2009) show how this expenditure function, when simplified to

allow for some “symmetry” across goods, has a convenient solution for the reservation prices

that can be substituted back into the expenditure function, obtaining a tractable form even as the

number of goods varies. Feenstra and Weinstein (2009) are making use of this functional form to

estimate the impact of globalization on markets and product variety in the U.S. market. It can be

expected that applications to many other countries will follow, thereby allowing us measure this

third source of gains from trade due to monopolistic competition.

Appendix

        Using L = σ(M e f e + Mf + M x f x ) and the full employment condition, we have that:

where the first line uses q (ϕ) = (ϕ / ϕ*) σ q (ϕ*) and the last line uses q(ϕ*) / ϕ* = (σ − 1)f .

                                                                      ( σ − 1)θ
Likewise,                 ∫     [q x (ϕ) / ϕ]μ x (ϕ)dϕ = f x

Substituting these in to the full employment condition above we obtain:

                                           ( θ − σ + 1)

from which it follows that M e = L( σ − 1) / σθf e .
