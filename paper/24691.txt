                                             ABSTRACT

Large literatures document positive effects of WIC on birth outcomes, and separately connect health
at birth and future outcomes. But little research investigates the link between prenatal WIC participation
and childhood outcomes. We explore this question using a unique data set from South Carolina which
links administrative birth, Medicaid, and education records. We find that relative to their siblings,
prenatal WIC participants have a lower incidence of ADHD and other common childhood mental health
conditions and of grade repetition. These findings demonstrate that a “WIC start” results in persistent
improvements in child outcomes across a range of domains.

        The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)

provides supplemental foods, nutrition education, and healthcare referrals to low-income pregnant

and postpartum women as well as infants and children up to age five who are at nutritional risk.

WIC has a huge reach; In 2014, 52% of infants received WIC benefits (almost all of whom started

receiving them prenatally) (Hoynes and Schanzenbach, 2016). Hence, it is important to understand

the long term impacts of the program.

        A voluminous literature, both inside and outside economics, has examined the effects of

maternal WIC participation during pregnancy on health at birth. In their 2016 review, Hoynes and

Schanzenbach conclude that “The literature on WIC is primarily aimed at estimating the effects of

the program on health at birth. The most credible design-based studies show consistent evidence

that WIC leads to improvements in outcomes such as average birthweight, the incidence of low

birth weight and maternal weight gain. There is much less evidence about how the program affects

outcomes for children…” (page 5).

        This study begins to fill this gap using administrative data from South Carolina that

combine information from birth records, Medicaid claims, and school records for all children born

between 2004 and 2009. We start by replicating results from earlier studies showing that in this

sample, as in others, WIC participation during pregnancy has a strong positive effect on birth

outcomes in models with mother fixed effects: For example, infants prenatally exposed to WIC

are 10.5% less likely than siblings who were not on WIC, to be small for gestational age. We then

examine the effect of prenatal WIC participation on whether the child is ever diagnosed with a

chronic condition as of 6 to 11 years of age, future utilization of medical care, and future grade

repetition.
        We find that prenatal WIC participation is associated with a 5.0% lower probability of

being diagnosed with ADHD and a 5.1% lower probability of being diagnosed with several other

mental health conditions that are commonly diagnosed in childhood. The children are also 7.9%

less likely to repeat a grade. These effects are concentrated among African-Americans and the

lowest income category of Medicaid recipients, groups who are at high risk of negative birth

outcomes. Our estimates contribute to the literature by showing that prenatal WIC participation is

associated with better child outcomes beyond measures taken at birth and by highlighting the

domains that are most affected.



Background

        WIC was initially established as a two-year pilot program in 1972 and became permanent

in 1975. In fiscal year 2015, eight million people received WIC at a cost to the federal government

of $6.2 billion dollars.1 WIC serves pregnant, breastfeeding and postpartum women, infants (up

to age 1), and children (ages 1-5) in households with incomes less than 185% of the federal poverty

level. In addition, pregnant women who participate in several other entitlement programs,

including Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), the Supplemental Nutrition

Assistance Program (SNAP), or Medicaid, the public health insurance program that covers low

income pregnant women and children, are automatically considered income-eligible for WIC.

WIC participants also need to be deemed at “nutritional risk” by WIC professional staff, but in

practice this requirement seldom seems to be a binding limit on participation (Bitler and Currie,

2005) since virtually all applicants fall into one of the nutritional risk categories.

       WIC participants receive monthly WIC checks or vouchers that can be redeemed for

specific types and brands of food at participating stores or farmer’s markets. Packages are tailored

for each group. For instance, the main component of the infant package is infant formula, while

packages for breastfeeding women include a large variety and quantity of foods. Pregnant women

can be WIC-certified for the entire pregnancy, breastfeeding women are eligible for the entire

period of breastfeeding, and postpartum women are eligible for six months. Children are generally

certified for one year at a time up to age five.

       In addition to food vouchers, WIC provides breastfeeding information and counseling

through breastfeeding peer counselors. WIC also offers nutrition education through initial one-on-

one appointments followed by group sessions or on-line classes. Those with serious nutrition and

health risks can receive help from a registered dietitian. Finally, WIC clinics refer mothers to

healthcare and social services as well as providing immunization screenings. In fact, WIC services

are often available through medical clinics serving low income women and children.

       The evaluation of prenatal WIC participation has attracted a great deal of interest from

economists. A fundamental issue is that women are not randomly selected into the program.

Careful analyses of the WIC participation decision suggest that relative to eligible non-

participants, WIC mothers are more disadvantaged. For instance, Bitler and Currie (2005) focus

on Medicaid-eligible mothers, and find that the WIC mothers were younger, less educated, less

likely to have a father listed on the birth certificate, more likely to smoke, more likely to be

obese, and so on. Currie and Rajani (2014) examine mothers in New York City who changed

WIC status between births and find that women received WIC when they were young and

unmarried, or when they were unemployed. Rossin-Slater (2013) studied WIC clinic closings in

Texas and found that distance to a clinic also negatively affected participation.
         Studies generally find positive effects of prenatal WIC participation on birth outcomes.

For instance, Bitler and Currie (2005) and Figlio et al. (2009) evaluate WIC by choosing control

groups similar to the WIC participants in terms of poverty and participation in other transfer

programs. Rossin-Slater (2013) finds that reductions in participation due to clinic closings

reduced pregnancy weight gain, birth weight, and breastfeeding. Similarly, Sonchak (2016)

finds that WIC participation among South Carolina (SC) mothers is associated with an increase

in birth weight and length of gestation, decrease in the probability of low birth weight,

prematurity, and Neonatal Intensive Care Unit admission.

         Studies of the roll-out of WIC in the 1970s have also found evidence of positive effects

on birthweight, and no evidence of effects on fertility (Hoynes, Page and Stevens, 2011).

Estimated effects on breastfeeding have been mixed, but some studies suggest that recent efforts

to promote breastfeeding among WIC mothers, and incentivize it by upgrading WIC packages

for nursing mothers mean that WIC now promotes breastfeeding (Chatterji and Brooks-Gunn,

2004).

         Currie and Rajani (2014) estimate models with maternal fixed effects and find that WIC

reduced the incidence of low birth weight and of being “small for gestational age” (or below the

10th percentile of the distribution of weight conditional on gestation). However, they also find an

increase in the use of medical care among infants born to WIC participants. One reason to look

at small for gestational age (SGA) as an outcome is that as Joyce (2008) points out, the longer a

pregnancy lasts, the more opportunity a woman has to sign up for WIC. Hence, it is important

to control for gestation, or to focus on measures like SGA, when evaluating the effect of prenatal

WIC participation.
       To date, there are virtually no studies examining the longer term effects of WIC on child

outcomes. Hoynes and Schanzenbach (2016) comment: “Reflecting on the designs used in the

analysis of birth outcomes… it appears possible to apply similar approaches to examine child

health. However, this would likely require rich administrative data, combining child health

records, linked across siblings, and family WIC participation.” Our analysis is based on just

such rich data, with the addition of children’s educational records.

       Given the strong prior evidence of effects of prenatal WIC participation on birth

outcomes, what might one expect to see in terms of longer-run effects? A great deal of previous

research links higher birth weights with child health and educational attainment (see Almond and

Currie, 2011 and Almond et al., forthcoming for reviews). For example, Figlio et al. (2014) find

using linked birth records and educational records that lower birth weight twins had persistently

lower test scores in Florida, and that gaps that were present at 3rd grade were still present, largely

unchanged, at 8th grade. The effects were qualitatively similar in Ordinary Least Squares models

but larger and more precisely estimated in models with mother fixed effects estimated using

twins. In addition, several common childhood health conditions including asthma and ADHD

(Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) have been linked to low birth weight (see for

example, Alexander and Currie, 2017 and Villamor et al., 2009), and ADHD has been linked to

school failure (Currie and Stabile, 2006; Currie, Stabile, Jones, 2014; Kitashima and Chorniy,

2017). Hence, one might well expect to see positive effects of prenatal WIC in terms of reduced

incidence of chronic conditions and improved schooling attainment, though this has not been

previously demonstrated.

       Another possible channel for prenatal WIC participation to have long-term effects is

through its facilitation of WIC services after birth. Nationally, over 90% of infants who were
prenatally covered by WIC continue to receive services in the year after birth; however,

participation rates fall off as children get older (USDA, https://www.fns.usda.gov/wic/wic-

eligibility-and-coverage-rates.)

         Unfortunately, we only have data on post-natal WIC participation for cohorts born in

2009 to 2013, that is after the dates when most of the children in our sample were born.

However, in these cohorts the pattern of postnatal WIC participation in South Carolina is

consistent with national participation rates. Among children who were covered prenatally, 89.3%

of them continued to receive WIC services in their first year of life, dropping to 60.6%, 42.8%,

31.0%, and 22.0% in the five years that follow.2 Thus, prenatal WIC participation appears to

bring with it a high probability of participation in the first year or so of the child’s life, and this

participation may also have positive effects on child outcomes.

         In addition to providing infant formula and food benefits, WIC has a mandate to help

infants and children access medical care. Chatterji and Brooks-Gunn (2004) find positive effects

on the use of well-child visits among low-income, single mothers. Bersak and Sonchak (2018)

find that prenatal WIC participation increases the number of well-child visits. They use a

maternal fixed effects design and focus on infants within the first year of life. To the extent that

WIC is successful in linking mothers of young children with providers willing to care for their

largely Medicaid-eligible children, and to the extent that these relationships endure over time, we

might see positive effects in terms of utilization of care: More preventive visits for primary care,

and fewer preventable hospitalizations and emergency room (ER) visits. Many providers refuse

  The children who participate longest, tend to come from the most disadvantaged backgrounds. Also, we see that
about 30% of children who did not participate prenatally, participate at some point before age 6. To the extent that
these unobserved benefits have positive effects on child outcomes, we will tend to under-estimate the effect of
prenatal WIC participation.
to serve Medicaid patients, or limit the number of such patients in their practices, so it can be

difficult for these children to access care (see Alexander and Schnell, 2018).



Data

       Using social security numbers, our data set links together information from several South

Carolina state agencies: birth certificates from the Department of Health and Environmental

Control; Medicaid claims from the Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office; and school records from

the Department of Education. We merge these files and focus on a sample of children aged 6 to

11 years old who were born between 2004 and 2009, but can be followed up to 2015 in the

Medicaid and education data.

       We focus on this age range because educational outcomes are only available for children

once they reach school age and because health care utilization measures for children five and under

may be directly affected by WIC eligibility (e.g. if they receive WIC benefits from a medical clinic

or if they receive referrals) rather than reflecting differences in health. Our mother fixed effects

models further restrict the sample to children who have a sibling in the data, resulting in an analysis

sample of 59,530 children.

       Table 1 presents summary statistics about background characteristics for the whole set of

2004 to 2009 SC births, the subset that can be matched to Medicaid records, the further subset that

can be matched to educational records, and the final data set of children with siblings in the sample.

Table 1 is based on birth certificate data, which is available for all SC-born children and on

Medicaid eligibility data. From the birth certificate data, we know whether the mother received

WIC prenatally, as well as child and mother background characteristics such as the child’s race,

maternal education, maternal behaviors such as smoking, previous pregnancy outcomes, and
maternal health conditions, such as hypertension. Birth certificates also have information about

the child’s health outcomes at birth which have been widely exploited in previous studies,

including low birth weight, prematurity, likelihood of being small for gestational age, admission

to a neonatal intensive care unit, and whether the infant was breastfed. Medicaid eligibility data

has the eligibility category, and also has income categories, though the later are often missing.3

         Column 1 shows that 54.3% of all SC births were to mothers who received WIC prenatally.

Since mothers on WIC are automatically eligible for Medicaid, virtually all of these mothers also

received Medicaid coverage of their pregnancies. The question about whether a mother received

WIC food assistance for herself during pregnancy was introduced as a part of the 2003 Birth

Certificate Revision. It is obtained directly from a mother as a response to a check box item on a

Mother’s Worksheet which is completed after delivery and before the mother leaves hospital.

Unfortunately, the birth certificate data do not indicate the timing and duration of WIC enrollment.

          Almost exactly half of the children have Medicaid records at age six plus. A comparison

of columns 1 and 2 shows that as expected, children on Medicaid at age six and older are more

likely to have received WIC prenatally (and therefore also Medicaid coverage of prenatal care and

delivery), but are disadvantaged in other respects. The Medicaid children are more likely to be

African-American, have younger and less educated mothers, and have mothers who were more

likely to smoke prior to the pregnancy and during the pregnancy, or to be obese. However, the

  Although children’s benefits do not depend on the enrollment category, the enrollment category may be a more
accurate reflection of family income than the actual income category variables, since the later are often missing or
zero. The major enrollment categories in our data are OCWI (Optional Coverage for Pregnant Women/Infants with
a cutoff of 185% the federal poverty line in 2013); Children (200% FPL in 2013); Low income families (50% FPL
in 2013); and disabled (4.4% of qualifying children). Note that “Low Income Families” (LIF), or less formally,
Parent/Caretaker Relatives is a title given to an eligibility group in the South Carolina Medicaid program. To
qualify as a low income family, family income must be no higher than 50% of the FPL during most of our sample
period. In 2014-2015 the cutoff was raised to 62% FPL. Monthly net family income in 2015 dollars at the time of
the birth is be coded as zero or in $500 bins, with the excluded category being $1,000-1,500, monthly.
mothers of the Medicaid children appear quite similar to the full sample in terms of other health

indicators such as whether they have diabetes, hypertension, or previous poor pregnancy outcomes.

       Matching to education records results in a loss of 7% of the remaining observations,

suggesting that most of the children for whom we have Medicaid records when they are six or

older attend public schools so that they are in our education data base.

       Finally, the requirement that the child has a sibling in the sample is a stringent one, resulting

in the loss of many “lone children” from the data set. Comparing columns 3 and 4 shows that the

sibling sample is slightly more likely to be African-American, and has mothers who are slightly

younger and less educated than the full matched sample. They are also more likely to have had a

previous C-section, and a previous preterm birth, though they are somewhat less likely to have had

diabetes or hypertension. In summary, the analysis sample is more disadvantaged in a variety of

ways than the overall sample of SC births in these cohorts.

       To summarize the way that we build our sample, we start with all of the births in South

Carolina. From this set, we retain children who have Medicaid records available at ages six or

older, and have educational records available, and who also have a sibling in the data.

        The Medicaid claims include outpatient, inpatient visits, and dental visits and thus are a

very important source of outcomes data, as well as of family background information. These

records include information on diagnoses, detailed procedures performed as reflected in Current

Procedural Terminology Codes (CPT), and the dates and locations where these services were

provided. Additionally, we can control for each individual’s annual enrollment information which

includes his or her Medicaid qualifying category and monthly family income categories. Children

in our sample are continuously eligible for Medicaid, so we have income measured at various

points in time. In our models we control for net family income both at birth and at age six. Since
we are focusing on the Medicaid population, all age-eligible children are automatically eligible for

WIC and there is less variation in income than in the full population. However, we also include a

measure of the variability of income prior to age six (the standard deviation) to reflect the idea that

income shocks could affect health directly.

         Diagnoses codes recorded on Medicaid claims allow us to look at whether the child has

been treated for a childhood chronic condition after age 5, including a mental health condition, or

for an acute condition such as an infection. One of the most common chronic conditions in our

sample is asthma affecting 14.7% of children (means for all the outcomes are shown in Tables,

3, 4, and 5 so that they can easily be compared to the regression estimates discussed below). The

two most common mental health conditions are ADHD, which affects 16.6% of our sample

children and “Mental disorders diagnosed in childhood (312–316) excluding ADHD” which

includes “Disturbance of conduct”; “Disturbance of emotions”; and “Specific delays in

development” and affects 18.6% of sample children. Mental retardation is a separate and much

smaller category (ICD9: 317-319 affecting 1.8% of the sample); as is depression and anxiety

(affecting 3.0% of the sample), while autism affects 1.0% of the sample. A large fraction of

children in our sample also had common childhood illnesses such as acute respiratory infections

(48.7%) and otitis media (21.8%). In what follows, we focus on conditions with a prevalence of

3.0% or greater for reasons of statistical power.

         The measures of healthcare utilization we examine include emergency room (ER) visits

categorized into those that could be prevented (24.8%) or treated by a primary care physician

(38.7%) and those that were not preventable (22.3%).4 Although there are few hospitalizations in


4
  Following earlier work (e.g. Miller (2012)), we adopted the coding algorithm and classification of ER visits
developed by John Billings and colleagues at New York University (see, e.g., Billings et al., 2000). The categories are
based on the patient's diagnostic code include: non-urgent ER visits (e.g. sore throat); PC-treatable (e.g. ear infection);
PC-preventable (e.g. asthma attack); Non-preventable visits (e.g. a cardiac dysrhythmia); Injuries, and other.
this age group, we also categorize hospitalizations into those that were avoidable (0.8%) and those

that were unavoidable (1.4%). With regard to doctor’s visits, 88.0% of children in our sample had

at least one doctor’s visit after age 6 which can be interpreted as a marker for access to care. On

average, children have 10.4 visits per year, though this number combines both the effects of illness

and access. One indicator of use of preventive services per se is receipt of a routine child health

check (general screen) after age 6 (48.6% of children in our sample).

       Dental services are another important class of care that is covered by Medicaid. In our

sample, 84.8% of children received dental diagnostics, 86.7% had a preventative dental care

services (e.g. fluoride application), and 54.3% received a restorative procedure while in sample

(such as a cavity being filled). More alarmingly, 28.7% had dental surgery, such as a tooth

extraction which may indicate inadequate dental care. WIC could have a lasting impact on

children’s dental health both by facilitating access to preventive care and by discouraging mothers

from giving their children sugary drinks instead of water or milk.

       Annual school records provide information on children’s grade progression from pre-

kindergarten up to sixth grade, as well as recording children’s special education status based on

the South Carolina Education Finance Act (EFA) codes. Taking kindergarten and higher grades

together, about 9.8% of children repeat a grade in our sample. A fifth of the children in our sample

(20.8%) have been diagnosed with mental, emotional, learning and physical disabilities and are

receiving special education services based on their condition. The most common disability in our

age group is speech-handicapped (14%), followed by learning disability (5%).               Physical

disabilities, developmental delays, and autism each have a prevalence of about 1%.



Methods
        The methods used in this study are straightforward, primarily involving comparisons of

sibling outcomes obtained by estimating models with mother fixed effects:

    (1) Outcomeij = aj + b1WICij + Childib2 + Motherjb3 + φcounty + φbirth_year + eij,

where i indexes the child and j indexes the mother. WIC is an indicator for prenatal WIC

participation, and aj is a fixed effect for each mother. Child characteristics (Childi) include

gender, race, and birth order (1…5, 6 or more, as well as indicators for prescence of a sibling 1

year older, 2 years older, up to 5 years older). Possibly time varying mother characteristics

(Motherj) include the mother’s age (single year of age dummies), education (<12, 12, some

college, college), county of residence (captured using county fixed effects, φcounty), household

income measured at birth, and several measures of health risk factors for the pregnancy (pre-

pregnancy diabetes, gestational diabetes, pre-pregnancy hypertension, eclampsia, previous C-

section, previous preterm birth, other previous poor birth outcomes,5 pre-pregnancy smoking and

smoking during the pregnancy, pre-pregnancy obesity). In addition, we control for measures of

county economic conditions at birth (rate of unemployment, median income, and population

density). Finally, we also include indicators for each year of birth (φbirth_year).6 For models of

health care utilization, health outcomes, and academic outcomes later in life we also include

household income measured at age 6, the standard deviation of income between birth and age

six, and measures of county economic conditions at age six as well as at birth (rate of

unemployment, median income, and population density). In addition, we control for birth weight

and gestation, which is likely to yield conservative estimates of the effects of WIC as possible

  In the Medical and Health information section, birth certificates include a check list of pregnancy risk factors.
Other previous poor pregnancy outcomes include perinatal death, and previous small-for-gestational age/intrauterine
growth restricted birth.
6
  It is unfortunately not possible to control for month of conception as we were not given access to month of birth
data.
effects on birth weight and gestation might be an important mechanism for longer-term

outcomes. Models that do not include these controls for birth weight and gestation are shown in

Appendix Table 3 and discussed further below.

       The birth outcomes that we examine include several measures that are common in the

literature: birth weight in grams, an indicator for birth weight less than 2500g (low birth weight),

an indicator for birth weight less than 1500g (very low birth weight), whether the infant is

preterm (gestation less than 37 weeks), whether the infant is small for gestational age (that is

below the 10th percentile of babies with the same gestational age), whether the infant was in the

neonatal intensive care unit after birth, and whether the infant was breastfed.

       For children 6 to 11 years old, we examine both mental and physical health outcomes.

Mental health outcomes include whether the child has been diagnosed with ADHD, whether a

child has been diagnosed with another common childhood mental health condition, and whether

the child has been diagnosed with depression. The physical health outcome measures include

whether the child has ever been diagnosed with asthma or other acute respiratory infections,

otitis media (ear infections), injuries, nausea, or serious infections. These conditions include all

those that had an estimated prevalence in our sample of 3% or more.

         We also examine several measures of utilization of care including ER visits,

hospitalizations, doctor visits, and dental care. Since we are focusing on children who are all

currently enrolled in Medicaid (at ages 6 to 11) it is unlikely that WIC status (at birth) on its own

could result in current differential eligibility for services within Medicaid. Even if children

qualified for Medicaid based on different eligibility categories (e.g. if one was disabled), they

would still be entitled to receive exactly same benefits.
           The education outcome measures for children in our age group include indicators for

grade repetition and special education status.

           The past literature suggests that even within family, mothers tend to receive WIC at a

time when they are relatively disadvantaged (e.g. younger and less likely to be married). We

investigate this issue by examining the within-family determinants of WIC participation in

models, where the WIC indicator is the dependent variable and the other variables include those

in (1). These models take the form:

       (2) WICij = aj + Childig1 + Motherjg2 + φcounty + φbirth_year + µij.



Results

           Table 2 shows estimates from a model examining selection into WIC (Equation 2), both

for the full sample with Medicaid and education records as well as siblings in the data, and for

subsamples divided by race and by Medicaid eligibility status. Estimates are shown separately

for non-Hispanic whites, African-Americans, and for children in the lowest income eligibility

category (i.e. families with income less than 50% of the federal poverty line).

           These mother fixed-effects estimates suggest that the probability of WIC participation in

pregnancy declines with birth order, so that within a household, first-born children are most

likely to have participated. This finding might indicate that pregnant women with other young

children find it more difficult to get to WIC clinics. Mothers carrying male children are slightly

less likely to participate, which might possibly reflect greater paternal support when a mother is

expecting a male child (see Dahl and Moretti, 2008).7 Within family, mothers are more likely to

use WIC (conditional on the effects of birth order) as they age, and when they have attended



7
    Unfortunately we do not observe marital status in these data.
“some college” (relative to when they have either completed high school or less or completed

college). In terms of risk factors for the pregnancy, women are more likely to use WIC when

they are not smoking prior to pregnancy and when they have been diagnosed with diabetes prior

to pregnancy. Other things being equal, they are also most likely to participate when they are in

the lowest income category. One of the strongest predictors of differences in WIC participation

within families is gestation. The longer the pregnancy lasts, the more time a woman has to

become enrolled in WIC. This result highlights the importance of controlling for gestation in our

models. Qualifying for Medicaid through disability also has a strong negative effect on the

probability of WIC participation.

       Overall, it is hard to say from these estimates whether in a household in which one child

received WIC prenatally and one did not, one would expect the WIC child to be either more or

less healthy than the non-WIC child. On the one hand, mothers are more likely to use WIC when

the child is the first born, the family is in the lowest income category, the mother is older, when

the father may be providing less support, and when they have been diagnosed with diabetes

prenatally. These factors would suggest a higher probability of negative birth outcomes. On the

other hand, women are more likely to use WIC when they have not been smoking prior to

pregnancy, when they have attained some college (relative to being a high school dropout or

graduate), and when they are not qualifying for Medicaid through disability. These factors are

generally associated with positive birth outcomes.

       Perhaps the most important takeaway from Table 2 though is that the detailed observable

information in this administrative data explains only four to seven percent of the within

household variation in WIC use, leaving most of it unexplained. Thus, the implicit sibling fixed

effects assumption that conditional on observables WIC is “as good as” randomly assigned
within the family may not be unreasonable. We return to this issue below when we consider the

possible effects of omitted variables on our estimates.

       Effects on birth outcomes

       Table 3 presents estimates of the effects of prenatal WIC participation on birth outcomes.

We find statistically significant effects on birth weight, the probability of low birth weight, and

the probability that the infant is small for gestational age (SGA). In the maternal fixed effects

estimates, the increase in birth weight due to the WIC program is 1.1% without gestation

controls and is less than 1% when controls for the length of gestation and included. These are

very small effects. However, one might expect a larger impact on the left tail of the birth weight

distribution. The mother fixed effect estimate of the effect on SGA corresponds to a 10.5%

reduction in the incidence of SGA. This effect is roughly twice as large as the 4.2% reduction in

SGA among Medicaid mothers in New York city reported by Currie and Rajani (2015), which

might reflect the greater neediness of the South Carolina sample. The reduction in the

probability of low birth weight is 7.8 percent. Comparing columns (1) and (2) shows that the

estimates for low birth weight and SGA are quite similar with or without maternal fixed effects.

       The remaining columns of Table 3 break out non-Hispanic whites, African-Americans,

and those in the lowest Medicaid income category. A comparison of columns (4) and (6) shows

that WIC participation only appears to have statistically significant effects for African-

Americans, and that the estimated effects on birth weight, low birth weight, and SGA are much

larger in this subsample. For example, SGA falls by 2.06pp (12.7%) among African-Americans

compared to 1.02pp (11.3%) among non-Hispanic whites. In addition, WIC increases breast

feeding among African-Americans by 2.33pp (6.6%).
       Means of each outcome are also shown for each group. These means demonstrate that

African-Americans are at much higher risk of poor outcomes than non-Hispanic whites. For

example, the probability of low birth weight is 12.9% among African-Americans compared to a

near zero mean among non-Hispanic whites. Hence, a possible interpretation of the difference

between African-Americans and non-Hispanic whites is that WIC has larger effects on more

disadvantaged mothers who are at higher risk. This interpretation is supported by the last

column, which shows that mothers in the lowest income category (regardless of race) show

larger effects than in the full sample on birth weight, and have point estimates for low birth

weight and SGA that are similar to those of the full sample, though less precisely estimated

given that the sample is roughly half the size of the full sample.

       Having established that prenatal WIC has positive effects on birth outcomes in SC, Table

4 turns to the longer-term effects on child health and utilization of care among children six to 11.

The table is divided into two panels, first assessing the impact on mental health conditions, and

then turning to physical health conditions.

       The contrast between the OLS estimates in column 1 and the mother fixed effects

estimates in column 2, indicate that children who received WIC prenatally come from families in

which children are less healthy than other children on average in terms of both physical and

mental health. For instance, the OLS estimates indicate that they are 13.4% more likely to have

been diagnosed with asthma and 10.8% more likely to have been diagnosed with ADHD.

However, within family there is no significant “effect” of WIC on asthma, and the effect on

ADHD actually changes sign indicating that WIC reduces ADHD. In addition, there is a

statistically significant reduction in the probability of other childhood mental health conditions

for a WIC child compared to a sibling who did not get WIC prenatally.
       Given the strong relationship between poverty and negative child outcomes, and our

relatively crude or absent controls for family backgrounds characteristics such as income,

maternal employment, parenting skills, parent’s mental health status or parental marital status, it

is perhaps unsurprising that OLS estimates are biased towards finding negative “effects” of WIC.

While fixed effects cannot capture changes in these variables between the siblings, they do

capture the effect of any omitted variable that remained constant. We will further consider the

effect of time-varying omitted variables below.

       The remaining columns of Table 4 show the same breakdowns by race and Medicaid

eligibility category as before. Since in Table 3 we found significant effects of WIC on birth

outcomes only for African-Americans and not for whites, effects on future health that operate

through better birth outcomes should be apparent only for African-Americans, if at all. The first

panel dealing with mental health shows that this is indeed the case. For African-Americans,

prenatal WIC participation is associated with reductions in the probability of both ADHD and

other common childhood mental health conditions excluding ADHD. We do not find any effect

on the probability of being diagnosed with depression. For the lowest-income, where we found

weak effects of WIC on health at birth, we see some weak evidence of improvements in mental

health. For non-Hispanic whites, where we saw no effect of WIC on birth outcomes, we

similarly see no effect on mental health conditions.

       Overall, children who participated in WIC prenatally are 5.0% likely than their non-WIC

siblings to have been diagnosed with ADHD and 5.1% less likely to be diagnosed with other

mental health conditions that are commonly diagnosed in childhood including “Disturbance of

conduct”; “Disturbance of emotions”; and “Specific delays in development.” Currie and Stabile
(2009) show that these specific conditions are in turn linked to poorer outcomes among teens and

young adults.

        The patterns are much less consistent for physical health conditions, and suggest, overall

that prenatal WIC participation has little effect on physical health of children between 6 and 11

years old. We see no statistically significant effect of WIC on the physical health of African-

Americans despite the fact that the effects on birth outcomes are concentrated in this group. For

non-Hispanic whites, where we saw no effects of WIC on birth outcomes, there only estimate

that is statistically significant is a positive effect on acute respiratory infections that likely

reflects increase in health care utilization. The robustness section below shows estimates using

an index of physical health outcomes and an index of utilization. Given that we find no effect of

WIC on the indices for non-Hispanic whites, this one statistically significant estimate is unlikely

to be meaningful. The lack of significant effects on longer term outcomes in this group is not

surprising given that we saw no evidence of any positive effect on birth outcomes for non-

Hispanic whites.

        We examine the impact of prenatal WIC participation on longer-term utilization of health

care in Table 5. It is conceivable, for instance, that gaining greater access to medical care in

infancy and early childhood, could increase utilization of care at older child ages. The OLS

estimates in column (1) do suggest that children who received WIC prenatally have more visits

of virtually all types (ER, hospitalizations, office visits) even after they leave the program.

However, the mother fixed effects estimates in column (2) suggest that there is no within-family

difference in access to care between a WIC child and a non-WIC sibling. This null finding in the

fixed effects models holds for each of the three subgroups examined, as shown in columns (4),

(6) and (8). Taken at face value, the fact that adding maternal fixed effects reduces all of the
effects to statistical insignificance suggests that the families of children who participate in WIC

are simply different in that their children are likely to utilize more health care with or without

WIC. However, as discussed above, spillovers may be a significant issue in family fixed-effects

models of utilization since it could be the case that when one child gains access to care, all other

children in the family benefit. In this case, fixed effects estimates could be biased towards zero

for utilization.

         The sole place where we find long-term effects of prenatal WIC participation on

utilization is with respect to dental care. Table 6 shows the estimated effects on diagnostic,

preventive care, restorative procedures and dental surgery. The OLS estimates in column (1)

suggest that children covered by WIC prenatally consume more dental care and are more likely

to need restorative procedures and dental surgery. However, a comparison of columns (1) and

(2) indicates that there is no within-family difference in the need for restorative procedures and

dental surgery, suggesting that children in WIC families are generally more likely to have bad

teeth.

         Looking at subgroups suggests that there are no effects of prenatal WIC on dental care

for non-Hispanic whites, but that African-Americans who participated prenatally are more likely

than their siblings to receive dental diagnostics and preventive care. Similarly, amond children

in the lowest income category those on WIC are also more likely than their siblings to receive

preventive care. It appears that unlike hospitals and ERs, dental offices find it feasible to treat

some children in a family (e.g. those with whom they began a relationship when the child had

WIC coverage) but not others. In any case, there does not appear to be a protective effect of

prenatal WIC participation on dental health per se, since there is no impact on the need for

restorative procedures or surgery within family in any of the subgroups.
        So far, the estimates suggest that prenatal WIC participation improves birth outcomes and

reduces the incidence of ADHD and other common childhood mental health conditions and that

these effects are concentrated among African-Americans and lower-income Medicaid recipients.

As discussed above, childhood mental health conditions have frequently been linked to a higher

probability of grade repetition. Because the SC health records can be linked to data on

educational attainment, it is possible to explore that connection here. Table 7 shows estimates of

the effects of prenatal WIC participation on whether a child ever repeated a grade, and whether a

child has a registered disability. We find no effect on the later variable. However, we find that

both the OLS and mother fixed effects estimates suggest that prenatal WIC participation reduces

the probability of grade repetition. The mother fixed effects estimate for any grade repetition is

somewhat larger than the OLS estimate and suggests a reduction of about 7.9%, which is about

the same magnitude as the reduction in ADHD and other common mental health disorders

discussed above. Since mental health problems are one of the causes of grade repetition, it may

be the case that WIC prevents grade repetition by improving children’s mental health.

        The remainder of the table breaks out the estimates by race and Medicaid eligibility

group. Among African-Americans, the OLS estimate of the effect of prenatal WIC participation

is strongly negative, which is remarkable given how disadvantaged these children are. When we

look within families, the estimate is slightly attenuated though larger than the fixed effects

estimate in the full sample. It is statistically insignificant, though this is largely due to a higher

standard error in this smaller sample rather than to any change in the point estimate. We also see

a large and significant effect of WIC participation in the lowest income sample of Medicaid

participants. In this sample, prenatal WIC participation reduces the probability of grade
repetition by 1.54pp on a baseline of 11.3%, which is a 13.6% reduction. It is noteworthy that

the fixed effect estimate is about a third larger than the OLS estimate in this subsample.



Robustness

       We have conducted three additional analyses in order to test the robustness of our main

results. Appendix Table 1 reports the results using an estimator proposed by Oster (2017), who

suggests a procedure related to Altonji, Elder, and Taber (2005) for assessing the likely degree of

bias stemming from omitted variables. Oster (2017) notes that the magnitude of the bias will be

related not only to changes in the magnitude of the coefficient of interest when other controls are

varied, but also to changes in the of R2. The proposed estimator requires two assumptions. First,

it depends on the relative degree of selection on observed and unobserved variables; and second,

it depends on the amount of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by a

hypothetical regression that includes all relevant observable and unobservable variables. Given

these assumptions, one can place bounds on biases due to omitted variables. Oster (2017) offers

a standard value based on her tests of the estimator in randomized data, which we adopt. Since

in practice it might not be realistic to be able to explain all the variation in the dependent variable

(R2 = 1), it is assumed that the maximum attainable R2 is 1.3 times the R2 obtained in the

specification that includes all of the observable controls.

       As for the relative importance of observables and unobservables, we report two cases (see

Appendix, Table 1). First, we assume that unobservables are as important as observables (the

delta parameter from Oster is equal to 1). Second, since we have a rich variety of observable

variables in our administrative data, we also report estimates under the assumption that the

unobservables are half as important as the observables. In order to calculate the proposed
estimator, we run baseline regressions that only control for child sex and compare them to our

main specification that has a large set of controls. In most cases, the results are robust in the

sense that estimates that are statistically significantly different than zero in the main

specifications remain so after accounting for omitted variables bias. (The only exceptions are the

estimated effects on dental health care procedures and on acute respiratory infections in the first

case of equal influence of observables and unobservables. Inferences are all unchanged in

second case in which unobservables are assumed to have only half the influence of the

observables).

       Given the large number of outcomes examined, the second robustness check we conduct

involves using indices of variables from similar domains. Appendix Table 2 shows estimates

using indices constructed following Kling et al. (2007) and Deming (2009) for the following

domains: Birth outcomes, mental health, physicial health, ER visits and hospitalizations, office

visits, dental health, and academic outcomes. These indices are computed by first standardizing

the variables so that a more positive value is a “good,” taking the z-score, and then taking an

equally weighted average of the z-scores.

       Appendix Table 2 is consistent with the estimates discussed above in that we find

positive effects of WIC on birth outcomes, dental health, and academic outcomes in the full

sample, among African-Americans and among the lowest income WIC recipients. We also find

positive effects of WIC on mental health outcomes in the full sample and among African-

Americans.

       As a final robustness check, we re-estimate all of our models excluding controls for birth

weight and gestation, since some of the effect of prenatal WIC participation could come through
these birth outcomes. These estimates appear in Appendix Table 3. For the most part, they are

qualitatively similar to our earlier estimates.



Discussion and Conclusions

         This paper relies on mother fixed effects models, which have several well-known

shortcomings.8 Most obviously, they can only be estimated in families with two or more

siblings. We have tried to be transparent about this limitation by showing how the progressive

steps to select our sample affect its mean characteristics in Table 1. Overall, our sample is

somewhat more disadvantaged than the full sample of SC children covered by Medicaid; for

example, 57% of the children were in the lowest income category compared to 51% of the full

Medicaid sample. To the extent that WIC has larger effects on poorer children, this may cause

our estimates to be larger than they would be in the whole Medicaid sample.

         The sample selection critique is about the external validity of our estimates, but there

may also be concerns about internal validity. Specifically, in the presence of random

measurement error, our estimates are likely to be biased downwards. Here, the use of

administrative data may be helpful; while administrative data are subject to input errors, they

may be more accurate than survey-based responses, for example. Another concern is that there

may be spillover effects between siblings. This would also tend to bias our estimates towards


8
  See Neumark (1999) for one discussion of limitations of fixed effects models. We also explored the identification
strategy used in Rossin-Slater (2013), which exploits the opening and closing of WIC clinics and the relationship
between distance to a clinic, and WIC participation in Texas. In our sample, between 2004 and 2012, 13 clinics
closed, however, these closures had little impact on the average distance between children in the Medicaid sample
and the nearest clinic. We also tried to exploit significant fluctuations in gasoline prices over our sample period,
using monthly gas prices from the American Automobile Association that was collected and generously shared with
us by Matthew Lewis. However, the relationship between the cost of driving to a clinic and WIC participation was
weak. This later result may reflect the fact that most mothers are fairly close to a WIC clinic in South Carolina, and
that the clinics that closed seem to have been located close to other clinics. Distances were calculated using the
addresses on Medicaid enrollment records, and hence are only available for children who were enrolled in Medicaid
at some point.
zero. We think that spillovers are unlikely to be a big threat to the estimated effects of WIC on

chronic and acute conditions, but that they could possibly be a larger issue for the estimated

effects on health care utilization. To the extent that both children can use the same provider,

improving access for one child could have the effect of improving it for the other. Hence

spillovers in the utilization of care could possibly explain our null findings with respect to health

care utilization using within-family estimates.

       The most fundamental critique of mother fixed effects estimates concerns the reasons

why one child obtained WIC prenatally while the other did not? If these reasons are correlated

with future child outcomes then they could bias the estimated effects of WIC in the fixed effects

models. When we examine this question directly, we find several factors that are associated with

differential WIC participation, although most of the within-family variation is unexplained. The

most important factor in our sample has to do with birth order. Mothers who already have young

children in the home are less likely to participate in WIC. Family income is also important, with

families being more likely to participate when they are poorer. While there are observable

factors that help explain why a mother uses WIC for some pregnancies rather than others, and we

control for these observable factors in our models, they explain relatively little of the within-

family variation.

       We cannot rule out the possibility that there is a time-varying unobserved factor that is

correlated both with WIC participation and with better outcomes for one particular child in a

household. However, our investigation of the likely magnitude of these biases, following Oster

(2017) suggests that they are not likely to be large enough to overturn our main findings.

       In summary, there is a large literature demonstrating positive effects of WIC on birth

outcomes, and an even larger literature showing a connection between health at birth and future
child outcomes. To date, it has not been demonstrated that prenatal WIC participation has

positive effects on later child outcomes. This paper leverages a unique data set from South

Carolina which links administrative Vital statistics natality records, Medicaid, and public school

records in order to explore this question.

       We find that while children who participated in WIC prenatally remain disadvantaged

relative to other children, their outcomes are improved relative to close-in-age siblings who did

not receive WIC. In particular, we find a lower incidence of common mental health conditions

including ADHD, and a lower probability of grade repetition. These findings hold whether or

not we include controls for birth weight and gestational age, suggesting that they may reflect

another channel for WIC effects other than via these birth outcomes. Previous work has shown

that the developing brain is sensitive to being deprived of micro-nutrients such as iodine and

folic acid both prenatally and throughout childhood and it is possible that nutritious food and

nutrition education offered through WIC helps prevent such deficiencies (See WHO et al., 2007

and Eryilmaz, 2018). These findings demonstrate that a “WIC start” is not only a healthy start,

but one that is likely to result in persistent improvements in child outcomes across a range of

domains. Research to further understand the mechanisms underlying these effects could lead to

further improvements in food packages and outcomes.

Notes: The table shows identified sets of estimated effects of WIC participation on children's outcomes
based on the preferred specifications shown in the main results tables and on a bias-adjusted estimator
proposed by Oster (2017). The first column indicates whether our preferred specification yielded
statistically-significant results. The Oster method requires assumptions about the R-squared that would be
obtained if the omitted variables causing the bias were included in the regressions. Oster suggests using 1.3
times the R-squared in the original model, which is what we do here. The second assumption involves the
ratio between the variance explained by the unobserved variables and the variance explained by the
observed variables. This is referred to as delta and we show estimates using delta=0.5 and delta=1.
