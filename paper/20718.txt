Nudges and Learning: Evidence from Informational Interventions for Low-Income Taxpayers

                                              ABSTRACT

Can one-time informational interventions cause permanent changes in benefit take-up? In the context
the Earned Income Tax Credit, we find evidence that reminding individuals of their eligibility has
meaningful effects. Reminder notices have the largest effect among taxpayers without kids, persuading
nearly 80 percent of taxpayers in the notice year to claim the credit. The effect of the notice quickly
attenuates to roughly 22 percent only one year later. We find that this pattern holds across two experimental
settings, one that tests the effect of being sent a notice and one that tests variations in the content of
the notices.

I. Introduction

Do informational interventions create short-lived effects or permanent effects? The answer to
this question has important implications for theories of incomplete take-up of social benefit
programs (Currie, 2006) and for interpreting the impacts of outreach efforts in a variety of
contexts. If providing individuals with benefit information results in permanent changes in
behavior, then a single intervention may be sufficient to increase take-up permanently, and
ignoring the longer-term effects would understate the true impact of the intervention. On the
other hand, if an informational intervention only has short-lived effects, then repeated
interventions may be necessary to increase take-up permanently.


Many studies examine short-term effects of informational interventions, but few consider the
longer-term effects. 1 In this paper, we examine both short-term and longer-term effects of
informational outreaches by the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The IRS sends
notices to all taxpayers who appear eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) but who
fail to claim it on their tax return. The goal of the IRS notices is to increase take-up of the EITC
among eligible taxpayers. 2 While EITC take-up rates among tax filers are generally high, there is
still considerable scope for IRS notices to affect EITC claiming among notice recipients. By
construction, taxpayers are only sent notices when they fail to claim EITC benefits on their tax
returns, so the entire sample of notice recipients could potentially respond to the notices and
claim benefits. 3 Furthermore, as we discuss more in the analysis below, taxpayers who receive
notices in a given year also appear to have relatively higher incomplete take-up in other years
compared to the national average, so there is also scope for IRS notices to have longer-term
learning effects on notice recipients.

  For examples, see Madrian and Shea (2001), Choi, Laibson, Madrian and Metrick (2002) and Thaler and Benartzi
(2004), Hastings and Weinstein (2008), Brown, Kapteyn and Mitchell (2011), Chetty and Saez (2013), Bettinger,
Long, Oreopoulos and Sanbonmatsu, (2012), Hoxby and Turner (2013).
2
  The IRS intervention is designed specifically to increase take-up of the Earned Income Tax Credit, a goal we take
as given. We discuss prior work that suggests that incomplete take-up may be optimal and result from rational
behavior in Section II.
3
  Roughly 90% of EITC-eligible taxpayers claim EITC benefits on their tax returns. The remaining EITC eligible
taxpayers are sent notices. Thus, there is considerable scope for notices to affect these taxpayers’ behaviors since, in
theory, all of the notice recipients could respond to the notices. In practice, in 2003 through 2007 (excluding 2005
because of a glitch), notice response rates are 55% and 37% for taxpayers without and with kids respectively.


                                                                                                                       2
Exploiting two unique experimental settings, we quantify the impact of being sent a notice as
well as the effects of different information content in the notices. We distinguish between
inattention and unawareness by examining both short-term effects which we term “nudge
effects” separately from longer-term effects which we call “learning effects.” To our knowledge,
this analysis is the first to focus on longer-term effects of an informational intervention designed
to increase benefit take-up. 4


To estimate the causal effects of IRS notices on EITC take-up, we exploit a national natural
experiment that resulted from a computer glitch. In 2005, some taxpayers who should have been
mailed a notice were not sent notices because of a computer glitch. While the glitch was
corrected after 2005, it allows us to distinguish between a treatment group of taxpayers who were
sent a notice in 2005 and a control group of taxpayers who were not sent a notice but should
have been. Using a difference-in-differences research design, we compare outcomes across these
groups over time. We note that both groups could receive notices in subsequent years, so we
distinguish our setting from one in which treated individuals receive a treatment only in a single
year. 5


The results from the glitch analysis indicate that the IRS notices have meaningful short-term
nudge effects that quickly dissipate over the longer-term, and that the notices persuade some
eligible taxpayers to claim EITC benefits on their tax returns as opposed to responding to post-
filing notices to claim their benefits. For both taxpayers without kids and with kids, the IRS
notices increase EITC claiming in 2005 for the treatment group relative to the control group.
Among taxpayers without kids, we find that the notices persuade nearly 80 percent of the
treatment group to claim the credit, and among taxpayers with kids, this effect is just over 45
percent. After 2005, taxpayers without kids show some evidence of longer-term learning effects.
In 2006, treated taxpayers without kids are more likely to claim EITC benefits on their tax

4
  Prior work examines the longer-run impacts of interventions targeted at impacting behavior, such as electricity and
water use (Allcott and Rogers 2012; Ferraro and Price 2013), academic performance (Levitt, List and Sadoff 2011)
and smoking (Gine, Karlan and Zinman 2010), though not specifically take-up of a benefit program. Gallagher
(2014) studies the take-up of flood insurance in a setting where prior floods serve as a key piece of information that
affects agents’ take-up behaviors.
5
  Guyton, Manoli, Schafer and Sebastiani (2016) study nonfilers in an experimental setting in which treated
individuals receive reminders in a given year and control individuals do not, and individuals from both groups do
not receive subsequent reminders.


                                                                                                                     3
returns than control taxpayers without kids, though the effect is roughly one-quarter the
magnitude of the 2005 nudge effect. However, because the IRS sends notices in each year,
control taxpayers are more likely to receive notices in 2006 and many control group taxpayers
respond to these subsequent notices. Thus, we find that, in 2006 and later years, total EITC
claiming (i.e. claiming on tax returns or through notices) is similar across treatment and control
taxpayers. Given that the IRS notices appear to teach taxpayers without kids to claim benefits on
their tax returns rather than through post-filing notices, we note that this could represent
significant welfare and efficiency gains from the IRS notices. In terms of welfare gains, claiming
benefits on tax returns instead of through notices leads to low-income, potentially credit
constrained taxpayers getting their benefits sooner rather than later. In terms of efficiency gains,
claiming benefits on tax returns instead of through notices leads to lower tax administration costs
since costs associated with sending and processing the notices can be saved.


In contrast to the results for taxpayers without kids, among taxpayers with kids, we find little
evidence of longer-term learning effects as the EITC claiming rates for the treatment and control
groups are similar in later years. The lack of persistence or longer-term learning among
taxpayers with kids is interesting given the potential benefit are relatively larger compared to the
EITC benefits for taxpayers without kids who do exhibit some evidence of learning effects. 6


We also present results from a randomized experiment where the IRS sent different types of
notices to EITC-eligible taxpayers in California. 7 This sample includes individuals who did not
respond to an initial IRS notice, and therefore may be relatively more inert compared to the
taxpayers in the glitch analysis. This experimental setting allows us to quantify nudge effects
and learning effects from notices that vary in their informational content. Bhargava and Manoli
(2015) examine short-run responses to the different notices in this setting, and we build on this
work by quantifying longer-term learning effects from the different notices. Like Bhargava and
Manoli (2015) we find that there are meaningful short-term nudge effects for notices that make

  In 2005, EITC benefits could be as high as $2,662 or 34% (=2662/7830) of earned income for households with one
qualifying child and $4,400 or 40% (=4400/11000) of earned income for households with two or more qualifying
children.
7
  In addition to these research designs, we also present results based on an event study research design in Appendix
C. The event study is based on looking at EITC claiming among taxpayers who did not claim the EITC on their tax
returns but were later found to be eligible for EITC benefits when they were selected for audit. The event study
results do not indicate signs of long-term learning effects from the audit.


                                                                                                                  4
benefit amounts salient. Though imprecise in later years, the empirical results suggest that the
short-term effects fade out relatively quickly. Overall, the findings from this experiment imply
that the content of the message can have meaningful short-term effects, but the differential
content has limited longer-term learning effects.


The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II describes institutional background
of the notification letters sent by the IRS and the administrative tax data used in the empirical
analysis. Section III presents the empirical analysis of the effects of notices on taxpayers’
outcomes, using both quasi-experimental and experimental research designs. Sections IV
concludes.


II. Institutional Background & Data
A. Literature Review
One view of incomplete take-up is that it results from rational behavior. Individuals may
optimally decline their benefits due to stigma or transaction costs (Moffitt, 1983, Currie and
Grogger, 2001, Hernanz, Malherbet, Pellizzari 2004, and Currie 2006). Kleven and Kopczuk
(2011) suggest that policymakers may enact complex program rules and difficult enrollment
procedures to balance rejecting illegitimate claims with legitimate program use. These theories
generally assume that agents are both perfectly rational and have complete information about
their potential benefits.


There is also a large and growing literature on the effects of informational interventions on
benefit take-up across a wide variety of settings, which relaxes the assumption of complete
information. Intuitively, if individuals are not perfectly informed about their benefits then we
would expect the informational interventions to impact take-up. Consistent with this idea, many
studies find that relatively low-cost informational interventions have meaningful effects on
outcomes such as applying for federal student aid and enrolling in college (Bettinger, Long,
Oreopoulos and Sanbonmatsu, 2012), applying to more selective colleges (Hoxby and Turner
2013), parents’ decisions to send their children to higher-achieving schools (Hastings and
Weinstein 2008), labor supply and earnings (Chetty and Saez, 2013, and social security claiming
(Brown, Kapteyn and Mitchell 2011). There is also strong evidence that individuals are unaware



                                                                                                    5
of important retirement savings benefits (Madrian and Shea, 2001; Choi, Laibson, Madrian and
Metrick, 2002; Thaler and Benartzi, 2004). In this paper, we build on this strand in the literature
by quantifying the impact of IRS notices that inform taxpayers of the eligibility for the EITC on
take-up in the notice year. We also measure the extent to which the notices teach individuals
about the EITC generally by examining take-up in subsequent years.


Additionally, this paper relates to the literature on persuasive communication (see DellaVigna
and Gentzkow 2010. Previous studies in this area typically focus on shorter-term responses in a
variety of setting that include consumers (Bertrand et al. 2010), voters (DellaVigna and Kaplan
2007; Gentzkow, Shapiro and Sinkinson 2011), or donors (Falk, 2007). Compared to the
persuasion rates reported across these other areas, we find short-term effects that are much
larger. One obvious reason for the larger effects is that we quantify the behavioral response to a
meaningful financial benefit, whereas earlier work typically considers environments that do not
involve material financial benefits.


B. The EITC & IRS Notices
The EITC is the largest cash assistance, anti-poverty program in the United States. Prior
research finds that the EITC has positive impacts in many areas including labor force
participation (Eissa and Hoynes 2006), earnings (Chetty Friedman and Saez 2013), consumption
and food expenditures (Patel 2011, Goodman-Bacon and McGranahan 2008, and McGranahan
and Schanzenbach 2013), infant health (Hoynes, Miller and Simon 2012), and education (Dahl
and Lochner 2012 and Manoli and Turner 2014). 8 These findings suggest that increasing take-up
of the EITC among eligible taxpayers could have meaningful welfare effects.


The EITC provides income support to millions of working families. For tax year 2015, eligible
taxpayers without kids and with kids could qualify for as much as $503 and $6,242 of EITC
benefits respectively. Eligibility is determined based on taxpayers’ earned income, adjusted
gross income, age, filing status and the number of qualifying children. Appendix Figure 1 shows
the corresponding EITC benefit schedules for two key tax years that we study, 2005 and 2009.


8
 Previous work also reports small or negligible effects on marriage and fertility (Ellwood 2000, Dickert-Conlin and
Houser 2002, and Baughman and Dickert-Conlin 2003).


                                                                                                                  6
EITC benefits phase in as earned income increases up to the first kink point, where taxpayers
realize the maximum credit for the minimum amount of earned income. As earned income
increases beyond the first kink point, the EITC amount stays constant until the second kink point.
This second kink point is determined by filing status and number of qualifying children. As
earned income increases beyond the second kink point, benefits phase out. 9


To claim the EITC, taxpayers must file a tax return (and taxpayers with qualifying kids must
complete a Schedule EIC as part of their tax return). If a taxpayer appears eligible for the EITC
yet fails to claim credit, then the IRS mails a notice to the taxpayer. 10 These notices are sent
within three to four months after receiving an eligible tax return. To determine the notice
population each tax year, the IRS applies a series of filters to ensure that the tax returns meet the
EITC eligibility criteria. Plueger (2009) provides details on the filters applied by the IRS.
Generally, IRS filters based on taxpayer and dependent ages, filing status and income eligibility
criteria, as well as criteria such as having a valid SSN and having no prior disallowance of the
EITC. Appendix Table 1 outlines the filters. We refer to taxpayers who appear eligible based on
these filers as “eligible taxpayers,” even though some taxpayers who pass the screening filters
may not be eligible.


The IRS mailings consist of a letter to inform taxpayers of the EITC and a worksheet to confirm
the taxpayers’ eligibility for the credit. (Appendix Figures 2 and 3 present examples of notices
for taxpayers without kids and with kids respectively.) This additional information helps the IRS
to accurately determine that individuals are truly eligible for the EITC. Eligible taxpayers can
complete the worksheet and return it to the IRS to claim their EITC. Taxpayers do not need to
file an amended return to receive their benefits. For returns without kids, information on the tax
return is almost sufficient to determine EITC eligibility completely, but the IRS still sends
notices to these taxpayers, in part to have taxpayers validate the information on the tax form in
order to reduce non-compliant credits and to verify residence requirements. For taxpayers with

9
  The EITC is a function of both earned income (generally W2 earnings and self-employment income) and adjusted
gross income. The EITC phases out once taxpayers have AGI above the second kink point; for these taxpayers the
EITC is calculated as the minimum of the credit determined by AGI and the credit determined by earned income.
10
   Using tax data matched to data from the CPS, Plueger (2009) estimates that EITC take-up is roughly 75 percent.
Of the 25 percent that fails to claim the credit, Plueger (2009) estimates that 9 percent are individuals who file taxes
but do not claim the EITC.


                                                                                                                       7
kids, the IRS requires verification through the notice and worksheet that children pass the
residency test to qualify as EITC qualifying children.


Claiming the EITC in response to the notice may result both from the reminder nudge by the IRS
and also from reduced transaction costs. After filling in the notice, taxpayers effectively have
the IRS determine their EITC. This can save taxpayers a significant amount of time as they can
potentially avoid possibly up to 25 steps compared to claiming the credit on the tax return and
figuring the value of the credit themselves. 11 In order to increase EITC take-up in subsequent
years, the IRS also provides taxpayers with a lower transaction cost strategy for claiming the
EITC on the tax return. 12 As described in the “what you can do next year” section of the notices,
the IRS advises taxpayers that they can fill in schedule EIC and then write “EIC” on the tax
return line. This strategy equalizes the transaction costs in claiming the EITC on the tax return
or in response to the IRS notice—effectively saving the taxpayers the same steps as the notice.
To the extent that taxpayers adopt and understand this strategy, differences in EITC claiming in
the notice year versus following years would be attributable to the reminder nudge of the notice.


Figure 1 presents EITC take-up rates among taxpayers across potential benefit amounts (Panels
A & B) and earned income (Panels C & D). 13 In all cases, the figures show total EITC claiming
as well as the components of this total that consist of EITC claiming on the tax return and EITC
claiming in response to a reminder notice. When constructing these figures, EITC eligible
taxpayers include both taxpayers filing a tax return and claiming the EITC and taxpayers who
were sent a notice after failing to claim the EITC on their tax returns. Panels A & B indicate that
the likelihood of claiming EITC benefits on the 1040 increases slightly with potential benefits,
both for taxpayers without kids as well as for taxpayers with kids. Panels C & D indicate that the
likelihood of claiming EITC benefits on the 1040 has a subtle hump-shape with earned income.
Overall take-up of EITC benefits among taxpayers based on tax return claims or responses to

11
   The number of necessary steps to calculate EIC benefits is based on the 1040 Instructions and EIC Worksheets A
and B, and it varies with or without self-employment income and with income above or below the second EITC
kink point. These documents are available at: http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1040gi.pdf
12
   The IRS also provides this guidance on the instructions for the 1040 form.
13
   The EITC benefit depends on both the number of qualifying children and marital status, in addition to earned
income and AGI. For simplicity in Figure 1, we show take-up rates for head of household returns with one child.
As shown in Appendix Figures 4 and 5, the overall take-up patterns by benefit amount and earnings are similar for
other types of filers with dependent children.


                                                                                                                    8
notice is over 90% (roughly 95% for taxpayers without kids, and 92% for taxpayers with kids).
Even though EITC take-up among eligible taxpayers is relatively high, the scope for notices to
affect behavior is high because all notice recipients could respond to the notices. Conditional on
receiving a notice, the response rates are roughly 55% and 37% for taxpayers without and with
kids respectively (as with Figure 1, these statistics are based on data from 2003 through 2007,
excluding 2005 because of the glitch).


C. 2005 Glitch
To quantify the impact of being sent a notice, we exploit an inadvertent error by the IRS that
omitted some returns from the notice population. Due to this error, we are able to address
selection into the notice population by examining the impact of being sent a notice among
returns that actually were mailed a notice, or that should have been mailed a notice absent the
error. The inadvertent error by IRS occurred only in 2005 and was the result of a computer
glitch. In this year, taxpayers who used computer software to generate their returns but then
mailed in paper versions of the return were omitted from the notice population. We refer to this
filing method as “computer-paper.” Taxpayers file computer-paper returns to utilize the benefits
of tax software but avoid e-filing fees. 14 In a typical year, roughly 10 percent of returns are filed
this way. Based on the 2005 computer glitch, we create a treatment group of taxpayers who
received notices and a control group of computer-paper taxpayers who did not receive notices
but who would have absent the glitch. We identify the causal effects of being sent a notice based
on comparing outcomes across the treatment and control groups over time.


D. 2009 CA Experiment
We also study the impact of being sent different information in the IRS notification by exploiting
an experiment set up by the IRS (see Bhargava and Manoli 2015). Typically, taxpayers in the
notice population receive only a single notice from the IRS each tax year. In this experiment, the
IRS sent second notices to taxpayers in California who were sent an initial IRS notice for 2009
but did not respond. This analysis includes the following treatments: (1) simplified notices

14
  Taxpayers commonly move into and out of computer-paper filing over time, though taxpayers who used
computer-paper filing in 2005 are generally more likely to file in this way in other years. Among returns without
kids using computer-paper in 2005 these shares were 44 percent in 2004 and 43 percent in 2006. By comparison,
among returns with no kids who did not file computer computer-paper in 2005, 7 percent used computer-paper in
2004 and 6 percent used computer-paper in 2006.


                                                                                                                    9
which aimed to reduce complexity by clarifying eligibility conditions and making response
worksheets shorter and easier to read, (2) benefit notices which aimed to increase the salience of
maximum credit amounts, (3) social influence notices which aimed to use information on peer
take-up to influence responses, and (4) claiming time notices which aimed to reduce perceptions
of the necessary time to respond to the notices. 15 Bhargava and Manoli (2015) discuss the
experimental design in greater detail and analyze the short-term effects of the experimental
notices. We extend this analysis by considering additional years and by differentiating between
EITC claiming on the tax return and EITC claiming in response to IRS notices.


E. Data
We use population level administrative income tax data from the United States Internal Revenue
Service for the empirical analysis of the national natural experiment and the randomized
experiment in California. For the national-level experiment, we construct the 2005 Analysis
Sample by identifying individuals who were sent an IRS notice for tax year 2005. Next, we add
individuals who filed computer-generated but paper-filed returns for tax year 2005 who would
have been sent a notice absent the glitch. We identify just over 130,000 omitted tax returns,
which is close to the estimate by the IRS that between 100,000 and 140,000 taxpayers were
omitted as a result of the glitch (Plueger 2009). For this Analysis Sample, we construct a
balanced nine-year panel from 2001 through 2009 based on each primary taxpayer in the 2005
sample.


Table 1 presents summary statistics for the Analysis Sample and the population of taxpayers in
2005 who claimed the EITC on their tax returns. Among returns without kids, taxpayers in the
Analysis Sample have slightly lower wage income (reported on Form 1040) but slightly higher
AGI, are much less likely to use a paid tax preparer, and are less likely to have computer-
prepared but paper-filed tax returns relative to the 2005 EITC Sample. For returns with kids, the
Analysis sample has both higher wages and higher AGI, more likely to file jointly and less likely
to use a tax preparer, compared to the 2005 EITC Sample.

15
   The treatment notices involved variations in the notice headlines. The simple notice headline was “You may be
eligible for a refund”; the benefit notice headline was “You may be eligible for a refund up to $5,657”; the social
influence notice was “You may be eligible for a refund. Usually, 4 out of every 5 people claim their refunds”; the
claiming time notice headline was “You may be eligible for a refund. Claiming your refund usually takes less than
10 minutes.”


                                                                                                                  10
Table 2 divides the Analysis Sample into the treatment and control groups and presents summary
statistics. Columns (1) and (2) report summary statistics for the treatment and control groups
among returns without kids and Columns (5) and (6) report these statistics for returns with kids.
In both cases, the treatment group and control groups are significantly different in many ways.
For example, among returns without kids, those in the treatment group have higher wage income
and are more likely to report wage income, are less likely to be married and are far less likely to
use a paid preparer. In some cases, the differences across treatment and control groups are
substantively large, such as the differences in AGI or in the probability of using a paid tax
preparer.


To explicitly account for these differences in observables between the treatment and control
groups, we re-weight observations in the treatment and control groups based on observable
demographic characteristics and earnings variables from 2005. (We discuss this method in detail
in Appendix A.) Columns (3) and (4) show the weighted means for returns without kids, and
Columns (7) and (8) show the weighted statistics for returns with kids. 16 Among both returns
with kids and returns without kids, after weighting the treatment and control groups have similar
observables. For example, the significant differences in AGI and use of paid tax preparers in the
un-weighted samples are now insignificant in the weighted samples. In the empirical results, we
focus on the results for the weighted sample to ensure that we are comparing outcomes of
observationally similar individuals across the treatment and control groups. We have verified
that we find qualitatively similar results using the unweighted sample as shown in the Appendix
Tables.


To construct the sample for the 2009 California experiment, we pull the panel of tax returns for
2005-2011 for each taxpayer in the experiment. Table 1 presents summary statistics from tax
year 2009 for the California Experiment Sample and for taxpayers in California who received an
initial IRS notice in 2009. As noted in Bhargava and Manoli (2015), these groups were

weighting procedure on this sample.


III. Empirical Analysis
A. Effects of Getting a Notice
1. Identification Strategy & Regression Specification
To identify the causal effects of being sent a notice on taxpayer behavior, we use a difference-in-
differences identification strategy and data from the 2005 glitch sample. We define the treatment
group as individuals who were sent notices for 2005 and the control group as individuals who
should have been sent notices for 2005 but were not (taxpayers with computer-paper returns).


We estimate the following regression specification
                              2009                             2009

 𝑦𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖 + � 𝛽2𝑘 [1(𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑡 = 𝑘)] + � 𝛽3𝑘 [1(𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑡 = 𝑘) ∗ 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖 ] + 𝜀𝑖𝑖
                            𝑘=2005                            𝑘=2005

in which Treati is an indicator equal to 1 if taxpayer i is in the treatment group (defined by 2005
return method) and 1(𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑡 = 𝑘) is an indicator equal to 1 if Year t is equal to k. We focus on
the binary take-up outcome to test for nudge and learning effects based on the extensive
margin, 17 so the dependent variable 𝑦𝑖𝑖 in an indicator variable equal to 1 if individual i claims
EITC benefits in year t. We also quantify the likelihood that taxpayer receive a notice in each
year, also coded as a binary dependent variable.


The sample includes data from 2004 through 2009 so that differences in outcomes between the
treatment and control groups in 2005 through 2009 are measured relative to the difference in
outcomes in 2004. We adopt this approach because 2004 is the year immediately preceding the
notice treatment. As discussed in the Appendix, the baseline nudge effects from this approach
are robust to the inclusion of additional years in the pre-treatment period.


The coefficients β3k are the coefficients of interest as they capture the difference between the
treatment and control groups in 2005 and later years, relative to the difference between the

17
  However, we also present results based on using EITC amounts claimed as the dependent variable in Appendix
Table 5.


                                                                                                               12
treatment and control groups in 2004. These differential effects in 2005 quantify the immediate
impact of the notice, which we refer to as the “nudge” effect. Intuitively, the notice directly
informs taxpayers of their eligibility in that year and allows them to claim the EITC simply by
responding to the notice. Beyond giving the taxpayer information on their eligibility for the
EITC in 2005, the notice tries to teach the taxpayer about the EITC more generally and provides
taxpayers with a strategy to make EITC claiming on the tax return easier. The differential effects
in 2006 through 2009 test whether taxpayers adopt this proposed strategy and/or whether the
notice translates into learning about the EITC generally, which we refer to as “learning” effects.


We estimate the above regression specification using only the sample of observations that are
eligible for EITC benefits. Our definition of EITC eligibility is exactly the IRS definition. We
use filters the IRS imposes to determine if a filed tax return is eligible for EITC benefits.
Appendix Table 1 lists these filters. In general, the filters are based on taxpayer and dependent
ages, filing status and income eligibility criteria, as well as criteria such as having a valid SSN
and having no prior disallowance of the EITC. By conditioning on EITC eligibility, we test if
eligible individuals take up EITC benefits. Before conditioning on EITC eligibility, we verify
that (1) the treatment and control groups have parallel trends in eligibility and notice receipt prior
to the treatment in 2005, and (2) the treatment in 2005 did not differentially affect EITC
eligibility of the treatment and control groups. Appendix Table 6 presents the parallel trends
tests. Specifically, this table presents the results from regressing an indicator for eligibility or
receiving a notice on a treatment indicator, a time trend and an interaction between the time trend
and treatment indicator using the pre-2005 data for the glitch analysis. The coefficients on the
interaction are small and statistically insignificant, so we conclude that there are parallel trends
in eligibility and notice receipt for the treatment and control groups. Appendix Table 7 presents
the results from estimating the above regression specification with indicators and eligibility and
notice receipt as dependent variables. These regressions are estimated using the full glitch
analysis sample. While we discuss the notice receipt results in more detail below, the eligibility
results show that the coefficients on the interactions of the year indicators and treatment
indicators are statistically insignificant. 18 The plots in Figure 2 present graphical evidence that

verifies these regression results. The figures plot EITC eligibility over time for the treatment and
control groups, there does not appear to be differential patterns in eligibility before or after
2005. 19


Treatment and control groups also appear to have comparable patterns in the likelihood of being
sent a notice over time in the years prior to the glitch, allowing us to attribute the effects in 2005
and later years as resulting from the glitch-induced difference in being sent a notice. Panels C
and D in Figure 2 show the fraction of each group sent a notice in each year, conditional on
being EITC eligible. In 2005, individuals in the treatment group were all sent notices by the IRS,
while none of the individuals in the control group were sent a notice. Among returns with no
kids, the trends in being sent notices appear to be parallel for the treatment and control groups in
the years 2001-04. This lends support to interpreting changes in behavior for the treatment group
relative to the control group after 2005 as being driven by the differences in being sent notices in
2005. We find support for this interpretation in Appendix Tables A6 that finds evidence of
comparable trends in the likelihood of being sent a notice in the years prior to 2005.


We account for differences in observables between individuals in the treatment and control
groups by re-weighting based on observables. We focus on re-weighting rather than controlling
for covariates in the regression specification because we aim to examine outcomes for
observationally similar individuals (which favors re-weighting) and we are not concerned about
treatment status being correlated with observables (which would favor controlling for covariates)
since treatment status was mechanically assigned. We follow standard re-weighting techniques,
and the details are presented in the Appendix. To summarize, we re-weight separately for returns
with and without kids in 2005 based on gender, age, filing status and a variety of income
measures in 2005. The re-weighting explicitly ensures that the treatment and control groups are
observationally similar along these dimensions. While we present results based on the re-
weighted data in the main text below, Appendix Table 3 presents the results using the un-


significant after weighting. Because we fail to find a comparable effect on EITC take-up in that year, it seems
unlikely that the eligibility pattern results from a behavioral response to the notice.
19
   In addition to checking trends in eligibility and notice receipt, we have also checked trends in key determinants of
EITC eligibility, namely earnings and the presence of kids. Appendix Figure 6 presents plots of these variables for
the treatment and control groups. Overall, we find similar trends in these variables for the treatment and control
groups.


                                                                                                                     14
weighted data. This Table suggests that the un-weighted and re-weighted results do not differ
substantively in terms of the main conclusions regarding nudge effects and learning effects. 20


2. 2005 Glitch Estimation Results
Mean differences in take-up over time across the treatment and control groups suggest that the
notice has a large nudge effect. Figure 3 illustrates time series of re-weighted take-up rates
conditional on EITC eligibility for the treatment and control groups. (Appendix Figure 7 presents
the corresponding plots of unweighted take-up rates.) Panels A and B present plots of the take-up
rates for taxpayers without and with kids respectively who claim the credit on their tax return in
2001-04 and 2006-09 and for responding to the notice in 2005. Panels C and D in Figure 3
presents total take-up rates, which includes both notice responses and tax return claiming, in all
years. In all cases, the control group has a zero response in 2005 by construction since
individuals in the control group were not sent notices. Among returns without kids, the take-up
rates suggest minimal long-term learning effects after 2005 in both Panels A and C, as the gap
between treatment and control groups narrows slightly in the post-2005 years relative to the pre-
2005 period. For returns with kids the implications for learning effects are less clear.


Figure 3 also highlights the intuition for limiting the regression analysis to the years 2004-09.
Especially for the case of returns with kids, the difference between the treatment and control
group is smaller in the year just before the treatment year compared to other earlier years. By
choosing to use only the year 2004 as the pre-period, our analysis highlights how behavior
changes in the year of the computer glitch and later years, relative to the year immediately
preceding the glitch. As shown in Appendix Tables 4 A & B, the choice or pre-treatment years
does not substantively affect our main conclusions about nudge effects and longer-term learning
effects.


Table 3 presents the baseline regression estimates which are consistent with Figure 3. We show
the results for three separate outcomes: (1) claiming EITC on a tax return or responding to the
2005 notice; (2) being sent an IRS notice; (3) claiming EITC on a tax return or in response to an


20
  We have also verified that the results are robust to controlling for a rich set of covariates based on demographic
and income history variables.


                                                                                                                       15
IRS notice in any year. The first and last outcomes are shown in Figure 3. In all cases, we restrict
the sample in each year to taxpayers who are eligible for the EITC.


The results in Table 3 show that the notices have strong nudge effects in 2005 for both taxpayers
without kids and taxpayers with kids. For taxpayers without and with kids respectively, the
estimates in the first and fourth columns indicate that the notices increased EITC claiming by 80
percentage points and 40 percentage points. The strong nudge effects in 2005 are also present
when we use total EITC claiming, either on the tax return or in response to an IRS notice, as the
outcome variable (the third and sixth columns). In this case, the nudge effect is about 66
percentage points for returns without kids and about 36 percentage points among returns with
kids, relative to total EITC claiming in 2004.


Next we turn to the longer-term learning effects after 2005. The results for taxpayers without
kids suggest that there are some statistically significant differences between the treatment and
control groups. The results for claiming EITC benefits on a tax return show that treated
individuals were more likely to claim EITC benefits on their tax returns after 2005 than control
individuals. The results in 2006 are statistically significant, while the results in subsequent years
are slightly smaller and not statistically significant. The 2006 results for claiming EITC benefit
on a tax return are perhaps the cleanest test of learning effects. As shown in the second column
in Table 3, control individuals were more likely to receive notices after 2005 than treated
individuals. In particular, treated individuals mechanically have a probability of one for being
sent a notice in 2005, but after 2005, treated individuals are about 10 percentage points less
likely to receive notices than control individuals, and these differences are statistically
significant. Intuitively, some taxpayers without kids who received notices in 2005 may have
learned to claim EITC benefits on their tax returns in 2006. Yet because the IRS sends out
notices each year some individuals in the control group may have claimed EITC benefits through
these subsequent notices. 21 When looking at the longer-term learning effects based on total
claiming of EITC benefits (on tax returns or through notices ), there are no statistically
significant differences between the treatment and control groups after 2005. These results are in


21
  The negative differential effects on the likelihood of being sent a notice in later years also suggests that members
of the treatment group do not on average learn to wait for a notice in later years in order to claim the EITC.


                                                                                                                    16
the third Column of Table 3. In contrast, the results for taxpayers with kids show no consistent
statistically significant differences between the treatment and control groups after 2005. Thus,
there is little to no evidence of longer-term learning effect for these taxpayers. Overall, based on
the regression results in Table 3, we conclude that some taxpayers do learn to claim EITC
benefits on their tax returns, but this learning is smaller than the nudge effect from the notices.


Using the estimated regression coefficients, we calculate “persuasion rates” following
DellaVigna and Gentzkow (2010). Persuasion rates rescale the estimated regression coefficients
by baseline take-up rates and treatment intensity, and hence allow us to characterize the effect of
the notice among those whose behavior could have been influenced. (We discuss the calculation
of these rates further in the Appendix.) Applying the persuasion rate formula to the regression
estimates suggests that the notices nudge a meaningful fraction of taxpayers. As shown in Table
4, we estimate persuasion rates of 77% of returns without kids and 46% of returns with kids in
2005. For taxpayers with kids, the standard errors for the persuasion rates after 2005 are very
large and we cannot draw any meaningful conclusions. For taxpayers without kids, the
persuasion rate in 2006 measured with respect to tax return claiming in that year is just over
22%, and about 18% when measured based on claiming EITC benefits on tax returns or through
notices. The point estimates for the persuasion rates after 2005 suggest some persistent learning
effects, but the standard errors are relatively large so that we cannot rule out that the hypothesis
that there are no meaningful learning effects after 2005.


B. Effects of Different Notices
1. Identification Strategy & Regression Specification
To further investigate the causal effects of IRS notices on taxpayer behavior, we consider the
effects of being sent simpler notices with more salient benefit information versus more
complicated and less salient notices. (See Bhargava and Manoli (2015) for a more detailed
discussion of this experiment.) If the causal effects of notices are concentrated only in the nudge
effect, then one would expect that the differences between groups sent simpler and more salient
notices versus more complicated notices are also concentrated in the notice year. To test this
hypothesis, we exploit the randomized variation in notice messaging from the 2009 CA
experiment. The identification strategy compares outcomes for taxpayers who were randomly



                                                                                                      17
assigned to different treatment groups with simpler and more salient notices or more complicated
notices as described in Bhargava and Manoli (2015). Compared to the 2005 glitch analysis,
there are two key differences in this experiment. First, the sample includes individuals who did
not respond to an initial notice in a given year rather than individuals receiving a notice for the
first time in a given year. Second, the results identify the effect of more versus less complicated
and salient notices, rather than the effect of being sent a notice versus not being sent a notice.


To test the effects of the different treatments, we estimate the following regression specification
                                                     2011

            𝑦𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽0 + � 𝛽1𝑘 1(𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖 = 𝑘) + � 𝛽2𝑠 [1(𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑡 = 𝑠)]
                            𝑘
                                                    𝑠=2008
                                       2011

                            +�         � 𝛽3𝑘,𝑠 [1(𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑡 = 𝑠) ∗ 1(𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖 = 𝑘)] + 𝜀𝑖𝑖
                                  𝑘
                                      𝑘=2008

where Treati captures the taxpayer’s 2009 treatment group k = simple, benefit, social, or time.
The variable yit denotes outcome y for taxpayer i in tax year t, including take-up of EITC
benefits as well as EITC amounts claimed. The key coefficients of interest are the coefficients on
the interactions between the year dummies and the treatment group dummies, β3k,s. These
coefficients capture the differences between the treatment groups across the different tax years.
As with the 2005 glitch regression specification, we include in the pre-period only one-year prior
to the experiment (the experiment was in 2009).


Similar to the 2005 glitch analysis, we estimate the above regression for the 2009 California
Experiment using only the sample of observations that are EITC eligible in each year. Similar to
Figure 2 for the glitch analysis, Figures 4A-D plot the time series of EITC eligibility and the
probability of being sent a notice for the 2009 experiment sample. By construction, all
individuals in the sample were eligible and received a notice in 2009. Consistent with the random
assignment in the experiment, Figures 4A and B demonstrate that the different treatment groups
all have essentially identical EITC eligibility histories and notice-receipt histories prior to 2009.
Furthermore, after 2009, the plots indicate nearly identical trends for the different treatment
groups, suggesting that the different notice treatments in 2009 did not differentially impact EITC
eligibility and notice receipt subsequently.



                                                                                                      18
2. California Experiment Estimation Results
The sample means suggest that the benefit notice had a relatively larger nudge effect, relative to
other notice messages. Figures 4E and F illustrate the main results for the 2009 California
Experiment analysis. The plots illustrate take-up rates based on claiming EITC benefits on tax
returns or through a notice in 2009 in each year for the different treatment groups. (Appendix
Figures 8 A & B illustrate the same plots based on claiming EITC benefits on tax returns or
through a notice in any year.) The plots show noticeable nudge effects in the notice year, but
after the notice year, the series all converge. This convergence suggests minimal differential
long-term learning effects from the different notices. Similar to the 2005 glitch analysis on the
effect of being sent a notice in a given year, the results for the 2009 California experiment
suggest that a simpler or more salient notice can have a more meaningful nudge effect than a
more complicated notice, but these effects appear to decline relatively quickly.


Table 5 shows the regression results for the California experiment, where the effects are relative
to being sent the standard (complex) notice a second time. While Table 5 focuses on EITC take-
up outcomes, Appendix Table 8 presents results using EITC amounts claimed as the dependent
variable. The results for both outcomes show similar patterns that confirm the graphical evidence
in Figures 5 E and F. The regression results for both returns without and with kids show that the
benefit salience treatment had the largest nudge effects, but the differential impacts of all of the
treatments in subsequent years are all statistically insignificant. Thus, the different notices appear
to have different nudge effects, but there are no differences in long-term learning effects. 22


IV. Conclusion
Incomplete take up of benefit programs among eligible individuals has meaningful welfare
effects in a variety of contexts, ranging from health insurance (Aizer 2007) to college financial
aid (Manoli and Turner 2014). In the case of the largest anti-poverty program in the U.S., the
Earned Income Tax Credit, we exploit a national level natural experiment and find evidence that
IRS notices informing taxpayers about their eligibility for the EITC have substantive effects on
take-up in the short-term. The empirical results suggest that IRS notices persuade as much as 80

22
   Appendix Table 9 presents the persuasion rates for the CA experiment. We do not focus on these results since the
post-2009 regression coefficients are not statistically different from zero, and hence the persuasion rates are also not
statistically different from zero.


                                                                                                                      19
percent of taxpayers who would not have otherwise claimed the credit to claim the credit in that
year. These effects attenuate rapidly and are meaningfully smaller and potentially economically
insignificant in the longer-term. The longer-term effects also suggest that repeated notices may
be more effective at increasing take-up each year, as opposed to one-time notices. We also find
evidence that clear messaging in the IRS notices can amplify the short-term nudge effects even
among a relatively more inert population using data from a randomized experiment in California.
Longer-term outcomes in this setting suggest relatively small and insignificant longer-term
effects, consistent with the national experiment.


While our findings suggest that relatively low-cost interventions can have meaningful welfare
effects, the relatively smaller longer-term learning effects also suggests that teaching individuals
about potential benefits is difficult. The interpretation that individuals do not have a full
understanding of the tax system, including potential benefits from refundable tax credits like the
EITC, is consistent with prior work (Chetty and Saez 2013; Chetty Looney and Kroft 2009;
Feldman, Katuscak and Kawano 2014). Determining how individuals learn about benefit
programs and the federal income tax code and designing experiments and interventions to test
these ideas remain important areas for future research.

             C. Returns without Kids, Single                      D. Returns with 1 Kid, Head-of-Household




Notes: This figure plots EITC take-up rates among taxpayers across potential benefit amounts (Panels A & B) and
earned income (Panels C & D). In all panels, the sample includes taxpayers who are eligible for the EITC. Panels A and
C include taxpayers without kids, and Panels B and D include taxpayers with one kid. The sample of EITC eligible
taxpayers include both taxpayers filing a tax return and claiming the EITC and taxpayers who were sent a notice after
failing to claim the EITC on their tax returns. The blue triangles depict claiming EITC benefits on the 1040, the red
circles depict claiming EITC in response to a reminder notice, and purple squares depict claiming EITC on either 1040
or in response to the reminder notice. In all panels data are from 2003, 2004, 2006 and 2007.

Notes: This figure plots the trends in the fraction of taxpayers eligible for EITC (Panels A and B), and who were sent
EITC notices (Panels C and D) for the 2005 Glitch Analysis Sample. Panels A and C include observations without kids,
and Panels B and D include observations with kids. The treatment group includes taxpayers who were sent notices and
the control group includes computer-paper taxpayers who were not sent notices but who would have absent the glitch.

                 C. Returns without Kids                         D. Returns with Kids




Notes: This figure plots the trends of re-weighted take-up rates conditional on EITC eligibility for the treatment and
control groups. Panels A and B plot the take-up rates for taxpayers without and with kids respectively who claim the
credit on their tax return in 2001-04 and 2006-09 and for responding to the notice in 2005. Panels C and D plot the
total take-up rates, which includes both notice responses and tax return claiming, in all years. The treatment group
includes taxpayers who were sent notices and the control group includes computer-paper taxpayers who were not sent
notices but who would have absent the glitch. In all cases, the control group has a zero response in 2005 by
construction since individuals in the control group were not sent notices.

Notes: This figure plots the trends in the EITC eligibility (Panels A and B), probability of being sent a notice, conditional on
eligibility (Panels C and D), and EITC take-up, conditional on eligibility (Panels E and F) in 2009. Panels A, C and E include
observations without kids, and Panels B, D and F include observations with kids. Each plot includes different trend lines for each
kind of treatment – simple, social, benefit, time and complex.

Notes: This table shows the regression estimates for claiming EITC on tax return or responding to the 2009 notice, being sent an IRS notice, and claiming EITC on a tax return
or in response to an IRS notice in any year for the 2009 CA Sample. The first three columns present the results for the full sample of taxpayers without kids and the last three
columns present the results for the sample of taxpayers with kids. Standard errors are clustered based on treatment status, 2009 AGI deciles, and year and reported in
brackets.

Appendix A. Weighting Method
Using 𝑋𝑖 to denote a vector of covariates from individual i’s 2005 tax return, we estimate the
probability that individual i is in the treatment group given observables 𝑋𝑖 using a probit
specification,
                                𝑝𝑖 = 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃(𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖 = 1) = 𝛷(𝛽𝑋𝑖 )
where 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖 is an indicator equal to one if individual i is in the treatment group and zero

Intuitively, the weights are constructed so that observations in the control group that have
observables similar to observations in the treatment group are “up-weighted,” and observations
in the treatment group that have observables similar to observations in the control group are
“down-weighted.”

Appendix B: Persuasion Rates
Following DellaVigna and Gentzkow (2010), we calculate persuasion rates, defined as:
                                            𝑦𝑡𝑇 − 𝑦𝑡𝐶      1
                               𝑓𝑡 = 100% ∗ � 𝑇        �∗�        �
                                            𝑒 −𝑒   𝐶     1 − 𝑦𝑡0


where T denotes the treatment group, C the control group, t tax years, e the treatment rate, and y
the response rate where 𝑦𝑡0 captures the baseline response rate. We define 𝑒 𝑇 − 𝑒 𝐶 as 0.85.
Guyton, Manoli, Schafer and Sebastiani (2015) present an analysis of a field experiment in
which the IRS mailed postcards and information flyers to low-income, potentially EITC-eligible
nonfilers. They report that 73 percent of intended recipients received their mailings. Because
address information for filers may be more accurate than address information for nonfilers, we
assume that 85 percent of notices sent to taxpayers would reach the intended recipients. To
define the baseline take-up, we define 𝑦𝑡0 as the sum of the constant and the year effect in the
notice year and as the sum of the constant the year effect and the treatment effect in other years.
In the notice year the response should not differ by treatment status and the sum of the constant
and the year term should be zero. Instead of mechanically setting this difference to zero, we rely
on the coefficients from the regression specification in order to keep the approach similar to the
approach applied to other years and as a check that these terms sum to zero as expected. In other
years, the combination of the constant, the treatment indicator and the year indicator give us an
estimate of what take-up would have been in that year for the treatment group, absent the
intervention. We define the difference in response 𝑦𝑡𝑇 − 𝑦𝑡𝐶 using the regression results, using the
key differential effect in each year. For the notice year, this effect is relative to EITC claiming in
response to the notice, but in other years we include the differential effect of claiming on the tax
return. We use this approach so the persuasion rates measure the effectiveness of the notices on
teaching taxpayers to claim the EITC on their return in following years.


Using the notation of the regression specification for the glitch analysis given in the main text,
the persuasion rates for the glitch analysis are calculated as
                                          𝛽3𝑡          1
                          𝑓𝑡 = 100 ∗ �        ��                 �
                                          0.85 1 − 𝛽0 − 𝛽1 − 𝛽2𝑡



                                                                                                     26
Using the notation of the regression specification for the CA experiment analysis given in the
main text, the persuasion rates for the CA experiment analysis are calculated as
                                         𝛽3𝑡,𝑘         1
                           𝑓𝑡,𝑘 = 100 ∗ �      ��                  �
                                          0.85 1 − 𝛽0 − 𝛽1,𝑘 − 𝛽2𝑡
where the subscript k refers to the treatment group (simple, benefit, social or time).


Standard errors for the persuasion rates are computed using the standard errors of the estimated
regression coefficients and the delta method.

Appendix C. Audit Analysis


To examine a potentially more aggressive informational intervention than the notification letters,
the empirical analysis below considers individuals who were audited in tax years 2006, 2007,
2008 or 2009. 23 Audit data is available for tax years 2006 through 2009 from the IRS National
Research Program (NRP) database. 24 In these data, there are 100 taxpayers who meet our criteria
of: filing a tax return in the audit year and not claiming an EITC; ruled eligible for the EITC
following the audit; received the EITC as a result of the audit. The IRS selects tax returns for
audit review quasi-randomly. It is not possible for us to explain the audit selection criteria; the
specific details of the audit selection are not made publicly available by the IRS so that taxpayers
cannot figure out how to evade audit selection. Because audit reviews can involve significant
time with an IRS auditing agent and tax preparer, as well as significant time spent reviewing
financial records and tax rules, the audit may represent a more aggressive informational
intervention that teaches taxpayers more about the EITC than notification letters. Summary
statistics are below.




23
   We restrict the sample to audits in these years only since consistent audit data is only available for these years.
Data from earlier years is not comparable to data on from these years, and in some cases, not digitized. Audit data is
made available internally 4 years after a given tax year. More recent audits may be ongoing.

Empirical Analysis: Audit Event Study
For taxpayers in our audit sample, we create a panel dataset based on 2001 through 2013. We
then implement an event study research design to examine behavior before and after the audit.
Specifically, we define event time as year since the audit, evtime=year-audit_year, and we
estimate the following specification,
                          2013                             5
               𝑦𝑖𝑖 = �           𝛽𝑘 1(𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑡 = 𝑘) + �           𝛿𝑘 1(𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑡 = 𝑘) + 𝜀𝑖𝑖
                          𝑘=2001                           𝑘=−5

where yit denotes claiming EITC benefits at time t for individual i. We also pool pre- and post-
audit years and estimate the following specification,
                   2013
         𝑦𝑖𝑖 = �           𝛽𝑘 1(𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑡 = 𝑘) + 𝛿 𝑝𝑝𝑝 1(𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑡 < 0) + 𝛿 0 1(𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑡 = 0)
                   𝑘=2001

                          + 𝛿 1 1(𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑡 = 1) + 𝛿 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 1(𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑡 > 1) + 𝜀𝑖𝑖 .
With this specification, we can test compare δ1 and δpost to δpre to test if there are short-term and
long-term effects following the audit.


The figure below presents the average fraction of individuals in the audit sample who claim
EITC benefits by event time. Prior to the audit year, the average fraction of taxpayers claiming
EITC benefits is roughly 0.33. In the year of the audit, the fraction of individuals who claim
EITC benefits on the initially filed tax returns and the fraction of individuals who ultimately
received EITC benefits following the audit are 0 and 1 respectively because of how the sample is
defined. Following the audit, the fractions of individuals receiving EITC benefits does not appear
to be significantly higher than the pre-audit fractions.




                                                                                                    30
Fraction claiming EITC




                                     Event time (years since audit)
                         Notes: This figure plots the probability of claiming EITC
                         benefits by years relative to the year of audit. The sample is
                         restricted to individuals who did not claim the EITC in the
                         audit year but were then found to be eligible for EITC benefits
                         after the audit was complete. Thus, pre-audit, the Fraction
                         Claiming EITC is 0, and post-audit, the Fraction Claiming
                         EITC is 1. The sample is taken from audits in Tax Years 2006
                         to 2009, and data from tax years 2001 through 2013 are pulled
                         for all individuals in the sample.

2005 and 2009, by filing status. The solid lines depict single filing status and the dashed lines depict the married
filing joint status. For simplicity, these figures show the statutory EITC schedules by earned income. In practice, the
EITC is a function of both earnings and adjusted gross income.

Notes: This figure presents trends in earnings and the likelihood of having kids for the treatment and control groups
separately for the 2005 Analysis Sample. The plots are based on the sample of EITC-eligible taxpayers in each year.
The treatment group includes taxpayers who were sent notices in 2005 and the control group includes taxpayers who
were not sent notices in 2005 but who would have been sent notices absent the glitch. In Panels A and B, earnings
refers to the sum of wages reported on Form 1040 and schedule C self-employment income. In Panel C and D, the
presence of kids on a tax return is measured based on the claiming of dependent exemptions.

                 C. Returns without Kids                         D. Returns with Kids




Notes: This figure plots the trends of unweighted take-up rates conditional on EITC eligibility for the treatment and
control groups. Panels A and B plot the take-up rates for taxpayers without and with kids respectively who claim the
credit on their tax return in 2001-04 and 2006-09 and for responding to the notice in 2005. Panels C and D plot the
total take-up rates, which includes both notice responses and tax return claiming, in all years. The treatment group
includes taxpayers who were sent notices and the control group includes computer-paper taxpayers who were not sent
notices but who would have absent the glitch. In all cases, the control group has a zero response in 2005 by
construction since individuals in the control group were not sent notices.

            A. Sample Without Kids in 2009                            B. Sample With Kids in 2009




Notes: These figures plot EITC take-up rates based on claiming EITC benefits on tax returns or through a notice in any
year for sample without kids, and with kids, respectively. Each plot includes different trend lines for each kind of
treatment – simple, social, benefit, time and complex.

without kids and the last three columns present the results for the sample of taxpayers with kids. Standard errors are clustered based on treatment
status, 2005 AGI deciles, and year and reported in brackets.
