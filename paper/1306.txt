                Monetarist Monetary Policy, Exchange Risk,
                    and Exchange Rate Variability

                                   ABSTRACT




This paper investigates the relationship between the new monetary control

procedures, implemented by the Federal Reserve Board in October l979, and

the subsequent increase in exchange rate variability for the United States.

It shows that, in the context of a stochastic, rational expectations model,

exchan.ge rate variability minimizing monetary policy is identical to the

policy which, in a deterministic, perfect foresight model, would place the

economy on the borderline between exchange rate overshooting and undershoot—

ing. The model is estimated for the United States since generalized

floating began in 1973. The new monetary control procedures have had two

opposite effects. Monetary policy has become less acconodative, increasing

exchange rate variability through overshooting. On the other hand,

systematic deviations from uncovered interest rate parity, which can be

attributed to exchange risk, have also increased. These increase exchange

rate variability through undershooting. It is shown that the latter dominate

the   former, providing an explanation of increased exchange rate variability
consistent with undershooting, not with overshooting.

I. Introduction

     The new monetary control procedures, implemented by the Federal

Reserve Board in October 1979, have been the subject of extensive

scrutiny. One major item of interest has been the impact of these

procedures on financial markets in general and, in particular, on the

foreign exchange market. A focus of this interest has been on exchange

rate variability which, like the variability of other financial assets,

has increased substantially since 19791.

     This paper considers the relationship between the conduct of

monetary policy and the variability of exchange rates2. It shows

that, in the context of a stochastic, rational expectations model,

exchange rate variability minimizing monetary policy is identical to the

policy which, in a deterministic, perfect foresight model, would place

the economy on the borderline between exchange rate overshooting and

undershooting. Policy which would cause either overshooting or

undershooting would increase variability.

     In this context, the change in the conduct of monetary policy in

the United States can be expected to have two opposite effects.

Monetary policy which is less acconinodative of prices and/or interest

rates, "monetarist" monetary policy, can affect exchange rate

variability through overshooting. On the other hand, the change in the

conduct of monetary policy was accompanied by a good deal of uncertainty

regarding the exact nature of the new policy. It is shown below how

this increase in uncertainty, or increase in exchange risk, will

increase deviations from uncovered interest rate parity in a predictable

manner. These deviations, in turn, can affect exchange rate variability

through undershooting.



                                1
     Using constrained maximum likelihood methods, the model is

estimated for the United States since generalized floating began in

1973. The estimation procedures incorporate both the rational

expectations restrictions and the policy rules. Over the period 1973—79,

the dollar experienced slight undershooting. Over the full period,

1973-82, the effects of less accommodative monetary policy were

overwhelmed by those of the increase in exchange risk, causing exchange

rate undershooting. The explanation of increased exchange rate variability

as being caused by undershooting, as opposed to overshooting: is

confirmed by estimating a less constrained version of the model within

which the undershooting hypothesis can be directly tested.

     The model is presented in Section II. In Section III, it is shown

how variable output, risk aversion, and accommodative monetary policy

affect exchange rate variability. The model is estimated in Section IV

and conclusions are presented in Section V.

II. The Model

     The model is based on Dornbusch (1976), although it extends his

work in a number of directions. It is a two-country model,

incorporating variable output, deviations from uncovered interest rate

parity, and both domestic and foreign money supply reaction functions.

The two country specification, rather than a single, small country

specification, was chosen to avoid making exogeneity assumptions

regarding foreign prices and interest rates which cannot be supported

empirically and to allow for the foreign money supply, as well as the

domestic money supply, to be determined endogenously. This is shown

below to be quite important, both theoretically and empirically, in

determining the magnitude of exchange rate variability. In order to

provide clear theoretical results that could be tested empirically, a

number of simplifying assumptions were made so that the model could be

solved analytically. The model consists 0f the following equations:

because, in long run equilibrium, there can be no depreciation or

subtracting (3b) from (3a), we obtain equation(3), where a5

Note that both domestic and foreign prices are pre-determined.5

     If capital were perfectly mobile and economic agents risk neutral,

uncovered interest rate parity would require that the interest rate

differential       equal the expected rate of depreciation.
               -       = et+i - et
Recent empirical work by Cumby and Obstfeld (1983) and Hansen and
Hodrick (1983) provides evidence that this relationship does not hold
for most bilateral exchange rates, even when there do not appear to be
constraints on the mobility of capital between the countries involved.
In particular, the evidence suggests that risk premia are significant
and vary over time. For the United States' effective                 exchange rate, an

additional   consideration is that, while capital may be perfectly mobile
with regard to the U.S., the weighted average of countries that
comprises the foreign "country" includes some, such as Japan, that
clearly restricted capital flows over at least part of the sample period.

     Much    of the theoretical work on the determinants of the risk
premium involves considerations of portfolio balance, such as relative
supplies   of wealth, that are beyond the scope of this paper. Instead,

we use some of the concepts in Dornbusch's (1983) mean-variance model of

international portfolio choice to relate deviations from uncovered

interest rate parity to deviations from purchasing power parity.

        We begin by formaliziRg the relationship between real interest

 rates in the two countries and the structure of expected real asset

 returns faced by investors in either country. By the Fisher relation

 with pre-determined prices, either country's real interest rate equals

 its nominal interest rate minus its expected, (equal to actual), rate of

 inflation,6

 implying the following real interest rate differential:

Assuming that covered interest parity, where the (nominal) interest

rate differential equals the forward premium, holds at all times

produces the following expression for the real interest rate

differential,

(4b)        r -
             t        r*t   =   f-e t       t

                                                                       -
where      is the one period forward exchange rate. For the moment,

assume that capital is perfectly mobile, so that risk neutrality implies

uncovered interest rate parity. In that case, (which we do not

generally assume to hold), the real interest rate differential equals the

expected real rate of depreciation,

(4c)        r -             = (et+1         -
                                                    et)

       From the perspective of a domestic investor, the real return on a

domestic asset (Rt) is just the domestic real interest rate. His or

her expected real return, (in terms of purchasing power over domestic

goods), on a foreign asset (R) is the foreign interest rate plus the

expected rate of depreciation minus the domestic inflation rate,

            t = .*t +t+l
                      (  t'\ ('t+l vt''                                     —




                                                                  7
which is not the foreign real interest rate. The domestic investor's

real return differential is

           Rt .R*=i
               t  t
                    _j*(e
                     t  t+l
                            -e)
                              t

Adding and subtracting the inflation differential, we obtain the

relation between the real return differential and the real interest rate

differential,

(4d)       Rt R =             (rt     r*t) -    ((et+i
                                                         -
                                                             et)
Under uncovered interest rate parity, since the real interest rate

differential equals the expected real rate of depreciation, real returns

are equalized,

(4e)       Rt -           = 0.

Under covered interest rate parity, substituting (4b) into (4d) produces

the result that the real return differential equals the risk premium,

(4f)                      =
           Rt
The choices faced by a foreign investor can be similarly described. The

foreign investor's real return on a foreign asset (F*) is the foreign

real interest rate, His or her real return on a domestic asset (F) is

the domestic interest rate minus the expected rate of depreciation minus

the foreign inflation rate. The foreign investors real return

differential is the same as that faced by the domestic investor,

            t   -   F*t   =   it      i*
                                       t
                                           (e
                                                t+l
                                                      e )
                                                         t'
The assumption of long run purchasing power parity in a linear, rational

expectations model ensures that an overvalued exchange rate (et >

implies   expected real appreciation while an undervalued rate (et <

implies   expected real depreciation. This can be seen by considering

all possible monotonic adjustment paths toward the steady state

( = ) equilibrium.                 It should be noted that this statement contains




                                                8
no implications about the expected (or actual) movement of the nominal

exchange rate.

       Consider the case where                 e >                  With risk neutrality, real

returns are equalized. Since there is expected real appreciation,

equation (4d) requires that the real interest rate differential be

negative, i.e., that             >
                                      r.            Now consider risk aversion. Since

nominal interest rates are known and price levels are pre-deterniined,

the only source of risk is exchange rate risk. From the perspective of

a domestic investor, since foreign assets are riskier, the real return

on foreign assets must exceed the real return on domestic assets

(R >   R)   to induce investment in foreign assets. From the

perspective of a foreign investor, domestic assets are riskier, and it is

necessary for Ft > F to induce investment in them.                                 These two

conditions cannot occur simultaneously. With the world consisting of

two countries, if one is a net lender the other must be a net borrower.

Assuming that the real interest rate is the marginal product of capital,

and assuming away all other considerations, such as differences in

tastes, size, wealth, liquidity characteristics, and risk aversion, that

could influence borrowing and lending, the country with the higher real

rate of interest will borrow and the other will lend. In this case,

To produce equation (4), a stochastic disturbance term is added to (4g)

to capture factors that may cause deviations from uncovered interest

rate parity but are not included in the model.

       Now consider the case where e <                      implying expected real

depreciation. With risk neutrality, real return equalization (in 4d)

requires that r > rt. This implies that the domestic country will

borrow abroad and, with risk aversion, that Ft > Ft to induce foreign

investors to invest in the domestic asset. Since Ft —                         =
                                                                         Ft       Rt

which is both equations (4g) and (4).

       Equation (4) relates deviations form uncovered interest rate parity

to deviations from purchasing power parity in a systematic manner. The

parameter a7 represents both the degree of risk aversion on the part

of investors and the degree of risk in the market. With risk

neutrality, a7 =   0.   The more risk averse are investors, the larger is

a7. If there is no exchange risk, a7              =    0.     The greater the exchange

risk, the larger is a7.

       The equation was derived, using risk aversion, assuming perfect

capital mobility. An identical equation is derived, using a flow

capital mobility specification, in Frenkel and Rodriguez (1982) and

Papell (1983). In those models, the current account balance is

postulated to depend on relative prices and the (flow) capital account

to depend on the expectations adjusted interest rate differential.

Using the constraint that, in the absence of central bank intervention,

the current and capital accounts sum to zero, equation (4) is derived,




                                        10
  The parameter a7 represents the degree of capital mobility, with

 a7 = 0 being perfect mobility.

      While these models are observationally equivalent from
                                                               any single
 country at a point in time, they have the potential to be differentiated

 either by estimating a cross-section of countries or by estimating one

 country over different tine periods. In this case, the hypothesis to be

 tested is that the change in the Fed's operating procedure increased

 uncertainty in financial markets, including the market for foreign

 exchange. This increase in foreign exchange risk increased the required

 expected real return differential for investing abroad, which would

 increase a7. The alternative explanation for a rise in a7, a

 decrease in the mobility of capital since 1979, does not seem tenable.

 Thus testing the model over these two periods for the United States

provides the potential for differentiating between them.

      The money supply for each country depends on the exchange rate, the

difference between domestic and foreign prices, and the nominal interest

rate differential. Monetery policy for either country is accommodative

if that country's money supply increases when its exchange rate

depreciates, when the difference between its prices and the other

country's prices increases and/or when its nominal interest rate

differential increases. Thus positive coefficients for         a13 are
                                                         a3
accommodative, negative coefficients are offsetting. The money supply

is constrained to respond to the price ratio, rather than to the levels

separately, because, in the reduced form of the model, prices appear

only in ratio form. While allowing the money supplies to respond

separately to domestic and foreign price levels would be desirable, it

would make the model analytically intractible. A number of analysts



                                  11
have proposed that the money supply be decreased when the rei exchange

rate depreciates and increased when it appreciates. This would involve

offsetting the exchange rate and acconiiiodating the price ratio so that

a8 =    - a and a11 =   - a12.   The money supply rule for each

country also includes an exogenous term and a stochastic disturbance

term.

III. Exchange Rate Variability

        In this section, we solve the model and show how variable output,

risk aversion7, and accommodative monetary policy affect exchange rate

variability.         We then describe the relationship between variability and

the concepts of overshooting and undershooting.

        Before solving the model, it is useful to simplify the price

adjustment, output, and money supply equations. Substituting (4a) and

(4) into (3), and collecting terms, we obtain,

                                                     -

Finally, substituting (4) into (5) and (6), we obtain,

It can be seen from (9) that the degree of a risk aversion affects the

use of interest rate targets for the conduct of monetary policy. If the

money supply accommodates the interest rate differential, (a10, a13 >                                                                 0),
then monetary policy becomes more offsetting towards the exchange rate

but more accommodative towards prices. The magnitude of these effects

depends on the degree of risk aversion. If investors were risk neutral

(a7 =   0),   interest rate targeting would not affect the degree of

accommodation.

       Substituting (4), (8), and (9) into (1), and interpreting all

variables as deviations from their steady state equilibrium values, we

We solve the model by using the method of undetermined coefficients.

Assuming that expectations are determined rationally and that e and

where the different representations for e and                         reflect the

assumption that prices are pre-deterrnined. Solution of the model

requires substituting (11) into (10) and solving the resultant set of

identities. As is usual in rational expectations models with

expectations of future values of variables, the solution is not unique

without the usual assumption that the conditionally expected exchange

rate and price paths are stable. In addition, we need to assume that

the money supply either offsets or is not too accommodative of exchange

rate movements, so that        > 1, in order to guarantee that the

stability assumption will produce a unique solution. Assuming that the

and the asymptotic variance minimized, if B1 =                        0.10 This can only
occur if 2 = 0.           The sign of 2 is determined by the income (a1)

elasticity and the interest rate (a2) semi—elasticity of the demand

for money, the elasticity of the demand for output with respect to the

real exchange rate (d3), the degree of risk aversion on the part of

investors (a7), and the degree of accommodation of domestic (c2)

and foreign (c4) money supplies to price movements. It should be

stressed that output variability, risk aversion, and accommodative

monetary policy all decrease 62.



                                                    15
     The intuition behind these results is provided by examining the

relationship between exchange rate variability and overshooting. In

response to a permanent, unanticipated increase in (for example) the

money supply, which causes a proportionate long run depreciation of the

exchange rate, overshooting occurs if the exchange rate first

depreciates by more than its long run value, and then appreciates over

time back to the steady state. Undershooting occurs if the exchange

rate first depreciates by less than its long run value, and then

continues to depreciate until the steady state is attained. In Papeil

(1983b), it is shown that in the perfect foresight version of the flow

capital mobility version of this model, 62 = 0 is the borderline case

between overshooting and undershooting. Overshooting occurs when

62 > 0, undershooting when 62 < 0.     It is important to remember that,

at any instant of time, prices are pre-determined while the exchange

rate is free to jump. When 62 =   0,   the exchange rate immediately

jumps to its new long run equilibrium value. This corresponds, in the

present stochastic context, to zero conditional and minimum asymptotic

exchange rate variability.

     The overshooting hypothesis was motivated as an explanation for

high exchange rate variability. Our results show that there is not a

one—to-one relation between variability and overshooting. High exchange

rate variability can be produced by undershooting as well as

overshooting. Furthermore, changes in the structural and policy

parameter which decrease ó2 (and hence reduce overshooting), only

will be certain to decrease variability if the country begins at a

position of overshooting and does not move into undershooting.

Otherwise, variability may actually be increased. For example, consider



                               16
a country that is characterized by overshooting. By making monetary

policy more accommodative of prices, (either directly or through

accommodating interest rates), exchange rate variability can be reduced.

If monetary policy becomes too accommodative, undershooting will result

and variability increased.

IV. Empirical      Results

       We now examine the effects of the changes in the conduct of

monetary policy in the United States since October 1979.           In order to

accomplish this, using quarterly data, we estimate the model separately

for the periods 1973 (II) — 1979 (III) and 1973 (II) — 1982 (III), and

then compare the results. The model is estimated by constrained maximum

likelihood techniques, with the constraints on the parameters caused by

the form of the structural equations, assumption of rational

expectations, and the stability condition necessary to achieve a unique

solution. The structural (a1 - a7) and policy (a8           a13)

coefficients are jointly estimated. Combined with the imposition of

rational expectations, this satisfies several aspects of Lucas (1976)

critique of econometric policy evaluation.

       Estimation of the model first requires deriving the reduced form.

Substituting the expression for e from (10) into (4), (8), and

(9) and taking variables as deviations from their steady state values,

we obtain:

(13)         i i =       (   - 1

                             -
                                     a7)et + 2 + a7)q +
                                                       + 2d4)q + U
(14)               4 = (d3       d4(1    l))et - (d3

(15)         m a8e + a9q           + a10(it i) + u5.
              *                              !
(16)                 a11e a12q — a13i            1' U6.
where the    u's   are combinations of Ult, u2., and the c's.

       it is necessary to make some assumptions about the structure of the

error terms. We assume that they are generated by first order

autoregressive processes, i.e.,
                                             =         + jt' j =   1,...,6,
where the tb's are serially uricorrelated. We then take the infinite

moving average representation implicit in the above autoregressive



                                        18
 process and truncate it at third order for u1 and fourth order for the

 others. This produces a first order autoregressive fourth order moving

 average model. Assuming that expectations are determined rationally and

 solving by the method of undetermined coefficients, the reduced form of

 (10) is derived,


 (17)
               et                 et1                   v1
                        =A                  +B(L)

               zt                 zt_l                  v2t
where z. =
              +l    and A and B are 2 x 2   matrices.    The elements of A and B

are non—linear combinations of the S's, y's, and ct's. The v's are

combinations of the f's, written so as to make the zero lag coefficient

matrix the identity matrix.11 The model to be estimated consists of

equations (13) -     (17).   Maximum likelihood estimates (conditional on the

initial disturbances being set equal to zero) are obtained under the

assumption that (v1 v2. u3. u4 u u6t)' is multivariate normal. The
Davidon-Fletcher-powell algorithm is used to find the optimum.

        As described above, the model is estimated for the United States,

beginning with the advent of generalized floating in 1973 (II) and

ending either in 1979 (III), before the change in the Fed's operating

procedure, or in 1982(111). While it would have been preferable to

estimate the model over non-overlapping sub—periods, this was precluded

by the limited number of quarterly observations since 1979. We

considered using monthly data, but it did not seem sensible to estimate

monthly money demand, output demand, and money supply equations without

incorporating lags. Unfortunately, incorporating lags was precluded by

our desire to keep the model analytically representable. Our results

should therefore be interpreted with caution, remembering that, if the

data were available, the model would be estimated separately for the

period since 1979 (III).

                                    19
     We use the effective exchange rate (MERM) calculated by the

International Monetary Fund. Real GNP (or GDP) is used to measure

output, MI for the money supply, the GNP deflator for the price level,

and representative three month money market rates for the interest rate.

The foreign variables were constructed by taking weighted averages, with

the weights taken from those used to construct the MERM rates. In order

to achieve stationarity, all variables, after taking logarithms (except

for the interest rate), were detrended by regression on a constant and a

linear time trend.1

     We use a two-step method of estimation. First, we estimate the

money market equilibrium equation (I) by a single equation method, and

then use the estimates from the regression as constants for the

constrained maximum likelihood estimates13. •There are several

advantages to this procedure, First, it enables us to get estimates of

the income elasticity and the interest rate semi-elasticity of the

demand for money directly from data on income and interest rates.

Second, the unstable nature of money demand estimates during the 1970's

raises the possibility that these parameters are inconsistently

estimated. In that case, estimating them by maximum likelihood would

spread inconsistency throughout the model. Finally, it reduces the

number of parameters to be estimated by maximum likelihood. The

disadvantages of the procedure are twofold. First, if the inconsistency

in the money demand estimates is caused by the use of single equation

methods this may introduce inconsistency into the model. Second,

because for the maximum likelihood procedure it is assumed that a1 and

a2 are estimated without error, the standard errors of the other

variables will be biased downward.'4



                              20
        The maximum likelihood estimates of the structural (a3 —    a7),
policy (a8 - a13) and, serial correlation (a1 - a6) parameters are given

in   Table 1 along with their asymptotic      at-ratios", the ratio of the
coefficients to their standard errors computed from the inverse of the
second derivative matrix of the likelihood function. Single equation
estimates     for a1 and a2, as well as parameter values for the reduced

form coefficients implied by the estimates, are also presented.

        The central result of the estimates is that 62 is close to zero

(-   .09) during 1973-79 and negative (-2.58) during 1973-82, indicating
that    the observed increase in exchange rate variability was caused, not
by overshooting, but by undershooting. The principal reason for this
was the dramatic change in the risk parameter (a7), which increased
from    .56   to 3.17, With the decrease in the interest rate
semi-elasticity        of the demand for money being comparatively small,

a2a7 increased from .39 to 1.90, causing much of the decline in

62. By way of illustration, if a7 stayed at .57 while all the other

parameters     took on their 1973—82 estimates, the value of 62 would       be

.07.    Another important determinant in the change in 62 is the decrease
in the real interest rate semi-elasticity of output demand (a4), which
by causing d4 to decrease, increases 62 (in absolute value) by
decreasing its denominator. With 62 close to zero, (as in the 1973-79

estimates) B1 will be close to zero whatever the values of i (the

stable root) and 61. With 62 not close to zero, (as in 1973—82),

the values of          and    matter. Changes in      between the two

periods were small. The value of 61 increased during 1973—82, making

(A1 -           less   negative. This affect, however, was swamped by the

increase (in absolute value) of 62, causing B1 to increase from

.08 to .71 between the periods.

                                       21
       We now examine the changes in the money supply reaction functions.

For the United States, looking directly at the structural parameter, the

money supply because more accommodative of prices, (a9 increased from

1,43 to 1.79), but more offsetting of interest rates, (a10 decreases

from -.94 to -1.14). However, when one includes the offsetting of

prices implicit in offsetting interest rates with a positive risk

parameter, (c2      a9 +   a7a10), domestic monetary policy (c,j switched
from being quite accommodative (.90) to very offsetting (-1.82). With

foreign monetary policy, in contrast, the direct and combination results

coincide. There is a decrease in the amount that foreign monetary

policy offsets prices, (a12 changes from -1.19 to —.81), and a switch

from offsetting to accommodating interest rates, (a13 increases from

—.61 to .19). Including the impact of the risk parameter, foreign

monetary policy becomes less offsetting of prices; c4 increases from

-1.56 to -.21. The switch from accommodative to offsetting monetary

policy in the United States dominates the decrease in offsetting abroad;

   +        decreases from -.66 to -2.03. Taken in isolation, this would
       c4
have caused exchange rate overshooting. The increase in the risk

parameter, however, dominates the increase in offsetting monetary policy

to cause undershooting.

       Since 2 is not estimated directly, but is implied by the values

of the estimated coefficients, it is legitimate to ask how significant

is the undershooting result for the 1973—82 estimates. In order to

answer that question, a semi-constrained° version of the model was

estimated. In this version,          and 62 are estimated directly,

rather than being implied by the structural and policy coefficients. All

of the other coefficients of the model are estimated as in the

constrained version above, This enables us to test for undershooting

                                     22
directly by examining the sign and significance level of 66. The

results of this procedure support the results found above, with

62 =   -.26   (-.36) for 1973-82 and -2.18 (-2.65) for 1973-82, (asymptotic

"t—ratios" are in parentheses). This indicates not only that the

undershooting result is not simply a construct of the structural and

policy parameters but also that it is significant'5.

       Another possibility which we consider is that the deviations form

uncovered interest rate parity in the 1973-82 estimates were caused by

the imposition of credit controls in 1980. Interest rates in the United

States, (and the interest rate differential), were very high in 1980 (I).

With the credit controls, they fell dramatically in 1980 (II) and (III),

but returned to almost their original levels in 1980 (IV). In order to

test whether the increase in the estimated value of a7 was caused by the

controls, we replaced the actual values of the interest rate

differential in 1980 (II) and (III) with values that were calculated by

taking the figure for 1980 (I) and (IV) and interpolating. We then

estimated the model for 1973-82, and found that a7 was 2.76 (2.61).

This indicates that most of the increase in a7 was not caused by the

imposition of credit controls. Using the same data, we estimated the

semi—constrained version of the model, and found that 62 equaled —2.44

(-9.54). Thus the undershooting results are not affected by correcting

for credit controls.

       We have characterized the changes in exchange rate variability

strictly in terms of changes in B1 which, while appropriate for

conditional variability, is not necessarily appropriate for asymptotic

variability. In order to consider asymptotic variability, we have to

examine the parameters of the price adjustment equation (y and



                                   23
Note that both parameters change very little over the periods and that

   is quite small (.04), indicating that we can approximately

characterize asymptotic variability in terms of      and      Thus the

above analysis of conditional variability also applies to asymptotic

variability.

     We conclude by evaluating the success of the estimates. The

positive result is that the individual parameter estimates are very

successful. All of the estimates, (except for the relative price

elasticity of output demand), are of the "correct sign. For 1973-82,

most of the parameters are significant; for 1973—79, the results are

mixed. It is especially noteworthy that the risk parameter, upon which

much of the analysis rests, is small and insignificant for 1973—79 and

large and significant for 1973—82. In addition, the correlations

between the actual and predicted values of the variable are fairly

high.16 The negative result is provided by the likelihood ratio test.

Comparing the constrained version of the model to an I!unconstraifledtl

version, which imposes the same policy equations (15-16) and serial

correlation structure as the constrained version described above, but

does not impose the forms of the structural equations or the rational

expectations restrictions, we can reject the constrained model at

standard significance levels for both periods17. This accords with

the results of previous work involving the United States since 1973,

including Driskill and Scheffrin (1981), Glaessner (1982), and Papell

(1983b)18.

V. Conclusion

     In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the changes

in the conduct of monetary policy in the United States following the new

monetary control procedures in October 1979 and the increase in exchange

rate variability experienced since then. We find two major effects,

although the estimation procedures necessatated by the small number of

observations since 1979 suggest that our results be interpreted with

caution. American monetary policy has become substantially less

accommodative and there has been a significant increase in the risk

parameter measuring systematic deviations from uncovered interest rate

parity. Our estimation results indicate that the latter dominates the

former, providing an explanation of increased exchange rate variability

consistent with exchange rate undershooting. This is in contrast with

the generally accepted association between high variability and

overshooting.

    Levich (1981) and Truman and others (1981) provide evidence on the

    increase in exchange rate variability in the first year following

    the new monetary control procedures.

2   Truman (1981) and Black (1982) also consider this issue, but in the

    context of quite different models from this paper.

3   Deflating the money supply in each country by a price index

    composed of a weighted average of domestically produced goods and

    imports makes only a minor theoretical difference by introducing

    another possible channel for undershooting. Empirically, however,

    it is impossible to identify the weights in a two country model of

    this type. For the estimation, we use the GNP deflator as the

    price level. This incorporates the exchange rate and foreign price

    level into the domestic price level through imports of intermediate

    goods, but not through imports of consumer goods.

4   We have imposed the constraint that b3 =
                                               b4, which is necessary
    because the real interest rate enters equation (3) in difference

    form, on a6 but not on a5. If the constraint was applied

    consistently, equation (3) would read,

    (3')           -    = b3 a3(et -       - b3a4(r   -
                                                          r)   +
                                                                   c3t.


    When the model was estimated with this constraint, it was clearly

    rejected in favor of the model reported in the text. We felt that

    the misspecification from the unsupported constraint was worse than

    the inconsistency in the less constrained model.




                               29
&   Mussa (1981, 1982) argues that a superior formulation to Dornbush's

    price equation would have the rate of inflation equal the expected

    rate of change of the equilibrium price level, plus some proportion

    (<1) of the difference between the equilibrium and the actual price

    level. As emphasized both by Mussa and by Obstfeld and Rogoff

    (1983), Dornbusch's price equation is inappropriate either when

    disturbances become anticipated long before they occur or when the

    long run equilibrium of the economy moves over time. Neither

    situation is considered in this paper.

6   Dornbusch's price level was a weighted average of domestic and

    import price levels. This does not affect the results.

7   We use the term "risk aversion" in this section as a shorthand for

    saying "either an increase in the level of risk aversion or in the

    degree of exchange risk" repeatedly.

8   Serial correlation of the disturbances has only a minor effect on

    the theoretical results. We incorporate serially correlated

    disturbances in the empirical work.

9   Meese and Singleton (1980) use the variance of the first difference

    of the exchange rate. This concept is similar to ours given the

    different methods used to achieve stationarity. Frankel (1983) and

    Frenkel and Mussa (1980) use the conditional variance around the

    forward rate, while Flood (1981) uses the conditional variance

    around the expected spot rate. These measures are appropriate if

    it is desired to equate the concepts of risk and variability.

    Since we do not wish to make normative statements about

    variability, we have no need to equate these two concepts.

     the increases in B and          to decrease s. This is

     the only case where B1 = 0 does not minimize the asymptotic

     variance. The conditional variance is always minimized when

     B1 =   0.

11   We do not impose the cross error constraints between the v's and

     the u's. Otherwise, there would be contemporaneous correlation

     among the errors and the estimates would be inconsistent.

12   The interest rates used for the estimation were representative

     money market rates, taken from World Financial Markets. All other

     data were taken from International Financial Statistics. The real

     output, price level, and money supply data were seasonally

     adjusted. The countries (and weights) used for constructing the

     foreign variables were; Canada (.263), France (.131), Germany

     (.168),     Italy (.097), Japan (.275) and the United Kingdom (.066).

13   We used the ARI procedure of TSP, which provides efficient

     estimates of an equation whose disturbances display first order

     serial correlation.

14   We tested these conjectures by estimating all of the parameters of

     the model by maximum likelihood. The major problem was that the

     interest rate semi—elasticity of the demand for money was positive

     for both time periods. Rehm (1983) was able to get plausible

     maximum likelihood estimates for (in our notation) a1 and a2

     for the United States by incorporating lags in the money demand

     specification, an option precluded in this paper by the desire for

     an analytic solution. Using maximum likelihood estimates of a1



                                   31
     and a2 that appear to be clearly misspecified seemed to be a

     worse choice than adopting the technique used in the paper.

15   Since the parameters a1 and a2 enter the model only through the

     definitions of      and 62 in (10), and since 61 and 62 are

     not constrained in this version, the values of a1 and a2 are

     irrelevant. Thus the support for undershooting provided by

     estimating the semi-constrained version is not contingent on the

     questions involved in the estimation of the money demand

     parameters.

16   One disturbing aspect of the estimates is that              the serial
                                                          cii,

     correlation coefficient in the exchange rate equation, is greater

     than unity for 1973 (III) - 1982 (III). We experimented with both

     a second order autoregressive and third order moving average

     representation for u1, but the result did not change. We also

     attempted to estimate the model using first -differenced, rather

     than detrended, data but could not get the estimates to converge at

     an optimum.

17   The unconstrained log likelihood is 517.875 for 1973—79 and 679.176

     for 1973—82. There are 17 parameters in the constrained version;

     22 in the unconstrained version.

18   Driskill and Sheffrin (1981) and Papell (1983a) use maximum

     likelihood estimates and likelihood ratio tests. Glaessner (1982)

     uses generalized method of moments estimates and chi-squared test.
