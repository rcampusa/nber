                                         ABSTRACT

The consequences of poor financial capability at older ages are serious and include making
mistakes with credit, spending retirement assets too quickly, and being defrauded by financial
predators. Because older persons are at or past the peak of their wealth accumulation, they are
often the targets of fraud. Our project analyzes a module we developed and fielded in the 2016
Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Using this dataset, we evaluate the incidence and risk
factors for investment fraud, prize/lottery scams, and account misuse, using regression analysis.
Relatively few HRS respondents mentioned any single form of fraud over the prior five years, but
nearly 5% reported at least one form of investment fraud, 4 % recounted prize/lottery fraud, and
30% indicated that others had used/attempted to use their accounts without permission. There
were few risk factors consistently associated with such victimization in the older population.
Fraud is a complex phenomenon and no single factor uniquely predicts victimization. The
incidence of fraud could be reduced by educating consumers about various types of fraud and by
increasing awareness among financial service professionals.

                      Financial Fraud among Older Americans:
                             Evidence and Implications

       The greying of the U.S. population is ushering in a growing need for assistance with key

financial decisions. The consequences of poor financial literacy and capability at older ages are

serious (see Agarwal et al., 2009; Karp & Wilson, 2011; Lusardi, Mitchell & Curto, 2014),

particularly when people make mistakes with credit, draw down retirement assets too quickly, and

are deceived out of their savings by financial predators. Highlighting older persons’ vulnerability

to fraud, a FINRA Investor Education Foundation study (2013) found that more than 80% of adults

of all ages had been solicited for potentially fraudulent offers, but older Americans were

particularly likely to be targeted and lose money.

       Using an experimental module in the 2016 Health and Retirement Study (HRS) that we

designed, we evaluate older Americans’ exposure to three subtypes of financial fraud and explore

how financial literacy and self-rated financial knowledge relate to victimization, controlling for

cognitive performance, depression, and physical and functional health, measured prospectively.



Background

       Despite increasing media attention regarding the threat of consumer fraud targeting older

people, researchers have only made limited progress in identifying at-risk groups for tailored

prevention and intervention programs (Deevy, Lucich & Beals, 2012). One challenge has been

inconsistent findings regarding how age, socioeconomic status, financial sophistication, and other

factors relate to fraud susceptibility. For example, AARP (2011) found that lottery fraud and




                                                                                                 2
investment fraud victims differed across nearly all demographic and socioeconomic characteristics

including financial literacy scores.

        Given the variation in victim profiles, researchers should distinguish fraud types, yet the

HRS “Leave Behind” questionnaires asked respondents only one broad question without defining

fraud or specifying any particular scam type. The question asked was: “Have you been a victim of

fraud five years?” (yes/no). Between 5-6% indicated they were victims (DeLiema et al., 2017),

lower than in a national telephone survey conducted by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that

covered multiple fraud subtypes and found prior-year prevalence rates between 6.5%-14.3%

(Anderson, 2013). 1 A limitation of that survey, as true in most fraud victimization studies, is that

those data were cross-sectional. By contrast, the HRS data are collected every two years, allowing

researchers to analyze the health, social, and financial antecedents of fraud.

        To address limitations of prior studies, we consulted with fraud experts to design a module

in the 2016 HRS. This permitted us to evaluate the incidence and determinants of three different

fraud types relevant for the older population: investment fraud, prize/lottery fraud, and account

misuse. Moreover, we can examine the associations between risk of victimization and a large set

of factors.



Methods

        Our HRS module (see Online Appendix A) was administered to 1,268 randomly selected

survey participants age 50 and older in the 2016 survey wave. 2 In prior research, analysts framing

questions about fraud in a criminal context found that it significantly reduced disclosure among



1
  Past-year fraud prevalence was 14.3% among adults ages 45-54, 9.1% among adults ages 55-64, 7.3% among
adults ages 65-74, and 6.5% among adults ages 75 and older.

                                                                                                           3
women and older people (Beals et al., 2015). Therefore, unlike the HRS Leave Behind surveys

that asked respondents to identify themselves as fraud victims, our module queried about specific

types of financial decisions and experiences often equivalent to fraud (see also FINRA, 2013). For

example, investment fraud was measured using four items capturing risky investments and

solicitation methods—e.g., penny stocks, “free lunch” seminars, unknown callers—and one

general “catch-all” item that asked whether the respondent (or the respondent’s spouse/partner)

put money into any type of fraudulent investment in the past five years. Those who replied ‘yes’

to any of these five items were classified as investment fraud victims. Respondents who paid money

to someone in order to obtain supposed lottery winnings or a prize (e.g., money, free vacation,

product or service) were classified as prize/lottery fraud victims. Those who reported that someone

used or attempted to use their existing accounts (e.g., credit or debit cards, checking, savings,

telephone, online, or insurance accounts) were classified as victims or attempted victims of account

misuse.

          The HRS module also included the “Big Three” financial literacy questions from Lusardi

and Mitchell (2014) and respondents were scored based on their correct answers (range = 0-3).

Self-rated financial knowledge was reported on a scale of 1-7, with 7 being the most confident.

          We use Probit multivariate regression analysis to examine the potential risk factors for each

fraud subtype. The marginal effects reported in the table can be interpreted as the percentage

change in the outcome probability for a one-unit increase in the independent variable. Controls

include age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, number of children, cognition score

(TICS) 3, number of limitations in activities of daily living (ADL), depression symptoms (CES-D


3
  See Clair et al. (2011). The cognitive functioning measure includes performance on immediate and delayed word
recall, serial 7s test, counting backwards, naming tasks (e.g., date-naming), and vocabulary questions. The mental
status index sums scores from counting, naming, and vocabulary tasks. The total cognition score sums the total
recall and mental status indices. For further detail, see Fisher et al. (2017).

                                                                                                                     4
score), self-reported health status, and net housing 4 as well as non-housing net wealth 5 ($2014).

These data were collected as part of the 2010 core HRS survey wave (pre-fraud). (Additional

robustness analyses are provided in Online Appendix B.)



Results

Descriptive Statistics

        Table 1 reports descriptive statistics: on average, respondents scored 2.2 correct of 3

financial literacy questions. Mean self-rated financial knowledge was 5.0 of 7, indicating a fair

amount of self-confidence. Respondents’ average age was 68.2; 44.5% were male; 59.5% were

married or partnered; 82.2% were White; and 8.4% Hispanic. Average educational attainment was

13.3 years and the average number of children was 2.8. Mean non-housing net wealth was

$171,000 ($2014), and total net housing wealth $154,000 ($2014). Seventy-three percent reported

their physical health was good to excellent; few reported symptoms of depression (average was

1.2 out of 8); and the average cognition score was 23.7 of a possible 27 points.

        Table 2 presents fraud prevalence. Though each specific form of investment fraud is rare,

4.9% of the respondents indicated that they had made one fraudulent investment in the past five

years: 2.7% had invested after a “free meal” seminar, 0.9% had invested in response to a phone or

email solicitation from an unknown person, 1.0% invested in a penny stock or oil-and-gas deal,

and 1.0% purchased a fraudulent investment (“catch all” item). Only 0.4% reported having bought

what turned out to be a fraudulent investment based on a relative’s recommendation. 6




4
  Total net housing wealth included the net value of the household’s primary (and if relevant, secondary) residence.
5
  This included the value of stocks, mutual funds, investment trusts, checking, savings, money market accounts,
CDs, government savings bonds, and T-bills, bonds, and bond funds, and all other savings, minus all debt.
6
  Interestingly, few of the individual fraud indicators were highly correlated, suggesting that most respondents only
experienced one of the measured fraud subtypes in the past five years.

                                                                                                                   5
       Four percent of respondents reported prize/lottery fraud victimization in the past five years.

As many as 29.5% said that others had used or attempted to use one or more of the respondent’s

accounts without permission. We acknowledge that this question did not differentiate respondents

who were victims of account misuse from those who were targeted, but it is striking that 34.8% of

the overall sample reported having been subjected to some form of actual or attempted fraud in the

past five years. Accordingly, we argue that the extent of financial fraud experienced by the over-

50 population is non-negligible.

Factors Associated with Fraud Victimization

       Table 3 shows that other than depression, relatively few variables were consistently

statistically significant across fraud subtypes. Financial literacy is negatively associated with the

probability of investing with an unknown person, but positively related to investing based on a

free meal seminar. Those rating themselves as very financially knowledgeable were significantly

more likely to indicate that an account of theirs had been used (or attempted to have been used)

without permission.

       Greater levels of depression were associated with prize/lottery fraud, account misuse, and

investment fraud. There was no systematic association between being victimized and age, wealth,

health or depression, sex, marital status, or education across subtypes. Hispanics were significantly

less likely to have reported being scammed by prize/lottery fraud, account misuse, and some forms

of investment fraud. Indeed, this analysis underscores that few readily-identifiable risk factors are

predictive of major subtypes of fraud.



Discussion




                                                                                                   6
       There has been much recent debate about whether older Americans make well-informed

financial decisions and whether they face higher fraud risk. Prior to our experimental module, there

had been no fraud victimization studies using the HRS’s rigorous sampling approach to determine

the prevalence and determinants of multiple forms of fraud. By linking the new information from

our module to the core HRS variables, we develop a more comprehensive profile of older adults

who are victimized.

       Our results indicate that relatively few HRS respondents experienced any specific type of

investment fraud in the past five years, but 5% did report at least one form of investment fraud and

4% paid money because they believed they needed to pay in order to claim a prize or lottery. More

alarming is that nearly one-third of respondents reported that someone had used or attempted to

use their financial accounts in the past five years. This figure is considerably higher than the five-

year prevalence of conventionally-measured fraud, indicating that actual and attempted financial

exploitation by family and friends or identity theft by strangers is a significant concern for older

Americans. This question did not differentiate between successful and attempted account misuse

or specify the victim’s relationship to the perpetrator (stranger versus friend/relative). More

research is needed to determine how often money is lost in such incidents, who perpetrated the

crime, and whether losses were recovered or reimbursed by financial institutions.

       Overall prevalence was higher than in the HRS Leave Behind questionnaires that only

included a single fraud item without offering specific examples of fraudulent behavior (DeLiema

et al., 2017). Those lower rates resulted despite the fact that respondents could have reported on a

broader range of fraud experiences not included in the new module. This suggests that informing

people about how one defines fraud is important for obtaining a more precise estimate of

victimization.



                                                                                                    7
       Other than depression, few readily-identifiable factors were associated with victimization

in the older population. Neither financial literacy nor self-reported financial knowledge were

consistently and significantly associated with any key outcome, nor were net housing or non-

housing wealth, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, or age. We find that those reporting

themselves as financially knowledgeable were also more likely to indicate account misuse; this

could imply that the more self-confident were better at monitoring their accounts and thus more

likely to detect suspicious activity, rather than experiencing more account misuse than their less-

confident peers. If anything, our research illustrates that more financially literate and educated

adults are not necessarily immune to financial fraud, and that predicting financial victimization is

not a simple matter.

       Lack of consistency in predictor variables across fraud subtypes could suggest that

unmeasured situational factors play a larger role, such as whether the respondent was alone when

solicited or in a state of high emotional arousal boosting susceptibility (Kircanski et al., 2018).

Another determinant might be lack of knowledge of specific scams or the tactics scammers use to

deceive targets. If context and prior knowledge are more prognostic of victimization than

sociodemographic factors and financial literacy, consumer education messages should focus on

strategies for resisting persuasion and tools for safeguarding financial accounts against malicious

actors and impulsive decision-making.

       AARP (2011) has previously argued that investment fraud victims were likely to be male,

well-educated, and relatively well paid. Nevertheless, respondents in that study were recruited

from a sample of known fraud victims identified by law enforcement. By contrast, our HRS

module was administered to a randomly selected and nationally representative subset of older

Americans. Accordingly, our findings are more reflective of the older population at large, rather



                                                                                                  8
than a subset of victims. As a result, we can be relatively confident that our results are likely to be

generalizable across the older population.



Conclusion

       Older adults may require assistance to manage their finances and avoid fraud, so financial

advisors and institutions could enhance protections and offer monitoring tools that reduce

opportunities for exploitation. Preventing fraud is a shared responsibility between consumers and

banks, insurance, and credit card companies holding and managing their accounts. Future studies

will need to explore the effects of financial literacy and confidence on risk of other types of scams.

When additional waves of the HRS become available, researchers will be able to link fraud

victimization to subsequent changes in wealth and retirement well-being.

Online Appendix B: Robustness Analysis

       Several other analyses were also examined for sensitivity analysis, in results not detailed

here. First, we measured the mismatch between respondents’ subjective and objective financial

knowledge, as this has been proposed as a possible determinant of victimization (Gamble et al.,

2015). To do so, we created a measure of financial overconfidence by subtracting each person’s

standardized financial literacy score from his standardized self-rated financial knowledge score.

Those with values above zero were coded as being overconfident. Nevertheless, holding constant

our other controls, we found no significant impact of overconfidence on any victimization outcomes.

       Second, we separately analyzed whether people responding “don’t know” to the financial

literacy questions were more likely to be victims of financial exploitation. We found that this

attribute had no significant impact when other controls were included.

       Third, we re-estimated Table 3 using Firth Logit, a technique sometimes deployed when the

observed event is relatively rare. Signs and significance levels were generally similar as those

appearing in Table 3. As that approach is not amenable to the use of sample weights, our preferred

results are those in Table 3 using Probit and weighted data.
