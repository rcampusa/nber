This paper compares the relative strengths of working longer vs. saving more in terms of increasing
a household’s affordable, sustainable standard of living in retirement. Both stylized households and
actual households from the Health and Retirement Study are examined. We assume that workers commence
Social Security benefits when they retire. The basic result is that delaying retirement by 3-6 months
has the same impact on the retirement standard of living as saving an additional one-percentage point
of labor earnings for 30 years. The relative power of saving more is even lower if the decision to increase
saving is made later in the work life. For instance, increasing retirement saving by one percentage
point ten years before retirement has the same impact on the sustainable retirement standard of living
as working a single month longer. The calculations of the relative power of working longer and saving
more are done for a wide range of realized rates of returns on saving, for households with different
income levels, and for singles as well as married couples. The results are quite invariant to these circumstances.

   1. Introduction

       One of the biggest financial challenges people face is allocating lifetime resources in such

a way as to support a satisfactory and sustainable standard of living in retirement. Households can

explicitly or implicitly establish a plan at a relatively early age, but there is a great deal of

uncertainty about important factors such as future wage growth, asset returns, life expectancies,

annuity prices and Social Security benefit formulas at the time of retirement. The key decisions to

make include when to start saving for retirement, what percentage of earnings to contribute to

employer-based tax deferred saving accounts, what asset returns and expenses to assume, and at

what age to retire. As time passes and some of this uncertainty is resolved, households should

reassess their strategy for providing resources for retirement. For example, households today may

wish to re-optimize retirement strategy in light of persistently low real interest rates and wage

growth. In a standard life cycle model with uncertainty, households continually reassess and

reoptimize as new information is revealed. In reality, households facing constraints on their time

and attention could reexamine their plan at periodic intervals, such as every ten years.

       In this paper, we examine how households that are close to retirement could reassess

retirement plans. Rather than specifying a full-blown life cycle model, we examine the marginal

impact of saving and retirement choices on sustainable retirement consumption. This framework

allows us to see how each of these margins influences retirement consumption, thereby defining

the tradeoffs that households face. The optimal choice with respect to these tradeoffs will of course

depend on household preferences. But spelling out the tradeoffs can provide practical guidance for

individuals and financial planners. We calculate the impact of working longer on retirement

consumption and compare it to the impact of saving more or switching to assets with lower expense

ratios. We examine this issue for both stylized households and actual households from the Health



                                                                                                   2
and Retirement Study (HRS), a nationally representative panel of older adults. Our key insight is

that some decisions, such as how much to save in retirement accounts going forward, become less

powerful at older ages in changing the affordable retirement standard of living. Saving an

additional one percent of earnings, for instance, would affect the retirement standard of living

much more at age 36 than at age 56. Similarly, the impact of choosing cost-efficient assets –

something financial planners frequently emphasize to increase retirement resources – diminishes

with age since there are fewer years to enjoy the benefit of a lower cost portfolio. In contrast,

changes to planned retirement and Social Security claiming dates continue to have the same impact

on retirement living standards as a person ages.

        We define the maximum sustainable standard of living in retirement as the maximum

annuity that can be obtained from both private retirement savings and Social Security. We assume

that retirement accumulations are used to purchase an inflation-indexed joint survivor life annuity

with 100% of the monthly benefit continuing for the survivor. Annuitizing wealth guarantees that

the benefits are indeed sustainable and protected from both inflation and the risk of outliving

retirement resources, and is generally optimal in the life cycle framework (see Yaari 1965; Mitchell

et al. 1999). It also facilitates our analysis by ensuring that the annuity benefits from 401(k) and

similar plans are comparable to Social Security benefits for primary earners, where the benefits

are paid out as a second-to-die inflation-indexed annuity. We assume that workers claim Social

Security upon retirement, and therefore workers who extend their careers postpone the

commencement of Social Security to their new retirement age. Claiming Social Security upon

retirement is not necessarily optimal. In fact, most primary earners benefit from delaying Social

Security to age 70 regardless of retirement age2, and using private retirement assets to finance a

al. (2002); Mahaney and Carlson (2007); Shoven and Slavov (2014a, b).

                                                                                                                 3
delay of Social Security is superior to annuitizing them (Bronshtein et al. 2016). However,

claiming Social Security upon retirement matches actual behavior of most Americans and appears

to be a social norm (Shoven, Slavov, and Wise 2017). We further assume that individuals who

continue to work continue to contribute to their employer’s defined contribution plan. We show

that postponing retirement impacts the sustainable standard of living in retirement for several

reasons: (1) commencing Social Security at a later age results in higher monthly benefits, (2)

working longer involves additional contributions to retirement accounts, (3) delayed withdrawals

from retirement accounts results in additional compounding of previous account balances, and (4)

delayed annuity purchase results in lower annuity prices (that is, a given amount of wealth will

convert to a larger monthly annuity payment).

       The stylized analysis and the empirical results from the HRS lead to the same conclusion.

Working longer is a powerful method to increase retirement standard of living and has a

substantially larger impact on retirement consumption than other alternatives, particularly in mid-

and late-career circumstances. For individuals who are 30 years away from retirement, extending

work for six months or less has the same impact as increasing annual retirement contributions by

one percentage point. For near retirees, increasing retirement contributions has even less relative

strength. In those cases, a one-percentage point increase in the contribution rate may be equivalent

to postponing retirement by a single month. While the optimal choice depends on household

preferences, including the disutility of work, these are the tradeoffs. Our analysis provides valuable

information to households as they consider the levers that they have at their disposal to increase

their retirement standard of living.

    2. Analysis of Stylized Households

        The traditional economic approach to modeling saving and retirement decisions is based

on the life cycle model. In a standard life cycle model, households aim to smooth consumption

over the lifetime by saving during working years and drawing down on savings during retirement

years (Friedman 1957; Modigliani 1966). Life cycle models can incorporate uncertainty in a range

of outcomes, such as wages, asset returns, and health. Some studies have introduced endogenous

retirement into the life cycle model by having the marginal cost of effort increase or the marginal

value of leisure decrease with age (e.g., Gustman and Steinmeier 1986; Blau 2008). Some studies

have explored the implications of various policy changes, such as an increase in the pension

eligibility age on retirement (Haan and Prowse 2014). A few papers have used the life cycle

framework to examine the impact of the actuarial adjustment for delaying Social Security on

consumption and retirement behavior (e.g., Gustman and Steinmeier 2008; 2015). For example,

Gustman and Steinmeier (2008) predict that changes to Social Security rules between 1992 and

2004, including the increase in the delayed retirement credit, increased the male labor force

participation rate.

        While the standard life cycle model provides the theoretical framework for our approach,

we focus directly on the marginal impact that adjusting saving and retirement decisions has on the

maximum sustainable consumption in retirement. This allows us to examine the tradeoffs that

households approaching retirement face. Like Gustman and Steinmeier (2008; 2015), we show

that the recent, more generous rules for delaying Social Security play a large role in the returns to

working longer relative to saving more, although other factors matter too.

        We begin by analyzing stylized workers who have smoothly growing wages and constant

asset returns, and who participate in the labor force without interruption. The advantage of



                                                                                                   5
examining stylized workers is that the underlying arithmetic relationships between saving, wealth

accumulation, and annuitization are readily transparent. Analyzing such individuals will give us

guidance on what to expect from real households with more complicated financial lives. We start

with an equation for the evolution of wealth in a defined contribution retirement plan as a function

of previous contributions and returns:
                                              𝑇−1        𝑇

                                      𝑊𝑇 = ∑ {𝐶𝑡 ∏ (1 + 𝑟𝑖 )} + 𝐶𝑇
                                              𝑡=1      𝑖=𝑡+1

In this equation, 𝑊𝑇 is wealth at time 𝑇, 𝐶𝑡 is annual contribution made at time 𝑡, and 𝑟𝑡 is the

return over the period (𝑡 − 1, 𝑡). The above equation has the household starting retirement saving

at time 0 and shows wealth accumulation as a function of time 𝑇. The equation assumes that

contributions take place at the end of each year of work, so that the final contribution does not earn

any asset returns. This annual version of the accumulation equation is sufficiently accurate for our

stylized examples, but it should be clear that a monthly version with monthly asset returns would

be simple to implement.

         In our stylized examples, we assume that workers earn the same real wage, 𝜔, in each

period of life. We further assume that there is no economy-wide wage growth. Social Security

benefits are based on Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME), calculated as the average of the

highest 35 years of earnings, indexed for economy-wide wage growth and divided by 12 to convert

to a monthly amount. Workers who claim at full retirement age (FRA) receive a monthly benefit

(called the primary insurance amount, or PIA) equal to 90 percent of the first $885 of AIME, 32

percent of any AIME between $885 and $5,336, and 15 percent of any remaining AIME.3 Our



3
 These PIA “bend points” are in effect for 2017. In general, bend points are indexed to average age growth. To
calculate AIME, wages are indexed to the year in which the worker turns 62 (with any additional years of earnings
counting at their nominal value), and PIA is based on the bend points in effect during the year in which the worker

                                                                                                                      6
assumption of zero real wage growth, both for the individual worker and economy-wide, implies

that AIME is equal to the monthly equivalent of 𝜔. For our stylized worker, we assume that the

ratio of PIA to AIME is equal to 0.42. That value is roughly in line with the ratio for a worker who

earns the economy-wide average wage in each year of his or her career.4 Due to the progressivity

of the PIA formula, the ratio of PIA to AIME declines with AIME. This fact will become relevant

later when we consider workers with different levels of earnings.

        At the time of retirement, the household annuitizes the accumulated wealth and commences

Social Security benefits. We define the retirement replacement ratio as the sum of the annuity

payments and Social Security benefits divided by pre-retirement income. Specifically, the

retirement replacement ratio, if retirement occurs at time 𝑇, is:

                                                      𝐴𝑇 ∙ 𝑊𝑇 + 𝑆𝑇
                                              𝜌𝑇 =
                                                            𝜔

where 𝐴𝑇 is the annual annuity conversion factor relevant at time 𝑇, 𝑆𝑇 is the annual Social

Security benefit at time 𝑇, and 𝜔 is the annual wage. The annuity conversion factor, 𝐴𝑇 , converts

retirement wealth into the annualized inflation-indexed life annuity benefit. Recent quotes for

annuity factors for same-age married couples and single men and women are shown in Figure 1.




turns 62. PIA is indexed for price inflation after age 62. For our stylized example, since we have assumed zero wage
growth, we are simply using the bend points for 2017.

  See Table V.C7 of the Social Security Trustees Report for 2013, at
https://www.ssa.gov/oact/tr/2013/V_C_prog.html#997444. This table reports the ratio of PIA to career-average
indexed earnings (similar to AIME) for individuals whose career-average earnings are equal to the economy-wide
wage index. The average of these ratios for workers reaching full retirement age in 2013, 2015, and 2020 is roughly
42 percent. The Trustees Reports stopped reporting these ratios in 2014.

The lowest curve shows the annuity conversion factors for same-age married couples and the

highest curve shows the factors for single men. These quotes reflect several important realities.

First, increasing sustainable lifetime standard of living is very expensive. At age 62, the conversion

factor for couples is .033267, which means that an additional $100,000 of retirement wealth would

raise the annual inflation-adjusted standard of living by just $3,327 per year. These quotes

implicitly take into account the current low real interest rates and the anticipated mortality of

today’s retirement age individuals.




                                                                                                    8
           Financial planners often use replacement ratios like the one above to summarize a

household’s goal for a sustainable retirement living standard. These ratios are a rule of thumb

deriving from the life cycle framework. Scholz and Seshadri (2009) show that optimal replacement

rates derived from a life cycle model vary greatly by household; for example, a couple with

children should target a lower replacement rate than a couple without children as the former can

reduce child care expenses during retirement. In addition, there has been some debate regarding

the appropriate denominator.5 Numerous alternatives are possible, such as final salary, real average

salary over the lifetime, AIME, or real average salary over the 5 years prior to retirement. The

optimal replacement ratio can vary greatly depending on the choice of denominator. In our stylized

examples, since we assume zero wage growth both economy wide and for the individual, all these

denominator choices are equivalent. Moreover, we do not take a stand on the optimal replacement

ratio. Instead, we examine how changes in saving and retirement decisions affect retirement living

standards at the margin. Using replacement ratios to summarize retirement living standards

simplifies the presentation of our stylized examples. However, even with wage growth, our results

would be insensitive to the choice of denominator or to other factors that influence the optimal

replacement rate. As long as the replacement ratio denominator is held constant, the growth rate

in the replacement ratio will be equal to the growth rate in retirement income.

           Next, we list our base case assumptions, summarized in Table 1. We start by looking at the

primary earner in a same-age couple, who chooses to start saving at age 36. This is 𝑡 = 0 in the

wealth accumulation equation. Their employer offers to match 50% of employee contributions to

a 401(k) plan, up to 6 percent of salary. The worker assumes that he or she will have this plan or

an identical plan available to them for their entire career. The worker’s initial plan is to work until

    See Biggs (2008, 2016) for further discussion.

                                                                                                     9
age 66, then retire, annuitize any 401(k) account balances, and commence Social Security benefits.

The worker intends to take advantage of the employer’s match offer and contribute 6 percent to

the retirement plan, with the employer matching with an additional 3 percent. In addition to zero

wage growth, we assume a constant return on assets (zero percent in the base case, though we

consider alternatives). Our assumptions about wage growth and asset returns are not far out of line

with recent experience. Real median wages have been quite stagnant for several decades and safe,

real asset returns such as interest rates on Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) have been

roughly zero for the past nine years.

Despite 30 years of saving 9 percent of earnings, the annuitized 401(k) balance accounts for only

19.4 percent of retirement income with Social Security accounting for the remainder. This fact

alone highlights the incredible value of Social Security benefits for primary earners.

       2.1 Working an Additional Year at Age 66.

       If our stylized primary earner delays retirement by one year to age 67, there are four main

impacts on retirement income:

       1. The annuity is cheaper (i.e., each dollar of savings will convert to a larger annuity

           payment) - the new conversion factor would increase to 𝐴𝑇+1 = .03871467.

       2. Wealth increases by the return on assets (initially ignored since asset returns are

           assumed to be zero).

       3. Wealth increases by the additional retirement contribution, 𝑊𝑇+1 = 𝑊𝑇 + 𝐶𝑇 .

       4. The Social Security monthly benefit increases by 8% over and above inflation.

The replacement ratio at age 67 is then:
         𝐴𝑇+1 ∙ 𝑊𝑇+1 𝑆𝑇+1 𝐴𝑇+1 ∙ 31 ∙ .09𝜔 1.08 ⋅ 𝑆𝑇
𝜌𝑇+1 =              +    =                +          = .1080139 + .4536 = .561614
             𝜔        𝜔          𝜔            𝜔
By working one year longer, the replacement rate has increased from around 52.1 percent to 56.2

percent. Recall that as long as the denominator used in the replacement rate is held constant, the

growth in the replacement rate is mathematically equal to the growth in retirement income, so we

can conclude that by working one year longer retirement income has increased by 7.75 percent.

This increase is a weighted average of the 8 percent increase in real Social Security benefits and

the 6.73 percent increase in the real value of the annuity payment obtained from the 401(k) balance

at retirement. The weights are based on the share of each of the elements in the replacement ratio

at the initial planned retirement age (about 81% and 19%, respectively). Even with zero percent

returns, the annuity payment still increases due to the additional contributions for one year and due

to the fact that annuities are cheaper at 67 than at 66. This example emphasizes that the returns to

working longer can be quite high even when asset returns are low.




                                                                                                  11
       We now discuss the relative importance of each of the four impacts on retirement income

listed above. We do this by showing the increase in retirement income attributable to each factor.

In our example the overall replacement rate increased by 4.04 percentage points. This overall

impact on the replacement ratio can be decomposed as follows:

                      1
       𝜌𝑇+1 − 𝜌𝑇 =      [(𝐴𝑇+1 − 𝐴𝑇 ) ∙ 𝑊𝑇 + 𝐴𝑇+1 ∙ 𝑊𝑇 ∙ 𝑟 + 𝐴𝑇+1 ∙ 𝐶𝑇+1 + (𝑆𝑇+1 − 𝑆𝑇 )]
                      𝜔

Therefore, the share of the increase attributed to each impact is then:

 𝜌𝑇+1 − 𝜌𝑇         𝜌𝑇+1 − 𝜌𝑇           𝜌𝑇+1 − 𝜌𝑇                𝜌𝑇+1 − 𝜌𝑇          𝜌𝑇+1 − 𝜌𝑇

This decomposition shows that 83 percent of the impact of delaying retirement comes from

additional Social Security benefits. The increase from Social Security can be further subdivided

into two components. One component reflects an actuarial adjustment to the payout associated

with delaying the onset of the benefit In the retail market, this actuarial adjustment is 3.3% since

the ratio of A67 to A66 is 1.033. However, the Social Security payout increases by 8% not 3.3%.

The additional 4.7% reflects the generous nature of the benefit increase. The rest of the growth

comes from the roughly even impacts of the cheaper annuity and the additional contribution.

       In the next subsection we look at how the returns to working longer change with respect to

changes in the baseline assumptions. First, we consider the returns to working longer when real

asset returns are positive (easing the assumption that 𝑟 = 0). Second, we compute the returns to

working longer at different baseline retirement ages (easing the assumption that baseline age is




                                                                                                 12
66). Third, we calculate the returns to working more than one year longer. Fourth, we consider the

impact of working longer for different wage levels. Last, we estimate the returns for singles.



       2.2 Role of Real Investment Returns

       We consider real investment returns ranging from 0% to 8%. The second column of Table

2 reports the growth in retirement income relative to the baseline as a result of one additional year

of work. The results suggest that the relative impact of working longer is fairly insensitive to asset

returns; one additional year of work raises retirement income by roughly 8 percent for real returns

of 0-3% and then the income increase gradually rises to about 10 percent in the case of 8%

compounded real returns.

              Table 2 - Returns to Working Longer by Real Investment Returns

In the last four columns of Table 2 we present the share of the increased retirement income

attributable to each of the four impacts described above. The growth rate of the Social Security

benefit is constant across the investment returns but its share in total retirement income growth

decreases from 83% as asset returns increase. Similarly, the effect of the additional contribution is

                                                                                                   13
constant across the investment returns, so that its share in the total increase diminishes as returns

increase. However, the impact of the additional return on existing wealth and the cheaper annuity

are larger at higher investment return rates. Therefore, their share in the total retirement income

increases. However, even when asset returns are very high (7-8%), the impact of Social Security

still dominates the increase in retirement income.

       Throughout, we assume that annuity prices are invariant to asset returns. That is, we use

the same annuity factors, based on current conditions, in all calculations regardless of asset returns.

It is possible that higher investment returns may be associated with higher discount rates and

therefore lower annuity prices. However, high investment returns do not necessarily imply low

annuity prices. Annuity prices are mainly based on risk-free interest rates. Over the last several

years, investment returns have been high while safe interest rates (such as those on inflation-

indexed government bonds) have remained low, a discrepancy that may be attributable to a higher

risk premium. Alternatively, the higher investment returns we have considered in this section can

be thought of as ex-post returns on potentially risky investments.



       2.3 Varying Age and Length of Extension

       So far, we have been looking at the power of working to 67 vs. a base case of retiring at

66. But many people retire well before age 66. So, how powerful is working an extra year at age

62 or 63? And what is the impact of delaying retirement by longer than one year? To estimate the

returns to working longer at different ages and for different work extension lengths, we return to

our baseline case: a primary earner in a same-age married couple who started at age 36 to

contribute 9 percent of salary to a defined contribution retirement plan. Asset returns and wage

growth are equal to zero. There are two key differences in this exercise compared to our base case.



                                                                                                    14
First, the number of years of saving changes. Clearly, retiring before age 66 means fewer years of

accumulated saving (relative to our base case) and retiring after age 66 means greater years of

accumulated savings (relative to our base case). Second, the Social Security benefit changes since

Social Security pays 100% of PIA for those claiming benefits at the full retirement age (which is

66 for those born between 1943 and 1954) but substantially lower benefits for those claiming

earlier and substantially higher for those claiming after their full retirement age.6

         The first column of Table 3 presents the percent increase in retirement income resulting

from working one year longer and delaying the claiming of Social Security by one year for primary

earners of age 62 through 69. By age 70 Social Security benefits no longer grow through delay,

and the returns to working longer are much lower. There are a few notable results. First, as a result

of the peculiar structure of the Social Security benefits, returns to working longer are non-linear.

Delaying from age 62 to 63 increases retirement income by 6.7%. Returns are the highest for those

aged 63 (about 8%), lower for those aged 64 and 65, and increase again to 7.75% for those aged

66. The rest of Table 3 displays the percentage increase in retirement income for those choosing

to delay by two through eight years, up to age 70. The returns are relative to the age displayed in

the first column of Table 3. For example, delaying by 4 years at age 64 (i.e., through age 68)

increases retirement income by 33.04 percent.




6
 For those born between 1943 and 1954, the Social Security monthly benefit is reduced by 5/9ths of one percent of
PIA for each month between 1 and 36 months prior to full retirement age that the benefit is claimed, and 5/12ths of
one percent of PIA for each additional month prior to full retirement age that the benefit is claimed. For example,
claiming at age 62 will reduce the Social Security benefit to be 75% of PIA, claiming at age 63 will reduce the
benefit to 80% of PIA, and so on. For claims after full retirement age, the monthly benefit increases by 2/3rds of one
percent of PIA per month of delay up to 48 months. For example, delaying to age 70 increases the benefit to 132
percent of PIA.

                                                                                                                   15

     68       6.87%       13.83%
     69       6.51%


The results are unequivocal. Primary earners of ages 62 to 69 can substantially increase their

retirement standard of living by working longer. The longer work can be sustained, the higher the

retirement standard of living. For example, retiring at 66 instead of 62 increases retirement living

standard by about one-third. As we will show in the Section 3, no reasonable amount of additional

saving could impact the retirement standard of living so significantly.



        2.4 Returns to Working Longer by Different Earnings Levels

        The previous analysis assumed a stylized worker with roughly average earnings (which

translated into a PIA to AIME ratio of 42 percent). However, as we noted earlier, the PIA formula

is progressive, so the ratio of PIA to AIME falls as AIME rises. For the following exercise, we

consider five different levels of the PIA to AIME ratio, as shown in the first column of Table 4.

These PIA to AIME ratios translate into the annualized AIME levels shown in the second column

of Table 4. If we continue to assume zero wage growth, both economy-wide and for individual

workers, then this annualized AIME is equal to the wage earned in each year of work.7 We then


7
  In reality, AIME may not translate one-for-one into annual earnings, as AIME is based on the top 35 years of
indexed earnings. For example, a person with a short career and high annual earnings may have the same AIME as a

                                                                                                              16
calculate the returns to working one year longer for the five earning levels. We continue to assume

a primary earner in a couple aged 66, saving 9% of salary for 30 years with zero percent real asset

returns.

           In the third column of Table 4 we present the returns to working longer in terms of

percentage increase in retirement income. These results indicate that the returns to working longer

– expressed as the percentage increase in retirement income – are about the same across the income

levels (about 7.75%, as our baseline results). However, the impact of working longer on the

replacement rate varies significantly across the different wage levels. A growth rate of 8% has

roughly three times the impact on the replacement rate assuming a base replacement rate of 75%

compared to a base replacement rate of 25%.

        The second result observed in the table is that the returns to working longer decrease as

earnings increase. A decomposition of the four impacts (not presented) reveals that the first three

impacts – cheaper annuity, returns to wealth and additional contribution – are constant across wage

levels. However, the Social Security impact changes. As the Social Security share of final

retirement income increases, the weight on the Social Security impact increases. Thus, an 8%

growth in the Social Security benefit has a higher weight for workers at the lower wage levels,

translating into higher returns to working an additional year.

       2.5 Single Individuals

       All of the above analysis was for the primary earner of a couple. In that case, Social

Security benefits are paid in the form of a second-to-die annuity, and we assume private retirement

wealth is converted into the same form. We now address how working longer impacts retirement

living standard for single individuals. While the increase in Social Security is the same as our base

case, the annuity factors are different. For singles, the analysis is identical for men and women

except that retail annuities are cheaper for men due to their shorter life expectancy. (For married

primary earners, the gender of the primary earner did not matter. A 100 percent joint and survivor

annuity is priced based on one male and one female lifetime.) Of course, annuities are cheaper for

both single men and women compared to primary earners, since primary earners buy a second-to-

die annuity and singles buy single life annuities.

       The returns to working one additional year at age 66 for single males, single females, and

married primary earners are shown in Figure 2. We illustrate in this graph how the returns increase

as we ease the assumption of zero rate of returns on assets. Returns are slightly higher for single

males, and to a lesser degree for single females, compared to married primary earners. These small

differences are driven by the impact of working longer on annuity prices (resulting from delaying

the annuity purchase by one year). It is important to note, however, that these figures represent the

increase in annual retirement income rather than lifetime retirement income. The increase in

lifetime retirement income is always greater for married couples compared to singles, as the higher

income is paid out as a second-to-die annuity rather than a single life annuity (see e.g., Shoven and

Slavov 2014a,b).

3    Working Longer vs. Alternative Strategies

         3.1 Alternative Strategy: Save One Percent More of Earnings

         An alternative way to boost retirement living standards is to save more. Suppose that our

stylized primary earner saves 1 percent more of wages starting at age 36. That is, they move from

a 6 percent to a 7 percent personal contribution rate, with a 3 percent employer contribution, for a

total retirement saving rate of 10 percent. If the higher contribution rate were applied for the entire

30 years (maintaining the assumption of zero real asset returns and wage growth during those 30




                                                                                                    19
years), then the replacement rate would rise to .53244 from the base case of .521194, translating

into a 2.16% percent increase in retirement income.8

         Recall from Section 2.1 that working one year longer increased retirement income by

7.75%. Delaying retirement by one year is roughly 3.5 times as impactful as saving an additional

1 percent of wages for 30 years. To put it another way, working just over 3 months longer would

have the same impact as a 1 percentage point increase in the contribution rate for 30 years. In what

follows we compare various alternatives that would increase retirement income to the working

longer alternative. For all these cases, we state the number of additional working months required

to have an equal impact on retirement income. The message resulting from this comparison is

clear. Working longer is very powerful compared to the other alternatives. This result holds for all

reasonable investment returns and ages considered.



         3.2 Role of Real Investment Returns

         In Section 2.2 we considered the effect of various asset returns on returns to working one

year longer. In Table 5 below we demonstrate how the returns to saving 1% more of wages for 30

years change with respect to the real asset returns.9 As expected, saving has a larger impact on

retirement income when real asset returns are higher. However, the returns to saving more are

much smaller than the returns to working one year longer shown in Table 2. For low asset returns,

working 3-4 months longer increases retirement income about the same as increasing the

contribution rate by 1 percentage point more for 30 years. At high asset return levels, working

replacement rate is equal to the growth in retirement income.

         3.3 Role of Start Age

         Now, let us look at different start ages for saving 1% more of wages. The base case is still

a contribution rate of 9 percent starting at age 36. We examine three alternatives (increasing the

contribution rate by 1 percentage point at ages 36, 46 and 56) and compare the impact of these

three scenarios with never increasing the contribution rate but working one year longer. Table 6

contains the results for two investment returns, zero and five percent.

       The table shows that as the number of additional saving years decreases, the impact of the

asset return assumption diminishes. That is, the impact of a 5% real asset return has a much smaller

effect relative to a zero percent return when the contribution rate is increased for only 10 years.

Second, as reflected in the last column, at age 56, the power of saving one percent more of income

is equivalent to working just one additional month (regardless of the return environment

considered). That is, the older the individual, the greater the relative impact of working longer

compared to increasing the saving rate.



       3.4 Role of Earnings Levels

       As we have shown in Section 2.4, the impact of working longer on the growth rate in

retirement income is insensitive to income levels. In this section, we examine the impact of saving

an additional 1% on different income groups’ retirement living standards. In Table 7 we present

the returns to saving more for different income levels (as indicated by PIA/AIME ratios, which

correspond to annual earnings under the zero-wage growth assumption).



  Table 7 - Saving More or Working Longer by Income Level
                                                        Months of work to equal 1% additional

       $16,212                      70%                    2.1           1.4           0.7

       $34,224                      50%                    2.9           1.9           1.0
       $68,184                      40%                    3.5           2.3           1.2
      $113,628                      30%                    4.4           2.9           1.5


       In terms of replacement rate, we see that Social Security is highly progressive. At a wage

rate of $16,000, Social Security replaces 70% of income, whereas the replacement rate at $113,000


                                                                                                 22
is only 30%. When Social Security replaces a larger fraction of income, working longer is

relatively more impactful than saving more. For example, compare a high wage worker to a low

wage worker each considering whether to save for 30 years or work longer. The lower wage

worker need only work 2.1 months to equal the benefit of 30 years of saving, whereas the higher

wage worker has to work more than twice as long, 4.4 months, to receive a comparable benefit.

The impact of saving more falls precipitously if saving occurs for fewer years. In this case, a low

wage worker saving more for 10 years need only work about 3 weeks to garner a comparable

benefit.

         Consider this information in a more realistic setting. Suppose a high wage worker is 46

years old and is deciding between saving an additional 10% of salary for the next 20 years or

working longer. The alternative to saving an extra 10% for 20 years is to plan on working an extra

29 months.10 For the low wage worker, the decision would be between saving an additional 10%

for 20 years, or working an extra 14 months. If the low wage worker were 56, then the decision

would be between saving an additional 10% for 10 years or working a mere 7 months longer. The

disutility of work would have to be very high for low wage workers to consider saving more rather

than working longer.



     3.5 Understanding the Results: Saving More vs. Working Longer

         Clearly working one year longer is much more powerful than saving one percentage point

more for 30 years. But, why is working longer so much more powerful? The income and saving

that results from one more year of work is only a small part of the story. Our calculations show

that working longer is only powerful if accompanied by deferring the commencement of Social


10
  Since the Social Security benefit growth varies over different ages, the calculation is not exact for horizons that
extend beyond 12 months.

                                                                                                                    23
Security and the annuitization of the accumulated 401(k) balance. Recall that in our base case,

working one additional year to 67 – and simultaneously and deferring Social Security and the

annuitization of defined contribution balances – increased the sustainable real standard of living

for the couple’s retirement by 7.75 percent. That is a very big impact.

         Now, consider another scenario, where the primary earner commences Social Security at

66, annuitizes his or her retirement assets at the same time, and then decides to work for another

year while making a 9 percent contribution to the company’s 401(k) plan. This is a case of working

longer with no deferrals at all, and the the sustainable standard of living would increase by only

0.67%.

         This calculation illustrates that working longer only has a powerful impact on retirement

income if it facilitates delay of Social Security claiming and annuitization. Of course, Social

Security and annuitization can both be delayed without working longer. Alternatively, Social

Security can be delayed and 401(k) assets used to finance living expenses during the delay period.

But given the presence of liquidity constraints and the strong social norm of claiming Social

Security upon retirement, it is plausible that delaying retirement can facilitate delays in both

claiming Social Security and tapping into 401(k) wealth.



   3.6 Alternative Strategy: Use More Cost-Efficient Portfolios

         One of the key services provided by financial planners is helping clients reduce portfolio

costs. Lower portfolio costs translate into higher net asset returns and higher retirement income.

In our last exercise, we compare the impact of reducing portfolio management costs to the impact

of working longer. Overall, our results in this section suggest that the gains from choosing more

cost-efficient portfolios are relatively small compared to the gains from working longer. Thus,



                                                                                                24
financial planners may have more of an impact on clients’ retirement living standards by helping

them time their retirement (and Social Security claiming) optimally than by helping them choose

cost-efficient portfolios.

        We return to the case of the primary earner in a couple who started contributing 9% of

earnings to a 401(k) at age 36, and planned to retire and collect Social Security at 66. The rates of

returns that have been used in the analysis up to now should be interpreted as net returns to

investors. We now look at the impact of increasing those returns by 60 basis points (0.6%), which

may be achieved by investing in lower cost mutual funds. Specifically, 60 basis points is roughly

the average difference between the expense charges of active and passive mutual funds, but it is

also possible to find active funds that are 60 basis points cheaper than some of the alternatives.

(There is little to no evidence that the more expensive funds have greater gross returns.)

        Table 8 shows the impact of reducing portfolio costs at different levels of net investment

returns. Comparing these results to those in Tables 2 and 5, we can see that improving returns by

60 basis points for 30 years has about the same impact as saving one percentage point more for the

same duration. Both of these strategies have a much smaller impact than working an additional

year. The last column in Table 8 shows that to replicate the impact of cost efficient investments on

retirement income, a primary earner would need to work just under 3 months more in the low real

asset return environment and around 6 months more in a high return environment. Finally, if one

could use a two-pronged approach of reducing portfolio management costs by 60 basis points and

saving an additional 1% of earnings (both maintained for 30 years), the impact on retirement

income would be equivalent to that of working one year longer if asset returns are high. If this

combined strategy were implemented at age 56, just ten years before retirement, then the impact




                                                                                                  25
on retirement income for an average earner would be equivalent to working three to four months

more.

   3.7 The Marginal Incentive to Work

        Throughout this paper, we have reported the benefit of working longer in terms of its

impact on retirement income. Here, we explore the benefit of working longer as a fraction of final

wage. We return to our base case, with zero wage growth and zero asset returns, in which a 66-

year-old primary earner is considering whether to continue working until age 67. If retirement

occurs at age 66, retirement income is 66·, where 66 is the replacement rate as defined in Section

2. If retirement occurs at age 67, retirement income is 67·.

        The increase in income can be decomposed into three factors. Mathematically, the

decomposition is as follows:

                   𝜌67 ∙ 𝜔 − 𝜌66 ∙ 𝜔 = .09 ∙ 𝜔 ∙ 𝐴67 + 𝜌66 ∙ 𝜔 ∙ 𝐴67 + 𝑋 ∙ 𝐴67

        The left-hand side is the difference in income. Part of this increase in income stems from

the fact that the extra year of work resulted in an additional 9% of salary contribution to savings.

This is the first part of the right-hand side of the equation. A second part of the increase in income

                                                                                                   26
results from simply purchasing the annuity later. We capture this aspect by calculating how much

additional lifetime income at 67 could be purchased using the retirement income that would have

been received between 66 and 67.11 Even after correcting for these two factors that increase

income, the income at age 67 is still higher due to the higher Social Security benefit. We let X in

the equation represent the amount of additional wealth that would generate the same increase in

income as working longer, after controlling for the increase in saving and the lower annuity price.

Solving for X, yields:

                                               𝜌67 − 𝜌66
                                        𝑋=[              − .09 − 𝜌66 ] 𝜔
                                                  𝐴67

If we use the values in our baseline case, we get

                                 0.5616 − 0.5212
                         𝑋=[                     − .09 − 0.5212] 𝜔 = .4327𝜔
                                     0.0387



Working an additional year results in an income increase far beyond what we would expect from

additional saving and delaying the annuity purchase. The value of this difference is 43.27% of

final salary in our baseline case. The root cause of this difference is the generosity of the Social

Security formula. In fact, people could capture a large fraction of the benefit for delaying

retirement by simply delaying taking Social Security. However, since people seem to closely tie

taking Social Security with the stoppage of work, claiming this increase in practice would likely

involve working longer.




11
  We assume income at 67 without work would be 66··(1+, reflecting using retirement income that would
have been received at age 66 to purchase more lifetime income at 67. Alternatively, we could assume income at
67 is 66··, which represents buying income at 67 using the implicit resources available at 66. While the
differences are small, we prefer to use first method because it is feasible for individuals and reflects a conservative
estimate of the work incentive.

                                                                                                                    27
4    Empirical Evidence from the Health and Retirement Study

        We examine the returns from working longer for actual individuals using data from the

Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a panel survey intended to be representative of the U.S.

population aged 50 and older. The survey began in 1992 and has been conducted every other year

since then, with additional cohorts added periodically to keep the sample representative of the

target population. For couple households, information is available for both spouses. The public use

HRS data includes information on basic demographics, as well as defined contribution balances.

The HRS further asks respondents for permission to access their Social Security earnings data.

Thus, we can merge the public use data with full earnings records derived from administrative

Social Security data.12 The earnings records allow us to identify the primary earner in each couple

and calculate the impact of an additional year of earnings on Social Security benefits.

        We begin by calculating Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME) for each respondent

with a linked earnings history and eligible for Social Security from 1985 to 2017 (18,444

individuals).13 Individuals with less than 10 years of earnings history are not eligible for retirement

benefits, so they are excluded from the data (this reduces the sample to 16,555 individuals). We

then drop all married secondary earners (reducing the sample to 11,579 individuals), thereby

restricting attention to singles and married primary earners. We further restrict the data to those

working for pay14 and are 61 or 62 in waves 10,11 or 12 (reducing the sample to 971 individuals).

We choose to focus on this age group since most individuals retire and claim Social Security at or

before their full retirement age (Goda et al., 2018). Finally, we remove one percent of observations


12
   Most of the variables used in our analysis come from the RAND version of the HRS (version P) except for the
earnings history variables, which come from the restricted HRS data.
13
   To estimate the AIME we merge the Social Security Index factors based on the respondent’s year of birth and
earnings year to calculate the indexed earnings. Then we calculate the average indexed-earnings for the highest 35
years of earnings.

   Having r10work r11work or r12work (whichever variable corresponds to the wave in which they are 61 or 62) equal

with the highest percent change in their AIME if they work one additional year, which is a proxy

for the disparity between their earnings history and their self-reported last income. Our final

sample includes 962 people, and we calculate the Primary Insurance Amount (PIA) for each of

them.15

          Out of the 962 people in our sample, 60 percent are married primary earners, 72 percent of

whom are male. Of the singles in our analysis, 34 percent are male. In Table 9 we present basic

summary statistics for our sample. Average earnings for those aged 61-62 is $53,800, slightly

higher than the average income in the population aged 55-64, which is $52,350.16 Since we drop

married secondary earners, it is not surprising that the average (and median) income in our sample

is higher. The average PIA of our sample is about $1,600, above the national average PIA

calculated based on the average monthly benefit for those receiving benefits at age 62. 17 Finally,

the majority of individuals in the data do not have a significant balance in their defined contribution

plan; however, some have large balances, resulting in a median ($7,650) that is well below the

mean ($107,284). In Appendix A we provide histograms of income and defined contribution

balances at individual and household levels.

eligibility year (the year he or she turned 62).

         Next, we construct annuity factors to convert respondents’ wealth to annuity income.

Rather than obtain annuity quotes for each gender and age combination in the sample, we estimate

annuity prices by first calculating actuarially fair prices using real risk-free interest rates as of

August 9th, 2017, and mortality rates as provided by the IRS.18 We then compare these actuarially

fair prices to quotes we retrieved from Immediate Annuities on August 9th, 2017 for various

combinations of age, gender, and marital status. The ratio between the actuarially fair price and

the quote obtained is the money's worth ratio (MWR). For a large range of the quotes we retrieved,

the MWR was about 0.84, so we use this factor to transform the actuarially fair prices to market

prices. These prices are then merged to the HRS data based on the age and gender of the individual

and (if married) spouse. We also merge in the annuity prices that individuals would receive if they

                                                                                                               30
were to start the annuity one year, three years, and eight years later (corresponding to retiring at

age 63, 65 and 70).

        To calculate the returns to working longer we must make several assumptions. First, we

assume that regardless of the retirement choice of the primary earner, the spouse will retire at age

62 and receive 75% of their Social Security benefits. Holding the secondary earner’s retirement

and claiming age constant ensures that the increase in retirement income is entirely driven by the

primary’s retirement choice. The specific age at which the spouse claims Social Security and

retires would not change the results substantially; we just need it to be constant across the scenarios

compared. Second, we assume future wage growth is zero, so that the wage in future years of work

is the same as the wage at age 61/62. Third, we allow for the additional year to count towards one

of the wages included in the AIME calculation; that is, if the last wage earned is among the top 35

years of indexed earnings it will increase the individual’s AIME. Fourth, we assume real asset

returns are 0%, and that the defined contribution saving rate during additional years of work is

equal to 9% of annual salary. Fifth, as in the stylized examples, we assume claiming Social

Security and retirement are simultaneous. Sixth, we assume people annuitize their defined

contribution balance when they retire.19 Finally, we ignore potential income from defined benefit

pensions.

        With the assumptions we have made, we can compute the returns to working longer for

each individual. Since the returns will differ across people based on individual factors, we plot in

Figures 3 through 8 the distributions of the returns to working longer and consider how these vary

based on individual characteristics and assumptions made.



19
   The initial defined contribution balance is the sum of the current balance in plans 1 through 4 (variable names
R`w’DCBAL1- R`w’DCBAL4, where `w’ indicates the wave number. We used the latest available balance we have
in the data. For many individuals since is the balance prior to age 61/62.

                                                                                                               31
       In Figure 3 we plot the distribution of returns to working longer for our full sample. Returns

vary from about 3% to double-digit returns. The mean and median are 7.4% and 6.9%,

respectively, not much higher than the 6.7% returns found in Table 3 for a 62 year old stylized

worker.



                       Figure 3: Returns to Working One Year Longer




               Note: Returns are calculated for all primary earners in the HRS data aged
               61/62 in waves 10, 11 or 12. Calculations assume returns on wealth are
               equal to zero and a 9 percent contribution rate.




       Figure 4 below presents the distribution of the returns to working longer based on income

quartiles, corresponding to the analysis of stylized workers at different income levels in Section

2.4. The only difference is that our stylized workers were assumed to be 66, while the empirical

analysis is done for individuals aged 62. The figure shows that returns tend to be more disperse

for higher income households relative to lower income households. While the mean return for all

income groups is about the same, the majority of households at the lowest income quartile


                                                                                                   32
receive returns around 6-8% returns, while middle and top income quartile households’ returns

are more spread out.

              Note: Returns are calculated for all primary earners in the HRS data aged
              61/62 in waves 10, 11 or 12. Calculations assume returns on wealth are
              equal to zero and a 9 percent contribution rate. We exclude in the graph
              returns below 3% and above 14% to focus attention on the majority of the
              return distribution.




       Figure 5 illustrates the impact of working for an additional three or eight years (as

opposed to one year). Unsurprisingly, working eight years longer has a much larger impact on

retirement living standards than working one year longer. The figure suggests that working eight

additional years will increase retirement income by at least 40% and above 100% for some

individuals. There is a large mass of people gaining just below 80%, which corresponds well

with our stylized example in Table 3.



                                                                                                33

               61/62 in waves 10, 11 or 12. Calculations assume returns on wealth are
               equal to zero and a 9 percent contribution rate.


       Who gains the most from working eight additional years? To answer that question, Table

10 presents the means of a number of variables for the full sample as well as those in the top 5

percent of the returns distribution. Those with higher returns are less likely to be married. They

also have shorter working histories (less than 35 on average), so part of the return from working

longer likely comes from the impact of the additional year’s salary on AIME. But the biggest

difference between the full sample and those at the top of the returns distribution is the average

defined contribution balance at age 62. The average DC balance of the top 5 percent is a fifth of

the average DC balance of the full sample. When low-balance individuals save 9% of their

                                                                                                     34
annual wage during additional years of work (where their final annual wage is about the same in

the two groups), they more than triple their savings. With the change in annuity prices due to age

they more than quadruple their annuity income.

        Next, we consider the impact of changing the real asset return assumption. In Table 2 we

saw that when real asset returns increase, the gains to working longer increase as well, although

the impact was small. Figure 6 reflects the same conclusion for our sample. The figure presents

the distribution of returns to working an additional year for individuals at age 62 assuming zero

and five percent asset returns. The distributions are fairly similar at all asset returns with a slight

shift to the right as the asset returns rate increases.



    Figure 6: Returns to Working One Year Longer by Real Asset Return Environment




                Note: Returns are calculated for all primary earners in the HRS data aged
                61/62 in waves 10, 11 or 12. Calculations assume a 9 percent contribution
                rate. We exclude in the graph returns below 3% and above 14% to focus
                attention on the majority of the return distribution.


        In Figure 7 we consider the impact of marital status and gender on the returns to working

longer. Our stylized examples presented in Figure 2 indicated that returns are highest for single

males and lowest for couples. The main driver of this result is the change in annuity price from

delaying an additional year. As expected, the distribution of returns for couples lies slightly to

the left of the distributions for singles. However, in contrast to the stylized examples, single

                                                                                                     36
females seem to have larger returns. This might occur because single women in the data have

lower incomes on average than single men, while our stylized examples assumed the same

income for both genders.

               equal to zero and a 9 percent contribution rate. Graph includes observations
               from the 5th to the 90th percentiles so that each bin includes at least 10
               people, in accordance with the restricted HRS data use requirements.


       Figure 8 shows the marginal incentive to work, as described in Section 3.6, for our HRS

sample. The median primary earner would receive the equivalent of an extra 29.9% of final year

salary if they were to work an additional year. The 25th and 75th percentiles of this distribution

are 18.3% and 44.4% of final salary, respectively. These results suggest that the Social Security

formula provides a sizeable incentive to delay the onset of Social Security and work longer if the

claiming and retirement decisions are tied together. Understanding this incentive provides

valuable information for workers considering options to boost retirement living standards.




                                                                                                     38
       5. Conclusion.

       Our primary conclusion is that working longer is relatively powerful compared to saving

more for most people. Our initial base case stylized primary earner illustrates why that is the

case. Recall, the base case was someone who started saving for retirement at age 36, who

contributed a total of 9 percent of earnings to a 401(k) plan, who experienced 0 percent real wage

growth and 0 percent real investment returns during their career, and who retired and

commenced Social Security at age 66. Sustainable income in retirement was composed

primarily of Social Security (81 percent), with a smaller proportion coming from the annuitized

401(k) balance (19 percent). By working longer and deferring the commencement of Social

Security, the primary earner could increase both the Social Security monthly benefit and the

annuitized monthly income. That is, working longer affects both components of retirement

income. On the other hand, by saving more, the primary earner could only increase the

annuitized 401(k) balance, which makes up only 19 percent of retirement income. For instance,

by saving 10 percent rather than 9 percent for the entire 30 years, the affordable 401(k) annuity

increases by 11.11%, but that increase applies to only 19 percent of retirement income.

Therefore, it is not surprising that only 3 months of additional work generates the same increase

in retirement income as 30 years of saving an additional one percentage point of earnings. When

we look at different rates of return on assets, different ages of retirement and at singles vs.

married primary earners, the general result remains that working 3 to 6 extra months has an

equivalent impact on the affordable sustainable standard of living as saving one percentage point

more for 30 years. Increases in saving that start later in life have a proportionately smaller

impact, increasing the power of working longer for individuals who are reoptimizing close to

retirement.



                                                                                                    39
       Our empirical results are understandably nosier than our stylized results, but at the same

time very consistent with them. They reflect that for most people, Social Security supplies a

large fraction of retirement income. Deferring retirement increases all sources of retirement

income, whereas saving more only increases the relatively small contribution of annuitized

defined contribution balances. The saving adjustment required to achieve a particular increase in

retirement income is larger the later in the career that the adjustment takes place. In other words,

saving more gets less powerful as the career progresses, but deferring retirement remains equally

powerful.

       Obviously, the choice of whether to work longer, save more, or adjust the retirement

standard of living depends on individuals’ preferences. However, by laying out the tradeoffs, we

hope that this paper helps people plan for their retirement and helps them reoptimize their

retirement plans in the face of changing circumstances. Not everyone has control over their

retirement date, but certainly many people do. We have shown that career length is a powerful

determinant of the standard of living in retirement. Roughly speaking, deferring retirement by

one year allows for an 8 percent higher standard of living for a couple and the subsequent

survivor. The effect compounds for two, three, and four-year work extensions. The impact of

working longer relative to saving more increases as individuals get closer to retirement. Thus,

working longer may be a much more attractive option than saving more for people who are

reoptimizing their retirement plans ten or so years before retirement.

A.1 Individual and Household Income
The following figures illustrates the distribution of individual and household income for the
people in our sample.

A.2 Defined Contribution Balances
The following figures illustrate the distribution of household defined contribution balances both
including and excluding zero balances. The graph on the left indicates that, zero balances are
very common, comprising almost 60% of the balances in our sample. The graph on the right
illustrates that even when zero balances are removed, the distribution of balances is skewed to
the left, with most balances below $50,000. This indicates that for most households, Social
Security is likely the main source of income during retirement. (Note that our analysis ignores
any defined benefit income.)

A.3 Career Length
Figure A.3 illustrates the distribution of career lengths in our sample. The majority of individuals
have a career length of 35 years or more, suggesting that additional years of work will have at
most a small impact on AIME.
