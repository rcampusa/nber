    WORKERS' COMPENSATION INSURANCE AND THE DURATION OF WORKPLACE INJURIES


                                    ABSTRACT


      This   paper uses a new administrative micro-data set to examine the effect

of a legislated increase in the minimum and maximum workers' compensation

benefit on the duration of workplace injuries in Minnesota. As a result of

legislation, workers in some earnings groups received higher benefits if they

were injured after the effective date of the benefit increase, while workers

in other earnings groups received the same benefit regardless of when they

were injured. The analysis compares the change in mean log   injury duration

for workers who were affected by the benefit increase to that of workers who

were not affected by the benefit increase. The findings indicate that the

duration of injuries increased by 8 percent more for the group of workers that

experienced a 5 percent increase in benefits than for the group of workers

that had no change in their benefit. Additional findings suggest that

employees of self-insured firms who are injured on the job tend to return to
                                                             firms who incur
work faster than employees of imperfectly experience rated

similar injuries.

      Work-related disabilities are an unfortunate and costly consequence of

production. In a typical year, more than fifty times as many working days are

lost to work injuries as are lost to labor strikes, and from one-half to one-

third as many working days are lost to work injuries as are lost to

unemployinent) The total amount of working time foregone because of

work-related disabilities is the product of the incidence of work-related

injuries and the average duration of time spent away from work once an injury

has occurred.2 This paper examines how workers' compensation insurance and

other factors influence the duration of lost work time that results from work-

related injuries and illnesses.

       Workers' compensation insurance is the primary public program for workers

who experience a work-related injury or illness. In recent years, nearly

half of all workers who missed one or more days of work because of a work

injury collected workers' compensation benefits.3 Previous research has

focused on the impact of providing more generous benefits on injured

employees' incentives to return to work. This research is limited, however,

by the difficulty of identifying separate benefit and wage effects because

benefits are typically determined as a function of the worker's pre-disability

wage. Moreover, workers' compensation insurance may also affect employers'

incentives to encourage disabled workers to return to work. In particular,

privately insured firms have little incentive to induce injured workers to

return to work because insurance premiums are often imperfectly experience

rated, while self-insured firms have a stronger incentive because they bear

the full marginal cost of workers' compensation benefits. The effect of

employers' incentives on the duration of workplace injuries has received

little attention in the literature.

       In this paper, I use longitudinal data on workers' compensation claims in
                                              2

  Minnesota to examine how both
                                   employees' and employers' incentives influence
  the duration of nonwork spells
                                   following workplace injuries. The analysis is
  based on an unusual natural
                                experiment that was created by a legislated
                                                                               change
  in the benefit schedule which raised
                                          the minimum and maximum benefits
                                                                             during
  the sample period. As a result of
                                       this benefit change, identical workers who
  qualify for the maximum or minimum benefits would
                                                       receive different benefit
  amounts depending on whether they were
                                            injured before or after the date of the
 benefit change. On the other hand, workers' who did not receive the maximum

 or minimum benefits form a control
                                       group because their benefits were the same
 regardless of when they were injured. Unlike
                                                  previous studies, this natural
 experiment allows one to compare the duration of
                                                     work injuries for workers in
 the same state who earn the exact
                                      same wage but received different workers'
 compensation benefits.

        This quasi-experiment is used to address
                                                    the following questions: How
 does the average duration and composition of temporary total workers'

compensation claims respond to changes in benefits?      Are short or long term
injuries more responsive to a benefit increase? Do
                                                        employees of self-insured
firms who are injured on the job have
                                         shorter spells away from work than
employees of firms that purchase insurance from
                                                    private insurance companies or
from the competitive state fund? Does
                                           the relationship between injury
duration and benefits vary between self-insured
                                                   and privately insured firms?
       The findings indicate that the average duration of temporary total

injuries is extremely responsive to the level of benefits paid. A comparison

of changes in durations before and after a 5 percent increase in the maximum

and minimuj benefits shows that the average duration of claims increased by

about 8 percent more for the group of workers that experienced a benefit
                                         3


increase due to the schedule change than for the group of workers that was

unaffected by the increase in the maximum and minimum benefits. Moreover, the

estimated effect of benefits on the duration of work injuries is qualitatively

different when the natural experiment is ignored and rionlinearities in the

benefit schedule are used to estimate the benefit and wage effects.

       In addition, employees of self-insured firms are found to have shorter

spells on workers' compensation than employees of privately insured firms, and

the average duration of injuries is found to be more responsive to the

increase in benefits in imperfectly experience rated firms than in self-

insured firms. These results suggest that employers' insurance incentives

also have an effect on the duration of work injuries.

       The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section I discusses

relevant institutional features of the Minnesota workers' compensation system

and briefly reviews the past literature. Section II presents several

difference-in-differences estimators of the effect of benefits on injury

duration based on the natural experiment created by the revision in the

benefit schedule. Section III presents multivariate estimates of the effect

of benefits on the duration of injuries based on the exogenous variation in

benefits caused by the change in the benefit schedule. Section IV estimates

the injury duration-benefit elasticity for a sample of workers with short-term

injuries, and for separate samples of self-insured and nonself-insured firms.

Section V contrasts estimates of the injury duration-benefit elasticity

identified by the change in the benefit schedule to those identified by

nonlinearities in the benefit schedule. Section VI contains a summary and

conclusion.

   I.    A Description of Workers'
                                     Compensation Insurance

           Temporary total injuries are the most
                                                       common type of claim in the
  workers' compensation system. A
                                    temporary total injury is one that renders an
  employee completely unable to work for
                                          a finite period of time. Most
                                                                         injuries
  are initially classified as a
                                temporary total claim. Cases
                                                               involving injuries
  that result in some form of
                              permanent impairment are reclassified as either a

  permanent partial or permanent total case
                                                  upon attaining maximum medical
  improvement, depending on whether the
                                          worker is healthy enough to return to
 work and on the type of impairment.
                                          In well over 90% of
                                                                  cases, employees
 return to work upon attaining maximum
                                          medical improvement.4
         Figure 1 displays the schedule that
                                                  was used to compute weekly benefits
 for temporary total cases in Minnesota in the beginning of l986.
                                                                           In essence,
 the workers' compensation benefit
                                      equals two-thirds of a workers'

 Pre-disability weekly wage, subject to a maximum weekly benefit
                                                                 payment
 ($342), and a minimum weekly benefit
                                      payment ($171). There is a further
 stipulation, however, that workers' whose
                                              earnings make them subject to the
minimum benefit be paid their
                                weekly wage if their weekly wage is less than
 the minimum. Lastly, there is a second minimum ($68.40) that
                                                               establishes a
absolute floor for benefits,
                             even for workers who earn less than the second
minimujn. It can be observed from
                                  Figure 1 that this benefit structure
                                                                        creates
a "two-tier" minimums in which
                               workers earning less that $256.50 per week are
paid the first minimum ($171) if their Pre-disabijjty
                                                      wage exceeds the first
minimum, exactly their wage if it is between the first minimum and
                                                                   the
absolute minimum, or the absolute minimum if their
                                                   wage is less than this
absolute floor.

        It Should be noted that, for a number
                                                  of   reasons, Figure 1 is a slight

  simplification of the actual benefit computation
                                                       formula. The value of
  certain fringe benefits, such as room and board, will be added to the weekly

  wage to compute benefits in cases where the provision of these
                                                                     fringes is
  curtailed as a result of the injury.
                                          Furthermore, minors and apprentices who

 experience an injury that is expected to result in any permanent impairment

 are paid the maximum benefit regardless of their
                                                      pre-injury earnings.
 Finally, if an employee has a second job, his combined
                                                            earnings from both jobs
 will be used to calculate the workers'
                                          compensation benefit.6 In most

 temporary total cases, however, Figure 1 represents the
                                                             relationship between
 past earnings and workers' compensation benefits.

        Maximum and minimum benefits are revised each year on October 1 by the

 Minnesota legislature to keep pace with past statewide wage growth. The

 maximum and minimum benefits are specified
                                                as a certain percentage of the

 average weekly wage for the calendar year ending on December 31 of the

preceding year. For example, the maximum benefit
                                                      payable is 100 percent of
the statewide average weekly wage. Injuries that occur on or after October 1

are subject to the new benefit schedule, while those
                                                         that occurred prior to
October 1. remain subject to the former benefit schedule. The next section

demonstrates how legislated changes in the minimum and maximum benefits can be

used to estimate the impact of benefits on the duration of claims.

       Benefits are payable for the duration of the disability in temporary

total cases. However, an employer or insurer may initiate administrative

proceedings to discontinue benefits if it believes that an employee has

recovered from his or her disability but continues to receive workers'

compensation benefits. In Minnesota, an employer may not dismiss an employee

for pursuing a workers' compensation claim.     Most cases are concluded without
                                        6

an administrative proceeding, and in the vast majority of temporary total

cases, employees return to work for their former employer.7

       Because workers' compensation insurance reduces the financial burden of

work injuries, many observers have hypothesized that more generous

workers' compensation benefits will lead workers to increase their reservation

wage for returning to work (e.g., Richard Butler and John Worrall, 1985). A

higher reservation wage, in turn, will lead injured workers to prolong their

spell on workers' compensation insurance.

       One problem with this argument is that most injured workers return to

their former job at exactly their pvc-disability wage.8 As a consequence,

their reservation wage must be no higher than it was before the injury

occurred. A more plausible explanation for a positive relationship between

benefits and work injuries is that workers experience greater disutility from

work the more quickly they return to work after suffering an injury. For

example, a back injury is likely to cause an employee more pain if he returns

to work after resting one day than after resting one week. In this view,

higher benefits increase average durations by raising workers' reservation

health level, which explains why wages are typically unchanged after spells on

workers' compensation insurance.

       Past studies have typically found a positive relationship between the

average duration of workers' compensation spells and the benefit level. For

example, Butler and Worrall (1985) estimate that a 10 percent increase in

benefits is associated with a 3.8 percent increase in the length of temporary

total lower back injury claims using data for Illinois.9 As Ehrenberg (1988)

notes, however, the fact that benefits are a nondecreasing. nonlinear function

of the predisability wage makes it impossible to disentangle the effect of
                                             7

 benefits from the effect of wages in a
                                           cross-sectional study of one state's
 workers' compensation program. Since workers of
                                                        different earnings levels may

                                                             worker's pre-disability
 wage rate may directly influence the length of workers' compensation
                                                                            spells
 and thus confound estimates of the effect of benefits.

         Furthermore, a cross-state analysis of the effect of benefits      on duration
 is unavoidably hindered by the fact that many relevant institutional factors

 besides benefits differ across the states. For example, disabled workers are

 required to wait between three and seven days to become
                                                              eligible for benefits,

 depending on the state. The waiting period will influence the measured

average duration of claims in a state. Similarly, unobserved differences in

 the administration of workers' compensation laws are likely to affect the

duration of injuries. Studies of injury duration based on inter-state

variations in benefits, such as John Worrall, Richard       Butler, Philip Borba and
David Durbin (1989) and William Johnson and Jan Ondrich (1989), are unable to

control for all the institutional features of workers'
                                                             compensation insurance
that vary across states.



II.   Enrntrical   Evidence on Benefits and Injury Duration: A Natural Experiment

        Increases in the minimum and maximum benefits create a natural experiment

that can be used to estimate the effect of
                                                 increasing workers' compensation
benefits on the duration of work injury claims. 10      Figure 2 illustrates how
this experiment works. As a result of the legislated, nonretroactjve increase

in the maximum benefit and minimum benefits, individuals whose pre-disability

earnings place them on segments A, C, and E of Figure 1 received a 5 percent

greater weekly benefit if they were injured on or after October 1 than if      they

  were injured before that date. For example, the
                                                        weekly benefit increased from
  $342 to $360 for high-wage earners on October
                                                     1, 1986.11 On the other hand,
  workers whose earnings fall into segments B and D form natural control
                                                                              groups
  because their benefit was the same
                                        regardless of when they were injured.
  Finally, the small sample of individuals with
                                                    earnings in the gray areas
 between the distinct earnings
                                 segments are excluded from the analysis because

 their benefits increased by an amount between 0 and 5 percent.

        If more generous benefits truly induce longer workers' compensation

 spells, we should observe longer spell durations for
                                                           those in segments A, C
 and E who were injured after October 1 than for those with the same earnings

 but with injuries pre-dating the October 1
                                                 increase. Furthermore, the
 experience of individuals in segments B and D allow us to control for any

 other changes that might have occurred in this time period. Time-varying

 factors that affect the duration of claims
                                                 (e.g., possible changes in
administrative procedures) can be differenced out by computing the difference

in the change in average duration between
                                             individuals on segments A, C and E,
and those on segments B and D before and after the benefit change. Moreover,

there are six possible pairings of "treatment"
                                                    and "control" groups because of
the two-tier structure of minimums.

D4ta and Emojrjcpl Results

       The data analyzed here are taken from administrative records on temporary

total claims filed by insurers and self-insured
                                                     employers in Minnesota. This
data set contains a rich collection of
                                          information on the duration of claims,

injury characteristics form of insurance,
                                              pre-disability wage, weekly
benefit, and demographic characteristic of workers' compensation recipients.

claims for injuries that occurred in 1986.12 To eliminate gross errors in the

benefit and wage data, the sample is restricted to individuals whose reported

temporary total benefit is within $10 of the benefit that is calculated from

the applicable benefit schedule and the reported weekly wage. Less than 5

percent of observations were deleted by this criterion.13

       The data set includes all claims for temporary total injuries in

Minnesota that originated in 1986 and closed by July 1989; incomplete spells

are truncated. But because an estimated 99 percent of temporary total

workers' compensation claims close in less than three years, the truncation of

incomplete spells does not present a serious problem (Minnesota Department of

Labor and Industry, 1988, P. 29).   Furthermore, in a later specification I

avoid the truncation issue entirely by restricting the sample to short-term

injuries, such as broken fingers and sprained ankles; virtually all of these
                                                   14
injuries would have closed in the sample period.

       Table 1 summarizes estimates of the change in duration of temporary total

injuries that occurred before and after the benefit increases for each

earnings category. The table shows a clear pattern. There is a statistically

significant increase in the average duration of temporary total claims after

October 1 for each of the three groups of workers (segment A,C,E of Figure 2)

for which benefits were increased. For example, workers in group E, who

qualified for the maximum benefit, had an average log duration of 1.101 weeks

if they were injured before the benefit increase, and an average log duration

of 1.233 if they were injured after the benefit increase. The difference

between these two numbers, which is reported in Column 3, indicates that the

average duration of claims increased by about 13.2 percent for workers who

received the higher maximum benefit. The average duration of claims increased

by a similar magnitude, 11 percent. for workers at the first minimum, and by

24 percent for the sample of workers at the absolute minimum.

       In contrast, workers in the two earnings segments (B and D) that had no

benefit change in spite of the higher maximum and minimums, exhibit no

statistically significant change in their average duration of claims after

October 1st.15 This finding suggests that the observed longer durations for

workers who received the higher benefits would not have occurred in the

absence of the benefit increase.

       The average log weekly benefit is reported in Table I to measure the

benefit changes during the sample periods. As noted earlier, benefits

increased by 5 percent for those who receive the maximum or one of the minimum

benefits. However, because the weekly wage is inferred from the First Report

Form and in some cases does not reflect the wage rate that was actually used

to determine benefits (e.g., wages from secondary employment and fringe

benefits are omitted), the benefit does not increase by exactly 5 percent for

individuals in segments A, C, and E. Nonetheless, the measured benefit

increases for the period after October 1 are extremely close to 5 percent for

workers in segments A, C, and E. In addition, the change in the average log

benefit is statistically insignificant and trivial for the groups of workers

in segments B and D, which were not affected by the maximum or minimum benefit

increase. Consequently, workers on segment B and D appear to form valid

control groups.

       A difference-in-differences estimate of the elasticity of the average

temporary total duration with respect to benefits ().can be calculated from

the information reported in Table 1 as        —   (Tt   -

                                                    workers in segment k. Six possible
  elasticities can be Calculated because there
                                                      are three groups that experienced
  a benefit increase (i's), and two groups that had an insignificant change in

  their benefit (i's). The estimated elasticities are:



                              AB               AD
                          ,        —3.68             —3.39

                                   —1.69             —1.22
                              EB —             ED —
                                   2.11             1.67


        Even if we discount the two large elasticities
                                                              derived from the imprecise
 estimate for segment A, the above elasticities are substantial. The

 unweighted average of the elasticities, excluding those
                                                                based on segment A, is
 1.67. This estimate is much larger than
                                               the elasticity that Butler and
 Worrall reported for temporary total back cases, and somewhat larger than

 Johnson and Ondrichs estimated
                                    elasticity for permanent partial cases.

       Figure 3 contains plots of the weekly return-to-work hazard rate for

workers in Segment E (the maximum
                                      benefit), depending on whether the injury
occurred before or after the benefit increase.
                                                       The figure depicts the
proportion of ongoing injuries that    close   each week, through the fiftieth
week. For both groups of workers, the
                                           plots show a sharply declining hazard
rate. Overall, more than half of all cases end within the first month, and

nearly three-quarters end within the first two months. The mean injury

duration is 8 weeks.

       In each of the first seven weeks, the
                                                    exit rate is greater for workers
who were injured before the benefit increase than for those who were injured

prior to the benefit increase. Over the

                                                                                  C,

 which are not reported here, show a similar pattern to Figure 3. These

 results suggest that benefit increases have a somewhat greater effect on

 recipients with relatively short term injuries.

        Finally, notice that Table 1 also shows that the average duration of

 workers' compensation spells increases with earnings in this sample. For

 example, workers with weekly earnings below $68.40 on average have

 substantially shorter injury spells than workers who earn in excess of $560

 per week. This finding is surprising in view of past cross-sectional studies,

 which found that average duration increases with the proportion of lost wages

 replaced by workers' compensation benefits, because individuals with low

 earnings have a higher replacement rate than individuals with
                                                                 high earnings.
As will be discussed below, the negative
                                           relationship between replacement
rates and duration illustrates the difficulty of drawing inferences when there

is not exogenous variation in benefits and wages.

composition of Injuries

       An increase in benefits may affect the incidence as well as the duration

of workers' compensation claims. Therefore, the composition of temporary

total injuries may be affected by an increase in the benefit level. A

composition change would result if, for example, the availability of more

generous benefits after a benefit increase encourages some workers with

relatively minor injuries to pursue claims that they would otherwise have

ignored in the absence of a benefit increase. On the other
                                                             hand, higher
benefits may induce some workers to take more risks on the job, which may
                                        13

result in more serious injuries.

       Table 2 explores the impact of changing benefits on the composition of

workers' compensation claims by estimating the relative frequency of claims

for various types of injuries for workers on the different segments of Figure

2, before and after the benefit increase. The results indicate that the

relative frequency of injuries involving bone fractures increased slightly for

workers who experienced a benefit increase, but was hardly changed for workers

on the segments that were unaffected by the benefit increase. The relative

frequency of fractures after October 1 increased by an average of 3 percent

for workers on segments A, C, and E, while there was a slight decrease in the

relative frequency of cases involving fractures for workers in segments B and

D. On the other hand, there is no discernable difference in the pattern of

changes in the share of cases involving sprains, back injuries, or multiple

injuries for workers in the different benefit segments.



III. çontrollnz for Covariate

        Because of potential compositional changes in workers' compensation

recipients in response to a change in benefits, it is desirable to control for

covariates in estimating the duration response to a benefit increase.      In the

                                                                           model
 absence of truncation and censoring, the log-linear multiple regression

 corresponds to a class of duration models known as the accelerated failure

 time model. The accelerated failure time model encompasses a wide array of

 parametric duration models, including the Weibull model,   the log-normal model,

 the generalized gamma model, and the log-logistic model (see John KalbfleisCh

log-linear regression model seems a preferable alternative for estimating the

duration of temporary total claims than making parametric distributional

assumptions to handle truncation.

      A fairly general model to explain the duration of injury spells as a

function of benefits and other covariates is:



(1) In Ti —        + a1A   +          +          +
                               a2Bi       a3C1       a4D

                                                                               3C.1n(Wage1)
                                      +
               +
                   fi4D.ln(Wage)          vi1n(Benefit) +     X111
                                                                     +




where Ti is the completed spell duration for worker i. The variables denoted

by a capital letter,                                 are dummy variables that indicate the
                               B. C or
earnings segment along the horizontal axis of Figure 2 in which each worker is

categorized. For example, if worker i earns less than $68.40 per week, dummy

variable A will equal 1 and the other dummies (B C, D) will equal zero.

These dummy variables are interacted with the log of the weekly wage to allow

for piecewise linear effects of past earnings on injury spells. Parameters

are denoted by greek letters. The coefficient, t, is the elasticity of injury

duration with respect to benefits, which is assumed constant across

individuals. The vector             denotes covariates, including dummies for the type

of injury and insurance arrangement, and                   is a random disturbance.

       Furthermore, since the benefit level changed for workers in some earnings

groups but not for workers in other groups, equation (1) could also include a

dummy variable, Zj which equals 1 if the worker was injured after the benefit

increase went into effect, and 0 otherwise. Including z, as shown in

equation (2), will net out additive period effects that might be correlated
                                                     15

 with the change in benefits.



  (2) in T — a    +         +          +         +
                      a1A       a2Bi       a3C       a4D

                +
                   4D1.ln(Wage) + ?7in(Benefit) + xr1 + 6z +

        The wage terms in equation (2) are designed to absorb the benefit

 schedule at a point in time. Therefore, the variation in benefits due to the

 nonlinear benefit schedule has been partialied out. But in Minnesota there is

 also idiosyncratic variation in benefits for workers who earn the same wage

because, in some cases, benefits are affected by the payment of fringe

benefits, apprenticeship status, and other factors.        Additionally, the
observed wage variable is measured with some error because it is derived from

the First Report. If equation (2) is estimated by Ordinary Least Squares

(OLS) effect of the benefit is identified by both idiosyncratic variation in

benefits (at the same wage) and by the change in the benefit scheduie)6

       Since the idiosyncratic variation in benefits is not necessarily a

legitimate source of variation to use to identify the benefit elasticity, it

is desirable to estimate the benefit elasticity from variations in benefits

that are solely due to the interteniporal change in the benefit schedule. This

is accomplished by estimating equation (2) by Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS),

using dummy variables indicating whether an individual is in segment A.B.C or

D and injured after the benefit change, along with the included variables in

(2), as instruments for the benefit variable. In other
                                                             words, equation (2) is

identified by the exclusion restriction of the vector of interactions, (zj.Ai,

z1'B1, z1•C1, zi.Dj). It should be noted that if the legislated benefit
                                         16

 change was the only source of linearly independent variations in
                                                                    benefits,
 then estimation of equation (2) by 2SLS and by OLS would be identical.

 Estimates

        Columns 1 and 2 of Table 3 present OLS estimates of
                                                              equation (2), and
Columns 3 and 4 present 2SLS estimates. In both the OLS and 2SLS estimates,

the first equation excludes covariates, and the second equation includes

several covariates   Means and standard deviations of the variables are also

provided in the table.'7

       The OLS estimates yield a larger benefit elasticity than the 2SLS

estimates. Moreover, a Hausman test rejects the hypothesis that the OLS    and

2SLS estimates of the benefit elasticity are equal at the .05 level, whether

covariates are included or excluded from the equation. Since the benefit

effect in the 2SLS equation is identified solely by variation created by a

legislative act that could reasonably be taken as exogenous in this case, the

idiosyncratic variation in benefits is not likely to be a legitimate source of

variation to use to identify the benefit elasticity. For this reason, the

2SLS estimate, which relies solely on time-series variation in benefits, is

probably more reliable.

       The elasticity estimated by 2SLS without covariates is 1.83 (t—2.ll),

which is similar in magnitude to the difference-in-differences elasticities

presented in Section 2. The addition of covariates slightly reduces the

estimated benefit elasticity in both the OLS and 2SLS estimates, suggesting

that compositional changes are not very significant. The estimated elasticity

of 1.67 in Column 4 implies that a 10 percent increase in benefits would

increase the average duration of temporary total work injuries by one week.

 table to test whether the instruments are orthogonal
                                                        to the residual in the

 2SLS equations. Although these specification test results suggest that the

 model is correctly specified, the results are not compelling in view of the

 imprecision of the instrumented coefficient. On the other hand, the    quasi-
 experimental nature of the instruments lends some additional support for the

 plausibility of the 2SLS estimation strategy.

        The coefficients on the wage terms indicate that the
                                                               pre-disability wage
has a complicated, nonlinear effect on injury duration.    Within most of the

 earnings brackets, the duration decreases with the wage rate, as evidenced
                                                                              by
 the negative coefficients on the wage-earnings segment interactions. It

should also be noted that the dummy for injuries occurring after October 1 is

statistically insignificant, suggesting that period effects are unimportant.

       The estimated coefficients for the remaining covariates are very similar

in the OLS and 2SLS models. The point estimates indicate that    the duration of

temporary total spells is about 10 percent shorter in self-insured firms than

in privately insured firms (the omitted dummy variable), and that the duration

of spells is about 15 percent shorter in firms insured by the Minnesota State

Fund than by a private insurance carrier. Moreover, the difference in the

duration between self-insured firms and the State Fund is not statistically

significant. The spell length is longest at firms covered by the Minnesota

Assigned Risk Pool, which only accepts firms with inferior safety records.

       A discussed in more detail below, a possible explanation for the shorter

injury duration at self-insured firms than privately insured firms is that

self-insured employers bear the full marginal cost of benefits, while

insurance premiums are only partially adjusted accident costs at privately

insured firms. This financial arrangement provides self-insured firms with    a
                                            18

 strong incentive relative to privately insured firms
                                                          to encourage workers to
 return to work quickly after an injury. On the
                                                     other hand, the group of firms
 that selects into self-insurance
                                     may have injuries that are less severe than
 privately insured firms, even after controlling for
                                                        observable covariates.
         The estimates also indicate that men have
                                                     shorter injury spells than
 women, white collar workers have shorter injury spells than
                                                                blue collar
 workers, and younger workers have shorter injury spells than older workers.

 Interestingly, being married tends to extend the length of time on workers'

 compensation insurance for women, but has no effect for men. Employees who

work in larger establishments return to work after injuries faster than

employees in smaller establishments, perhaps due to the fact that it is easier

to facilitate injured workers in large establishments.'8
                                                              Larger
establishments are also more likely to be experience rated.

        Several injury characteristic dummy variables are included in the

equations estimated in Columns 2 and 4 but not reported in the table. To

summarize their effects, the results indicate that injuries    involving an

amputation, nervous disorder, hernia, or heart ailment, and injuries to the

back and to multiple body parts have relatively long spell durations. On the

other hand, scratches, cuts, contusions, and injuries to the lower extremities

have relatively short spell durations.



IV.   Estimates   for Selected Subspmples

A. Short-Term Injuries

       Table 4 presents 2SLS estimates of injury duration equations including

covariates for several different samples. For convenience, Column 1

replicates the estimates for the full sample. Column 2 presents an estimate
                                        19

of the same equation for the subset of workers with injuries that on average

close in less than 10 weeks. The sample of short-term injuries includes such

injuries as lacerations, scratches, and poison ivy infections.'9 The purpose

of presenting results for the sample of workers with short-term injuries is

twofold. First, it is likely that none of the spell durations for these types

of injuries is truncated. Second, it is useful to know whether the duration

of short-term injuries is relatively more responsive to changes in benefits.

       The results for the sample of workers with short-term injuries are

similar to those for the overall sample. The effect of benefits on injury

duration is slightly greater in the sample of short-term injuries than in the

full sample. The difference in the benefit elasticities, however, is not

statistically significant. In addition, the effect of the covariates is

similar in the sample of short-term injuries and in the full sample. These

results suggest that, as expected, truncation of very long-term injuries in

this sample has little effect on the estimates.

B. Form of Insurance

       In Minnesota, employers can satisfy their workers' compensation insurance

requirement by purchasing insurance from a private insurance carrier or from

the competitive state insurance fund, or by self-insuring. Permission to

self-insure is typically only granted to large, financially solvent firms.2°

Employers who are unable to provide insurance through other means may be

eligible for coverage by the Minnesota State Assigned Risk Pool, which insures

high-risk firms. Privately insured firms account for approximately 70 percent

of injuries, and self-insured firms account for nearly 20 percent of injuries.

The Minnesota Competitive State Fund is relatively new and quite small,

handling just 3 percent of injuries that occur in the state. The alternative

 insurance arrangements provide different incentives for firms to invest

 resources in accident prevention and to rehabilitate
                                                        disabled employees.
        In the event of a work-related injury, self-insured
                                                              firms are required to
 provide the same level of workers' compensation benefits
                                                            as firms that are
 insured through private carriers or the state.   Self-insurers must maintain a
 security account with a balance of at least 110 percent of their
                                                                    expected
annual workers' compensation costs. The firm's subsequent Workers'

compensation losses are drawn from this account. As a result,
                                                                 self-insurers
bear the full marginal cost of injuries.

        In contrast, insurance premiums for firms covered by the state fund,

private carriers, or the Assigned Risk Pool are imperfectly modified to

reflect an employer's past loss experience. Insurance premiums are typically

determined by a weighted average of the firm's last three year's accident

experience and the average accident experience in the firm's industry.

Greater weight is placed on the firm's past insurance losses for larger firms.

At one extreme, very small firms are "manual rated," which means they are

charged the insurance rate for their industry listed in the state's rating

manual regardless of their actual experience. For very large firms, most or

all of the weight is placed on the firm's own experience. Louise Russel

(1973) estimates that more than 80 percent of employees work in firms that      are

not fully experience rated for their workers' compensation costs.

      Moreover, even in fully experience-rated firms, the typical experience-

rating formula places greater emphasis on the incidence of past workers'

compensation claims than on the severity (i.e., duration x average benefit) of

injuries in determining experience-rating offset. This practice, known as

"loss limitations," is accomplished by discounting the amount of losses
                                        21

incurred for claimS that cost more than $2,000, and by capping the maximum

loss for a claim. The severity of injuries is given little weight in

experience rating modifications because the conventional view in the insurance

industry is that the duration of work injuries is beyond the employers'

control (National Council on Compensation Insurance, 1982).

       There are several ways, however, in which an employer might be able to

affect the duration of an employee's workers' compensation claim. First, an

employer could modify a disabled employee's work environment to accommodate

his or her disability. Second, an employer could arrange for a temporarily

disabled employee to perform alternate job tasks until he or she is fully

recovered. Third, an employer could have an employee initially return to work

on a part-time basis. Fourth, an employer could apply pressure on the

employee to rapidly return to work. Finally, an employer might file for a

discontinuance of benefits or challenge a claim if it is believed that a

beneficiary is malingering.

       A comparison of the duration of temporary total claims in self-insured

and nonseif-insured firms provides a test of whether firms' incentives

influence the amount of work time their employees lose after a workplace

injury. Because self-insured firms directly bear a greater share of the

marginal cost of providing workers' compensation benefits to employees, these

firms have a greater incentive to induce their workers to quickly return to

work. The regression results in Table 3 indicate that self-insured firms have

about a 10% shorter average injury duration than privately insured firms.21

Moreover, in results not reported here, self-insured firms were found to have

shorter injury durations than privately insured firms in a variety of

homogeneous injuries, including hernias, broken fingers, and sprained ankles.

                                                                    estimating

                                                     types of employers. The results
 are suggestive. The benefit elasticity is
                                                   greater for nonself-jnsured firms
 than for the full sample, and the benefit
                                                  elasticity is negative (but very
 imprecise) and statistically insignificant for self-insured firms. These

 results provide some support for the view that the effect of
                                                                    providing more
 generous benefits on employees' injury spells is
                                                        tempered if employers' have a
 stronger incentive to have workers return to work.



 V. Estimates Identified by Nonhinearities in the Benefit Schedule

        In the absence of experimental data
                                                  on benefit changes, it has been
common for researchers to estimate the effect of social insurance benefits

 (which are a nonlinear function of wages)
                                              by restricting the functional form
of wages. In the context of equation 2, this
                                                    is equivalent to assuming that

the piecewise log linear wage terms should be excluded from the equation.

Although this restriction is overwhelmingly rejected
                                                           by the estimates in Table
3, it is natural to question how sensitive the
                                                     estimates would be to
functional form restrictions of this type.

       Table 5 presents several OLS injury duration regressions that are

identified by restricting the functional form of the wage term.22 Variations

in the benefit variable in these specifications are primarily due to

nonhinearities in the benefit formula. These estimates are meant to provide a

comparison to the specifications previously estimated in the literature (e.g.,

Butler and Jorrall, 1985). In general, this exercise shows that the benefit

elasticity is remarkably sensitive to alternative identifying assumptions

based on functional form.

        The log of the benefit and the log of the wage are entered as separate

regressors in the first three columns of Table 5. In these specifications,

the benefit has a small but statistically significant, positive effect on the

duration of claims, and the wage has a statistically insignificant, negative

effect on claim duration. The magnitude of the benefit elasticity is close to

Butler and Worrall's (1985) Weibull model estimate for Illinois, but

substantially smaller than that implied by the natural experiment studied

here.

        Columns 4.6 of Table 5 enter the log of the replacement rate (weekly

benefit divided by weekly wage) in place of the separate wage and benefit

variables. This specification constrains the benefit and wage to have equal

but opposite signed effects, which imposes a more restrictive functional form

assumption than Columns 1-3. This modification in the specification yields a

strikingly different result: A higher ratio of the benefit to the wage is

associated with a shorter duration of time spent on workers' compensation

insurance. Given that the benefit and wage have opposite signs in Columns

1-3, the negative effect of the replacement rate is counterintuitive.

        The dramatic difference between the two different specifications in

Table 5 can be traced to the strong multicolinearity between the benefit and

wage variables. To see this, denote B as the benefit and W as the wage, and

let b1 equal the benefit coefficient and b2 the wage coefficient in the

specification in Columns 1-3. Using the omitted-variable formula, the

coefficient on the log replacement rate, a1, in the restrictive specification

estimated in Columns 4-6 can be decomposed as:
                                                    24

        Substituting into equation (3), the coefficient on the
                                                                               log replacement
 rate in Column 4 is       -   .308      .319 +   (.319   -
                                                              .051) x ( -.124 / .053).     The
 variance in the replacement rate (.053) is
                                                          relatively low because benefits are
 nearly a linear transformation of wages. Moreover, the
                                                                        replacement rate
declines sharply with wages, which leads to the large negative covariance

between the two variables.

        Lastly, it should be noted that the estimated negative effect of the

replacement rate on spell durations is not entirely surprising in light of the

cross-sectional relationship between wages and mean spell duration discussed

in regards to Table 1. Higher paid workers tend to have a lower replacement

rate and a longer injury duration, on average. Moreover, the fact that the

effect of the replacement rate on nonwork spells is only one-third as large in

magnitude in Column 6 as in Column 4 suggests that the variables
                                                                                   measuring the
workers' occupation, extent of injury, and demographic characteristics can

account for a large portion of the negative effect of the replacement rate.

This finding may result because, other things equal, high-pay workers have

more dangerous jobs, or because high-pay workers are less likely to pursue

claims for minor injuries.

       The qualitatively different estimates of the effect of benefits on

duration in the two specifications in Table 5 exemplify how incorrect

inference can be drawn about the effect of social programs when nonlinearities

in replacement rate formulas generate the main source of variations in
                      23
benefits and wages.

VI. Summary and Conclusion

       This paper has explored the effect of the workers' compensation insurance

system on the duration of workplace injuries. The analysis focuses on a

natural experiment that increased benefits for some workers, but left benefits

unchanged for other workers. This natural experiment is used to estimated the

effect of providing more generous benefits on the duration of work injuries.

In addition, incentive effects for employers' to facilitate and expedite their

employees' return to work are also considered.

       In a period when benefits were increased by 5 percent for workers who

qualify for the minimum or maximum workers' compensation benefit, the average

duration ofan injury spell was found to have increased by 8 percent for the

group of workers that received the higher minimum or maximum, but was

virtually unchanged for workers who were unaffected by the benefit change.

Moreover, the benefit response tends to be greater for workers who have short-

term injuries. Although it is unlikely that these findings could have

occurred by chance, one might be skeptical of the magnitude of the estimated

impact of benefits on the duration of claims in this natural experiment

because it is much larger than previously published estimates of the benefit-

injury duration elasticity.

       One   explanation   for the larger estimated effect of benefits in this study

than in previous analyses of workers' compensation is that the variation in

benefits is genuinely exogenous in the data considered here, whereas

identification of independent benefit and wage effects is problematic in the

past literature. Support for this interpretation comes from a recent paper by

Bruce Meyer, Kip Viscusi and David Durbin (1989), which examines changes in

the median injury duration associated with large changes in the maximum
                                         26

 benefit in two states. Although Meyer, Viscusi
                                                    and Durbin's results are not
 directly comparable because they focus on the median spell length, the implied

 elasticities in their two states are also
                                              substantially larger than those
 found in the past literature. Together, these
                                                   longitudinal analyses of
benefit changes should move even a hardened skeptic in the direction of

believing that the duration of work injuries is responsive to the
                                                                       amount of
workers' compensation benefits that are paid.

       Other estimates in the paper document that self-insurance is associated

with shorter injury spells than (imperfectly experience rated) private

insurance. Moreover, an increase in workers' compensation benefits has a

positive effect on injury duration in the sample of firms that purchase

insurance from private carriers or from the state fund, but has    a

statistically insignificant effect in the sample of self-insured firms. These

results provide the first evidence that employers' incentives may have an

important influence on the duration of employees' injuries.
                                                                Clearly,
additional evidence on this issue would be useful.

       The empirical results presented here suggest that there are two effective

levers available in workers' compensation insurance to influence the       duration

of working time lost due to workplace injuries. The first lever is by

changing the amount of indemnity benefits provided to workers who are injured

on the job; and the second lever is by strengthening the link between

employer's insurance costs and the actual cost of providing injury benefits to

their employees.

1. In 1986, for example, 2.63 percent of working time was lost due to

occupational injuries and illnesses, .05 percent of work days were idled due

to work stoppages involving 1,000 or more employees, and 7.9 percent of labor

force time was lost due to unemployment (see Tables 647, 679, and 681 of U.S.

Bureau of the Census, 1989). For expediency, I will use the term work injury

broadly throughout the paper, including both physical injuries and illnesses.

2. See Ronald Ehrenberg (1988) and Alan Krueger (1990) for recent surveys

of the determinants of the incidence of work-related injuries.

3. This figure is based on the author's calculations of the nationwide

workers' compensation recipiency rate using the March 1988 Current Population

Survey and on the Occupational Safety Health Administration's survey of all

lost-work time accidents.

4. See Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry (1988), Chapter 2 and 5.

Because most workers return to work immediately when their temporary total

spell ends, the terms duration of temporary total case and time away from work

will be used interchangeably.

5. Only 13 percent of workers' compensation recipients in Minnesota receive

disability compensation from their employer, and only 3 percent receive other

government support, such as unemployment insurance, medicare, or foodstamps,

during their disability, so little is lost by focusing solely on workers'

compensation benefits (Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry, p. 74).

6, There are some additional, less common exceptions to the benefit-wage

relationship in Figure 1. For example, benefits for volunteer workers are

based on the prevailing wage for that type of job, and benefits for employees

who work irregular hours are based on a five day work week if they work fewer
                                              30

  than five days per week.

 increases in the maxjmtim
                           unemployment insurance benefit to estimate the effect
 of benefit changes on the duration
                                     of unemployment spells. In related work,
 Gary Solon (1985) uses a change in the tax status of unemployment
                                                                    insurance
 benefits to examine the effect of
                                    after-tax benefits on
                                                          unemployment spells.
 11. The inflation rate
                         (CPI-Urban) was only 1.1% in 1986, so these benefit

 changes represent approximately real changes in transfer payments.

 12. If a claim is initially classified
                                              as a temporary total case, but
reclassified as a permanent partial
                                          case upon the date of maximun medical
improvement, the length of time on
                                         temporary total is counted as the duration
of the temporary total claim. Claims that are later reclassified
                                                                 as permanent
total injuries are excluded from the data
                                                   set. In results that are available
on request, I have estimated Veibul]. duration
                                                       models that treat the duration
of permanent partial injuries as censored at the date of maximum medical

improvement. These estimates lead to
                                           qualitatively similar conclusions.
13. The sample is also limited to
                                        individuals between age 16 and 70 with
complete data who earned less than $5,000 per week.
                                      31

14. Under the null hypothesis that benefits are unrelated to duration, the

truncation of benefits does not lead to biased estimates. Furthermore, if

higher benefits cause the distribution of spells to shift to the right, right-

hand truncation will lead to an underestimate of the benefit elasticity.

15. The same pattern holds for the median injury duration.

16. Note, however, that the effect of measurement error and idiosyncratic

variations in benefits should be limited because the sample was restricted to

workers whose benefit was within $10 of the benefit based on the schedule.

17. To compare the age and marital status of the workers' compensation

claimants to the overall workforce, I have estimated the age distribution and

marital rate for the sample of Minnesota workers contained in the 1987 Current

Population Survey Outgoing Rotation Group Sample. The sample of workers'

compensation recipients is slightly younger than the general workforce, and

about equally likely to be married.

18. The establishment size variable was merged to the data set by the author

on the basis of the firm's Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code.

Specifically, the average number of employees per establishment in an industry

was derived from the 1986 County Business Patterns survey of Minnesota (US

Department of Commerce, 1987). and then matchsd to each claimant on the basis

of its firm's four-digit SIC. If average firm sizs at the four-digit level

was not availabis in County Business Patterns, th. three-digit industry level

was used, and so on. Because government employment is excluded from County

Business patterns, it was assumed that th. average establishment size is 1,000

for stats government. 1,000 for the executive branch, and 50 for local governments

  19. For this analysis, injuries
                                    are defined in terms of
                                                            three.digjt nature of
  injury-part of body cells. For example, a broken toe is considered
                                                                       separate
  from a broken arm. There are 357
                                    injury-classes in the sample that have an
  average duration of less than 10 weeks. A
                                             complete listing of these injuries
  is available on request from the author.

 20. A firm must receive permission from
                                               the Minnesota Department of Commerce
 to self-insure. Although the selection
                                             criteria the Department uses to
 determine eligibility are complicated,
                                        permission is typically only granted to
 financially solvent firms with a net worth of at least two million dollars.

 Examples of self-insured firms in Minnesota include
                                                          VS Steel, Amoco and
 Nabisco (see Minnesota Department of Labor
                                                 and Industry, 1989). Self.
 insurance may also be granted to groups of employers.

 21. Because the state fund utilizes the
                                               same experience rating formula as
private insurance carriers, it is unclear
                                               why injuries covered by the state
fund have a shorter duration than
                                    injuries covered by private insurance
carriers. A possible explanation for this finding is that the state fund

screens out firms with particularly severe
                                                injuries. Alternatively, the state
fund may be more successful in providing rehabilitation for disabled workers.

22. The covarjates in these specifications are the same as those in Table 3,

except dummies indicating the season of the year the worker was injured have

been added to these specifications. Note also that the sample for these

regressions includes individuals with earnings in the grey area of Figure 2.
