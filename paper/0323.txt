                   COMPARING PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES



      The operations of 31 large public library systems across the
country are compared using inforniat ion from the author' s interview
survey. Operations are compared in physical terms: hours of service,
materials, locations, and staffing. Differences in operations are
found to be associated with differences in labor costs, local fiscal
circumstances, and demographics. The libraries seem to reduce hours
in the face of higher labor costs. Differences in the use of the
libraries are found to be associated with differences in library
services and demographics. The number of materials acquired per
capita has a strong inpact on library use.

                         COMPARING PUBLIC LIBRARY SYSTEMS


       Public library systems   differ   substantially in the services they provide
their clients. This essay will compare the operation of 31 large public li-
brary systems across the country.1 One concern is to discover what forces
shape the library systems. For example, how are library operations different
when labor costs are higher? The focus is on service characteristics that
are explicitly under library control such as hours, materials and locations.
A second concern is to discover how the library operations influence outcomes.
For example, how   is   the circulation of library materials influenced by the
number of hours of service or the number of branch locations? The focus here
is on the response of users to library services. This essay deals with the
main components of library budgets: the number of locations, the size and
age of collections, the number of hours of service, and staffing. Later
essays will delve more deeply into issues of technical services (acquisition
and cataloging of materials) and technological change. A previous essay has
examined some of the literature of library evaluation and examined the opera-
tion of the N York Public Library.2
       The initial discussion of the library systems examines the libraries in
three groups: city, metropolitan, and suburban. City libraries serve a           cen-

tral   city alone. Suburban library systems serve suburban areas alone. Metro—

politan   library systems serve a central city and a substantial suburban area.3
One question   to be explored is   whether this grouping appropriately differ-

entiates the libraries. The groupings are for exposition only however, and

do not play an important role in subsequent analysis.
                                                                             2



                         MEASURING LIBRARY OPERATIONS


     The central   features of a large public library system are the number of

locations where services are provided, the size of collections of materials,

the rate at which new materials are added, the hours of service, and the char-

acter of the staff. These features are observed in an interview survey of 31

large public library systems in 19 states. The cities are indicated in an

appendix.


Locations

     Most large public library systems operate many facilities. The total num-

ber of locations per 100 square miles of area served gives a rough indication

of the average distance users must travel in order to get to a library. The

average number of locations per 100 square miles among the library systems

surveyed is 17.39, as indicated in Table 1. Metropolitan and suburban library

systems are significantly different than city libraries, however. While the

central city systems average 32 locations per 100 square miles served, the

metropolitan and suburban systems average 4 and 3 per 100 square miles. The

Brooklyn Public Library averaged 84.29 locations per 100 square miles while

San Antonio and San Diego County average less than 1 per 100 square miles.

The very great diversity in the density of branches, of course, reflects the

differences in the age and density of development of the different areas, as

will be seen below.

     A circle of radius 1 mile subtends an area equal to the average area

served by the library facility in the average city system. Because the cities

include some systems like Houston, Dallas, and San Antonio with relatively

low branch densities, the typical older central city system has branch den-

sities higher than the reported average for cities. The suburban systems

such an area. The suburban group includes San Diego

ville system with service areas that include large amounts of undeveloped land.

Thus, the effective branch densities for library users is probably somewhat

higher than the average reported here. It is clear, however, that the central

city systems maintain ten times as many branches per unit of area as the sub-

urban systems. The ten fold greater branch density only reduces the average

travelling distance to branches by just over 3 times because distance and area

are related by the square root.

     Library service locations are differentiated. Twenty—seven of the thirty—

one libraries surveyed identify one facility as a main library. Four suburban

library systems eschew a main library. The New York Public Library designates

four facilities as library centers. Main libraries or library centers usu-

 ally offer larger, more varied collections and better library service than

 other facilities. Some main libraries may approximate the sophistication of

expansion of the main library, or as an effort to move away from over branch-

ing, that is, as a prelude to consolidating or closing marginal neighborhood

branches. The survey did not attempt to measure the scope of regional library

operations.

     Some libraries operate unstaffed library stations. Small collections of

a few hundred books may be kept in fire stations, nursing homes, hospitals,

schools, community centers and the like. Eighteen of the 31 libraries surveyed

indicated maintaining one or more stations. Dallas, Cincinnati, and Birmingham

have over 20, and Philadelphia maintains 335 stations. Library stations are

not investigated here in any detail.

     Public libraries also provide services by truck. Bookmobiles typically

house a collection of a few thousand books and operate as mobile branch li-

braries. While a patron can order a book for later delivery, most select ma-

terials from those on board. Only Brooklyn and Chicago among the systems sur-

veyed do not offer bookmobile service. Cutbacks in bookmobile service does

seem to be a response to budget pressure however, so that some cities with

bookmobiles were not operating them at the time of the survey. Only one sys-

tem operated more than 5 bookmobiles, and that is St. Louis County where 23

bookmobiles operate. St. Louis County has elected to operate fewer branches

than most systems and to operate very many bookmobiles. The intensity of

bookmobile service also varies. San Antonio has 34 stops for its 5 bookmo-

biles; Hennepin County has 100 stops for its 2 bookmobiles. Presumably the

 frequency and duration of bookmobile stops also influence the amount of use

 of bookmobile service.


Materials

      The stock of materials reflects both the items in the main library and
                                                                            6




in all the branches. Materials could be disaggregated on several dimensions.

The most important media is the book   Recordings are the mot important non—

book material. Prints, films, microfilm and pamphlets play,a lesser role,
especially jn the branches. The materials might be differentiated by audience:

adult vs. juvenile; and by subject: fiction versus non—fiction. Too few li-

braries have records that allow easy disaggregation along the different dimen-

sions so only totals can be compared across a substantial number of systems.

The systems averaged two volumes in stock per capita. There is no significant

difference between the city, metropolitan and suburban systems in the number of

volumes in stock per capita.

     Age is another important dimension of library materials. New materials

generate much more use than old materials. The acquisition of new materials

can be characterized by examining the number of volumes acquired annually per

capita. While the libraries average .15 new volumes per capita, there is a

significant difference among the three geographic types. Central city libraries

acquire more than metropolitan; suburban libraries acquire more than either

of the other two

     The acquisition program of a public library has a quality dimension as

well. Thenumber of new titles cataloged annually indicates the breadth and

depth of collection development   (There need be no strong link between the

number of volumes acquired and the number of titles acquired because most

 public libraries buy multiple copies of many books.) The libraries differ
 significantly in the number of new titles acquired annually. The city librar-
 ies average over 25,000 titles; metropolitan near 14,000; and suburban just

 under 10,000. These compare with the over 30,000 new titles produced in the

 United States each year.

      The differences in the number of titles acquired reflect basic differences

buy more volumes per capita and many fewer titles than the city libraries, we

Louis County Library bought the same titles for all its locations, thus it

 rarely acquired a book in single copy. The contrast with the Boston Public

 is clear.

      The contrast in the breadth of materials is also seen in the number of

 serials titles subscribed to. The boston Public Library subscribes to about
                                                      3,314 serials titles. The
 11,000 serials titles. The city libraries average

 suburban libraries average 1,431. Nine of the library systems surveyed sub-

 scribe to fewer than 1000 titles. Of course, the suburban systems may sub-

 scribe to the same titles for each facility, while most of the titles in the

 research oriented main libraries will be acquired in single copy.

      The objective of materials acquisition differs markedly across the public

 libraries. On the one hand, a library may seek to hold materials representa-
                                                                be it French lit-

to the highest amount of use. Popular interest is the target.4

    Some surveys of librarians compare the materials acquisitions of librar—

iës by comparing the proportion of the library budget devoted to materials.

Such a measureis inadequate for several reasons. First, higher salaries will

cause personnel costs to be higher and so the fraction of the budget devoted

to material acquisitipn to be smaller even though the same number of staff and

the same number of materials are acquired. Second, the expenditure on mate-

rials does. not indicate IQW many volumes are purchased, nor how many titles

are included in the acq4sition. The measurement of number of volumes, number

of titles, and number of staff gives a much clearer picture of library ser-

vices as users may observe them.


Hours

     The hours of service is dramatically related to library use, as found in

the study of the New York Public Library.5 Branch libraries are open an

average of 48 hours per week in surveyed systems.    While there is no signif 1—

cant difference across the geographic types, the variance in hours in each

group is substantial. The 22 hour average in New York City contrasts with

the 72 hours per week in the St. Louis County Library.


Staffing

        The single most expensive Item of library operation is the staff.   The

total professional and clerical work force is compared across library systems.6

The libraries average 0.42 staff members per thousand population. There is

significantly smaller staff per capita in the metropolitan library systems.

A more detailed investigation of the sources of the differences will be made

below.

        About three—fourths of the staff are engaged in activities directly
                                                                             9




related to public services. The other quarter engage in administration and

technical services. Technical services involves the acquisition and catalog—

ing of materials. The public service staff may   select   materials, control cir-

culation, and respond to user queries, the reference function.

    While part of the affect of changes in staffing in public services is to

chatrg the hours of service, and the character of materials selection——activities

that have already been examined——the nature of the public services staff may

also be of direct influence on users. The capability of the library to handle

user queries, for example, may be a direct consequence of the proportion of

the staff that has professional training as librarians. The libraries aver-

aged 38.3 percent professional staff.7 While there is no significant dif-

ference across the geographic types, there is some variation anng the li-

braries. Over half of the public service staff is professional in San Antonio,

Buffalo, and Nashville; while less than twenty percent of the public service

staff is professional in St. Louis County and San Diego County.

     The public service staff is allocated between a main library and branches.

The city and metropolitan libraries on average have 42 percent of their public

service staffs assigned to the main library. Over half of the public service

staff is assigned to the main library in Boston, Dallas, Minneapolis, San

Antonio and Birmingham. Four of the seven suburban library systems have no

main library; the seven suburban systems average eight percent of their public

service staff in the main library. The pattern of staff assignments confirms

the differing nature of main library services indicated by the acquisitions

policies of the libraries.

     Part of the staff may be supported by federal Comprehensive Employment

and Training Act (CETA) funds. While the CETA workers may be both clerical

and professional and similar to other library employees, it may be of interest
                                                                             10




to observe the pattern of use of CETA workers. Twenty—five of the 31 library

systems have one or more CETA employees. CETA workers account for 7.4 per-

cent of the library's work force on average. CETA workers account for over

20 percent of the work force in five library systems surveyed: San Antonio,

Birmingham, Nashville, Brooklyn, and New York.

      Libraries may use volunteers to supplement paid workers. Some libraries

employ a personnel officer just to co—ordinate and train volunteer workers.

Of   twenty—seven libraries that responded to the question about volunteers,
ten indicated that volunteers are used. When the number of volunteer hours
contributed   each week are compared to the average number of paid hours worked,

one finds that the twenty—seven systems averaged about 0.9 percent volunteer

effort as a percent of paid effort.


EXPLAINING LIBRARY OPERATIONS

       Having measured a variety of characteristics of library operations, it

is appropriate to explain the differences in activities of the libraries.

Why do some have long hours of service? Why do some buy fewer titles than

       Because   each library system is faced with a budget constraint, each must

make tradeoffs among different services. For example, a library that wants

to collect a large number of titles may acquire fewer volumes per capita, that

is fewer books in multiple copies. A library that operates many hours per week

may have fewer locations. For these reasons the correlations between some in-

puts will be expected to be negative indicating they are substitutes.
                                                                          11




    On the other hand, the pursuit of a particular philosophy of what public

library services should be may lead a library to have higher levels of cer-

tain activities jointly. For example, a library acquiring many titles may

also have a higher proportion of its public service staff in the main library.

In this case, the correlations among inputs would be positive indicating they

are complements.

     The correlations among inputs presented in table 2 reveal some of both

kinds of groupings. Hours in branches and the number of locgtions seem to

e substitutes. This finding is consistent with the experience of the New

York Public Library. The maintenance of a large number of locations is at

the expense of fewer hours of operation in each location. The number of

bookmobiles is negatively correlated both with the proportion of public ser-

vice staff In the main library and the proportion that is professional. These

suggest that on average across the library systems there may be a trade off

between bookmobile service and main library service and between bookmobile

service and professional librarians. The bookmobile correlations may be in-

fluenced by the St. Louis County Library because it operates so many more

bookmobiles than any other of the observed systems.

     The positive correlations between acquisistions and stock, acquisitions

and staff, stock and staff, and titles and staff are consistent with these

activities being complements with each other. More titles and staff tend

 to be found in library systems operating more locations. Libraries that have

more books in stock also seem to acquire more books, acquire a greater variety

 of titles, have a larger staff, and operate more locations per 100 square miles

 than other libraries. Thus, some libraries emphasize more materials in more

 locations at the expense of hours while others emphasize hours of service with

 bookmobiles. The interactions among the different dimensions of service are,

 of course, complex.

Determinants of Activities

    The variation in library activities may be associated with differences

in the areas the libraries serve. For example, high labor cost may shift

library activities away from labor intensive services to other services.   The

fiscal circumstances of the local government may shape the mix of library ser-

vices through the local budget process. The characteristics of the local popu-

lation may influence the character of the local public library. The measure-

ment of each of these factors is discussed and then the influence of these

factors on library activities is examined.


Labor Cost

     If a library can substitute one type of service, say, additional materials,

for another, say, hours of service, while being just as attractive to users,

then one might expect to find different mixes of activities given different

costs. That is, if a library chose to provide as much service value as possible

within a given budget, it will substitute away from more expensive activities

relative to less expensive ones. In particular, those libraries that face

higher labor costs will be expected to adjust the mix of services so as to

economize on the use of labor.

     Total annual compensation for a recruit librarian adjusted to a 40 hour

work week and including fringe benefits averaged $14,911 in the surveyed 11—

braries as reported in table 3. %hi1e there is no statistically significant

 difference across the geographic types, there is substantial variation among

 the libraries from a low of $10,287 in St. Louis County to a high of $26,278

 in Chicago. Sources of variation in labor cost will be examined in a later

 essay. The range of variation in the cost of labor is sufficient to induce

 differences in the mix of library activities if substitution is possible and

 if libraries are responsive to economic incentives.

Fiscal Indicators

    The fiscal circumstances of local government may influence the level of

library activities through the budget making process. First, those libraries

that are departments of city or county governments may be more subject to

trade—of fs against other government services, say schools or police, than a

library that is an autonomous or semi—autonomous agency. Eighteen of the 31

libraries surveyed are departments of government. The other thirteen are at

least semi—autonomous. Nine of the library systems receive earmarked tax

revenue, thus further insulating the library's expenditures from the exigencies

of local finance.

     Library activities may be influenced by the stringency of the local fiscal

position in general although the direction of the effect may be unclear. On

the one hand, a locality that raises large amounts of money may have more to

spend on libraries as well as on many other services. On the other, a city

that finds it necessary to raise a large amount of revenue for other purposes

may be less likely to spend a great deal on the library.

     There are two main sources of funds for local government. Funds may be

raised from local sources, principally the property tax, and funds may come

from the state and federal governments. The census of governments reports

suimnary financial information for 1972. The own revenues per capita net of

library expenditures averaged $350.31 in the library areas surveyed. Direct

expenditure less revenue from local sources is taken to be Intergovernmental

transfers. Netting out the expenditures on libraries yields the intergovern-

mental figures reported in Table 3. The library areas averaged $178.40 per

capita. The per capita expenditures on libraries indicated In the census of

governments was $6.44. It is possible that library expenditures are influenced

differently by funds from local sources than from intergovernmental transfers.

    Library systems may respond only slowly to changes in the service area.

The opening and closing of facilities is likely to be slow relative to chang-

ing use patterns both because buildings are durable and because the develop-

ment of the political support necessary to make changes may take time. There-

fore, the ratio of the gain in population from 1960 to 1970 relative to 1960

population may be associated with differences in library activities. The

suburban areas show an average of 52 percentage points of growth, while both

city and metropolitan areas averaged less than 10 points. Fewer locations

and smaller stocks of materials will be expected in areas of higher growth.

     The total size of the area served in terms of population may also influ-

ence the mix of activities. An area with more people might be expected to

have more main library activities in total but less per capita because of

economies of scale. That is, the more people who share the cost of a main

library, the lower the cost to each. There may be other economies of scale

as well, perhaps in technical services or acquisitions. Organizational dis—

economies may affect the largest systems. A very large system may have a

higher proportion of its budget absorbed in administration than a smaller

organization. The library systems surveyed averaged 993 thousand population

without statistically significant difference across the geographic types.

Chicago's 3,367,000 is the largest; Minneapolis's 434,000 is the smallest in

the group.


 Regression Analysis of Operations

      Each measure of library operations is related to labor cost, the local

 fiscal situation, and to the characteristics of the local population in a

 series of multiple regressions. The purpose is to discover systematic sources

 of differences In library operations.

other things equal. No other activity (except CETA employees to be discussed

below) is negatively associated with labor cost, thus the only apparent re-

sponse to high labor cost seems to be cuts in hours.   Because the survey

study is a cross section, it is, of course, inappropriate to conclude that

over time libraries have been induced to cut hours because of rising labor

costs. Nevertheless, the cross section evidence is consistent with such be-

havior. This finding ten4s to reenforce the evidence In the study of the

New York Public Library: hours are more readily cut than locations or

materials.

     More volunteer effort relative to paid staff is found in libraries with

high labor costs. Libraries may be led to put more effort into using volun-

teers where labor costs are high. The level of volunteer effort, however, is

lower in larger library systems. Larger systems may be less effective in

organizing the use of volunteers; perhaps larger systems show more bureaucratic

Inertia.

     Labor cost is positively associated with acquisitions, titles acquired,

stock, and staff. High labor costs are not associated with lower levels of

service in these dimensions. The strength of the positive relationship is a

 little surprising. While these activities differ from central city to subur-

ban systems (as shown in table 1), labor costs do not differ significarLtly

 across the georgraphic types. Therefore, the association between labor cost

 and the material and staff intensive library systems reflects more than just

 a central city———suburban difference. Perhaps the political and organiza-

 tional arrangements that lead to more materials and staff also lead to higher

 labor costs.

      CETA employees are a smaller fraction of staff in library systems with

 higher labor cost. Apparently CETA employment has been concentrated in cities

 with lower labor costs.

       Intergovernmental revenues per capita are positively associated with CETA

workers. Because CETA funds may be included in the intergovernmental trans-

fers, this association is quite understandable. Moreover, similar criteria

may be used in distributing other intergovernmental transfers as in distribu-

ting CETA funds.

       Intergovernmental transfers are negatively associated with the level of

staff. This association may reflect the dominance of tied grants in inter-

governmental transfers. Restrictions on grants, say for education or law

enforcement, may require that local funds be directed to specific purposes

as with matching formulae. Untied aid, as for example, general revenue shar-

ing, would be expected to induce somewhat higher levels of local expenditure.

Aid tied to library services would be expected to have the largest Impact on

libraries. The displacement effect of tied aid for purposes other than li-

braries must dominate the influence of untied aid and library specific aid

with respect to staff. This result is a little surprising. It is unclear

why   this result should be found for staffing but not for other categories
of library services.
      Libraries   that are departments of local government have less autonomy

than departments that are independently chartered. Library departments may

be less successful in competing for local funds against the police and schools

than the autonomous library. The only statistically significant association

found is with volumes in stock per capita. Fewer volumes are found in li-

braries operated as departments of city government than in libraries that are

autonomous.

      Library systems serving areas with a higher proportion of adults who are

high school graduates are little different, on average, than library systems

with relatively fewer high school graduates. They have a statistically
                                                                            23




significant smaller proportion of their public service staff in a main   library,
and they have relatively fewer CETA employees. Suburban systems have popu-

lations with more education and are less likely to develop a main library ser-

vice. One might have expected higher levels of service in areas with a popu-

lation with more education, because library use increases with education.

That no such finding is apparent———indeed the more highly education popula—

tions have smaller main librarles———suggests that something other than the

reading tastes of the resident population is shaping the library service.

     The ratio of 1970 to 1960 population is negatively associated with the

number of library locations per 100 square miles. This is consistent with a

substantial lag in the development of additional locations as a response to

increases in population. Also, areas that show population growth will be at

much lower population density than areas that have mature development. Lower

densities embody automobile oriented consumption patterns, and lower densities

of library locations are desirable in such circumstances.

     Libraries in areas of recent growth operate more hours per week on

average than those in slower growing areas. Having fewer branches, they con-

centrate their energy in operating more hours. Not having inherited too many

branches, they do not have to close branches in order to sustain a high level

of hours of service.

     The libraries in rapidly growing areas have smaller main libraries. Just

as with locations, a main library takes time to develop. Therefore, it is not

surprising that library systems in growing areas have smaller main libraries.

On the other hand, the library systems in growing areas may have decided against

providing a substantial main library service. The notion that libraries in

growing areas have a different philosophy of service can not be ruled out.
                                                                           24




    A distinction might be made here between an age affect and a vintage

affect. The age affect implies that particular kinds of library service such

as a main library cumulate with age. Each 25 year old library system will

have similar main libraries. The difference in main libraries may reflect

the fact that the library systems are of widely differing ages; the suburban

systems are much younger than the city and metropolitan systems. If the age

affect is dominant, then when the suburban systems are 100 years old they will

look much more like the 100 year old city systems observed now. The weak

association between population growth and the stock of materials suggests that

the age affect is not very powerful. The vintage affect implies that each

library is molded at birth by the context of that time. Libraries created

in the 1920's had many neighborhood branches for walking access, a substantial

demand for sophisticated main library services, and the orientation toward

collecting materials for posterity. Libraries created today may reflect an

orientation toward meeting the circulation requirements of current users, and

emphasize automobile access. Thus longer hours, more multiple copies, and

fewer locations may be appropriate. The vintage hypothesis depends on the

assumption that libraries are slow to change to new circumstances. An analogy

might be made to grocery stores. The size and distribution of grocery stores

of the 1950's are being transformed into larger stores at lower density in

the 1970's. If library systems are slow to change, they may reflect their

vintage. It is difficult to disentangle age and vintage affects from cross

section evidence alone: a cross section over time is necessary. But I

suspect that vintage affects are important for locations and the age affect

may be important for the main library.
                                                                              25




    The size of the area served is indicated by the population. Library

systems serving larger populations seem to stock fewer books per capita.

Perhaps there are economies of scale in the book stock. That is, perhaps

certain materials are acquired in single copy for the whole system. Such

materials will be spread over a larger audience in a larger system, and so

the stock of materials might be smaller in per capita terms in a larger

library system.

        Systems serving larger populations tend to operate fewer hours than

smaller systems. It is unclear why larger systems should offer fewer hours

than the average system.

        Overall, the differences in library services are not all that well ex-

plained. Labor costs have some role especially in limiting hours of service.

The libraries in growing areas have fewer locations, operate longer hours, and

have smaller relative commitments to main library services than libraries in

areas               with smaller population growth rates. These influences do

not tell the full story, however. First, the history of each library system

is probably very important. Library systems seem to be very durable; once in

place they tend to stay in place. The level of bureaucratic and political

inertia may be very high. It may be difficult to close or relocate branches

and to change the basic features of the library services. If sophisticated

main library service is developed, it may be difficult to reduce the level of

such service should the demand for it change. Second, residents are not the

only library users. Employment in central cities may be larger than the nutu—

ber of residents. The demand for public library services may be influenced

in important ways by the character of employment. For example, an area with

a large number of financial firms and corporate headquarters may require more
                                                                               26




library services than say manufacturing activities.   This investigation has

not given sufficient attention to the history of the library systems and to

the character of employment in the area.


EXPLAINING LIBRARY USE

     The library activities discussed above can be related to the use of the

library systems. How do different sets of activities influence the level of

use? Perhaps more hours and more books generate more use. The study of

branches in New York demonstrated that library use is very responsive to the

hours of service, and is somewhat responsive to the acquisition of materials.9

In this study use is compared across library systems.


Measuring Use

     The main category of use is circulation. Circulation figures are avail-

able from most library systems and has been used as a quasi—output measure in

other studies)0 Circulation at the time of the survey is examined relative

 to 1970 population. On average, 4.66 books circulated per year per capita [n

 the library systems surveyed as reported in Table 5. There is a statistically

 significant variation across the geographic types.   Suburban library systems

 average over seven circulations per capita while city systems averaged under

 four. Pittsburgh averaged 1.75 circulations per capita while Fairfax County

 averaged over 10. The likely differential growth of the jurisdictions will

 only have heightened the differences.

      Circulation could be disaggregated in several ways. The circulation of

 adult materials could be distinguished from the circulation of juvenile ma-

 terials. Fiction might be distinguished from non—fiction.    The circulation

                                                            Too few libraries
 of books might be distinguished from non—book materials.

 have such disaggregated information available to make analysis possible.

       Circulation figures, of course, do not reflect all the dimensions of

library use. In particular, the number of persons served may be as important

as the ntiinber of materials used. One way of considering the number of per-

sons who use the library system is to count the number of cardholders. Of

the 31 systems, six either do not require cards or keep no central count of

the number of cards outstanding. The renewal period varies for the cards

from an annual card renewal required in San Diego, New Orleans, and Fairfax

County to permanent cards in Houston, and St. Louis County. Note that non—

residents may acquire cards in several places, and therefore the possible

number of cards is not limited by the population of the area. The library

systems averaged 37 cards per 100 population with no statistically signif 1—

cant difference across the geographic types.

       Library use might also be compared by observing attendance. Turnstile

counts are available from only a very few libraries, however, so attendance

can not be examined. Reference questions asked could also be compared across

systems, and many libraries do count questions asked. Reference queries may

be of many different sorts, however. It would be useful to try to identify

some particular categories of questions. The survey asked how many questions

were   received by telephone, but too few libraries were able to sort out the
number of telephone inquiries from questions from other sources. Consequently,
the    issue of reference questions is   not examined here.
       Libraries   also interact with other libraries via the interlibrary loan

of materials. The survey askedabout the number of materials sent and the

number received. On average 9708 materials were sent and 2484 materials were

received via interlibrary loan. These figures occur in the surveyed systems

where circulation averaged over 3.5 million. Thus the interlibrary flow of

materials accounts for less than half of one percent of circulation. (Some
                                                                                  2


libraries may    require   materials received via interlibrary loan to be used in

the library, thus interlibrary flows may not appear in the circulation figures.)

Relative to the total scope of library services, interlibrary flows seem in-

consequential.

     The receipt of materials through interlibrary loan varies significantly

across the geographic types; city and metropolitan libraries have much smaller

inf lows of materials than the suburban systems. These differences may reflect

the greater commitment of central city and metropolitan systems to central

library services, an issue that will be explored below.

     The outflow of materials does not differ significantly across the geo-

graphic types. The suburban systems on average have a rough balance of in-

flows and outflows. The central city and metropolitan systems are net lenders.

     The library use will be conditioned by several other dimensions of the

service. For example, the length of the loan period may       influence   the leve]

of use of the library. The loan period varies from two t:o four weeks with .t

mean of three weeks. Nine of the 31 library systems do not allow material

to be renewed. Because renewals count as additional circulations, libraries

that disallow renewals are likely to have lower levels of circulation than

those that allow renewals. Three library systems allow renewals to be made

by telephone: San Antonio St. Louis County, and Birmingham. The quality

of service may   also   be influenced by the length of the wait for popular ma-

terials. The survey asked the libraries to estimate how long on average one

would have to wait for a best seller. Twenty—two libraries were willing to

guess at this number.       The average reported wait is six weeks.   The mean wait

varies from one week in 1'lilwaukee, and San Francisco to over 20 weeks in San

Diego   and San Diego County. Of course, the actual wait    will likely follow

some skewed distribution with the most popular book having the longest wait.
                                                                             30




The length of the queue will vary over the life of the book, from a long queue

when the book is new and heavily promoted, to a sharp drop off when a paper-

back version becomes available. Nevertheless, the rough measure of waiting

time may indicate a dimension of the quality of service not captured in cir—

culation figures.


Regression Analysis of Use

     Differences in use can be explored by regressing the measures of use on

the library activities and the measures of the public taste for library ser-

vices. The central hypothesis is that use will be greater the higher the

level of activity the library system provides. The more hours, books, and

locations, the more use there should be.11 The regressions are reported in

Table 6.

     The simple linear regression explains over 84 percent of the variation

in circulation per capita across the 31 library systems surveyed. The most

important influence is the level of education: the higher the proportion of

adults who are high school graduates, the higher the level of circulation.

Among library services, the most important factor seems to be the number of

acquisitions. Higher levels of acquisitions are associated with higher levels

of circulation. The elasticity of circulation with respect to new acquisi-

tions, evaluated at the means, is 0.32.

     Libraries that allow renewals have more circulation per capita, other

things   equal. The coefficient indicates that on average one circulation per
capita per year is a renewal. Taking account of renewal policy seems to be
 important in   comparing   circulation across library systems.
     The other variables in the regression show no statistically significant
 associations with circulation. In particular, the average hours of service
                                                                                             31

at branches is unrelated to circulation in the comparison of library systems.

This result is at variance with that for the New York system. Apparently,

hours are very important given the low level of hours of service found in the

New   York system, but are much less important in the range observed here, that

is among systems averaging 48 hours of service in branches each week. It may

also be that variance among branches within systems Is important while varia-

tion across the systems is not.

      The number of locations is also unrelated to circulation in the regres-

sion. The systems with large numbers of locations tend to offer fewer hours,

and that affect may dominate here. The number of titles catalogued is also

unrelated to circulation In the regression. Thus, there is no evidence to

indicate that the large, varied, sophisticated collections of systems with

larger main libraries generate more circulation than those systems with many

fewer titles. The lack of association between population In the area and the

per capita circulation tends to suggest that there may be little economy of

scale in the provision of public library circulation services among these

relatively large library systems.

       Somewhat different factors seem to explain the number of cardholders

per hundred population. In particular, many more people seem to hold cards

of library systems with more titles cataloged annually. Thus while the sophis-

tication and variety of collections indicated by the number of titles cata-

loged does not seem to account for differences in circulation, they do seem

to account for differences in the number of cardholders. Inclusion of a

variable for the number of years between renewals of the card does not affect

the relationship: the number of cardholders is apparently little affected by

the renewal cycle. Thus the main affect seems to be that of titles. It

would be interesting to have turnstyle counts or sample surveys for the
                                                                              33




library systems indicating attendance to see whether the number of cardholders

gives a clue to in—library use. One might also like to know what fraction of

cardholders reside outside the jurisdiction of the library, as

a way of examining geographic spillovers. Because holding a card is not a

direct benefit, it is possible that cardholding is weakly associated with

any particular library use. Nevertheless, because the cardholding patterns

seem different than circulation patterns, it may be that cardholding reflects

other categories of library use.

     Interlibrary loan flows are not well explained by the variables at hand.

One would expect a library system with a large main library and one that is

acquiring a large number of titles each year would both lend more materials

and borrow fewer materials through interlibrary loan. One might further ex-

pect that some of the same factors that lead to own circulation would also

lead to more interlibrary loan inf lows, that is, areas with more educated

adults would be expected to have more demand for interlibrary loan inf lows.

Finally, one might expect that larger systems would both require more inflows

and be more important suppliers of interlibrary loans. These hypotheses are

only weakly substantiated. Regressions of the gross flows are reported in

Table 6. The coefficients on the percentage of public service personnel who

are assigned to the main library is statistically significant at the .10

level with a one—tailed test. Larger main libraries have somewhat lower

demands for interlibrary inflows and supply greater levels of outflows.

Population, titles, and volumes acquired are unrelated to interlibrary loan

flows. The overall explanatory power of the relationship is low, however,

and unobserved influences are probably important.

     Interlibrary loan flows are never large relative to total system circu-

lation. Users for the most part rely on materials available locally. Inter—
                                                                               34




library loan becomes more important when elaborate interconnections between

libraries develop. Some libraries are designated regional centers. For
                                                    four libraries as resource
example, the State of Pennsylvania has designated

centers, and the subject categories of the dewey decimal system have been

parcelled out. A resource center library receives some state funds to support

its collections development in its assigned subject areas.    It then has a

responsibility to respond to interlibrary loan requests in its subject area.
                                                      The libraries in the
Library interconnections may alp develop locally.

                                                      relationships with smaller
can be filled quickly. Some libraries have special

libraries in nearby jurisdictions such that all requests for interlibrary loans
                                                      flows will be greater in

libraries that are a part of active regional systems for the exchange of

materials. The survey asked whether libraries belonged to a network, and

                                             Yet the level of development of
 over 90 percent responded affirmatively.

 outlets either for promoting the use of large collections or for collections

 that are too small or thin. Interlibrary loan operations require investment

 in the development of institutions to make them work. Not all public li-

 braries participate aggressively In such services.

      The numher of weeks a user must wait on average for a bestseller may
                                                                               be
                                                                 and on the other
 influenced on the one hand by the nuither of volumes acquired

 by the number of people using the system.    The longer the loan period in

                                               hold a book, and so the longer
 the library system the longer each user may

    The wait for bestsellers is only poorly explained by the regression, at

least in part because the information reflects the best guess of the librar-

ians rather than systematic data gathering. Nevertheless some of the hypo-

theses receive weak confirmation. On average, a one week longer loan period

is associated with 3.887 weeks longer wait for bestsellers, a figure sta-

tistically significant at the 10 percent level with a one tailed test. Sec-

ondly, the wait is longer in library systems with more educated adults. The

pressure of demand increases the wait. Third, there seems to be no relation-

ship between the number of volumes acquired per capita and the length of

the wait. Of course, a library may meet the demand for bestsellers by renting

books, so the lack of association here may not indicate a lack of response

of libraries to the length of queues for popular materials.

     The comparison of library use across the library systems has not done

justice to the uses of main library services. While circulation, cardholders,

attendance, and reference questions figures might be revealling, especially

if available in disaggregated form, an important quality dimension is over-

looked. The value of a sophisticated main library service depends in impor-

tant ways on the quality of the collection and the breadth and depth of study

that may be done using the materials. A scholar may spend each day for weeks

in a library exploring a particular theme. Simple counts will not do justice

to the value of the library service to such an individual. The relevant

question from the point of view of the public interest in libraries, however,

is what institutions are most appropriate for meeting research library needs,

and how should they be financed. The results presented here suggest that

the research library function may have little serendipity with the current

circulation orientation of most public library users.

SUMMARY OF THE COMPARISON OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES

    Measuring   library services in direct physical terms   proves   more revealing

                                                             comparisons are in-
than relying on expenditure comparisons. The expenditure

fluenced by differences in labor costs as well as by differences in the ser-

                                                       reveal the differences In
vices offered. Expenditure comparisons also do not

service mix. For example, public library systems are
                                                     services are not provided in

                                                              the combinations of
     While the public library systems are quite varied in

services they supply, a rough division seems possible along the following

lines. Some libraries have many locations, buy many book titles, have larger
                                                        effort into the main li-
staffs in per capita terms, and put relatively more

brary. Such libraries operate for fewer hours, and use fewer bookmobiles.

 Other libraries do the opposite. While classification of the library systems

 geographically into city, metropolitan and suburban systems explains some

 of the differences in service mix, most importantly the number of locations,
                                                  classification does not ex-
 and the number of book titles, the geographic

 plain the differences in hours, stock, and bookmobiles.

      The differences in service mix is explained in part by differences in

 labor costs. Systems with higher labor costs operate significantly fewer
                                                             also have more ma-
 hours per week on average. The high labor cost systems

 terials in stock, acquire more books and more titles, and have more staff.
                                                               be seen as a tem-
 Reductions in hours in response to higher labor costs may

 porary adjustment to financial pressure, while adjustment of locations,

 stocks, acquisitions and staff may   be   slower and viewed as more permanent.

 The higher levels of materials and locations being associated with higher

  labor costs may indicate some historical overexpansiofl of expenditures.
                                                                             37




    The level of education of adults in the jurisdiction explains little of

the differences in service mix even though education is very strongly asso-

ciated with differences in library use. Given the fact that adults with more

education use the public library mere than others, one would expect the poli-

tical system to deliver significantly more library services in areas with

higher levels of education. That education has little association with dif—

ferences in library services suggests that the political system is not very

responsive to ultimate users.

     The rate of population growth of the jurisdiction is important in ex-

plaining some differences in library set-vices. Areas that have experienced

rapid growth tend to have fewer locations per 100 square miles, to have less

commitment to main libraries, and to operate longer hours. To what extent

these affects result from delays in the growth of library services and to

what extent they reflect changing tastes and technologies in services is

difficult to determine without time series evidence.

     The differences in library services are associated with differences in

use, but the dominant importance of hours of service found in the New York

study is not found in the comparison of library systems. The important ser-

vice characteristic in comparing systems seems to be volumes acquired per

capita per year. This reenforced the finding that the age of the stock of

materials is very important in user decisions to use the library.

     The level of cardholding, on the other hand, seems to be influenced

importantly by the nuither of titles acquired. The greater diversity of

collection as indicated by the nuther of titles may attract more individuals

to the library. Attendance and reference question usage information would

be more attractive usage measures.
                                                                             38




    It might be interesting to try to use the coefficients of services in

the usage regressions as measures of library effectiveness.   The cost of in-

creasing each type of service might be estimated. Some method for valuing

the usage might be devised, and some marginal benefit cost ratios for the

different services might be stated. Using the coefficient on acquisitions

in the circulation regression in Table 6 suggests that if a circulation is

worth more than one tenth the cost of acquiring an additional volume, addi-

tional acquisitions should be made. On average the systems may be acquiring

too few materials. While the coefficient of titles in the cardholder re—

gression suggests that an additional thousand titles would attract 493 addi-

tional cardholders per 100,000 population, it is difficult to imagine what

the value of an additional cardholder might be. Other important library

uses are not examined, and so a complete assessment of the relative ef—

ficiency of the average library service in choosing a mix of services is

impossible with present evidence.

     1The survey was conducted by interview in 1978. Most of the information
reflects the latest fiscal year for which information was available in February
1978. The 50 largest public library systems in the country in terms of popu-
lation served were identified by the listing in the American Library Directory.
The 31 interviewed were selected on the basis of replies to a letter asking
for preliminary information. Several libraries that replied to the letter
interview declined the interview: Los Angeles, Oklahoma City, Baltimore, and
Louisville. Two        libraries
                           had to be excluded because of interview cost: Hawaii
and Seattle. While the interview group is not a random sample, it does include
over half of the largest public library systems in the country.

script, 1979.

     3The assignment of library systems to groups may be a little more diff i—
cult than it would seem. Dallas and Houston are served by a city library but
the cities encompass large areas of what would be suburbs in other metropolitan
areas. The Nilwauikee Public Library serves some limited area outside the city
on a contract basis. Perhaps it should be called a metropolitan library.
Many of the service areas do not match the political jurisdiction. Nineteen
municipalities in Jefferson County do not participate in the Public Library
of Birmingham and Jefferson County, Alabama. Two municipalities in St. Louis
County, Missouri have independent libraries. Tacoma Park is a municipality
that is partly In Montgomery County and partly In Prince Georges County, Mary-
land; it participates in neither library system.

     4Library acquisition policy will also be concerned with issues of quality
and taste. The Free Library of Philadelphia captured national attention for
Its refusal to stock the Nancy Drew stories on grounds that the stories are not
of the standard of quality that the Library could recommend them. Public li-
braries may differ in their willingness to acquire Gothic novels. The inter-
view survey did not pursue this issue.

                   and security personnel are more difficult to compare because
        6Naintenance
such services are frequently performed by contractors or by other agencies of
government. Thus the library budget may not reflect the full cost of mainte-
nance and security activities.

      71n most libraries, a certified librarian has a masters degree in library
science. American Library Association certification required a masters degree
in 19   .  Some libraries use librarians with bachelors degrees in much the
same way as others use the masters degree holders. We have classified per-
sonnel as professional according to the job labels used in the library system.
There has been some movement trard paraprofessional librarians. The inter—
views    did not pursue this issue.

    0ne might like to control for the simultaneity of library activitie8
and use. More library services may be offered in areas where people value
library services more highly. Greater levels of use may induce higher levels
of hours, books, and locations. In the study of New York, (N. Getz, The
Efficient Level, .   cit.) this simultaneity is dealt with directly. In
the cross system study, the sample size is too small to use the instrumental
method to control for simultaneity.
