CPI Bias from Supercenters: Does the BLS Know that Wal-Mart Exists

                                            ABSTRACT

Hausman (2003) discusses four sources of bias in the present calculation of the CPI. A "pure price"

index based approach of surveying prices as done by the BLS cannot succeed in solving the

problems of bias. We discuss economic and econometric approaches to measuring the first order bias

effects from outlet substitution bias. We demonstrate the use of scanner data that permits

implementation of techniques that allow the problem to be solved. In contrast, the current BLS

procedure does not treat correctly outlet substitution bias and acts as if Wal-Mart does not exist. Yet,

Wal-Mart offers identical food items at an average price about 15%-25% lower than traditional

supermarkets. The BLS "links out" Wal-Mart's lower prices. We find that a more appropriate

approach to the analysis is to let the choice to shop at Wal-Mart be considered as a "new good" to

consumers when Wal-Mart enters a geographic market. This approach leads to a continuously

updated expenditure weighted average price calculation. We find a significant difference between

our approach and the BLS approach. Our estimates are that the BLS CPI-U food at home inflation

is too high by about 0.32 to 0.42 percentage points, which leads to an upward bias in the estimated

inflation rate of about 15% per year.

        I. Introduction

                Hausman (2003) discusses four sources of bias in the present calculation of the
        CPI. The most often discussed substitution bias is a second order bias while the other
        three sources of bias are all first order in their effects: “new good bias”, “quality bias,”
        and “outlet substitution bias.” A “pure price” index based approach of surveying prices to
        estimate a COLI cannot succeed in solving the three problems of first order bias. Neither
        the BLS nor the recent report C. Schultze and C. Mackie, eds., At What Price (AWP,
        2002), recognizes that to solve these problems, which have been long known, both
        quantity and price data are necessary. We discuss economic and econometric approaches
        to measuring the first order bias effects from outlet substitution bias. We demonstrate the
        use of scanner data that permits implementation of techniques that allow the problem to
        be solved.
                Over the past decade, “non-traditional” shopping formats have captured significant
        share from “traditional grocery.” P. Little (2004) describes the two categories of
        alternative retail outlets as “high-spend” outlets, which are low price, one-stop shopping
        destinations, and “low and medium-spend” stores which are mostly convenience stores
        that serve a “fill-in” role in between trips to the “high-spend” outlets He includes
        supercenters (Wal-Mart, Kmart, Meijer, etc.), warehouse clubs (Sam’s Club, Costco and
        BJ’s), and mass merchants (Wal-Mart, Kmart, Target, etc.) as the primary outlets for
        these “high-spend” expenditures. 3 Using 2003 data, he estimates that these outlets have
        24.8% of food expenditures, with supercenters having 45.6% of the category. Over the

        past few years Wal-Mart has become the largest supermarket chain in the U.S. Wal-Mart,
        excluding its Sam’s Club, now has supermarket- related revenues approximately 51%
        larger than the runner-up Kroger, and larger than Albertsons and Safeway, the third and
        fourth largest supermarket chains, combined. Nationwide Wal-Mart has a 14% market
        share (in 2003), despite not being in a number of regional markets, and an 18% share
        when Sam’s Clubs are included. Within the “medium-low spend” category, Little
        estimates convenience stores that also sell gasoline as the fastest growing store type with
        85.5% of the 12.4% total share for the category. Little calculates that total traditional
        grocery outlets, including conventional supermarkets and superstores (a larger version of
        the conventional supermarket), have decreased to a 56.3% dollar share in 2003. He also
        forecasts that in 5 years, the “high-spend category” will grow from 24.8% to 31%, with
        supercenters comprising 54.8% of the total while traditional grocery outlets decrease from
        56.3% to 48.3%. Thus, he expects Wal-Mart to become increasingly important over the
        next few years, continuing the trend of change over the past decade.
                Wal-Mart began selling food in 1988 and in 2002 because the U.S. largest grocery
        chain. Wal-Mart now is larger than Kroger, Albertsons, and Safeway, which are the next
        largest supermarket chains. Significant consolidation has occurred in the supermarket
        industry, but Wal-Mart continues to grow at a significantly faster rate than these
        supermarket chains. The majority of Wal-Mart’s grocery sales arise from its over 1400
        (as of April 2004) supercenters which are 180,000 square foot stores that are both
        discount stores and grocery stores, although it also has “Neighborhood Market” stores
        that are about the size (40,000 sq. feet) of an average supermarket.4 While most of the
        stores are in the South and Southwest, Wal-Mart is increasing moving into urban centers
        with openings expected in Los Angeles and Chicago, along with other urban centers.4
                Over the 10-year period from 1991-2001 margins increased in supermarkets as the
        price of food sold at supermarkets grew at approximately twice the rate of the PPI for

  Wal-Mart management has given guidance that it expects to open between 230-240 new supercenters in 2005 for
an increase of about 16%. See Dow Jones, “Factiva,” April 19, 2004. Morgan Stanley reports that Wal-Mart is
seeking 16%-17% growth in supermarket sales compared with 3% industry growth. See M. Wiltamuth and R.
Fariborz, “Food Retail,” June 2004. Wal-Mart has grown at a 16% rate over the past three years.

  Wal-Mart has sometimes had difficulty in receiving planning approval for its stores. Currently, Wal-Mart has
either no presence or an extremely limited presence in New England, the New York metro area, California, and the
Pacific Northwest. However, its expansion into new areas has proceeded over the past few years.


                                                        2
        food. Over this period the PPI for finished food increased by 13.9% while the CPI for
        food at home increased by 27.7%. Various studies have demonstrated that food items at
        Wal-Mart are 8%-27% lower priced that at the large supermarket chains, even after
        discounts for loyalty card and other special are taken into account.5 After entry by Wal-
        Mart conventional supermarkets typically decrease their prices (or do not increase them
        as much as in non-Wal-Mart markets) because of the increased competition.
                 Remarkably, the large expansion and continuing expansion of Wal-Mart and other
        supercenter food outlets has almost no effect on the BLS calculation of the CPI for food.6
        The BLS employs a “linking procedure” that assumes “quality-adjusted” prices at Wal-
        Mart are exactly equal to prices at conventional supermarkets. Thus, when a Wal-Mart
        store replaces, say a Kroger, in the BLS sample of stores from which it collects prices, it
        links the lower Wal-Mart price to the higher Kroger price to remove any difference. Even
        though packaged food items are physically identical at the two stores, the BLS procedure
        does not recognize any price difference between the stores. This procedure is not based
        on any empirical study. Rather, it is based on mere assumption. The assumption is
        completely inconsistent with actual real world market outcomes where Wal-Mart has
        expanded very quickly in markets that it entered. Thus, Wal-Mart and other supercenters
        are nowhere in the food CPI so that we find that the BLS does not know that Wal-Mart
        “exists” in terms of the estimation of a CPI. We also believe that observed consumer
        behavior cannot be explained by the BLS assumption of a compensating “quality
        differential.” We specify a theoretical model of consumer behavior that demonstrates this
        point below.


        II.       Current BLS Procedure
                  The BLS methodology updates its samples of stores from which it collects prices
        periodically. It makes two adjustments. First it updates the products in the market basket

5
  A recent December 2003 study by UBS Investment Research found a price gap of 17.3% to 26.2%, “Price Gap
Tightens, Competition Looks Hot Hot Hot.” The previous year UBS found a price gap of 20.8% to 39.1%. For
example for a specified identical market basket UBS finds Wal-Mart supercenters to have an average price 19.1%
less expensive in Tampa and 22.8% less expensive in Las Vegas. In 2002, Salomon Smith Barney estimated the
price gap to be between 5% and 25%. See L. Cartwright, “Empty Baskets, September 12, 2002.
6
  When customers shift from conventional supermarkets to Wal-Mart no change occurs in the food CPI. To the
extent that prices at Wal-Mart decrease (or increase) at a different rate than conventional stores, the food CPI will
take account of this change with a lagged effect over time.


                                                           3
        that consumers purchase. The BLS also updates the stores at which these purchases are
        made. The BLS sometimes takes a very long time to incorporate new products in the
        market basket as in the case of cellular telephones, which were not included for 15 years
        after their introduction. Hausman (1999) demonstrates the significant bias from the delay
        in the introduction of cellular telephone. Cage (1996) describes the current BLS
        procedure of the “Continuing Point-of-Purchase Survey” (CPOPS), which provides the
        BLS with a sampling frame of outlets visited by urban consumers.7 Approximately 20%
        of all sampling units participate in a given year.. In 1999 the BLS began collecting the
        CPOPs data using computer assisted telephone interviews (CATI The new procedure,
        known as TPOPS, allowed an updated list of commodities in all sample units in each
        year, rather than only a 20% rotation per year. While the products can change, note that
        the expenditure shares across categories did not change with this procedure. The
        expenditure shares are only updated on a considerably less frequent basis since the
        CPOPs data does not collect expenditure data or quantity data.
                 When the BLS collects data, it collects the name and address of the retail
        establishment reported by respondents and estimates of the total daily expenditure by
        POPS category. The expenditure weights are not used to update the expenditure weights
        used in the weighted average of prices, rather they are used in the selection of outlets so
        that those outlets with larger expenditure weights receive a greater probability of
        selection.8 The use of CATI allows for between 20%-25% of the products and services to
        be re-sampled in every sampling unit each year.
                 TPOPS outlet rotation allows a closer approach to actual consumer shopping
        patterns as they change. As more households shop at Wal-Mart, the probability of a Wal-
        Mart being included in a given market increases. Item rotation also occurs as discussed
        above. However, when an identical item is sampled at the new outlet, even if the product
        is physically identical to the item sampled in the old outlet, the BLS does not take account
        of the lower price. Thus, if a 12 ounce box of Kellogg’s Rice Krispies is purchased at a
        Wal-Mart that is newly included to replace a Kroger that has been dropped; the BLS links

  The following discussion follows Cage (1998) closely.

  Note that this procedure may introduce bias because higher priced outlets will have higher expenditure weights
than lower priced outlets in many situations, mainly depending on the expenditure elasticity of the market basket
chosen.


                                                         4
        the new lower price to the old higher price so no price change occurs. This linking
        procedure creates outlet substitution bias in the estimation of the CPI. In the AWP (2002,
        p. 168) discussion of BLS procedures, it is claimed that consumer shopping comprises a
        package and that non-monetary benefits exactly balance out the effects of the lower price.
        This finding was based on absolutely no empirical evidence whatsoever. The finding is
        also completely inconsistent with the real world market facts that expenditures at
        supercenters grow quickly when they become available. Indeed, Wal-Mart is now the
        largest supermarket chain in the U.S.
                This “compensating service effect” explanation is also inconsistent with the
        “indirect price effect” that we estimate subsequently, where we find that as expenditure at
        superstores increases in a given market, the prices at traditional supermarkets decrease.
        For example, after two Wal-Mart supercenters opened in Houston, a nearby Kroger’s
        sales dropped 10%, the Kroger store reduced worker hours by 30%-40%, and it decreased
        its prices.9 Presumably this price decrease is caused by greater competition. Thus,
        consumers demonstrate with their expenditure choice that they prefer lower priced
        outlets, and the higher priced supermarket must respond in a competitive manner. The
        AWP description of the BLS assumption that markets are in equilibrium is inconsistent
        with the real world market data, which find that prices from traditional stores decrease
        from the increased competition.
                 Thus, when a new set of stores are included in the BLS sample, the linking
        procedure eliminates all of the price differences. Even though the box of Kellogs Rice
        Krispies is identical in all respects, the BLS assumes that the quality of the shopping
        experience completely explains the difference in price. Thus, lower prices from increased
        expenditure at superstores have no effect on the CPI. In all respects, the BLS assumes
        that Wal-Mart does not exist in constructing the CPI.
                 Reinsdorf (1993) found that food and motor-fuel prices during a two-year overlap
        period led to new samples prices being lower by about 1.25% compared to the outgoing
        samples. Since sample rotation occurs every 5 years, this finding would create a 0.25%
        bias per year. However, Reinsdorf’s quantitative findings have not been totally accepted


9
 P. Callahan and A. Zimmerman (2003) report on these effects. The regional head of Kroger’s stated, “Wal-Mart
made us look at ourselves and reinvent ourselves.”


                                                       5
        because of concerns about product quality as well as differences in coverage. The AWP
        (2002, p. 176) recommended that the BLS continue its current practice and disregard the
        effect of Wal-Mart and other supercenters on prices and price indices.




        III. A Utility-Consistent Economic Model of Shopping Destination
                 The BLS assumes that an exact compensating “quality differential” exists between
        shopping at a supercenter store with its lower prices and a conventional supermarket.
        Service quality and other factors supposedly allow the BLS to assume that quality
        adjusted prices are exactly the same when the BLS links the prices. However, this
        assumption is inconsistent with real world market behavior that finds when Wal-Mart
        opens a store in a new geographic market, it rapidly gains share while conventional
        supermarkets lose share.10 We believe that a better model than the implicit BLS model is
        to consider Wal-Mart supercenters as a new choice to consumers. Some consumers find
        the choice to be superior while others continue to shop at conventional supermarkets.11
        Thus, the arrival of Wal-Mart in a given geographic market is similar to the introduction
        of a new good into the geographic market. Hausman (1997, 2003) discusses how new
        products should be included in a correct cost of living index (COLI). Here, rather than a
        completely new product, e.g. cellular telephones, an existing product is expanded into a
        new geographic market. However, the effect on consumers is similar since they now
        have increased choice in their shopping trips.
                 For our economic model we consider the conditional choice of consumers to shop
        at either a conventional supermarket or at a lower price, and perhaps lower service
        quality, supercenter. For ease of exposition, we use a two-stage choice model in which at
        the lower stage the consumer considers his or her shopping behavior conditional on type
        of store. The consumer calculates a price index for shopping at either type of store, takes

10
   Supermarket chains sometimes exit a geographic market after Wal-Mart enters. Albertsons exited the Houston
market after Wal-Mart entry. However, in our model we assume that consumers continue to have access to
traditional supermarkets, even if a given chain exits the market.
11
   As we discussed above, these conventional supermarkets typically decrease price because of the increased
competition from Wal-Mart. If the BLS consistently applied its “quality adjustment” procedure it would ignore
these price decreases at conventional supermarkets because presumably they arise from reduced service quality.
However, the BLS fully incorporates these price decreases, demonstrating that its approach is based on no correct
economic assumptions.


                                                         6
        account of service and other quality differences, and then at the upper stage decides
        which type of store to shop at.12 We use the two-stage approach of Hausman (1985) and
        Hausman, Leonard and McFadden (1995), although neither of the models was designed
        precisely for the situation of shopping destination choice.
                  We allow for consumers choice of shopping at either a conventional supermarket,
        j=1, or at a supercenter, j=2. Conditional on choosing to shop at one of these two types of
        stores the consumer has a conditional expenditure function


         y = e( p 0, p1 , p 2 ,..., p n ; u ) = e( p, u ) solves min ∑ pi xi such that u ( x) = u

        choice, p j = { p1 , p 2 ,... p n

        denoted by the superscript j, and u is the utility level of the consumer.13 The conditional
        demand for each type of product, depending on the type of outlet j chosen is:

        where the indirect utility function v(p,y) is derived from the duality relationship with the
        expenditure function. Using duality corresponding to any level of utility in equation (3.1)
        and any vector of prices, a price index exists that corresponds to the minimum
        expenditure required to achieve a given level of utility u . Indeed, the utility consistent
        price index is the level of expenditure needed to achieve the utility level:


                  Π ( p j , u ) = e( p j , u ) = y j ( p j , u ) = y j = ∑ p i x i
                                                                                              j   j
                                                                                                         (3.3)
                                                                                      i




12
   We assume that consumers do not divide their shopping trips between different types of stores, although this
behavior could be incorporated into the model.
13
   As written, equation (3.1) assumes that both types of stores carry all goods. To the extent that supermarkets carry
a wider variety of products that supercenters, the prices for supercenters can be entered as virtual prices that set
demand to zero. See Hausman (1997) for an explanation of virtual prices.


                                                                             7
        An “average price” p j can then be calculated by dividing y j by a quantity index x j so

        that y j = p j x j . 14
                 We now move to the top level where the consumer decides whether to shop at the
        conventional supermarket or at the supercenter outlet. We expect y 1 > y 2 because most
        prices in supermarkets exceed the prices in supercenters. Consider the use of the
        binomial logit model for choice between traditional supermarkets and supercenters.15 The
        probability of choosing the traditional supermarket is:


                                                         1
                  pr ( j = 1) =                                                                                    (3.4)
                                     1 + exp( β 0 + β 1 ( p 1 − p 2 ))


        where a log price index or other type of price index (e.g. a Stone price index) can also be
        used depending on the precise form of the underlying expenditure (utility) and demand
        functions in equation (3.1) and (3.2).16
                 If we can assume that the overall units of a good are the same, e.g. Kellogg’s Rice
        Krispies, we can simplify so that the overall demand for good i becomes:


                  xˆ i ( p 0 , p 1 , p 2 , y ) = pr ( j = 1) xi ( p 0 , p 1 , y ) + pr ( j = 2) xi ( p 0 , p 2 , y ) (3.5)


        where the right hand side demands are the conditional demands from equation (3.2) and
        have common units. Similarly, to calculate the unconditional price for the representative
        consumer we take overall expenditure on good i and divide by the quantity of equation
        (3.5):


                  pˆ i ( p 0 , p 1 , p 2 , y ) = Ξ i ( p 0 , p 1 , p 2 , y ) / xˆ i ( p 0 , p 1 , p 2 , y )        (3.6)




14
   Instead of the average price we can also divide expenditure by utility to get a “cost of utils” index.
15
   Because of only two choices, the independence of irrelevant alternative assumption does not create a problem
here. With more than two choices a nested logit or multinomial probit model could be used. See Hausman et. al.
(1995) for a derivation with the nested logit model.
16
   An exact aggregation approach when using a Gorman generalized polar form appears in Hausman et. al. (1995).


                                                                        8
         where Ξ i is expenditure on good i. If choice j = 2 does not exist in a given geographic

         market, then the price index of equation (3.6) is just the traditional supermarket price so

         that pˆ i ( p 1 , p 2* , y ) = p 1 where p 2* are the virtual prices, which cause demand at

         supercenters to be zero.17 But when supercenters become available, consumers who

         choose to shop at supercenters do so to maximize their utility and the correct price index

         is an expenditure weighted average of the two prices. This expenditure weighted

         approach to price averages is the procedure we use in the empirical work that follows.

                 Thus, the exact cost of living index becomes

                                              y 2 ( p 0 , p 1 , p 2 , u ) e( p 0 , p 1 , p 2 , u )
                  P( p0 , p 2 , p 1 , u ) =                               =                            (3.7)
                                              y 1 ( p 0 , p 1 , p 2* , u ) e( p 0 , p 1 , p 2* , u )

         which gives the ratio of the required amount of income when supercenters are present in
         the market compared to the situation where supercenters are not present and prices are at
         the virtual level p 2* , which causes demand to be zero. Equation (3.7) demonstrates how
         the new good approach applies to supercenters when the correct unit of observation is a
         geographic market, rather than a new product. Taking the appropriate weighted averages
         of equation (3.7) leads to an expenditure share weighted approach.
                 Thus, we do not find support for the BLS assumption of an exact compensating
        quality differential when consumers can choose which type of outlet at which to shop.
        Some consumers continue to shop at traditional supermarkets when supercenters become
        available, while other consumers shift to shopping at supercenters. In terms of the
        representative consumer we calculate the probability weights for each type of choice
        multiplied by the demand at each type of outlet and divide this weighted demand into
        expenditure to derive the price index. As more supercenters become available in a given


17
   To the extent that traditional supermarkets close because of increased supercenter competition, consumers have
decreased choice, which could effect price index calculations. However, in the model we assume that consumers
still have the choice to shop at one or more traditional supermarkets, i.e. that not all supermarkets in a given
geographic market close. In this situation which is consistent with actual market outcomes, the effect on a
theoretical price index would be extremely small. Indeed, supermarkets that close typically have the smallest
customer base, which further decreases the effect of store closings on a price index.


                                                                  9
geographic market, more consumers choose to shop at supercenters and its expenditure
weight increases. We continuously update the expenditure weights to allow for this
observed market determined change in shopping destination choices. Consumers in their
revealed preference choices determine the appropriate weights to be used in the price
index.
         We find that Wal-Mart should exist in the estimation of a price index, contrary to
the current BLS procedure. However, note that as Hausman (2003) emphasized, to
implement this approach both prices and quantities need to be available, which
necessitates the use of scanner data. The BLS approach, which only collects price data,
cannot implement the correct price index approach. Without quantity data, the BLS will
always be required to make one or another arbitrary assumption regarding “service
adjusted” quality levels. Observation of actual consumer choice in terms of quantities
purchased allows us to resolve the problem.



IV. Data Description
         This study uses a customized subset of the ACNielsen Homescan scanner panel
data for the four years 1998-2001. The ACNielsen Homescan data is a consumer panel
consisting of approximately 61,500 randomly selected households across the U.S. and
includes purchase as well as demographic information for all households in the sample.
Homescan households are randomly recruited to join the panel using sampling techniques
to ensure household representation for demographic variables such as household income,
family composition, education, and household location. Each household is equipped with
an electronic home-scanning unit, and household members record every UPC-coded food
purchase they make by scanning in the UPC of the food products that they buy from all
retail outlets that sell food for home consumption.
         The panel is recruited on a permanent basis, subject to turnover from normal
attrition or adjustments to demographic targets necessitated by Census revisions.18 The
Homescan panel is considered by many in the food industry as the most reliable
household based panel data due to its long-standing reputation in the marketplace and its
utilization of hand-held technology that minimizes the recording burden for participants.




                                         10
           The ACNielsen Homescan consumer panel collects consumer shopping and purchase
            data from all outlet channels, including grocery, drug, mass and convenience stores. The
            panel is geographically dispersed and is demographically balanced so the sample profile
            matches the US population as closely as possible. The panel data is also projected to
            census estimates that are updated regularly to reflect population changes.
                    Household panel data allows for observation of the ongoing purchase habits and
            practices of household and demographic groups. Tracking and analyzing this
            information over time can reveal the dynamics of consumer behavior such as who is
            buying what products, what different products are purchased during a given shopping
            trip, and how often a product is purchased. Panel data quantifies the composition of
            category or brand volume which can be used to measure the impact of store choice on the
            purchase level of product quantities and prices. Data are collected after each panelist
            shopping trip. Members of the panel record their purchases, capturing not only what is
            purchased, but also where the purchase was made, and whether the purchase was a
            promotional, sale, or coupon item.
                     These data are useful in price analysis since we are able to observe actual
            purchase choices by consumers. However, in terms of food purchase behavior, the key
            missing information is consumer purchases of food away from home (primarily
            restaurant meals) so one needs to assume that the unknown levels of food away from
            home purchases do not somehow bias the average prices paid by an individual household
            for their food at home purchases. Once this assumption is made these data are useful for
            analysis of the impact of store choice on average prices paid for food at home items.
            Consumer panel information can be used to measure the average prices paid by a
            representative group of households over time. This measurement of average price paid
            can be aggregated across households and/or across time to measure price change for
            different categories of products.
                    Along with the description of each product, the price and quantity that was
            purchased is recorded on a daily basis. National and regional level aggregates can be
            calculated using transaction data from households located in 50 local U.S. markets as
            well as households in non-metro/rural areas that are included in this data set. For 21 of

18
     Households lost through attrition are replaced with others having similar key characteristics.


                                                            11
         these 50 markets, a large enough number of panelists are included to enable comparisons
         across markets for all UPC-coded products. 19
                  The Economic Research Service (ERS) of the USDA purchased a sub-sample of
         transaction level data from the Fresh Foods Homescan Panel20 comprised of households
         that not only recorded their UPC-coded transactions, but also recorded their random-
         weight (non-UPC coded) food purchases over the year(s) that they participated in the
         panel. This sub-sample was used for this study in order to be able measure the entire
         market basket of household purchases of food for at-home consumption21. Of this group
         of 15,000 households per year, the sample was restricted to households that participated
         in the panel for at least 10 out of 12 months per year22.
                 Standard demographic information is collected on an annual basis from each
         household and each household’s home market/city and census region is identified for
         stratification purposes (see below). Each household is then assigned a projection factor
         (weight) based on its demographics in order to aggregate the data to be representative at
         the market, regional, and national level. 23
                  These data were constructed based on a stratified random sample with households
         as the primary sampling unit. A stratified random sample is used to ensure that the

   The Fresh Foods Homescan Panel contained 12,000 households in 1998 and 1999 and was expanded to 15,000
households in 2000 and 2001.
21
   If only UPC-coded products were used to measure food-at-home expenditures, many fruit, vegetable, meat, and
poultry purchases would not be recorded in the data and food-at-home expenditure shares by store type would not
accurately measure true household and market expenditure shares. This is especially true in this situation when
alternative channel stores sell less random weight items than conventional retailers. Leaving out random weight
items would then tend to overstate the shares of food expenditures of alternative retail outlets.

22
  In total, there were 9,501 unique households in the data with some subset participating each year creating a total
of 28,996 household by year observations. In 1998 there were 7,624 households, 7,124 households in 1999, 7,523
households in 2000, and 8,216 households in 2001. Some households participated in the panel for more than one
year. Of the 9,501 households in the data, 5,247 households participated for all four years, 1,877 households
participated for three years, and 2,377 households were one year participants.

           Atlanta, Baltimore/Washington, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, and San Antonio. All
           other households fall into one of four census regions: East, Central, South, and West.

        There was no known or intentional clustering in the sample construction. The projection
        factor (weight) reflects the sample design and demographic distribution within the strata.
                 The information that is captured on a transaction level basis includes: date of
        purchase, store name and channel type identifier25, store department identifier26, item
        description, brand name, number of units purchased, price paid,
        promotions/sales/coupons used (if any). For retail stores that ACNielsen tracks with their
        store-level scanner data27, prices are verified through store-level price and promotion
        checks.
                 Warehouse shipment data are used to supplement scanner-generated data
        collected from households or provided to ACNielsen through their store-level scanner
        data. Warehouse shipment data is used to estimate the balance of sales moving through
        other food retailers. This information is Census data (i.e., non-projected, actual shipment
        data) supplied to ACNielsen by wholesale co-operators.
                 Some question the quality of household panel data when they try to reconcile it
        with store-level scanner data. There is the perception that the volumetric data from each
        source should be the same. However, panel data and store data are not always equal
        because measurement methodologies differ. Store-level data records millions of

25
   Grocery, Drug, Mass Merchandiser, Supercenter, Club, Convenience, Other (including dollar stores, bakeries,
military stores, online purchases, health food stores, and vending machines)
26
   Dry Grocery, Dairy, Frozen-Produce-Meat, Random Weight.
27
   The ACNielsen store-level sample is updated through both replacement of canceled or closed stores and
Continuous Sample Improvement Program -- when the sample is changed intentionally to ensure that changes in the
universe are reflected in the sample.


                                                      14
     shopping transactions while panel data records a specific group of shoppers. In addition,
     panel data only represents household-based purchases, so there are no small businesses or
     other institutional purchases included in the panel.
            Both types of information have their uses, and by combining the two, one can
     quantify the composition of volume, understand the reasons behind consumer behavior
     changes, and measure the impact of store choice on average prices. Store-level scanning
     data may show that sales were down in a particular store for some group of products in a
     given time period. Panel data provide insight into whether the lost volume is due to
     fewer buyers or if the existing buyers purchased less at the given store or chain of stores.
     Panel data also provide information on which competitors gained the lost expenditures of
     the store in question.


V.      Effects on Prices
            Our empirical approach first investigates the effect of supercenters, mass
     merchandisers, and club stores, (hereafter SMC) on prices paid by households. Two
     effects are present. The direct effect is that as more of these superstores operate in a
     given geographic market, the average prices paid by households will decrease. Prices for
     food categories in superstores are typically 5%-48% less than prices for the same product
     in supermarkets and other conventional retail outlets. Thus, as a high proportion of
     households buy their food at non-traditional retail outlets, the average price paid in a
     market will decrease.


            A. Price Difference between Supermarkets and Superstores
            In Table 5.1 we calculate the ratios of average prices across different types of
     outlets for 20food categories. Column 2 compares the prices for the food categories in
     traditional supermarkets compared to prices for these same categories in SMCs (non-
     traditional stores).

            The largest difference in average price was for lettuce where SMC prices were about
            50% lower than traditional supermarkets over the 48 month period. Bottled water was
            the lowest price difference with SMC prices about 5% less expensive. Soda was the only
            item with a lower price in traditional supermarkets than in SMCs. When we take an
            average across all of the food categories we find that SMCs have prices that are 27%
            lower than traditional supermarkets. We find this difference to be quite large.28
                   In column 3 of Table 5.1 we compare the price in all non-SMC outlets, including
            traditional supermarkets, to the price of these food categories in superstores. We find the
            results to be quite similar with the main differences occurring in soda and bottled water.
            We find the same overall results that SMC stores offer significantly lower prices than
            other retail outlets.
                   We do not find any indication that SMC stores change (increase) their prices at a
            greater or lower rate than traditional supermarkets and other retail outlets. However, we
            cannot do the comparison of price changes in equilibrium because as the presence of

     The estimated difference is in line with stock analyst reports who have previously sampled the difference in prices

         SMC stores increases, traditional retail outlets, and most importantly traditional
         supermarkets, decrease their prices as a competitive response.


                  B. Direct and Indirect Effects on Prices from Superstores
                  Another important effect exists from the expansion of SMC stores. Their
         increasing presence also increases competition among traditional food retailers. These
         supermarkets must decrease prices to remain competitive. The well-publicized strike in
         the Los Angeles area in late 2003 through early 2004 when traditional supermarkets
         wanted to decrease health benefit for their employees demonstrates the effect that
         potential entry of supercenters can have on competition. We call this SMC effect on
         traditional supermarkets the indirect price effect. Both the direct and indirect price
         effects lead to lower average prices for households.
                  To investigate both the direct and indirect effects on average prices, we do an
         econometric analysis using the ACNielsen Homescan data. These data are particularly
         useful since they provide household data and allow for a stratified random sample of all
         households. Importantly they provide both price and quantity data across all stores.
         Since Wal-Mart and some other large superstores no longer participate in the IRI or
         ACNielsen store level data collection, household data collection provide a source of price
         and quantity data that are not available elsewhere.29
                  We analyze data at the market level using a fixed effects specification with 48
         monthly observations for each market during the period 1998-2001:


                   pit = α i + δ t + βeit + ε it   i = 1, 34 t = 1, 48                              (5.1)


         where pit is the average log price paid for a given product, α i is a fixed effect for a

         market, δ t is a monthly fixed effect, eit is percentage expenditure for a given product in

         superstores, and β is thee elasticity coefficient that wee estimate. We use market fixed


over a very few markets.
29 Since the SMC stores continue to collect the data for internal use, we believe that if the BLS were to begin to use
scanner data these large stores would likely allow use of their data under confidentiality restrictions. However, the
household data provide an adequate source of information for most uses.


                                                         17
effects rather than random effects because expenditure in SMC stores is unlikely to be
uncorrelated with the stochastic disturbance, e.g. Hausman (1978). In this situation a
fixed effects estimator yields the efficient estimator. However, we make two further
econometric adjustments. First, expenditure in superstores on a given product may well
not be econometrically pre-determined. Thus, we use instrumental variable estimation
(2SLS) where as the instrument we use the overall proportion of food expenditure in
SMC stores in a given market as the instrumental variable. Also, we use an
autoregressive model for the stochastic disturbance (AR1) to capture the time series
aspect of the data and to achieve more efficient estimates. However, least squares with
robust standard errors leads to quite similar results.
       For our econometric investigation of 20 food products we use 34 markets, each
with over 12,000 food transactions per year. The 34 markets are listed in Table 5.1:

For each of these markets we standardized purchases on a physical unit measure and
estimated the effect of increasing purchases in SMC stores. Since we have fixed effects
for each market, persistent cost and price differences should be take account of as well as
seasonal effects given the presence of monthly fixed effects. We give the econometric
estimates for these 20 food categories across the 34 markets in Table 5.2:

All of the estimated elasticity coefficients are negative as expected. Thus as households
spend increasing amounts of expenditure at SMCs, the average prices paid for food items
decrease. While the effects are estimated with varying amount of precision, overall the
results are highly significantly different from zero. No obvious pattern of coefficient size
seems to exist: we find the largest effects for ham, lettuce, butter/margarine, tomatoes,
potatoes, and coffee, which are a mix of branded and unbranded products. Yet, we find
relatively small effects for ground beef, apples and bananas, which are typically
unbranded products, but we also find relatively small effects for cereal and yogurt, which
typically are branded products. Overall, we find a statistically negative effect on
average prices as shopping in superstores increases. Thus, we find the “direct effect”
operates as household shift their expenditure from traditional supermarkets to lower
priced superstore outlets.
       In Graph 5.1 we depict the difference in average prices paid by households due to
the spread of SMC stores over the period. During the sample period from January 1998
to December 2001 the expenditure share of SMC stores increased from 10.9% to 16.9%,
a 55.3% increase over the 48 months or 11.6% per year. We take the econometric
estimates from Table 5.2 and use them to estimate the decrease in average price for each
food category. We then average across food categories and plot the results in Graph 5.1,
which demonstrates the increasing effect on average food prices as SMCs become more
available and households increase their expenditures at these retail outlets. We find that
food prices are 3.0% lower than otherwise, or an effect of about 0.75% year.

The estimated coefficient for butter/margarine in Table 5.2 is quite large at –0.8192. The
estimated effect of the spread of superstores on the price of butter/margarine is –5.63%
over the 48 month period. The effect on the price of yogurt is presented in Graph 5.3.
The estimated coefficient for the price of yogurt is considerably smaller at –0.1832.

Thus, in Graph 5.3 the effect on the average price of yogurt over the 48 month period is –
1.1%. From Graphs 5.2 and 5.3 we see that significantly different price effects exist for
different food products due to the spread of SMCs and increased expenditure at those
SMCs by households.
                           We now repeat the econometrics to test for the “indirect effect” of lower
conventional supermarket prices because of increased competition from superstores. In
equation (5.1) we replace the left-hand variable pit, which is the average log price paid
for a given product, with ~
                          p , which is the average price paid in supermarkets. We give
                                               it


the results in Table 5.3:

           We estimate 18 of the 20 coefficients to be negative, with the only exceptions being
           bread and cereal, neither of which is statistically significant.30 As would be expected
           from economic theory, the effects of increased SMC expenditures are smaller for most of
           the products. Thus, the “direct effect” on average prices paid by household arising from
           substitution to lower priced SMCs typically exceeds the “indirect effect” of decreased
           prices in supermarkets. Nevertheless, we do find some quite large indirect effects as in
           lettuce, butter/margarine, coffee, ice cream, potatoes, tomatoes, and bottled water. The
           spread of supercenters leads to lower prices both for households that shift their food
           shopping from supermarket to SMC stores but also for households who continue to shop
           at supermarkets because of lower prices caused by the increased competition from
           expanding food offerings at SMCs.
                  In terms of one of the questions we posed at the beginning of the paper, the spread
           of supercenters does significantly affect prices paid by households. However, to
           correctly estimate the effect both quantities and prices must be utilized. Holding prices
           fixed as households shift their expenditures to non-traditional retail outlets, we find the
           average prices they pay decrease. However, prices also change because as households
           shift their purchasing behavior, the increased competition forces supermarkets to lower
           their prices. Both of these effects, the direct effect and indirect effect, lead to lower
           average prices paid by households for food items.


     VI.      Effect on Price Indices
                  Since our scanner based data set includes observation on both quantity and price,
           we are able to construct a price index that takes account of both increased expenditure at
           SMC stores as well as the effects of substitution when consumers face lower prices.

30
   We find very similar results if we group the remaining Nielsen categories with supermarket: drug stores,
convenience, and “other”. These other outlet categories have relatively low expenditure levels compared to
traditional supermarkets.


                                                        24
Thus, we are to consider a source of first order bias in the CPI, outlet substitution bias, as
well as the source of second order bias, substitution bias that occurs with the lower prices
at the SMC outlets.
       Food expenditures at SMC outlets have increased over the years in question. In
January 1998, in our sample of 34 markets, we find an expenditure share of 0.1090. At
the end of the sample, 48 months later, in December 2001 we find an expenditure share
of 0.1693. Thus, the expenditure increased by .0603 or by 55.3% over the 48 months or
11.6% per year. The share has continued to increase as new SMC food outlets have
continued to open and as consumers have increasingly shopped at these outlets.
       We estimate the effect of this increased expenditure in lower priced SMC outlets
on the 20 food categories we considered above and an overall food price index. We
consider three indices in Table 6.1: (1) Continuous update: a continuously updated,
Divisia-style, price index where aggregates food expenditure shares across outlets from
the current month are used to construct a share weighted average price for each food
category. Note that since we have scanner data we can update both the food expenditure
shares (quantity data) and the price data each month. This continuous updating allows us
to control for both outlet substitution bias, a first order bias in the CPI, and substitution
bias, a second order bias in the CPI. (2) BLS Constant Weights: we keep the expenditure
shares constant over the 48 months. We use current prices each month, but we take a
weighted average using the expenditure weights as of January 1998. Thus, both outlet
substitution bias and price substitution bias are present in the calculated index. (3) BLS
with updated yearly expenditure weights: In January of each year we rotate stores and
link the prices to the preceding December. We are assuming here that the BLS TPOPS
procedure leads to a correctly reweighted sample each year, but that price linking
removes the lower price effect of the shift by consumers to increasing expenditures at
SMCs (4) Biennial Update which is closest to the current BLS procedure. We now
update the expenditure weights across stores based on the previous December. We
continue to use the BLS linking procedure. Thus, we continue to have outlet substitution
bias but we have reduced price substitution bias because of the yearly updates. While we
cannot tell exactly which method BLS used, we believe method (4) is the closest to
current BLS procedures.

              In Table 6.1 we see that Method (1), the Continuous Update procedure, almost
       always leads to lower price increases or greater price decreases for all food products over
       the 48 month period. For example, apples have a price increase estimated at 1.6%.
       Method (2) calculates an increase of 2.8%. The difference is 0.12 percentage points or a
       difference of 15.0% per year. Method (3), which allows for yearly updated expenditure
       weights, calculates an increase of 3.2% per year, 0.16 percentage points more than
       Method (1), or a difference of 18.9% per year. Lastly, Method (4), which uses biennial
       updates to the weights, again calculates an increase of 3.2% per year or a difference of
       18.9% per year. To our initial surprise, while Method (1) finds the lowest price increase
       as expected, Method (2) often estimates a lower price increase than Method (3) or
       Method (4). However, we now recognize this outcome as the result of the BLS linking



                                               26
procedure that eliminates the effect of the lower prices when customers switch outlets.
Method (2) captures the “indirect effect” of lower prices when the presence of
supercenters increases, but Methods (3) and (4) eliminate part of this indirect effect
because they update the expenditure weights. Thus, the outcome of a more continual
updating of expenditure weights leads to a perverse result because of the “linking out” of
lower prices in SMCs.
       When we take average yearly changes across all food categories we find the
estimated difference between Method (1) and Method (2) to be 0.32% a year. This
estimate is the same order of magnitude, but somewhat higher than Reinsdorf’s (1993)
estimate. In terms of the BLS CPI-U for food at home which averaged 2.29% over this
period, the 0.32% per year difference is 14.0%. Thus, we estimate that the Method (2)
has an upward bias of approximately 14.0% because of its linking procedure, which
eliminates the effect of households shifting their expenditure to lower price supercenter
outlets such as Wal-Mart.
       We next compare Method (1) to Method (3), which allows for updated
expenditure weights each year. Here we find an estimated difference between Method
(1) and Method (3) of increase of about 0.36% per year. We find an upward bias in the
Method (3) measure of food at home to be upward biased by 15.7%. If we compare
Method (4), the biennial update method, we find the estimated average difference to be
0.42% per year. In terms of Method (4), which is probably most similar to the
calculation of the BLS CPI-U for food at home, the 0.42% per year difference is 18.3%.
The years 1998-2001 were generally a period of low inflation, but we still find significant
difference in estimates of the food price indices dues to shift towards lower price outlets.
We find an upward bias in the range of 14.0% to 18.3% in the estimate of the CPI for
food at home because of the use of the BLS linking procedure. Thus, updating the
expenditure weights significantly reduces the bias in the estimated price index
       In Graph 6.1 we plot the Method (1) price index where January 1998 is set equal
to 1.0. Over the entire period we estimate a price increase of 12.1% or 2.5% per year.

   .
   While this estimate is for just the 20 food products we have investigated to date, we note
   that the BLS CPI-U food at home index increased by 9.48% over the same period or
   2.29% per year. The estimates are quite comparable, but the CPI-U index is over a much
   wider range of food products than the index we have computed. We intend to widen the
   range of food categories we for which estimate the effects of shifts to lower price outlets
   in future versions of this paper.




VII.      Conclusion
                            Over the past 15 years the largest development in food retailing has been the start
   of Wal-Mart supercenters that compete most closely with traditional supermarkets. Wal-
   Mart has expanded greatly, mostly in the South and Southwest, and become the largest
   supermarket chain in the U.S. Wal-Mart is now expanding into additional geographic
   markets in California and the upper Midwest, so its effects will become even more




                                                               28
           important.31 Wal-Mart offers identical food items at an average price about 15%-25%
           lower than traditional supermarkets. Wal-Mart’s entry into a new geographic market
           creates a direct price effect by offering a lower price option to consumers and an indirect
           price effect by causing traditional supermarkets to lower their prices because of the
           increased competition.
                   The BLS procedure currently does not take account of the lower price option that
           Wal-Mart offers when it enters and expands in a given geographic market. The BLS only
           captures the indirect price effect. Instead, the BLS “links out” Wal-Mart’s lower prices
           by assuming that an exact “compensating service quality differential” exists that exactly
           counteracts Wal-Mart’s lower prices. If this assumption were correct, we would not see
           the rapid gain in market share by Wal-Mart after its entry into a market.
                    We find that a more appropriate approach to the analysis is to let the choice to
           shop at Wal-Mart be considered as a “new good” to consumers when Wal-Mart enters a
           geographic market. Some consumers continue to shop at traditional supermarkets while
           other consumers choose to shop at Wal-Mart. For the representative consumer we take a
           utility-consistent probability weighted average of the choice of shopping destination.32
           This approach leads to a continuously updated expenditure weighted average price
           calculation, which we apply to food data in 34 markets over a 48 month period.
           However, this approach requires quantity data as well as price data, so the BLS would
           need to begin to use scanner data to implement our approach. Currently the BLS collects
           only price data, but does not collect quantity (or expenditure) data that it incorporates
           into the CPI except at lengthy intervals.
                   We find a significant difference between our approach and the BLS approach,
           even for the relatively low food inflation period of 1998-2001 that we study in this paper.
           Our estimates are that the BLS CPI-U food at home inflation is too high by about 0.32 to
           0.42 percentage points, which leads to an upward bias in the estimated inflation rate of
           about 15% per year. We intend to expand our approach to more food categories in
           further research, but we find that the BLS should take account of Wal-Mart and other
           non-traditional retail outlets, rather than making believe that Wal-Mart does not exist.
