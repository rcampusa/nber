                                            ABSTRACT

The best predictor of current investment at the firm level is lagged investment. This lagged-investment
effect is empirically more important than the cash-flow and Q effects combined. We show that the
specification of investment adjustment costs proposed by Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans (2005)
predicts the presence of a lagged-investment effect and that a generalized version of their model is
consistent with the behavior of firm-level data from Compustat.

1. Introduction

Lagged investment is a much better predictor of investment than Tobin’s Q and
cash flow combined. While this fact has been recognized in empirical work on
investment, it has mostly been viewed as an inconvenience. Hayahi’s (1982) re-
sult that investment should depend only on Tobin’s Q placed Q at the center
of the empirical investment literature. The potential role of financial frictions
or other deviations from Hayashi’s framework motivated the subsequent work on
the cash-flow e§ect found in the data.1 While much progress has been made in
understanding the role of Q and cash flow in investment regressions, an important
question remains: what explains the lagged-investment e§ect?
       In this paper we first document the importance and robustness of the lagged-
investment e§ect in firm-level Compustat data. We then use these data to estimate
the investment adjustment-cost model proposed by Christiano, Eichenbaum, and
Evans (2005) (henceforth CEE). This specification was designed to make the im-
pulse response of investment to monetary policy shocks generated by DSGE mod-
els consistent with the impulse response estimated using vector auto-regressions.
It has since become standard in the DSGE literature.2
       We show analytically that the CEE model predicts the presence of a lagged-
investment e§ect in addition to cash-flow and Q e§ects.3 Moreover, regression
coe¢cients obtained from our model-generated data are similar in magnitude to
empirical estimates. We also find that a generalized version of CEE does surpris-
ingly well at explaining the patterns of persistence, volatility, and comovement

     Examples of papers that use this adjustment-cost specification include Fernández-Villaverde
and Rubio-Ramírez (2004), Smets and Wouters (2007), Justiniano and Primiceri (2008), Del
Negro and Schorfheide (2009), and Gertler and Kiyotaki (2010).

     Gilchrist and Himmelberg (1998) raise the possibility that the highly significant lagged-
investment e§ect in their data could be generated by a di§erent adjustment-cost formulation.

       Our paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe the data and
document the presence of a lagged-investment e§ect. In Section 3 we show an-
alytically that a linearized version of the CEE model predicts the presence of a
lagged-investment e§ect. We then discuss a generalized version of the model that
we use in our estimation. Section 4 presents our estimation results and discusses
the model’s implications for investment regressions. Section 5 concludes.


2. The lagged-investment e§ect

In this section we describe our data set and use it to document the importance of
lagged investment as a predictor of current investment. We also summarize some
key features of the data.
       We use a balanced panel of Compustat firms with annual data for the period
1981-2003. We use a balanced panel because the time dimension of the data is im-
portant in identifying the dynamics of the model. The sample includes 776 firms
and roughly 14, 000 firm-year observations. We focus our analysis on the large
firms in our dataset, defined as those in the top quartile of firms sorted by size of
the capital stock in 1981. In the beginning of the sample, the top quartile of firms
represents 30 percent of aggregate private non-residential investment and 40 per-
cent of corporate non-residential investment.4 This focus on large firms coupled
with the fact that the balanced panel selects for more stable firms means that we
can reasonably abstract from any financing frictions which might be present for
smaller firms. We use data for the four variables present in our model: invest-
ment in property, plant, and equipment, the physical capital stock, Q, and cash
   4
    Despite our focus on the largest firms, there remains considerable size heterogeneity within
that group: the time-series average of the capital stock ranges from 116 to 239,225 million dollars
across the 194 firms.



                                                2
flow. We exclude from our sample firms that have made a major acquisition in
order to definitively focus on investment as purchases of new property, plant, and
equipment. We estimate the physical capital stock using the perpetual inventory
method, using the book value of capital as the starting value for the capital stock
and four-digit industry-specific estimates of the depreciation rate. Q is calculated
as the market value of equity plus the book value of debt, divided by the capital
stock estimate. Cash flow is measured using the Compustat item for Income be-
fore extraordinary items + depreciation and amortization + minor adjustments.
We describe the data and sample selection in more detail in Appendix 6.1.

2.1. Key empirical features

In Table 1 we report summary statistics for both the 1981-2003 period and for
two sub-periods, 1981-1992 and 1993-2003. These estimates are similar to those
reported in other studies that use Compustat data. Bootstrap standard errors are
indicated in parenthesis. We report the median across firms of selected time-series
moments. An alternative would have been to compute moments for the average
across firms of the variables of interest. However, this procedure would eliminate
the idiosyncratic variability associated with individual firms. Henceforth, to sim-
plify the exposition we use I/K and CF/K to refer to the investment-capital ratio
and the cash—flow—to-capital ratio, respectively.
   The most striking features of the data are the important di§erences across
sub-samples. In particular, the mean and standard deviation of Q and CF/K
in the second sub-sample are significantly higher than in the earlier period. All
variables exhibit positive skewness, and there is more skewness in the full sample
than in each of the two sub-samples. Finally, Q exhibits strong persistence, while
the persistence in I/K and CF/K is more moderate.




                                         3
2.2. Investment regressions

The three panels of Figure 1 provide scatter plots of pooled time-series-cross-
section data that are useful to visualize the relation between I/K and the three
variables of interest: Q, CF/K and lagged I/K.
      We use log(Q) and log(CF/K) in our investment regression because, as dis-
cussed in Abel and Eberly (2002), this specification provides a better fit owing to
skewness in the firm-level data. Similarly, the log specification makes our para-
meter estimates less sensitive to a small number of very high Q values observed
in the data.5
      We now describe results from regressing I/K on di§erent combinations of three
variables: log(Q), log(CF/K), and lagged I/K.
      In Panel A of Table 2 we report estimates from pooled, time-series-cross-section
regressions. Comparing columns 1 and 2 we see that Q and CF/K individually
have similar explanatory power. Regressing I/K on either of these variables
generates an R2 of 30 percent. When both Q and CF/K are included in the
regression (column 4), the goodness-of-fit rises slightly to 0.34. We obtain a
much higher R2 (0.57) when we use lagged I/K as the sole explanatory variable.
When all three regressors are present, the coe¢cient on lagged I/K remains large
(0.6253) and very highly significant, while the coe¢cients on Q and CF/K are
significant but small in magnitude (0.0126 and 0.017, respectively).
      To investigate the robustness of the lagged-investment e§ect we run panel ver-
sions of these regressions with firm fixed e§ects. The results, reported in Panel B
of Table 2, lead to similar conclusions. The explanatory power of lagged invest-
ment is much greater than that of Q and CF/K together (R2 of 0.57 versus 0.30).
  5
    When we run linear regressions, the coe¢cient on Q is small but significant, and the co-
e¢cient on CF/K is larger and also statistically significant. These results accord with the
investment regression results reported in the literature. In addition, the lagged investment
coe¢cient is roughly una§ected.


                                             4
When all three variables are included as regressors the coe¢cient on lagged I/K
is large (0.4462) and significant. The coe¢cient on Q is small and significant,
while the coe¢cient on CF/K is marginally significant.
   Since lagged investment is by definition correlated with the panel-level e§ects,
we re-run the panel regressions using Arellano and Bond’s (1991) consistent GMM
estimator. The results are reported in Panel C of Table 2. The results obtained
with this estimator are very similar to those reported in Panel B. In addition, the
lagged-investment e§ect continues to be highly significant even when we include
year dummies (column 3). Columns 4 and 5 of Panel C show that the lagged-
investment e§ect is present in both subsamples (1981-1992 and 1993-2003). We
also find that including lags of both Q and CF/K has a negligible impact on the
size and significance of the lagged-investment coe¢cient. We use the estimates in
the second column of the Panel C of Table 2 (displayed in bold) as the benchmark
estimates that we later compare with the implications of the model.
   In sum, we find that lagged I/K is a better predictor of current I/K than
Q and CF/K , even when combined. The coe¢cient on lagged I/K is roughly
0.40. This lagged-investment e§ect is robust across specifications. Q has a small
but robust and significant e§ect on I/K. In contrast, the cash-flow e§ect is weak
and not robust in our sample, becoming insignificant or negative in some of the
regression specifications.


3. The CEE model

The firm’s problem is given by the following Bellman equation, where y 0 denotes
next period’s value of variable y:
                                                Z
             V (K, I1 , z) = max0 zK  I +        V (K 0 , I, z 0 )F (dz 0 , z),   (3.1)
                             I,K




                                        5
subject to:
                          K 0 = I  I(I/I1 ) + (1  )K.                      (3.2)

   The firm’s output is given by zK, where K denotes the stock of capital and z
is a stochastic variable governed by the distribution F (·). This variable represents
a shock to productivity or to the price of the firm’s output. We can interpret the
production function as requiring a single productive factor, capital. Alternatively,
we can think of output as being produced with capital, labor, and other variable
factors, with labor and variable factors being costlessly adjustable. In this case,
zK represents output net of labor and other variable costs. Under this interpre-
tation, which we adopt throughout the paper, the variable z can also incorporate
shocks to the real wage or to the price of other variable factors.
   Investment, denoted by I, is subject to adjustment costs according to the CEE
specification which is given by equation (3.2), where 00 (.) > 0.
   Matsuyama (1984) provides an interpretation of the CEE adjustment cost for-
mulation based on the idea that firms have to learn how to implement a given
rate of investment. Lucca (2007) provides micro-foundations for the CEE formu-
lation by assuming that investment projects are imperfect substitutes and have
an uncertain duration. He shows that the linearized first-order condition implied
by his model is the same as that implied by the CEE model.
   To study the properties of the model, it is convenient to assume that in a
deterministic steady state with constant z there are no adjustment costs. This
property requires that:
                                 (1) = 0 (1) = 0.                             (3.3)

   The function V (K, I1 , z) represents the value of a firm with capital stock K,
lagged investment, I1 , and total factor productivity, z. Lagged investment is a
state variable for the firm because it enters the adjustment cost specification given


                                         6
by equation (3.2). We denote the discount factor by . Capital depreciates at
rate .
   The optimal solution to the firm’s problem is characterized by the first-order
conditions for K 0 and I:
               Z
      =  V1 (K 0 , I, z 0 )F (dz 0 , z),                                                 (3.4)
                                                         Z
                                             0
      1 =   (I/I1 )  (I/I1 ) (I/I1 ) +            V2 (K 0 , I, z 0 )F (dz 0 , z), (3.5)

and two envelope conditions:

                       V1 (K, I1 , z) = z + (1  ),                                     (3.6)
                       V2 (K, I1 , z) = (I/I1 ) (I/I1 )2 .                           (3.7)

The variable  denotes the Lagrange multiplier associated with equation (3.2).
   To study the properties of this problem we linearize the first-order conditions
around a deterministic steady state. Equations (3.5) and (3.7), together with the
requirement of no adjustment costs in the steady state (equation (3.3)), imply
that the steady state value of  is equal to one. Equations (3.2) and (3.3) imply
that the steady state level of investment is: I = K.
   We assume that the steady state value of z satisfies the following equation:

                                   1/  1 = z  .                                        (3.8)

The left-hand side of this equation is the real interest rate faced by the firm. The
right-hand side is the marginal product of capital net of depreciation.
   Equation (3.1) and condition (3.8) imply that the steady state value of the
firm is given by:
                                       V = K/.



                                                 7
Tobin’s (average) q is defined as:6

                                      Q = V /K = 1/.

Linearizing equation (3.2) around the steady state we obtain:

                                 K̂t+1 =  Iˆt + (1  )K̂t ,                            (3.9)

where
                                         = 00 (1) > 0.

Combining equations (3.4)-(3.7) and linearizing the resulting conditions we obtain:
                                  h                      i
                       ̂t / = Et z ẑt+1 + (1  )̂t+1 ,                  (3.10)


                                                             
                        0 = ̂t   Iˆt  Iˆt1 +  Iˆt+1  Iˆt .                      (3.11)

       To study the properties of the investment regressions implied by the linearized
version of the model we assume that ẑt follows an AR(1) process with first-order
serial correlation . The resulting solution to the firm’s problem takes the form:

                               Iˆt =  ii Iˆt1 +  iz ẑt +  ik K̂t .                 (3.12)

Solving for coe¢cients  ii ,  iA , and  ik using the method of undetermined coe¢-
cients we obtain:
                                               z/
                           Iˆt = Iˆt1 +                  ẑt .               (3.13)
                                     1   1  (1  )
The properties of this solution are as follows. The higher the degree of adjustment
costs, , the smaller the response of investment to a given shock. The higher the
   6
    The steady-state value of Q is di§erent from one because this version of Tobin’s Q is based
on the value of the firm in the beginning of the period. The value of Q computed using the end
of period value of the firm (after cash flow has been received and investment expenditures have
been incurred) is equal to one. This e§ect of timing on the value of Q is common in discrete
time models.


                                                  8
degree of shock persistence, , the stronger the response of investment to shocks.
When shocks are i.i.d. ( = 0) investment is constant over time.
    It is useful to use this linearized solution to compute Tobin’s Q. Combining the
equation for the value of the firm and the linearized laws of motion for investment
and capital yields:
                                             z
                                  V̂t =           ẑt + K̂t .                          (3.14)
                                          1/  
In general V̂t should be a function of the state variables K̂t , Iˆt1 and the shock,
ẑt . The fact that V̂t does not depend on Iˆt results from adjustment costs being
zero in steady state. Equation (3.14) implies that Q̂t is given by:
                                                z
                            Q̂t = V̂t  K̂t =        ẑt .                (3.15)
                                              1  
   We can now use equation (3.13) to study the model’s implications for the form
of the investment regression equation. We denote the investment-capital ratio by
it = It /Kt .
    Using the policy function for investment and the linearized law of motion for
the capital stock we obtain the following expression for ı̂t :
                                                   z/
                    ı̂t = (1  )ı̂t1 +                       ẑt .     (3.16)
                                         1   1  (1  )
The investment-capital ratio is a linear function of its own lag and the shock,
ẑt . Since cash-flow/capital in deviation from its steady state value is equal to ẑt
(Ĉt  K̂t = ẑt ), it enters significantly in a regression of ı̂t on ı̂t1 . Equations (3.15)
and (3.16) imply that if Q̂ is included in the regression instead of cash-flow, we
obtain a positive regression coe¢cient given by z/ { [1  (1  )]}.
    In sum, this model predicts the presence of a lagged-investment e§ect as well as
a role for cash-flow or Q. A simple modification of the model allowing both a cash-
flow and Q e§ect in addition to the lagged investment e§ect involves assuming
that the production function has decreasing returns to scale. We pursue this
modification below.

                                               9
Generalizing the model Before estimating the model we generalize this basic
specification to make it more compatible with the data along four dimensions.
First, we allow for “flexible capital” which can be installed within the period
without adjustment costs. Second, we introduce the possibility of decreasing
returns to scale (DRS) in production. Third, we incorporate exogenous technical
progress, so that in the absence of shocks capital, investment and cash flow grow
at a constant trend. Fourth, we introduce a fixed cost in production.
   All four features are useful in improving compatibility between model and
data. Flexible capital allows the model to better fit the persistence properties of
investment. As discussed above, DRS allows the model to generate both a Q and
a cash-flow e§ect, in addition to the lagged-investment e§ect. Technical progress
introduces a time trend similar to the one present in the data. Finally, the fixed
cost scales profitability and allows the model to match the average level of Q in
the data.
   The firm’s problem in this generalized model is given by:

   The variable X denotes the level of exogenous technological progress. This
variable grows at a constant rate  > 1, X 0 = X. The parameter  controls the
fixed operating cost paid in every period. This cost, X, is fixed with respect to
the investment decision, but grows at rate X, so that it does not become irrelevant
as the firm gains in size.

                                              10
   The variables H and I h denote the stock of flexible capital and the investment
in flexible capital, respectively. The production function depends on H 0 so the
stock of flexible capital that is relevant for production is chosen after the shock is
realized. Both stocks of capital depreciate at rate .
   We assume that  + ! < 1. We can interpret this property as reflecting the
presence of decreasing returns to scale (DRS) in production. Alternatively, we can
think of  + ! < 1 as resulting from a setting in which the production function
exhibits constant-returns to scale but the firm has monopoly power and faces a
constant-elasticity demand function.
   We assume that the adjustment cost function, , takes a quadratic form:

                           (I/I1 ) = 1  (I/I1  )2 .

   This formulation has the property that adjustment costs are zero when the
firm grows at its steady state growth rate, . The parameter  controls the size of
the adjustment cost.
   We define cash-flow (CFt ) as:

                          CFt = zK  (H 0 )! X 1!  X,

which is revenue net of fixed operating costs.


Shock process We consider two versions of the shock process. First, we con-
sider a version with a single regime. In this specification all shocks are idiosyn-
cratic to the firm, there are no aggregate shocks. The shock follows a first-order
Markov chain with support z 2 {µ  , µ, µ + }. We assume that the Markov
chain for the single-regime model takes the form:
                         2                                 3
                              p2     2p(1  p)    (1  p)2
                     = 4 p(1  p) p2 + (1  p)2 p(1  p) 5 .
                           (1  p)2  2p(1  p)       p2

                                         11
The first-order serial correlation of the shock implied by this matrix is:  = 2p  1
(see Rouwenhorst (1995)).
   Second, we consider a ‘regime-switching’ specification with two aggregate regimes,
high and low. The aggregate stochastic process is governed by a two point Markov
chain with a transition matrix given by:
                                            
                                      a  1a
                             A=                .
                                    1a   a

The idiosyncratic shock has three states and is governed by the following Markov
chain:                      2                             3
                                 b1      b 2 1  b1  b 2
                       B = 4 (1  b1 )/2 b1 (1  b1 )/2 5
                             1  b1  b2 b2      b1
The support of the idiosyncratic shock z in a given aggregate regime R 2 {L, H}
is given by:
                                                      
                           z 2 µR   R , µR , µR +  R .

This formulation allows the idiosyncratic shock to have di§erent means and dif-
ferent variances in the two aggregate regimes. To see how this formulation works,
suppose we are in the high aggregate regime and consider a firm that is in the
lowest of the three possible values. The productivity of this firm is µH   H .
Suppose that, in the following period, the aggregate regime switches from high
to low and the idiosyncratic productivity of the firm goes from the lowest to the
highest of the three possible values. The new productivity of the firm is: µL +  L .
   A single regime process is a particular case of this specification, so the estima-
tion algorithm can choose a single regime if it provides a better fit to the data.
We find that the “regime-switching” specification allows the model to be consis-
tent with three important features of the data. First, data moments are di§erent
in our two subsamples (1981-1992 and 1993-2003). Second, all variables exhibit
skewness which arises naturally with regime switching. Third, regime-switching

                                         12
can generate the imperfect correlation between cash flow and Q that we observe
in the data.7

4. Estimating the model

We solve the model numerically using the procedure described in Appendix 6.3.
Our solution method does not yield an analytical representation for the popula-
tion moments implied by the model. For this reason, we estimate the model using
the simulated method of moments proposed by Lee and Ingram (1991). We first
use our data to estimate the vector of moments D . Then, we find the para-
meter vector ̂ that minimizes the distance between the empirical and simulated
moments, (̂),

                      L(̂) = min [()  D ]0 W [()  D ] .                        (4.1)

       The weighting matrix W is computed using a block-bootstrap method on our
panel dataset (see Appendix 6.4 for a description). This estimation method gives
a larger weight to moments that are more precisely estimated in the data
       We solve the minimization problem (4.1) using an annealing algorithm to re-
duce the risk of convergence to a local minimum.8 Finally, the standard errors of
the estimated parameters are computed as
                                            (0 W )1
                                     ̂ =              ,
                                                 n
where  is the matrix of derivatives,
                                             @(̂)
                                       =  ,
                                      @ ̂
which we compute numerically. The estimation method is discussed in more de-
tails in Appendix 6.4.
   7
    The median, across firms, of the correlation between Q and CF/K is 0.58.
   8
    We also tested the robustness of our results by experimenting with various starting values
of the model parameters.


                                             13
4.1. Parameter and moment estimates: single regime

We choose the exogenous rate of technical progress to be  = 1.03. This growth
rate is equal to the real annual growth rate of corporate net cash flows from
January 1981 to January 2004. We fix the sum +! because we cannot separately
identify  + ! and  using the moments of the data that we consider. Both
parameters control curvature, so when  + ! changes, the value of  can be
adjusted to restore the fit of the model. Hence, we set  + ! = 0.8, consistent
with the estimate of the average degree of returns to scale across industries by
Burnside (1996).
   To estimate the models we include 12 moments in the D vector: the mean,
standard deviation, skewness, and first-order serial correlation of I/K, CF/K,
and Q. Table 1 reports these moments in bold. The moments of CF/K help us
identify the shock process. The standard deviation of I/K helps us identify ,
while the mean of Q helps us identify the fixed cost, .
   We report our parameter estimates and standard errors in Table 3. Our es-
timate of the adjustment cost parameter, , is 0.297 (with a standard error of
0.0534). Our estimate of the fixed operating cost parameter, , is 99.94 (with a
standard error of 0.4987) which corresponds to 22.7 percent of average cash flow.
The weight on flexible capital, !, is very small (0.025 with a standard error of
0.0036). With the average shock z normalized to one, we estimate the spread
between shocks to be 0.588. Finally, the estimated Markov chain exhibits strong
persistence with the parameter  equal to 0.6840 (recall that our data has annual
frequency).
   Table 1 shows that the single-regime model does a reasonable job at matching
the average values of Q, I/K and cash-flow/K. In terms of volatility, I/K and
cash-flow/K are somewhat more volatile in the model than in the data, while
the volatility of Q is only about 40 percent of the volatility we observe in the

                                        14
data. These results are related. To make Q more volatile, the algorithm increases
the volatility of z. This increase results in volatilities for I/K and cash-flow/K
that are too high relative to the data. Also, the model does not generate enough
persistence in Q and generates too much persistence in I/K and cash-flow/K.
Finally, the skewness properties of the single regime model are very di§erent from
those in the data. The model produces basically no skewness, while Q, I/K and
cash-flow/K all show strong skewness in the data.
   To evaluate the performance of our model from a di§erent angle we estimate
investment regressions on a panel of firms constructed by simulating our model.
We report the results in Table 4. The model generates the same patterns we
observe in the data. Lagged investment in isolation has more explanatory power
than Q and cash flow. When we use lagged I/K, the log of Q, and the log
of cash-flow/K as explanatory variables we obtain a strong coe¢cient on lagged
investment, as well as Q and cash flow e§ects. The lagged investment e§ect is
however somewhat stronger than the one observed in the data (coe¢cient value
of 0.5970 in the model vs 0.4187 in the data).

4.2. Parameter and moment estimates: two regimes

We choose the same values of  and  + ! used in the single regime model. To
estimate the regime—switching model we add to the moments used in estimating
the single-regime model some moments computed in the two subsamples: the
mean of Q and CF/K and the standard deviation of CF/K. These additional
moments help us identify the support and transition matrix of the shocks. Table
1 reports in bold all the moments targeted by the estimation algorithm.
   We report the point estimates and standard errors of the estimated parameters
in Table 3. Our estimate of the adjustment cost parameter, , is 0.9447 (with a
standard error of 0.0384). This value is close to that obtained by CEE using


                                       15
macro data.9 The estimated value of the fixed operating cost parameter, , is 85.5
(with a standard error of 1.2380) which corresponds to 19.8 percent of average
cash flow. The weight on flexible capital, !, is relatively small (0.0693 with a
standard error of 0.0005). It implies that flexible capital represents on average
8.5 percent of total capital, and that investment in flexible capital is on average
5.1 percent of total investment. To put this value in context, software investment,
which is arguably a flexible form of investment, accounted for 7 percent of total
investment expenditure in the National Income and Product Accounts in 1993,
the middle point of our sample.
       The parameters that characterize the support and transition matrix for the
shocks are presented in Table 3. In addition to a higher average productivity, the
high aggregate regime also features a higher standard deviation. It is particularly
interesting to note that the supports of the two aggregate regimes overlap. In fact,
the low shock in the high aggregate regime (µH  H ) is lower than the low shock in
the low aggregate regime (µL  L ). This configuration of shocks makes the model
consistent with the imperfect correlation between investment, Q and cash-flow in
addition to providing a better fit to subsample moments. For example, when the
shock is in the low regime, cash-flow is low and investment opportunities are poor,
leading to a low value of Q. In contrast, when the shock is in the high regime, cash
flow is low but investment opportunities are good as the firm faces a relatively
high probability of moving to high-cash-flow states in the future. Consequently,
Q is high. These estimates emphasize the importance of a structure in which Q
and cash-flow are not informationaly redundant. Finally, notice that the estimated
Markov chain exhibits strong persistence: the probability of remaining in the same
aggregate state is 0.98, while the probability of remaining in the same idiosyncratic
   9
    CEE estimate 00 (1) = 2.48, where 00 (1) is the second derivative of the adjustment cost
function evaluated at the steady state. In our case the adjustment cost function is quadratic,
so  = 00 (1)/2 which yields 00 (1) = 1.86.


                                             16
state is 0.70.10
       Table 1 reports summary statistics for variables simulated from the model.
The algorithm matches all of the targeted moments much more closely than the
single-regime version of the model. Not only does the introduction of aggregate
regimes allow the procedure to match the serial correlations of Q and I/K, it
also generates skewness in Q, I/K, and CF/K. There are, however, still some
di§erences between the skewness patterns generated by the model and the data
within subsamples. We conjecture that these di§erences are, at least in part, due
to our choice of a relatively simple 2-state aggregate stochastic process.
       The volatility in Q is greatly improved relative to the single regime version
of the model. The standard deviation of Q is 70 percent higher in the regime-
switching version of the model when compared to the single regime version. Still,
the volatility of Q in the regime-switching model (0.45) is lower than that in
the data (0.625). Erikson and Whited (2000) make a compelling case for the
hypothesis that there is substantial measurement error in Q. Their estimates
imply that we should increase the standard deviation of Q generated by the model
by 47 percent to incorporate the e§ect of measurement error that is present in
the data. Using this adjustment, we obtain a standard deviation of Q equal to:
0.45  1.47 = 0.66. This value is very close to our estimate of the volatility of Q
(0.625).
       Finally, in order to evaluate the role played by flexible capital we re-estimate
the model setting ! to zero. We obtain very similar parameter estimates. The
adjustment cost parameter is 0.98 instead of 0.9447 in the model with flexible
capital. The fit to the data of the two versions of the model is similar with one
exception: the serial correlation of investment is too high in the model without
  10
    The high persistence of the aggregate regime helps the algorithm generate more volatility
and skewness in Q. Reducing the persistence of the aggregate regime has little e§ect on other
moments or on the results for simulated investment regressions.


                                             17
flexible capital (0.93). Flexible capital, while a small share of investment in the
model, is important to match the persistence of total investment even if it plays
little role for other moments.

4.3. Simulated regression results

We now regress investment on its determinants using simulated data from the
model with regime switching. We report our results in Table 4. Regressing I/K
on ln(Q) yields an R2 of only 0.26 and a coe¢cient of 0.0827 on ln(Q). Regress-
ing I/K on ln(CF /K) yields an R2 of 0.25 and a cash-flow coe¢cient of 0.0574.
Including both ln(Q) and ln(CF /K) in the regression raises the R2 to 0.32. Re-
gressing I/K only on lagged I/K yields an R2 of 0.36 and a lagged-investment
coe¢cient of 0.5984. Finally, regressing I/K on lagged I/K, ln(Q) and ln(CF /K)
we obtain a lagged investment e§ect of 0.45 and a R2 of 0.49.
   Comparing the model’s result to the regression results from the second column
of Panel C of Table 2 (in bold), the lagged-investment e§ect is very similar (around
0.4 in both cases). The Q e§ect is also similar in the model and in the data (0.03
versus 0.04). The cash-flow e§ect is negligible in the data, while it is weak but
significant in the model (0.03).


5. Conclusions

We find that the investment adjustment cost specification proposed by Christiano,
Eichenbaum and Evans (2005) provides a good fit to firm-level data. It can also
explain the strong and robust lagged investment e§ect found empirically.
   Since the CEE specification penalizes changes in the level of investment, the
reader might find this result surprising. After all, aren’t periods of zero investment
followed by investment spikes and irreversibilities key features of micro data? It
depends on the level of aggregation that we consider. Irreversibilities and jumps

                                         18
are important in plant data. But they are not important for the large Compustat
firms included in our sample. Doms and Dunne (1998) show that aggregating data
for smaller firms or for individual plants tends to smooth out non-convexities in
investment. An interesting question for future research is to investigate how the
right model of investment varies with the level of aggregation and whether the
CEE specification can emerge from aggregating adjustment cost models that are
consistent with plant data.
      The implication that lagged investment is an important driver of current in-
vestment is consistent with institutional information obtained from survey data
collected by Bloom, Van Reenen, and Sadun (2009). These data cover roughly
4, 000 firms in the U.S., Europe and Asia. The authors find that, when senior
managers decide on the investment budget of plant managers, the default is to
set it equal to the previous year’s budget. It is then up to the plant manager
to argue for any changes. The bigger the di§erence between the plant manager’s
proposal and the budget of the previous year, the harder it is to get the revised
budget approved.11 An interesting issue for future research is to study of the in-
centive problems that might justify the investment budgeting process adopted by
the firms in the Bloom et al. (2009) data.

6.3. Solution Method


To solve the firm’s problem we first write it in terms of detrended variables: k =
K/X, h = H/X, i = I/X, and ih = I h /X. The value function is homogeneous
of degree one in K, H, I1 , and X. This property follows from the fact that we
can write the value function as a sum of functions that are homogeneous of degree
one in these four variables. The homogeneity property allows us to rewrite the
problem of the firm as:
                                                             Z                             

                                                    

                                     h0 = ih + (1  )h.

   To reduce the dimension of the state space we optimize out h0 and use the fact
that h matters for the value of the firm but not for choosing the optimal level of
h0 . The resulting firm problem is:
                                                          Z                      

   The original value function is given by:

                          v  (k, h, i1 , z) = v (k, i1 , z) + (1  )h.

   We obtain numerical solutions to the model with CEE adjustment costs using
the following algorithm developed in Lkhagvasuren (2006):

                                                27
       1. Define a coarse grid for (k, i1 , z);
       2. Choose a guess for v(k, i1 , z) and evaluate it on the coarse grid;
       3. Choose a fine grid for i1 ;
       4. Generate a fine grid for k compatible with fine grid for i1 using the resource
constraint, (6.1);
       5. Use bilinear interpolation to evaluate v(k, i1 , z) for every value of z on the
fine grid for i1 and z;12
       6. Find the optimal value of i for every (k, i1 , z) combination;
       7. Save the new value of v(k, i1 , z) evaluated on the coarse grid;
       8. Save the policy function for i, i(k, i1 , z), evaluated on the fine grid;
       9. Check whether the value function has converged;
       10. If the value function has converged then stop; else go to step 5;
       To simulate the model we can use a bilinear interpolation of i(k, i1 , z) evalu-
ated for every z, for every pair (k, i1 ) evaluated on the fine grid. This interpola-
tion procedure avoids k and i1 having to take values on the real line.
  12
    Bilinear interpolation is an extension of linear interpolation for bivariate functions. Suppose
we know the values of the function f (x, y) evaluated at four points: (x1 , y1 ), (x2 , y1 ), (x1 , y2 ),
                                    f (x1 ,y1 )                            f (x2 ,y1 )
and (x2 , y2 ). Then f (x, y) ' (x2 x 1 )(y2 y1 )
                                                    (x2  x)(y2  y) + (x2 x 1 )(y2 y1 )
                                                                                           (x  x1 )(y2  y) +
    f (x1 ,y2 )                                f (x2 ,y2 )
(x2 x1 )(y2 y1 ) (x2    x)(y  y1 ) +   (x2 x1 )(y2 y1 ) (x    x1 )(y  y1 ).

6.4. Estimation Method


The objective of the simulated method of moments is to find the parameter vector
̂ that minimizes the distance between empirical (D ) and simulated moments
(()):
                    L(̂) = min [()  D ]0 W [()  D ] .                  (6.2)

The weighting matrix, W , is obtained using the variance-covariance matrix of the
empirical moments, D :
                                             1
                                 W =                ,                           (6.3)
                                       D (1 + 1/k)
where k = length of simulation/length of sample. We estimate the matrix D
using a block-bootstrap method as follows. We form m samples. Each sample
consists of data for n firms drawn with replacement from our data set. For each
of the m samples we compute the vector of empirical moments. We use the m
observations on the vector of moments to estimate the variance-covariance matrix
of the empirical moments, D .
   We solve the minimization problem (6.2) using an annealing algorithm. The
first step consists in choosing initial values for the parameter vector, , admissible
ranges for the parameters, as well as the “temperature” and the step size. As
we discuss below, the temperature controls the probability that, given the best
parameter vector so far,  , we accept a parameter vector 0 that yields a worse fit
(L(0 ) > L( )). This procedure is used to avoid convergence to a local minimum.
We start with a high temperature value, so that the algorithm explores di§erent
regions of the parameter space.
   The second step is to generate a new parameter vector, 0 , by adding random
shocks to the elements of  within their admissible range. Next we solve the
model using value-function iteration for the parameter vector 0 and simulate
1940 representative firms (each with 23 years of data). Since the number of firms

                                         29
in our Compustat sample is equal to 194, this implies that k in (6.3) equals
10. The fourth step consists in computing the simulated moments and L(0 ).
If L(0 ) < L( ) we set  = 0 . If L(0 ) > L( ) we set  = 0 with
probability exp [ (L(0 )  L( )) /temperature]. Finally, we reduce the values of
temperature and step size before going back to step two. The vector of parameter
estimates is the one that generates the lowest value of L. We denote this vector
by ̂.
   To verify the convergence properties of our estimation procedure, we used a
simple robustness check. Starting with a parameter vector ̃, we simulate a panel
of firms and compute the simulated moments, (̃). We then use the SMM pro-
cedure described above to fit these moments. Ideally, we would like the parameter
estimates ̂ to be as close as possible to the true parameter values ̃ (the ones
that generated the data). Failure to do so may indicate that the estimation pro-
cedure is not adequate or that the model parameters are not identified. We find
that our procedure can recover reasonably well the true parameter values. This
result is also confirmed by the fact that we obtain similar parameter estimates
across SMM runs with di§erent starting values.
