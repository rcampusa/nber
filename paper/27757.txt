                                          ABSTRACT

We discuss and review literature on the macroeconomic effects of epidemics and pandemics since
the late 20th century. First, we cover the role of health in driving economic growth and well-
being and discuss standard frameworks for assessing the economic burden of infectious diseases.
Second, we sketch a general theoretical framework to evaluate the tradeoffs policymakers must
consider when addressing infectious diseases and their macroeconomic repercussions. In so
doing, we emphasize the dependence of economic consequences on (i) disease characteristics; (ii)
inequalities among individuals in terms of susceptibility, preferences, and income; and (iii) cross-
country heterogeneities in terms of their institutional and macroeconomic environments. Third,
we study pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical policies aimed at mitigating and preventing
infectious diseases and their macroeconomic repercussions. Fourth, we discuss the health toll and
economic impacts of five infectious diseases: HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, influenza, and
COVID-19. Although major epidemics and pandemics can take an enormous human toll and
impose a staggering economic burden, early and targeted health and economic policy
interventions can often mitigate both to a substantial degree.

    1. Introduction
The emergence and rapid transmission in late 2019 and early 2020 of severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the steep increase in the prevalence of the disease it causes
(coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19) forcefully reminded scientists, policymakers, and the wider
public of the world’s vulnerability to infectious disease pandemics. Within a few weeks, we moved
from a few reported cases of a new pulmonary disease in the city of Wuhan in China to a state in which
almost all countries reported infections and deaths, billions of people could only leave their homes for
essential purposes, economic activity nosedived, and unemployment figures skyrocketed. The global
economy’s vulnerability to such a pandemic underscores the importance of health for economic well-
being and brings to mind Arthur Schopenhauer’s famous quote “health is not everything, but without
health everything is nothing.”

Apart from the COVID-19 crisis, the late 20th and early 21st centuries have seen the rapid transmission
and difficulty of containing various diseases. Many epidemics and pandemics are ongoing, claiming
millions of lives per year (such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis); some are on the rise in terms
of infections and deaths (such as dengue fever and various forms of hepatitis); some have nearly been
eradicated but with a dangerous prospect of re-emerging should containment efforts be relaxed (such
as measles and poliomyelitis); some have abated or were successfully contained (such as SARS, Ebola,
H1N1 influenza, and Zika); and some have frequent outbreaks (such as cholera).

This article aims to discuss the macroeconomic effects of modern infectious disease epidemics and
pandemics and the frameworks that are used to assess them. (Hereafter, we will generally use the
word epidemic, except where necessary to explicitly distinguish between epidemics and pandemics.)
First, we provide a brief overview of the relationship between general health improvements and
macroeconomic outcomes and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different economic
frameworks to assess the macroeconomic impacts of infectious diseases. Second, we sketch a general
theoretical framework for analyzing the macroeconomic impacts of infectious diseases to identify the
channels by which epidemics affect the economy and the extent to which these channels matter across
diseases and cross-country settings. Third, we discuss pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical policy
interventions toward curbing and preventing epidemics and mitigating their macroeconomic
repercussions. Fourth, we describe the most important modern infectious disease outbreaks and
discuss their economic consequences based on the pertinent literature. In so doing, we emphasize the
recent health and economic crises caused by HIV/AIDs, malaria, tuberculosis, influenza, and COVID-19.

In underscoring the economic impacts of infectious diseases, we hope to clarify the importance of (i)
preventive actions against infectious diseases, such as efforts to improve hygiene and to develop
vaccines and distribute them widely, and (ii) early action in the case of outbreaks such as surveillance,
early and accurate reporting, cuts in unnecessary travel, transmission hotspot shutdowns, and testing
and contact tracing. The advantage of these preventive policies and early responses is that their costs
tend to be small compared with the costs of containment measures against full-scale outbreaks.

Important tradeoffs that policymakers must consider when enacting containment measures include
the following:

    •   While containment measures save lives, they often impose constraints on crucial economic
        sectors. When constraints are especially strict, more lives could be lost due to the measures
        imposed than would be saved by them. For example, lifesaving medical interventions in other
        domains (such as surgeries, vaccination programs against other diseases, etc.) might not
        proceed as planned, or—particularly in poor countries—people might even starve because
        lockdown measures deprive them of the income they need to afford subsistence consumption.
                                                  2
        This suggests that optimal containment measures depend on country characteristics such as
        general income levels and poverty rates that affect the fraction of particularly vulnerable
        people.
    •   Short-run and long-run effects trade off in the sense that shutdowns can be imposed decisively
        and quickly, which might reduce how long they would have to be applied. In addition,
        lockdown measures reduce economic activity sharply at impact, while a continuing, unchecked
        epidemic leads to more infections and deaths over time. Thus, in the latter case, the adverse
        economic effects spread out over time and into the longer term. Another intertemporal
        tradeoff arises regarding efforts aimed at reducing the risk of pandemics and building up
        medical and nonmedical capacity to deal with them. Such investments may carry high and
        certain costs upfront while leading to delayed and uncertain, but potentially very high, returns
        in the future.
    •   Tradeoffs also arise in the context of targeting policies to specific population subgroups.
        Resource limitations may force the policymaker to target treatments or vaccines according to
        their highest effectiveness. Alternatively, if nonmedical interventions, such as lockdowns, are
        burdensome to those affected, issues emerge about whether the stringency of these measures
        should vary across different parts of the population. For example, if a disease predominantly
        affects specific risk groups such as older adults, discussions naturally emerge regarding the
        extent to which other parts of the population need to be subjected to strict lockdown
        measures to protect the group(s) at risk. Finally, choices must be made regarding the extent
        to which protective measures and economic relief should be targeted according to medical
        and socioeconomic vulnerability.


Some of these tradeoffs change in a crucial way when considering different diseases. For example,
children seem to be particularly contagious when it comes to the seasonal flu such that closing schools
is an important policy lever to stop or slow its spread (Litvinova et al., 2019). In the case of COVID-19,
closing bars; canceling large indoor events; and addressing issues with air conditioning, climate control,
and hygiene within meat production facilities, warehouses, and public transportation seem to be most
effective.

Despite the economic focus on the tradeoffs faced when enacting policies against infectious diseases,
we would like to issue a caveat up front. Narrow economic considerations take inadequate account of
the ethical, normative, and political dimensions of decisions that relate to saving lives, particularly the
lives of vulnerable members of the population who depend on the actions of others and who might
not contribute economically by participating in the labor market (e.g., because of age or illness). While
welfare economics has long gone beyond a focus on gross domestic product (GDP) and while practical
well-being indicators have recently been developed that emphasize life expectancy and health (e.g.,
Jones, 2016; Jones and Klenow, 2016; Kuhn and Prettner, 2016; Fan et al., 2018; Frankovic and Kuhn,
2018; Bloom et al., 2020a), they might still not fully capture all aspects of living a healthy life without
pain and suffering.

In addition, the value of a statistical life (VSL) metric that is typically employed when considering the
tradeoff between lifesaving measures and their economic repercussions has problematic properties
(cf. Viscusi and Aldy, 2003; Adler, 2020). In particular, the VSL declines with age and increases with
income (cf. Murphy and Topel, 2006; Aldy and Viscusi, 2008). Thus, a disease that kills mainly older
persons or poor persons would be associated with comparatively low losses in terms of the VSL. This
indicates the limits of economic analysis when it comes to the implicit social contracts and ethical
responsibilities that we all have in providing appropriate protections for the most vulnerable parts of
the population.
                                                    3
As the economic literature on infectious diseases is large to begin with and the literature on COVID-19
is following its own epidemic growth at the time of writing (cf. Brodeur et al., 2020; Wyplosz, 2020, for
some bibliographical analysis), we must restrict our attention to selected prominent studies. Philipson
(2000), Laxminarayan and Malani (2006), Klein et al. (2007), Gersovitz (2011), Hauck (2018), and Rasul
(2020) survey the economics of infectious diseases with more focused treatments of the earlier
literature. Brodeur et al. (2020) provide a survey of the emerging economic literature on COVID-19,
and a wealth of research has been published as part of the Centre for Economic Policy Research’s Covid
Economics series of vetted and real-time papers (cf. Wyplosz, 2020, for a summary of the editorial
experience).

The remainder of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly presents core insights into the
general relationship between health and economic growth that serve as a backbone for this survey.
Section 3 introduces the main approaches used to assess the economic burden of diseases and the
literature on economic epidemiology. Section 4 sketches a general theoretical framework to evaluate
the interrelations between disease dynamics and behavioral responses, while Section 5 analyzes the
associated macroeconomic repercussions. Section 6 discusses the effects of economic policies toward
containing or eradicating infectious diseases, issues of international coordination, and macroeconomic
interventions toward mitigating disease-induced recessions. Section 7 summarizes insights into the
most important epidemics since World War II, while Section 8 concludes and discusses the reverse
channel from economic activity to changes in the likelihood of epidemics.

    2. General health and economic growth
        2.1 Theoretical considerations
To better understand the effects of epidemics on economic prosperity, knowing the channels by which
health affects economic growth in general and the extent to which these channels differ between rich
and poor countries is important (for surveys on the health–growth nexus see Weil, 2014 and Bloom et
al., 2019a). Generally, better health implies (i) a greater supply of productive labor and thus higher
incomes (e.g., Bloom et al., 2020c); (ii) higher life expectancy and lower morbidity, which tends to
increase schooling and thus human capital accumulation (e.g., Bleakley, 2007, 2010; Boucekkine et al.,
2002; Cervellati and Sunde, 2005); (iii) higher saving and investment because of the longer individual
planning horizons and potentially more foreign direct investment (e.g., Alsan et al., 2006; Bloom et al.,
2007); and (iv) lower fertility due to a decline in precautionary fertility and higher opportunity costs of
children, which can then initiate a takeoff in education investments and the emergence of a
demographic dividend (e.g., Bloom et al., 2003, 2017, 2020c; Cervellati and Sunde, 2005, 2011; Klasing
and Milionis, 2020).

In low-income countries, a lack of general access to quality health care, widespread undernourishment,
and the prevalence of competing infectious diseases exacerbate the impact of epidemics. Generally,
low-income countries are at considerable risk of entering or remaining in a vicious cycle that links low
income, a lack of investment in schooling and health, and high fertility (e.g., Galor and Weil, 2000;
Lagerlöf, 2003; Galor, 2005, 2011). Low incomes prevent investments in health that through the
previously described channels would help promote sustained economic development. Overall,
countries with poor population health are then trapped in a Malthusian stagnation equilibrium. In such
a setting, negative health shocks from an epidemic can have strongly adverse effects on economic




                                                    4
growth by either perpetuating stagnation, or by pushing the economy back into a poverty trap (e.g.,
Lagerlöf, 2003; Momota et al., 2005; Chakraborty et al., 2010). 1

In high-income countries, by contrast, access to effective treatments and a well-functioning health care
sector can often mitigate negative health shocks.2 The main economic effects then relate to rising
health care costs, which curb the scope for investments and might lead to private or public budget
deficits. Recent analysis tends to agree, however, that in rich countries the willingness to pay for health
and survival is typically so high that rising health care costs are justified in social welfare terms even if
they impose a drag on economic growth (Hall and Jones, 2007; Jones, 2016; Kuhn and Prettner, 2016;
Frankovic and Kuhn, 2018; Fonseca et al., 2020; Frankovic et al., 2020). In high-income countries,
concerns rather relate to inequality in survival and other health outcomes as documented empirically
by, e.g., Chetty et al. (2016) and theoretically by Frankovic and Kuhn (2019). In summary, high-income
countries likely exhibit a large willingness to pay to contain the mortality and morbidity from large-
scale epidemics even at high economic cost, but this willingness to pay may vary considerably across
subgroups of the population. Inequality with respect to risks of infection and access to prevention and
treatment technologies and their effective usage may thus be the prime concern.

         2.2 Empirical considerations
There are two main approaches to estimating the direct effects of health on economic growth from an
empirical perspective. The micro-based approach utilizes well-identified wage regressions of the
Mincerian type to isolate the effects of health on individual earnings. The results are then aggregated
over the whole population to arrive at the effects of health on macroeconomic performance (cf.
Shastry and Weil, 2003; Weil, 2007). 3 The macro-based approach, by contrast, utilizes conditional
convergence regressions along the lines of Barro (1991) and Islam (1995) to estimate how health
improvements affect the growth rate of the economy. In general, the latter finds greater effects of
health on economic growth than the micro-based approach (cf. Barro, 1997; Bloom et al., 2004; Sala-
i-Martin et al., 2004; Aghion et al., 2011; Lorentzen et al., 2008, Bloom et al. 2020d). 4 The explanation
is that while macro-based estimates tend to include indirect effects of health on schooling and saving
that foster economic growth, these effects are disregarded in the micro-based approaches by
construction. Bloom et al. (2019b) seek to reconcile the two approaches by (i) carefully specifying the
estimation equations, (ii) controlling extensively for indirect effects of health, and (iii) instrumenting
for health and education, which allows (at least in principle) identification of the causal direct effect of
health on economic growth. Their macro-based estimates imply that a 10-percentage-point increase
in adult survival rates (the probability of surviving to age 60, conditional on having survived to age 15)
leads to a 9.1% increase in aggregate labor productivity. 5 This estimate is well within the range of

1 By contrast, the Black Death is often assumed to have affected so many workers that labor became scarce and wages rose
substantially above the subsistence level, at least for an extended period. The extent to which this could have helped in
escaping a Malthusian trap is discussed in Jedwab et al. (2020a).
2
  This is not always true, of course. For HIV/AIDS, expensive treatment can now contain mortality and morbidity, but this was
not the case in the 1980s. By contrast, COVID-19 lacks effective treatment options (at this writing), although health care
facilities are important because in many cases intensive care and mechanical ventilation are necessary for survival. The
availability of these tends to be greater in richer countries.
3
  Micro data on the impact of health and health-related policy interventions on earnings is also obtained from randomized
(e.g., Baird et al., 2016) or natural experiments (e.g., Bleakley, 2007, 2010). These data, too, would need to be aggregated.
4
  Acemoglu and Johnson (2007) is an exception in that the authors find a negative effect of increasing life expectancy on
economic growth. Their results change, however, when controlling for initial health and when splitting the sample into pre-
demographic transition countries in which increasing life expectancy raises population growth and post-demographic
transition countries in which increasing life expectancy reduces population growth (see Aghion et al., 2011; Cervellati and
Sunde, 2011; Bloom et al., 2014; Hansen and Lønstrup, 2015; Klasing and Milionis, 2020).
5
  A 10-percentage-point improvement in adult survival rates is approximately equal to going from the adult survival rate of
India (82.2% in 2016; World Health Organization, 2020) to that of China (92%).

credible estimates from the micro-based approach as calculated by Shastry and Weil (2003) and Weil
(2007).

          2.3 Role of complementarities
Many theoretical and empirical contributions center on the evidence that strong indirect effects
complement the direct effects of health on economic performance. Complementarities exist along at
least four margins: (i) Complementarity between health/longevity and education. Here, Boucekkine et
al. (2002), Cervellati and Sunde (2013), and Sanchez-Romero et al. (2016), among others, study the
role of the Ben-Porath effect, whereby extensions in life expectancy trigger greater investments in
education, with Jayachandran and Lleras-Muney (2009), Fortson (2011), and Oster et al. (2013)
providing empirical evidence. Bleakley (2007, 2010), by contrast, emphasizes the complementarity
between childhood health and the productivity of education. Finally, a reverse effect from education
to health and health behavior is also likely, although the evidence is somewhat mixed (cf. Galama et
al., 2018). (ii) Complementarity among investments into improving different types of health, e.g.,
relating to competing risks of mortality or to morbidity (quality of life) in parallel to mortality (quantity
of life) (cf. Murphy and Topel, 2006; Oster, 2012a; Oster et al., 2013). (iii) Complementarity between
health/longevity and savings, as individuals who live longer tend to save more, which has repercussions
for capital accumulation and economic activity (cf. Bloom et al., 2007). (iv) Complementarity between
improvements in women’s health and reductions in fertility, which in turn can help the escape from
poverty traps (Bloom et al., 2020c; Klasing and Milionis, 2020). In the context of endemic infectious
diseases, such as HIV or malaria, complementarities imply serious economic consequences, including
the negative impact of HIV on human capital investments (Fortson, 2011), the negative impact of
malaria during childhood on educational attainment (Bleakley, 2010), and the detrimental impact of
low levels of life expectancy on risky sexual behavior in the presence of HIV (Oster, 2012a).

To summarize, this section shows important pathways by which health affects economic outcomes.
The direct effects of health on economic growth as derived from micro-based and macro-based
approaches are sizeable, but many indirect effects via health-induced education, savings, and fertility
reductions strongly reinforce the direct effects at the macroeconomic level.

    3. The economic burden of diseases: different assessment
       methods, their weaknesses, and potential solutions
Various approaches are used to assess the economic burden of diseases. A broad categorization would
distinguish the following approaches, which have different properties, advantages, and disadvantages.

    (i)      The cost-of-illness approach (COI) summarizes the economic burden of a disease by
             summing up all direct and indirect costs caused by the disease over a specified time period.
             The direct costs include personal medical costs (e.g., for inpatient and outpatient
             treatment), nonmedical care costs (e.g., for transportation), and personal nonmedical
             costs (e.g., for research). The indirect costs include the loss of income of individuals
             afflicted with the disease. Adding up the costs results in a monetary value that can be
             interpreted in a straightforward manner and compared with other figures such as the cost
             of eliminating the disease. Therefore, the approach lends itself to an easy-to-interpret
             cost-benefit analysis. However, this approach is mechanical because costs are summed up
             without considering general equilibrium adjustment mechanisms at the macroeconomic
             level or individual behavioral changes and policy interventions in response to the spread
             of infections. For example, the job of a worker who dies from a disease is often filled by
             someone else after a certain amount of time. The associated loss of income to the person
                                                     6
        who died may therefore lead to a gain of income of another underemployed or
        unemployed individual if there is slack in the economy. For a more detailed description of
        the approach and debates on its usefulness see, for example, Currie et al. (2000), Rice
        (2000), and World Health Organization (2009).
(ii)    The VSL approach first infers the value that individuals attach to their lives by estimating
        their willingness to accept risks in wage regressions (where risk premia are paid for more
        dangerous occupations), or, alternatively, their willingness to pay to reduce risks based on
        consumption data for lifesaving or health-preserving items. From the corresponding
        parameter estimates inferring the value a person attaches to his or her life is then possible.
        Aggregating the resulting values over the whole population and weighting by the life years
        lost due to a disease yields again a single monetary value that represents the disease
        burden (Viscusi and Aldy, 2003; Murphy and Topel, 2006). In typical empirical applications,
        this approach also does not consider general equilibrium repercussions and behavioral
        changes and is thus of limited use from a macroeconomic perspective. Note, however, that
        recent work has included the value of life in numerical general equilibrium frameworks
        (Hall and Jones, 2007; Frankovic and Kuhn, 2019; Frankovic et al., 2020).
(iii)   A conceptually different approach that considers macroeconomic adjustment mechanisms
        is based on convergence regressions following Barro (1991) and Islam (1995). In this
        approach, economic growth is regressed on the prevalence of the disease of interest and
        a set of relevant control variables (cf. Durlauf et al., 2005; Eberhardt and Teal, 2011 for
        general discussions of the method). From the coefficient estimate of prevalence, the
        disease-specific impact on economic growth can be inferred directly. The drawbacks of
        this approach are that (a) the data requirements are rather high, (b) misspecifications of
        the regression equation and missing or inaccurately measured data strongly influence the
        final results, (c) the approach only works for severe diseases (to have a sufficiently high
        signal-to-noise ratio), and (d) it only works if the disease affects many countries over a
        substantial time span so as to have a sufficiently large number of observations for precise
        estimates in either cross-country or panel settings. The necessary conditions for the
        approach to work tend to be fulfilled for severe pandemics or for widespread
        noncommunicable diseases with a discernible impact on economic growth, such as
        cardiovascular diseases (see Suhrcke and Urban, 2010 for an application to cardiovascular
        diseases, and see Barro et al., 2020 for an application to the Spanish flu).
(iv)    As another conceptually different approach, Bloom et al. (2020b) propose calibrating a
        human capital–augmented production function along the lines of Lucas (1988) with
        disease-specific and age-specific data on morbidity and mortality of the disease of interest
        (cf. Bloom et al., 2004). Mortality and morbidity related to a certain disease reduce
        aggregate effective labor supply depending on age-specific individual labor supply, age-
        specific education levels, and the susceptibility of the corresponding age group to the
        studied disease. In addition, treatment costs reduce the amount of resources that are
        available for saving/investment and therefore hamper capital accumulation. The
        framework thus allows tracing the long-run supply-side effects of a disease (including the
        substitution patterns of labor and capital over time) on GDP in general equilibrium, but
        also disregards behavioral changes on the household side. The long-term general
        equilibrium nature of the approach and the missing scope for analyzing patterns of private
        or public response to the emergence of an epidemic limits the applicability of this
        approach in the case of infectious diseases. For applications to noncommunicable diseases
        and traffic accidents (where the approach is generally better suited) see Chen et al. (2018,
        2019a, b).

     (v)      No approach discussed so far is ideally suited to analyzing the effects of infectious diseases
              on macroeconomic outcomes. To this end, merging a detailed production function
              approach as described in item (iv) with behavioral effects and their repercussions on the
              macroeconomy and with disease dynamics according to a susceptible–infected–recovered
              (SIR) model in the background would be desirable. Attempts along these lines couple SIR
              models with computable dynamic general equilibrium models of the economy,
              incorporating the direct effect of the disease and disease- or policy-induced behavioral
              changes on aggregate production and income (cf. Chakraborty et al., 2010, 2016; Goenka
              et al., 2014; Brotherhood et al., 2020; Eichenbaum et al., 2020a, b; Glover et al., 2020;
              Krueger et al., 2020). 6 In these frameworks, disease transmission follows an SIR pattern,
              household behavior follows a dynamically optimal path as in the standard business-cycle
              literature with endogenous labor supply, and a simplified production function is usually
              applied on the supply side to keep the framework tractable. 7

This short overview shows that from a macroeconomic perspective (i) and (ii) fall short of providing an
accurate picture of the economic effects of infectious diseases, while (iii) and (iv) capture some aspects
well, for example, the growth effects of severe conditions that affect many countries or the overall
burden of a disease if household behavioral reactions need not be identified directly. However, only
an approach along the lines of (v) would, in principle, be able to capture all important macroeconomic
effects of infectious diseases and the pathways by which they emerge.

     4. An epidemiological economic model
In this section, we sketch a general epidemiological macroeconomic model with competing risks to
analyze how the epidemiological properties of disease dynamics (rates of infection, mortality, and
recovery; measures of morbidity) and the state of disease (as measured by the size of the infected
population) affect individual consumption, labor supply, and protective behavior, and ultimately
impact on macroeconomic outcomes.

           4.1 Epidemiological dynamics
Consider a population of 𝑁𝑁 = 𝑆𝑆 + 𝐼𝐼 + 𝑅𝑅 living individuals. Among these, 𝑆𝑆 are susceptible (vulnerable
to contracting an infection), 𝐼𝐼 are infected, and 𝑅𝑅 are recovered (with immunity). The disease dynamics
for susceptibles are given by

                      𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡+1 − 𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡 = 𝐵𝐵𝑡𝑡 − 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡 𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡 − (1 − 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡 )𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡 𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡 = 𝐵𝐵𝑡𝑡 − [𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡 − (1 − 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡 )𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡 𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 ]𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡 ,   (1)

where 𝐵𝐵𝑡𝑡 denotes the number of susceptible newborns, 𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡 the infection rate, and 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡 refers to baseline
mortality. The number of susceptible individuals increases with the birth of individuals without
immunity and decreases with deaths from causes other than the infectious disease under
consideration. The number of susceptible individuals also decreases because a fraction of still-living
susceptibles become infected and therefore move from state 𝑆𝑆 to state 𝐼𝐼. The dynamics of the number
of infected are given by


6 A second line of contributions that is not always based on SIR dynamics more specifically assesses the effects of infectious

diseases on economic development and in particular on the onset of the demographic transition or the emergence of a
demographically induced poverty trap (Lagerlöf, 2003; Momota et al., 2005; Boucekkine et al., 2009; Aksan and Chakraborty,
2014; Gori et al., 2020).
7 A rich literature on behavioral epidemic modeling provides alternative approaches, including network- and agent-based

models (e.g., Hollingsworth et al., 2011; Manfredi and D’Onofrio, 2013; Liu et al., 2015; Enanoria et al., 2016). While these
models often allow for a rich description of behavioral and epidemic dynamics, they typically do not include detailed models
of the underlying economies, and the pathways by which different effects emerge are difficult to trace.
                                                                     8
           𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡+1 − 𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 = (1 − 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡 )𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡 𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡 − 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡𝐼𝐼 𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 − (1 − 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡𝐼𝐼 )𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡 𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 − (1 − 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡𝐼𝐼 )(1 − 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡 )𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡

                          = {(1 − 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡 )𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡 𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡 − 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡𝐼𝐼 − (1 − 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡𝐼𝐼 )[𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡 + (1 − 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡 )𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 ]}𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 ,                                                   (2)

where 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡𝐼𝐼 denotes infection-specific mortality and 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 is the rate of recovery, conditional on survival.
The number of infected increases with the number of susceptibles who get infected at time 𝑡𝑡 and
decreases with general and disease-specific mortality and with the recovery of the surviving infected
who move from state 𝐼𝐼 to state 𝑅𝑅, in which they do not have the disease but acquired immunity. 8 The
number of recovered increases with the number of the surviving and recovered infected and decreases
with the number of recovered who die from causes other than the infectious disease under
consideration: 9

            𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡+1 − 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 = (1 − 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡 )(1 − 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡𝐼𝐼 )𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 − 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡

                            = 𝐵𝐵𝑡𝑡 − 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡 𝑁𝑁𝑡𝑡 − (1 − 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡 )𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡𝐼𝐼 𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 .                                                                                    (3)

The competing risks structure is an important prerequisite to capture the dynamics of infectious
diseases that become chronic or recurrent and constitute a significant mortality risk in their own right,
that is, diseases with a low 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 and a high 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡𝐼𝐼 . This applies in particular to HIV, at least until potent
treatments became available. While the economic implications of competing risks will be addressed
subsequently, in the SIR dynamics they appear prominently in the dynamics of the number of infected,
where individuals may exit due to death from the disease, 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡𝐼𝐼 𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 ; due to death from other causes,
(1 − 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡𝐼𝐼 )𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡 𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 ; or due to recovery, (1 − 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡𝐼𝐼 )(1 − 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡 )𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 . The latter two terms need to be weighted with
survival to avoid double counting. We note, however, that this is not always explicit in the formulation
of SIR models, where (under the assumption 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡 = 0) the unconditional recovery rate is often stated
as a single parameter, 𝛾𝛾�: = (1 − 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡𝐼𝐼 )𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 . While this is fine for any analysis in which the disease-specific
                                                                                                                        �𝑡𝑡
                                                                                                                      𝑑𝑑𝛾𝛾                                  𝑑𝑑γ
mortality 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡𝐼𝐼 is held constant, care needs to be taken to account for the term                                                = −𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 + (1 − 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡𝐼𝐼 ) 𝑑𝑑𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡𝐼𝐼
                                                                                                                      𝑑𝑑𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡𝐼𝐼                                    𝑡𝑡
in case variations of this mortality rate are considered. 10

To reflect hospital crowding exacerbating death rates as during the COVID-19 epidemic, several models
(e.g., Acemoglu et al., 2020; Brotherhood et al., 2020; Eichenbaum et al., 2020a, b; Glover et al., 2020)
assume the mortality rates 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡𝐼𝐼 =𝜇𝜇̂ 𝑡𝑡𝐼𝐼 (𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 ) to be an increasing function of infections. Although not contained
in these models, similar assumptions could be applied to the recovery rate 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 or, indeed, to general
mortality 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡 , the latter reflecting the deferral of lifesaving treatments due to crowding in the health
care system (Maringe et al., 2020). However, general mortality might also decline if preventive
behavior reduces the probability of infection by other viruses (e.g., the common flu) or if lockdowns
reduce road accidents (Oguzoglu, 2020).

Let the infection rate be given by the function 𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡 = 𝛼𝛼(𝑁𝑁𝑡𝑡 , 𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑆𝑆 , 𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑡𝑆𝑆 , 𝑣𝑣𝑡𝑡𝑆𝑆 , 𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝐼𝐼 , 𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑡𝐼𝐼 , 𝑣𝑣𝑡𝑡𝐼𝐼 ), where 𝑐𝑐 is consumption,
𝑙𝑙 is labor supply, and 𝑣𝑣 is preventive effort with the superscripts 𝑆𝑆 and 𝐼𝐼 denoting these activities for
susceptible and infected individuals, respectively. As is intuitive, the infection risk rises with


8 More general frameworks allow for yet another transition from state 𝑅𝑅 back to state 𝑆𝑆 because immunity might only be

short lived (as, e.g., in the case of the flu) and for a state of infection without symptoms that comes in between states 𝑆𝑆 and
𝐼𝐼 in which individuals might be infectious without knowing that they carry the disease as in the case of COVID-19 (see, e.g.,
Anderson et al., 2012; Brotherhood et al., 2020; Rowthorn and Toxvaerd, 2020).
9
   The change in population size 𝑁𝑁𝑡𝑡+1 − 𝑁𝑁𝑡𝑡 = 𝐵𝐵𝑡𝑡 − 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡 𝑁𝑁𝑡𝑡 − (1 − 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡 )𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡𝐼𝐼 𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 is easily constructed from combining equations (1)–
(3).
10 Here, the first negative term captures the direct reduction due to mortality of the population from which recovered

individuals are drawn, while the second term captures a selectivity effect according to which surviving individuals may also
face better chances of recovery.
                                                                             9
consumption and labor supply due to the associated social interactions and decreases with preventive
effort, such as exercising restraint in risky activities; using protective devices, for example, face masks
in the case of a disease like COVID-19 or condoms in the case of HIV; and taking up vaccination. Thus,
we have the following derivatives: 𝛼𝛼𝑐𝑐 𝑆𝑆 , 𝛼𝛼𝑐𝑐 𝐼𝐼 ≥ 0; 𝛼𝛼𝑙𝑙𝑆𝑆 , 𝛼𝛼𝑙𝑙𝐼𝐼 ≥ 0; and 𝛼𝛼𝑣𝑣 𝑆𝑆 , 𝛼𝛼𝑣𝑣 𝐼𝐼 ≤ 0. Generally, the
infection rate also depends on the population size, such that 𝛼𝛼𝑁𝑁 ≷ 0. Here, several competing
specifications are in use: Assuming that a susceptible individual interacts randomly with other
members of the population at a rate 𝛼𝛼�, the infection risk is 𝛼𝛼� × 𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 /𝑁𝑁𝑡𝑡 , where the probability of meeting
an infected person is given by the prevalence rate 𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 /𝑁𝑁𝑡𝑡 . The seminal SIR model by Kermack and
McKendrick (1927) posits 𝛼𝛼� = 𝛼𝛼�1 , a constant rate of interaction. This implies that by lowering the
prevalence rate 𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 /𝑁𝑁𝑡𝑡 , the infection risk 𝛼𝛼�1 × 𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 /𝑁𝑁𝑡𝑡 decreases, ceteris paribus, with the size of the
population. By contrast, many models (e.g., Philipson, 2000; Eichenbaum et al., 2020a, b) assume that
the rate of interaction is proportional to the population size, such that 𝛼𝛼� = 𝛼𝛼�2 𝑁𝑁𝑡𝑡 . In this case the
infection risk 𝛼𝛼�2 𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 is independent of the population size. While the two approaches are (broadly)
equivalent for (near) stationary populations, the assumptions about the interaction rate 𝛼𝛼� become less
innocuous when disease mortality or responses in terms of fertility or migration lead to changes in the
population size. The same applies to diseases that turn endemic within non-stationary populations.
Acemoglu et al. (2020) explore a general specification of the infection function that nests the two polar
cases described but allows for all intermediate forms. Studying testing and lockdown policies in the
context of COVID-19, they show that while the recovered offer greater protection for the case 𝛼𝛼� = 𝛼𝛼�1 ,
lockdown policies tend to be more effective in settings where the rate of infection increases with the
population size, as is the case for 𝛼𝛼� = 𝛼𝛼�2 𝑁𝑁𝑡𝑡 .

          4.2 Behavioral responses
Building on Eichenbaum et al. (2020a), we assume that individuals within each of the SIR groups
maximize utility over their remaining life course from time 𝑡𝑡 onward. 11 We can write the maximization
problem for susceptible individuals at time/age 𝑡𝑡 in terms of the value function:

                          𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡𝑆𝑆 = max �𝑢𝑢(𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡 , 𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑡 , 𝑣𝑣𝑡𝑡 ) + 𝜌𝜌(1 − 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡 )�𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡 𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡+1
                                                                                             𝐼𝐼                       𝑆𝑆
                                                                                                 + (1 − 𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡 𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 )𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡+1 ��,          (4)
                                             𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡 ,𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑡 ,𝑣𝑣𝑡𝑡


where 𝜌𝜌 ∈ [0,1] is the time discount factor, 𝑢𝑢(𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡 , 𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑡 , 𝑣𝑣𝑡𝑡 ) is period utility, and 𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 denotes the value
function of group 𝑖𝑖 = 𝑆𝑆, 𝐼𝐼, 𝑅𝑅 as of time 𝑡𝑡. Period utility increases with consumption (𝑢𝑢𝑐𝑐 > 0), decreases
with labor supply (𝑢𝑢𝑙𝑙 < 0) because of the disutility of work, and decreases with prevention (𝑢𝑢𝑣𝑣 ≤ 0)
because preventive activities typically imply restraint in what would otherwise be some utility-
maximizing behavior. 12 We normalize utility in the state of death to zero.

Similarly, the maximization problem for infected individuals at time/age 𝑡𝑡 is given by

                                                                                              𝑅𝑅                  𝐼𝐼 ]
                  𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡𝐼𝐼 = max {𝑢𝑢�(𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡 , 𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑡 , 𝑣𝑣𝑡𝑡 ) + 𝜌𝜌(1 − 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡 )(1 − 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡𝐼𝐼 )[𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡+1 + (1 − 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 )𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡+1  + 𝛽𝛽𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡𝑆𝑆 },   (5)
                          𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡 ,𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑡 ,𝑣𝑣𝑡𝑡




11 Our model generalizes Eichenbaum et al. (2020a) by considering (i) a specific preventive effort, 𝑣𝑣 , apart from adjustments
                                                                                                         𝑡𝑡
to consumption and labor supply; (ii) the multiplicity of disease and general survival risk; (iii) the presence of altruism on the
part of infected individuals; and (iv) a dynamic budget constraint.
12 While we emphasize the macroeconomic linkages and therefore follow Eichenbaum et al. (2020a) by explicitly allowing for

consumption and labor supply responses to the disease, we acknowledge the large body of literature in economic
epidemiology that models the choice of prevention effort, often understood as vaccination but also as social distancing (e.g.,
Geoffard and Philipson, 1996, 1997; Kremer, 1996; Auld, 2003; Fenichel, 2013; Toxvaerd, 2019, 2020). For surveys see
Philipson (2000), Gersovitz (2011), and Chen and Toxvaerd (2014).
                                                                     10
where 𝛽𝛽 ∈ [0,1] denotes the degree of altruism of the infected toward contemporary susceptible
individuals and where period utility 𝑢𝑢�(𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡 , 𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑡 , 𝑣𝑣𝑡𝑡 ) is typically lower than that of susceptible individuals,
that is, 𝑢𝑢�(𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡 , 𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑡 , 𝑣𝑣𝑡𝑡 ) ≤ 𝑢𝑢(𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡 , 𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑡 , 𝑣𝑣𝑡𝑡 ), with additional effects relating to the marginal utilities.

Finally, we can write the life-cycle utility of recovered individuals as

                                                                                           𝑅𝑅 },
                                        𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡𝑅𝑅 = max{𝑢𝑢(𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡 , 𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑡 , 0) + 𝜌𝜌(1 − 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡 )𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡+1                      (6)
                                                  𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡 ,𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑡


where we note that recovered individuals who are immune to the disease have no need or incentive
to engage in preventive behavior.

Assuming that physical capital 𝑘𝑘𝑡𝑡 is the only savings vehicle and normalizing the price of consumption
goods to one, individuals face the following dynamic budget constraint:

                                       𝑘𝑘𝑡𝑡−1 − 𝑘𝑘𝑡𝑡 = 𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡 𝑘𝑘𝑡𝑡 + 𝜙𝜙 𝑖𝑖 𝑤𝑤𝑡𝑡 ℎ𝑡𝑡 𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑡 − 𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡 − 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 𝑣𝑣𝑡𝑡 ,         (7)

where 𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡 and 𝑤𝑤𝑡𝑡 denote the interest rate and the wage rate per unit of human capital ℎ𝑡𝑡 (which for
the moment we treat exogenously), respectively; where 𝜙𝜙 𝑖𝑖 with 𝑖𝑖 = 𝑆𝑆, 𝐼𝐼, 𝑅𝑅 refers to labor productivity
of type 𝑖𝑖 with 𝜙𝜙 𝑆𝑆 = 𝜙𝜙 𝑅𝑅 = 1 and 𝜙𝜙 𝐼𝐼 ∈ [0,1]; and where 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 ≥ 0 is the price of protective goods in case
these can be purchased. This would apply, for example, to condoms for the prevention of HIV infection,
to face masks for reducing the risk of COVID-19 infection, or to costly vaccines.

         4.2.1 First-order conditions for susceptible individuals (S types)
The choices of susceptible individuals follow from the first-order conditions:


                                    𝑢𝑢𝑐𝑐 − 𝜆𝜆𝑡𝑡𝑆𝑆 + 𝜌𝜌(1 − 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡 )�𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡+1
                                                                     𝐼𝐼       𝑆𝑆
                                                                         − 𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡+1 �𝛼𝛼𝑐𝑐 𝑆𝑆 𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 = 0,

                                  𝑢𝑢𝑙𝑙 + ℎ𝑡𝑡 𝑤𝑤𝑡𝑡 𝜆𝜆𝑡𝑡𝑆𝑆 + 𝜌𝜌(1 − 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡 )�𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡+1
                                                                            𝐼𝐼       𝑆𝑆
                                                                                − 𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡+1 �𝛼𝛼𝑙𝑙𝑆𝑆 𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 = 0,

                                   𝑢𝑢𝑣𝑣 − 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡 + 𝜌𝜌(1 − 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡 )�𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡+1
                                                                         𝐼𝐼       𝑆𝑆
                                                                             − 𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡+1 �𝛼𝛼𝑣𝑣𝑆𝑆 𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 ≤ 0,

where 𝜆𝜆𝑡𝑡𝑆𝑆 denotes the shadow price of wealth for a susceptible individual. For all conditions, the first
two terms govern the choice that would be made in the absence of the disease (i.e., 𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 = 0). Notably,
under the assumption that 𝑢𝑢𝑣𝑣 < 0, individuals would not engage in preventive activity. The third term
then indicates how choices are adjusted if this reduces the risk of infection, that is, if 𝛼𝛼𝑐𝑐 𝑆𝑆 , 𝛼𝛼𝑙𝑙𝑆𝑆 > 0 and
𝛼𝛼𝑣𝑣 𝑆𝑆 < 0.

Proposition 1
                                       𝐼𝐼       𝑆𝑆
Under the plausible assumption that 𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡+1 < 𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡+1 , susceptible individuals lower their consumption and
their labor supply and engage in preventive activities in line with

    •    the “stakes of infection” in terms of the present value of the expected loss in future life-cycle
                                                            𝐼𝐼       𝑆𝑆
         utility in the case of infection, 𝜌𝜌(1 − 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡 )�𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡+1 − 𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡+1 �;
    •    the impact of the respective activity on infection risk, �𝛼𝛼𝑐𝑐 𝑆𝑆 , 𝛼𝛼𝑙𝑙𝑆𝑆 , 𝛼𝛼𝑣𝑣 𝑆𝑆 �;
    •    the prevalence of the disease, 𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 ; and
    •    opportunity costs, ℎ𝑡𝑡 𝑤𝑤𝑡𝑡 , and prices for protective goods, 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 .

Note that apart from the future orientation, as measured by the discount factor 𝜌𝜌, and the utility loss
implied by the infection, the “stakes of infection” also depend on the general survival prospects, 1 −
𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡 . This implies that population groups with poorer survival prospects (e.g., the old or the poor) have
                                                                  11
ceteris paribus a lower incentive to invest in self-protection (Oster, 2012a). The corollary that follows
is that the downward adjustments in consumption and labor supply are weaker for these groups.

The utility loss from the infection itself, 𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡+1 − 𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡+1 , is high if the infectious disease is associated with
(i) high morbidity, implying a strong loss in period utility 𝑢𝑢�(𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡 , 𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑡 , 𝑣𝑣𝑡𝑡 ) << 𝑢𝑢(𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡 , 𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑡 , 𝑣𝑣𝑡𝑡 ) or productivity
                                  𝐼𝐼
𝜙𝜙 𝐼𝐼 << 1; (ii) high mortality 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡+1 such that survival into period 𝑡𝑡 + 2 is compromised; or (iii) poor
prospects of recovery, that is, 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡+1 << 1. By now considerable empirical evidence is available to
indicate the dependency of preventive behavior on life-cycle circumstances (e.g., Kremer, 1996; Auld,
2003; Dupas, 2011; Oster, 2018; Dang et al., 2020). Income tends to be conducive to prevention by
raising the stakes from income loss and the value of prevention (relative to foregone consumption),
while education increases awareness and empowerment to engage in prevention. In addition,
expectations about disease development have been shown to matter. Here, a belief that future
                                                                                                      𝐼𝐼           𝑆𝑆
infection, for example, in period 𝑡𝑡 + 1, is unavoidable will narrow the wedge (𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡+1                       − 𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡+1 ) and thus
the stakes of infection in period 𝑡𝑡. Finally, the decision to engage in prevention and the means of
prevention depend on the prices for protective mesures (e.g., Cohen and Dupas, 2010) and the
opportunity cost.

Remark 1
The model’s structure allows considerable scope for heterogeneity across (i) diseases that differ with
respect to their disutility effects, infection risks, morbidity effects, mortality effects, and survival
prospects {𝑢𝑢�, 𝜙𝜙 𝐼𝐼 𝜇𝜇𝐼𝐼 , 𝛾𝛾, 𝛼𝛼}; (ii) individuals that differ with respect to wealth, income, education, general
mortality risk, impatience, and susceptibility to the disease {𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 , 𝑤𝑤, ℎ, 𝜇𝜇, 𝜌𝜌, 𝛼𝛼}; and (iii) countries that
differ with respect to income levels, price levels, and institutional settings that drive general mortality
and infection risk and insure against the cost of prevention and infection {𝑤𝑤, 𝑝𝑝, 𝜇𝜇, 𝛼𝛼}.

While most older literature in economic epidemiology focuses on preventive effort, 𝜈𝜈, that may be
costly but is otherwise not linked to macroeconomic performance, recent macroeconomic literature
on the impact of COVID-19 has focused on social distancing as a means of prevention that directly
bears on consumption and labor supply (see, e.g., Brotherhood et al., 2020; Eichenbaum et al., 2020a,
b; Glover et al., 2020; Krueger et al., 2020). Indeed, this literature shows that the reduction in
consumption and labor supply for reasons of self-protection can have large macroeconomic
repercussions, as experienced in the context of COVID-19. Importantly, however, an interdependency
exists between the extent of self-protection and the extent to which consumption and labor supply
are reduced due to social distancing. To simplify the exposition, we assume that no cross-effects exist
between the marginal utility of consumption and labor supply 𝑢𝑢𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 = 0 (as is assumed, for example, in
Eichenbaum et al., 2020a, b).

Proposition 2
Self-protection is conducive to alleviating the negative impact of the epidemic on consumption and
labor supply if it lowers the riskiness of these activities to an extent that overcompensates a decline in
the marginal utility of consumption or an increase in the marginal disutility of labor that is associated
with self-protection.

To illustrate the claim, consider the partial derivative of consumption with respect to prevention effort:

                                                                                  𝐼𝐼      𝑆𝑆

Noting that the second-order conditions imply that 𝑢𝑢𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 − 𝜌𝜌(1 − 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡 )�𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡+1               − 𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡+1 �𝛼𝛼𝑐𝑐 𝑆𝑆𝑐𝑐 𝑆𝑆 𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 < 0, we
           𝑆𝑆                                                    𝐼𝐼       𝑆𝑆
obtain ∂𝑐𝑐 / ∂𝑣𝑣 > 0 if and only if 𝑢𝑢𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 − 𝜌𝜌(1 − 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡 )�𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡+1 − 𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡+1 �𝛼𝛼𝑐𝑐 𝑆𝑆𝑣𝑣 𝑆𝑆 𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 > 0. Under the plausible
assumptions that 𝑢𝑢𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 ≤ 0 and 𝛼𝛼𝑐𝑐 𝑆𝑆𝑣𝑣 𝑆𝑆 < 0, that is, protection is potentially reducing the marginal utility
of consumption but is also lowering the infection risk associated with consumption, the condition then
implies the statement in the proposition (see Doganoglu and Ozdenoren, 2020, for a modeling
application to COVID-19). Note that such an outcome is likelier the higher the stakes of infection are
and the higher the prevalence of the disease is. A similar result is easily obtained with respect to labor
supply. In macroeconomic terms, the proposition implies that the reductions in consumption or labor
supply may be strongly mitigated if individuals have the scope to take preventive actions. This creates
inroads for policymaking in enabling and fostering such options, which are related to (i) availability of
vaccination, (ii) availability of condoms/face masks/insecticide-treated bednets, (iii) restraints on risky
behaviors (e.g., just working/shopping but without mingling), or (iv) substitution of
consumption/employment with less risky forms like food delivery instead of eating in restaurants or
home office instead of commuting by public transport to work in open plan offices. Krueger et al.
(2020), who generalize the Eichenbaum et al. (2020a) model of the COVID-19 pandemic to allow for
substitution toward home production and home consumption, show that quantitatively this may
mitigate both the human and the economic loss associated with the pandemic considerably.

Remark 2
The dependency of preventive actions on the prevalence of a disease has the important repercussion
that diseases are difficult to eradicate via private actions alone (Geoffard and Philipson, 1996, 1997).
This follows immediately from the fact that preventive incentives wane with declines in disease
prevalence and peter out entirely once the disease is close to eradication, 𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 ≈ 0. In such a case, the
further evolution of the disease toward either vanishing or re-emerging very much depends on (pure)
epidemiological properties.

          4.2.2 First-order conditions for infected individuals (I types)
The choices of infected individuals are determined by the first-order conditions:

                                                                           𝐼𝐼       𝑆𝑆
                                       𝑢𝑢�𝑐𝑐 − 𝜆𝜆𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 + 𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽(1 − 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡 )�𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡+1 − 𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡+1 �𝛼𝛼𝑐𝑐 𝐼𝐼 𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡 = 0,
                                                                                     𝐼𝐼       𝑆𝑆
                                  𝑢𝑢�𝑙𝑙 + 𝜙𝜙 𝐼𝐼 ℎ𝑡𝑡 𝑤𝑤𝑡𝑡 𝜆𝜆𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 + 𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽(1 − 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡 )�𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡+1 − 𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡+1 �𝛼𝛼𝑙𝑙𝐼𝐼 𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡 = 0,
                                                                              𝐼𝐼       𝑆𝑆
                                     𝑢𝑢�𝑣𝑣 − 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 𝜆𝜆𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 + 𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽(1 − 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡 )�𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡+1 − 𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡+1 �𝛼𝛼𝑣𝑣 𝐼𝐼 𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡 ≤ 0,

where 𝜆𝜆𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 denotes the shadow price of wealth for an infected person.

Proposition 3
                             𝐼𝐼       𝑆𝑆
Under the assumption that 𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡+1 < 𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡+1 , infected individuals lower their consumption and their labor
supply and engage in preventive activities in line with

     •    the degree of altruism, 𝛽𝛽 ∈ [0,1];
     •    the “stakes of infection” in terms of the present value of the expected loss in future life-cycle
                                                              𝐼𝐼      𝑆𝑆
          utility in the case of infection, 𝜌𝜌(1 − 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡 )�𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡+1 − 𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡+1 �;
     •    the impact of the respective activity on infection risk, �𝛼𝛼𝑐𝑐 𝐼𝐼 , 𝛼𝛼𝑙𝑙𝐼𝐼 , 𝛼𝛼𝑣𝑣 𝐼𝐼 �;
     •    the number of susceptible individuals, 𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡 ; and
     •    opportunity costs, 𝜙𝜙 𝐼𝐼 ℎ𝑡𝑡 𝑤𝑤𝑡𝑡 , and prices for protective goods, 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 .

Infected individuals accommodate prevention concerns to the extent 𝛽𝛽 ≥ 0 that they are altruistic
toward the susceptible. Note that entirely selfish individuals with 𝛽𝛽 = 0 will not adjust their
                                              13
consumption and labor supply to avoid infections and, for 𝑢𝑢�𝑣𝑣 ≤ 0 and 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 ≥ 0, will not engage in any
preventive behavior. Even if infected individuals engage in some prevention for 𝛽𝛽 ∈ (0,1), they impose
a certain (contemporary) externality on the susceptible population.

Similar to the incentives that susceptible individuals face, the incentive to engage in prevention
                                                           𝐼𝐼       𝑆𝑆
increases with the “stakes of infection,” 𝜌𝜌(1 − 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡 )�𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡+1 − 𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡+1 �, reflecting the utility loss imposed on
a contemporary susceptible individual in the case of an infection and the additional infections that are
avoided at time 𝑡𝑡. Notably, the contingency of the stakes of infection on general survival has
repercussions if the susceptible population is selected from groups with higher mortality (e.g., the
older population, the poor, etc.). Utilitarian altruists may then have a low incentive to invest in
protecting these vulnerable groups.

We assume here that individuals only care about those infections they cause in person, where a
broader notion of altruism would also embrace an intertemporal component, 𝑋𝑋𝑡𝑡+1 = 𝜌𝜌(1 −
            𝐼𝐼       𝑆𝑆                       𝑑𝑑𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡+1
𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡+1 )�𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡+2 − 𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡+2 �𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡+1 𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡+1                  + 𝑋𝑋𝑡𝑡+2 , reflecting the knock-on effect of the infections caused at
                                                𝑑𝑑𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡
time 𝑡𝑡. Given that the individuals under consideration do not directly cause the knock-on infections, it
seems reasonable they cares less about them. However, the intertemporal term also illustrates that
the size of the dynamic part of the externality may be substantial, in particular, in the case of fast-
spreading infections such as COVID-19. In such cases, decisive policy interventions may well be
required.

Remark 3
A richer behavioral model should account for reciprocity and trust (Alfaro et al., 2020; Doganoglu and
Ozdenoren, 2020), which would make own prevention efforts depend positively on the (expected)
prevention of others (Bartscher et al., 2020). The violation of prevention norms, in particular by public
figures and members of the government, may erode voluntary efforts in such a setting (Fancourt et al.,
2020).

Finally, the incentive to engage in prevention increases with the size of the susceptible population and
thus tends to decline with disease prevalence, i.e., with 𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 (but also with 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 ). This implies that to some
extent preventive actions of altruistic infected individuals foster disease eradication even when an
incentive on the part of the susceptibles to engage in self-protection no longer exists.

Depending on the cross-derivatives between the preventive efforts of the susceptible and the infected
within the function 𝛼𝛼(⋅), preventive efforts may be strategic substitutes (complements) across types.
In the (more likely) case that they are strategic substitutes, the following holds. 13

Proposition 4
If preventive efforts of the susceptible and the (altruistic) infected are strategic substitutes, both groups
have an incentive to underinvest in prevention when taking the other group’s efforts as given, implying
that preventive efforts tend to be too low from a welfare perspective.

To consider a specific example, we build on Eichenbaum et al. (2020a) and assume that
                                                               𝑐𝑐 𝑆𝑆   𝑐𝑐 𝐼𝐼        𝑙𝑙 𝑆𝑆   𝑙𝑙 𝐼𝐼

where the second equality and the inequality follow for our specific example. Here, reductions in
consumption to prevent disease are strategic substitutes, and this implies that the underprovision of
prevention as a public good within a noncooperative Nash equilibrium is well known (Pauly, 1970),
that is, individuals will consume too much. A similar result is easily verified with respect to the choice
of labor supply, 𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 , which is overprovided, and preventive effort, 𝑣𝑣𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 , which is underprovided, a well-
known result in the literature on economic epidemiology (e.g., Chen and Toxvaerd, 2014 in the context
of vaccination; Toxvaerd, 2019 in a general prevention model; Farboodi et al., 2020; Garibaldi et al.,
2020; McAdams, 2020; Toxvaerd, 2020 in the context of social distancing; and Kuhn et al., 2011 for a
life-cycle account of externalities arising from health care choices).

While, to our knowledge, this has not yet been studied, the presence of complementarity in preventive
efforts could yield important macroeconomic implications. Compare, for instance, two economies, of
which only one experiences altruism on the part of the infected. Assuming that infected individuals are
less productive, that is, 𝜙𝜙 𝐼𝐼 < 1, the greater reduction in labor supply on the part of the infected
altruists then allows healthy but susceptible individuals to reduce their labor supply less and thus
mitigate the loss in output.

One general issue with voluntary preventive actions on the part of the infected is the presumption that
they know about their infection. Indeed, one prime problem of infectious diseases is that individuals
may be ill-informed because they have not yet developed symptoms, or even remain asymptomatic
altogether, or because symptoms may be signals for several diseases of different degrees of
infectiousness or severity. These issues have turned out to be particularly salient for HIV infection,
where the median lag between infection and the development of symptoms lasts for several years,
and for COVID-19, where the 7–14 day incubation period is relatively long for a disease with likely
airborne infection and where the large share of asymptomatic infections and difficulty of distinguishing
symptoms from the common flu exacerbate the information problem. Brotherhood et al. (2020)
develop a model in which altruistic individuals engage in prevention but where individuals are
imperfectly informed about their illness status. They conclude that testing for COVID-19 is a
prerequisite for effective voluntary prevention of the disease, which quantitative analysis bears out.

Finally, the disease itself changes infected individuals’ behavior regardless of whether they engage in
prevention or not: Infected individuals tend to lower consumption (ia) if the disease lowers their
marginal utility from consumption, that is, if 𝑢𝑢�𝑐𝑐 (𝑐𝑐, 𝑙𝑙) < 𝑢𝑢𝑐𝑐 (𝑐𝑐, 𝑙𝑙), and (ib) if they are subject to a negative
income effect (implying a higher 𝜆𝜆𝑡𝑡 ). Infected individuals also tend to lower labor supply if (iia) they
experience a higher disutility from working due to the illness, 𝑢𝑢�𝑙𝑙 (𝑐𝑐, 𝑙𝑙) > 𝑢𝑢𝑙𝑙 (𝑐𝑐, 𝑙𝑙), and (iib) if the
productivity loss from illness is sufficiently large, 𝜙𝜙 𝐼𝐼 << 1, to overcompensate a possibly offsetting
income effect that would induce individuals to work more hours to make up for the earnings loss due
to lower productivity.

         4.3 Human capital responses to the epidemic

Infectious disease outbreaks can affect human capital accumulation in various ways, including the
occurrence of long-term physical and mental health sequelae, interrupted access to the health system,
school closures, and changes in the expected benefits of attending school. Arguably, because of their
long-term nature, investments in human capital, that is, education and general health, tend to be less
affected by unexpected and transitory infectious disease epidemics (such as dengue or Ebola
outbreaks) than by endemic infectious diseases (such as HIV and malaria in Sub-Saharan Africa). A

                                                                               15
similar argument applies when the number of competing pathogens increases, leading to an increase
in the risk of acquiring some infectious disease (of many), a scenario that is deemed likely even for
richer countries in the global North. We first discuss the implications of (endemic) infection risks on
educational investments before turning to health.

          4.3.1 Education
For simplicity, assume that at time 𝑡𝑡 individuals (or in the case of children, their parents on their behalf)
can invest an amount 𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡 into education at some cost 𝜅𝜅𝑡𝑡 > 0 and thereby augment human capital
ℎ𝑡𝑡+1 = 𝜃𝜃 𝑖𝑖 𝑓𝑓(𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡 ), with 𝑓𝑓 ′ > 0. Here, 𝜃𝜃 𝑖𝑖 with 𝜃𝜃 𝐼𝐼 ≤ 𝜃𝜃 𝑆𝑆 = 1 (ignoring the recovered) denotes the health-
dependent productivity of education, where Bleakley (2007, 2010), Lucas (2010), Baird et al. (2016),
and others document that educational investments are less productive in the presence of infections
(hookworms, malaria) during childhood. The first-order condition for the choice of 𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡 by a healthy
susceptible individual is then given by

                          𝜌𝜌(1 − 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡 )�𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡 𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 ϕ𝐼𝐼 𝑤𝑤𝑡𝑡+1 𝜆𝜆𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡+1 + (1 − 𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡 𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 )𝑤𝑤𝑡𝑡+1 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡+1 �𝑓𝑓 ′ − 𝜅𝜅𝑡𝑡 𝜆𝜆𝑡𝑡𝑆𝑆 = 0.

Optimally, the expected return to education (in value-of-wealth terms) is equated with the cost-
weighted current value of wealth. Here, the expected return increases with general survival—the Ben-
Porath effect—and is conditioned on the probability of getting infected. Demobilizing infections, for
which 𝜙𝜙 𝐼𝐼 << 1, then imply a drag on the returns to education and thus the accumulation of human
capital, a drag that increases with the probability of getting infected. Interestingly, however, an
offsetting tendency may exist. If the infection imposes severe financial strain on the infected, we may
                  𝑆𝑆
find 𝜆𝜆𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡+1 ≫ 𝜆𝜆𝑡𝑡+1 so that the threat of infection may actually provide a stimulus to educational
investments for precautionary reasons. A similar argument would hold if the infection risk itself were
contingent on income or education. Finally, we note that the presence of an infectious disease may
raise the cost of education, as would be the case whenever concerns about transmission through the
educational system reduce the supply of education (in case of full lockdown triggering an infinite
increase in the price). Especially in developing countries, adult morbidity or mortality may force
children to take up labor at the expense of education (cf. Gertler et al., 2004; Case and Ardington,
2006). This is tantamount to an increase in the opportunity cost of education, 𝜅𝜅𝑡𝑡 , paired with a negative
income effect, implying an increase in 𝜆𝜆𝑡𝑡𝑆𝑆 .

For an individual who is already infected at the point of taking up education, the first-order condition
reads

                    𝜌𝜌(1 − 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡 )(1 − 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡𝐼𝐼 )[(1 − 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡+1 )𝜙𝜙 𝐼𝐼 𝑤𝑤𝑡𝑡+1 𝜆𝜆𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡+1 + 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡+1 𝑤𝑤𝑡𝑡+1 𝜆𝜆𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡+1 ]𝜃𝜃 𝐼𝐼 𝑓𝑓 ′ − 𝜆𝜆𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 = 0,

implying that the return to education and thus the incentive may be reduced directly if morbidity
lowers the effectiveness of education, 𝜃𝜃 𝐼𝐼 < 1. We also note, however, that the mortality risk from the
infectious disease is now reducing the returns to education, an issue that has been shown to be
particularly relevant in the context of HIV (Bell et al., 2006; Fortson, 2011). As before, infections that
curb individual productivity tend to reduce the incentive to invest in human capital, an effect that tends
to be more pronounced the lower is the expectation of recovery. 14

Finally, we note that in a more general model that includes fertility choices, the quality–quantity
tradeoff implies that the constraint on educational investments that infections impose may decelerate

14
   To the extent that educational investments not only raise human capital in the next period, ℎ𝑡𝑡+1 , but also in periods further
into the future, the returns to education for the infected enter the first-order condition of susceptible individuals as higher-
order returns contingent on the risk of infection.
                                                                      16
or even stall fertility reductions (cf. Aksan and Chakraborty, 2014 for a theoretical account and
application to Sub-Saharan Africa; Bleakley and Lange, 2009 for supportive evidence in the case of
malaria; and Young, 2007; Boucekkine et al., 2009; Fortson, 2009; and Juhn et al., 2013 for mixed
evidence in the case of HIV/AIDS).

          4.3.2 Health
In a similar vein, the threat of infections may bear on individuals’ behavior toward their general health
and survival. Thus, assume that at time 𝑡𝑡 individuals can invest an amount 𝑚𝑚𝑡𝑡 to lower their mortality
𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡+1 = 𝑔𝑔(𝑚𝑚𝑡𝑡 ) with 𝑔𝑔′ < 0. The first-order condition for a healthy susceptible individual is given by

                                                        𝐼𝐼                       𝑆𝑆
                                        𝜌𝜌�𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡 𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡+1 + (1 − 𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡 𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 )𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡+1 �𝑔𝑔′ − 𝜆𝜆𝑡𝑡𝑆𝑆 = 0,

                      𝐼𝐼                       𝑆𝑆
where 𝜌𝜌�𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡 𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡+1 + (1 − 𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡 𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 )𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡+1 � corresponds to the expected utility stream over the remaining
                                                     𝐼𝐼       𝑆𝑆
life cycle. Continuing to assume that 𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡+1             < 𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡+1 , high infection risk from the infectious disease lowers
the value of survival and thus the incentives to invest in general health. This is a particular problem in
the case of an endemic disease, such as HIV or malaria, because it stifles incentives to invest in health
(cf. Oster, 2012a) with further repercussions on productivity and economic outcomes (cf. Bloom and
Sachs, 1998; Bloom et al., 2019b, 2020c). Rossi and Vilar (2020) show that public anti-malaria
interventions are an important lever to trigger private health investments.

For an infected individual, the first-order condition reads

                                                             𝑅𝑅                  𝐼𝐼 ]𝑔𝑔′
                                     𝜌𝜌(1 − 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡𝐼𝐼 )[𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡+1 + (1 − 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 )𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡+1     − 𝜆𝜆𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 = 0,

where high mortality from the infectious disease and poor prospects of recovery tend to lower the
value of general survival and thus the incentives to invest in general health. Again, this is a particular
problem in the case of an endemic disease, such as HIV or malaria.

We conclude by drawing attention to the important role of complementarities in this context. In
particular, we have shown that both the return to educational investments and the return to
investments in general health tend to decline with (i) the risk of acquiring an infectious disease and
with (ii) the morbidity and (iii) mortality associated with this disease. Conversely, recall from the
previous subsection that both general health, that is, a lower 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡 , and human capital, ℎ𝑡𝑡+1 , tend to raise
the stakes of infection and the value of lowering the morbidity and mortality associated with the
infection and improving the recovery. Overall, this implies that efforts aimed at preventing and treating
the infectious disease are complementary to investments in education and general health, suggesting
the scope for virtuous and vicious cycles depending on socioeconomic status within economies and on
the state of economic development across economies (cf. Lagerlöf, 2003; Chakraborty et al., 2010,
2016; Azomahou et al., 2016).

     5. Macroeconomic repercussions of epidemiological dynamics and
        behavioral responses
The production side of the economy is represented by a production function according to which the
inputs aggregate physical capital, 𝐾𝐾𝑡𝑡 , and aggregate human capital, 𝐻𝐻𝑡𝑡 , combine to produce aggregate
output 𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡 (or the GDP of a country): 15

                                                            𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡 = 𝐹𝐹(𝐾𝐾𝑡𝑡 , 𝐻𝐻𝑡𝑡 ).

15
   For Malthusian economies, explicit consideration may also be given to land as a fixed factor of production. For an analysis
in the context of the Black Death see, for example, Jedwab et al. (2020a).
                                                                 17
Aggregate human capital is the product of aggregate labor supply, 𝐿𝐿𝑡𝑡 ; average human capital, ℎ𝑡𝑡 ; and
average disease-specific productivity, 𝜙𝜙𝑡𝑡 , such that 𝐻𝐻𝑡𝑡 = ℎ𝑡𝑡 𝜙𝜙𝑡𝑡 𝐿𝐿𝑡𝑡 . Average human capital, in turn, is
determined by the quantity and quality of schooling when young and by work experience. In more
elaborate models, a breakdown of the population to age cohorts can be made to the extent that older
persons might have more experience but might have received less schooling in the past (cf. Bloom et
al., 2020b). Assuming a closed economy implies that aggregate output equals aggregate income.
Aggregate output/income, in turn, can be consumed or saved such that aggregate capital accumulation
is given by

                                            𝐾𝐾𝑡𝑡+1 = 𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡 − 𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡 − 𝐺𝐺𝑡𝑡 + (1 − 𝛿𝛿)𝐾𝐾𝑡𝑡 ,

where 𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡 is aggregate private consumption; 𝐺𝐺𝑡𝑡 is aggregate private or public resource use for
education or health; and 𝛿𝛿 is the rate of depreciation of physical capital. The following subsections
describe the main macroeconomic effects of the disease and efforts to prevent infections.

           5.1 Human capital and output
By causing morbidity and mortality and thus a reduction in the labor force, any epidemic will have a
direct impact on human capital, which, as we will outline, may be accompanied by possibly even larger
indirect effects through behavioral adjustments in labor supply and education.

(i) Disease-specific morbidity and mortality reduce human capital and thereby output directly in the
short run and, in the case of mortality or scarring, also in the long run. The extent to which human
capital is reduced very much depends on the particular age pattern of the epidemic in terms of
incidence, morbidity, and mortality (cf. Bloom et al., 2020b in the context of noncommunicable
diseases). Compare, for instance, the impact of COVID-19 and that of HIV. In terms of severe morbidity
and mortality, COVID-19 tends to be more concentrated among older adults and thus does not trigger
a large direct loss in labor supply. 16 HIV/AIDS is different, mainly because heterosexual sex is its
dominant transmission mechanism, which means it mainly affects young or prime-age workers. Note,
however, that considerable variation may occur across countries, where, in the case of COVID-19, the
prevalence of severe cases tends to stretch to much younger age groups in some countries (cf. Dowd
et al., 2020; Kass et al., 2020 point out that obesity may increase the incidence of severe cases among
younger ages in the United States). (ii) Additional short-run reductions in labor supply may arise
indirectly from the voluntary or mandated restrictions aimed to curb infection risk in the workplace,
which tends to be the prime mechanism in the case of COVID-19. (iii) Long-run reductions in human
capital arise if the epidemic stifles the incentives to invest in human capital.

           5.2 Private consumption
Here, the following channels matter. (i) Aggregate consumption tends to be reduced directly through
mortality and possibly through morbidity. The extent to which this is true tends to depend on the age
pattern of the epidemic, in particular, of mortality in combination with the age structure of
consumption (Kuhn and Prettner, 2018). (ii) Voluntary or mandatory restraints on consumption to
avoid infections lead to an indirect reduction in consumption. (iii) Foregone consumption (due to illness
or voluntary restraint) translates into additional savings, and, perhaps more importantly, individuals
are induced to engage in precautionary saving due to uncertainty. While an increase in savings may
enhance long-run economic growth, the implied short-run shortfall of demand may, in the presence
of rigidities, create severe unemployment (Guerrieri et al., 2020). (iv) The extent to which short-run

16 Bloom et al. (2020e) assess the often unmeasured and disregarded economic contributions of older adults, such as care for
their grandchildren.
                                                            18
earnings losses (due to illness or shutdown) translate into reductions in consumption strongly depends
on whether or not individuals have access to government insurance programs and transfers and to the
capital market. (v) Expenditure is reallocated away from consumption to expenditures aimed to
prevent or treat the disease. Such reallocation may occur directly in the case of private out-of-pocket
payments for prevention or treatment or publicly in the case of tax-financed public prevention or
treatment programs and indirectly as increases in health-insurance premia. Again, the extent to which
private payments tend to curb consumption is prone to vary with the coverage of public health care,
with the individual’s income, and with access to the credit market. In regard to increases in public
expenditure, the impact through the commensurate tax increases may well be delayed. In particular,
for shock-like epidemics, such as COVID-19, much of the current expenditure flowing into testing-and-
tracking measures and the development of treatments and vaccines is prone to be financed through
debt, which would be repaid only later.

         5.3 Expenditure on health, education, and infrastructure
A priori, one would expect a strong increase in expenditure targeted to preventing and treating the
disease. The extent to which these activities curb savings and capital investments is not initially clear.
While current prevention and treatment costs can be understood as a form of consumption, the extent
to which this lowers savings depends on the exent to which treatment costs are financed out of other
private consumption or other expenditures (e.g., for infrastructure or education). Regarding the
expenditures for developing future treatments or vaccines, they may be considered research and
development (R&D) activities, which may well lead to the development of profitable new goods
despite lowering the accumulation of capital. Here, a more thorough analysis would call for a
multisector growth model, as is considered, for example, in Jones (2016), Kuhn and Prettner (2016), or
Frankovic and Kuhn (2018). Further impacts to the structure of public expenditure may arise if
epidemics in which mortality is concentrated among particular age groups change the age structure of
the population, which then requires readjustments of the transfer system.

As a result of the relative changes previously described (which depend on the disease under
consideration, on the country that is modeled, etc.), goods and factor prices are likely to change. For
example, a disease that strongly reduces the working-age population implies rising wages in the long
run (such as in the case of the Black Death; see also Jedwab et al., 2020a). As another example, the
supply chain disruptions that lockdowns and social distancing cause will put upward pressure on
consumer prices, whereas the reduction in consumption due to these measures will work in the
opposite direction. The total effect then depends on the relative strength of these effects, which, in
turn, depends on the items under consideration. 17

         5.4 Key economic pathways
The effects of epidemics feeding through multiple macroeconomic transmission channels makes
drawing general conclusions difficult. Table 1 summarizes some of the key pathways as linked to
certain properties of an infectious disease and provides examples of diseases for which these pathways
are particularly prominent.

                malaria


Broadly, we may categorize diseases according to their macroeconomic impact as follows: (i) Diseases
that lead to a direct large-scale loss of labor, as they affect prime-age workers (rather than older adults
or children). The impact increases with the extent of mortality and morbidity and, in the latter case, is
exacerbated to the extent that recovery is impossible, for example, due to scarring. This implies a
short- to mid-term supply-side shock to labor, leading to a short-term recession and mid-term
adjustment issues due to an excessive capital intensity. (ii) Diseases that are transmitted through
nonspecific social interaction in the workplace or during leisure (including most airborne pathogens
and smear infection) have the potential to trigger precautionary reductions in consumption and labor
supply and thus stronger short-run recessions unless other means for protection exist. Significant
short-run reductions in labor supply and consumption are also the consequence of uncertainty, as
associated with new diseases or incoherent policy responses (Baker et al., 2020). 18 (iii) Endemic
diseases with high infection risk over the life cycle, high morbidity and mortality, and poor chances of
recovery tend to reduce the return to human capital and thereby stifle its accumulation. This will
compromise long-run growth and development. (iv) Diseases that affect children tend to reduce the
productivity of human capital accumulation and thus, again, stifle its accumulation. In addition, if these
diseases lead to scarring, they may also directly trigger long-run productivity loss.

Finally, (v) various long-run structural effects are conceivable. These tend to differ by the stage of
economic development. For rich and advanced economies, the emergence of new pandemic diseases
and their possible transition into an endemic stage may trigger strong technological or sectoral
responses. 19 Here, the potential to face large, frequent, or unpredictable losses to labor induces firms
to substitute capital for labor in the production process and thus may emerge as a driver of automation
(Prettner and Bloom, 2020). Both workers and firms have incentives to rely on technologies that enable
social distancing by working from home. Sectors that rely on social interaction either because it is
inherent or for reasons of economies of scale (e.g., culture, entertainment, hospitality, sports, tourism)


18
   Specifically, Baker et al. (2020) show that about 50% of the output loss in the course of the COVID-19 epidemic may be due
to uncertainty.
19 The impulse for such changes is equally present within developing economies. However, due to their different sectoral

structure and/or limitations in the resources to drive technological and organizational changes, they are likely to be followers.
However, developing countries may be particularly vulnerable to sectoral changes, such as reshoring or reductions in tourism
that originate in rich countries.
                                                              20
may face significant within-sector transformation (development of online culture, sports,
entertainment) or shrinkage. Barrero et al. (2020) study such reallocations in the context of COVID-19.
Large-scale epidemics may also turn out to be a driver of institutional change, for example, the
construction of surveillance and early-warning systems or tracing and tracking and treatment facilities.
In turn, the experience of an epidemic and the perceived success or failure of public policy responses
are prone to shape the level of trust within societies and toward its institutions, governments, and
experts (cf. Aksoy et al., 2020a, b; Brück et al., 2020, in the context of COVID-19). Finally, pandemics
may give rise to deglobalization and/or reshoring, especially from the perspective of advanced
economies with their extensive reliance on global supply chains. In contrast, from the perspective of
poorer countries, infectious diseases pose a risk of stalling or even reversing economic development.
As we have argued before, this is particularly true when diseases become endemic and when
complementarities stifle investments into both education and health, possibly accompanied by a
stalling fertility decline. 20

         5.5 Distributional impacts
We highlighted earlier that heterogeneity both within societies and across societies is prone to shape
the susceptibility to infectious diseases, the behavioral responses, and the outcomes. While such
heterogeneity is reflected in the empirical studies of individual behaviors toward epidemics (discussed
earlier), systematic economic research on how epidemics affect distribution within a society is
suprisingly scarce.

For epidemics such as the Spanish Flu that yield a large negative effect on labor supply, one would
expect at least a temporary increase in wages and reduction in the interest rate. While some historical
evidence exists for both (cf. Garrett, 2009; Karlsson et al., 2014; Jordà et al., 2020), these authors have
mostly avoided drawing inferences on the distributional implications. Boucekkine and Lafargue (2010)
simulate the evolution of the income distribution within an overlapping generations economy that is
subject to epidemic shocks to adult lives. Endogenizing the acquisition of human capital, they find that
the presence of (recurring) epidemics may lead to an increase in the population share of the unskilled
if orphans have poor access to education.

 More extant literature describes how vulnerability to various infectious diseases is shaped by the
income distribution and by poverty. While poverty and socioeconomic deprivation clearly raise
vulnerability to several epidemics such as tuberculosis (cf. Duarte et al., 2018 for a survey) and malaria
(e.g., Teklehaimanot and Mejia, 2008), the link is more complex for HIV/AIDS (e.g., Fox, 2012), where
across Sub-Saharan African countries wealthier (poorer) individuals experienced higher infection rates
in poor (wealthier) economies and where inequality itself was a driver of overall infection rates. On
the premise that vulnerability to epidemics is related to poorer expected economic outcomes, this
literature suggests the distributional consequences but again does not study them. A considerable
amount of recent evidence has emerged for the link between poverty and deprivation and COVID-19.
While the analyses by Jung et al. (2020) and Tubadji et al. (2020) suggest higher vulnerability in
deprived areas in the United States and the United Kingdom, Palomino et al. (2020) and Galasso (2020)
find that the disadvantaged are hit harder by lockdown measures and face poorer labor market
outcomes. Considering survey data from six countries, Dang et al. (2020) also find evidence for the loss
of labor income and reductions in saving among lower income strata. We conclude by noting that the
underlying distributional impacts of epidemics—whether real or perceived—have the scope to



20
  Epidemic or endemic diseases can also be conceived as drivers of migration. While Beach et al. (2020) discuss migration in
the context of the 1918 influenza pandemic, this appears less evident in the context of more modern epidemics, although
arguably wherever infectious diseases stall economic development they contribute to migration incentives.
                                                            21
undermine social cohesion. This is in particular true when it comes to the apportionment of “guilt” and
“blame” (scapegoating) in a crisis environment (cf. Jedwab et al., 2020b for a survey).

    6. Policies and their effects on disease dynamics and economic
       outcomes
Reflecting the wide differences among infectious diseases in mode and risk of transmission,
contagiousness, morbidity, mortality, duration, medical preventability, and treatability, policy
approaches aimed at containing or even eradicating infectious diseases and mitigating their economic
consequences tend to differ widely. In the following, we concentrate on highlighting a few exemplary
approaches, touching on different aspects and stages of epidemics. Specifically, we consider policies
aimed at (i) containing and controlling an epidemic through lockdown (of consumption and labor
supply) and testing; (ii) the equitable provision of treatment; (iii) the prevention or eradication of the
disease; (iv) the need for global policymaking in relation, for example, to the timely reporting of
outbreaks and coordinated containment; and (v) macroeconomic stabilization in case of epidemic-
induced recessions.

        6.1 Lockdown and testing
Lockdown and testing policies have been at the forefront of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic,
but strikingly have received relatively little attention before. Eichenbaum et al. (2020a) model
lockdown policies as a tax on consumption in the budget constraint. In our case this would amount to

                           𝑘𝑘𝑡𝑡−1 − 𝑘𝑘𝑡𝑡 = 𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡 𝑘𝑘𝑡𝑡 + 𝜙𝜙 𝑖𝑖 ℎ𝑡𝑡 𝑤𝑤𝑡𝑡 𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑡 − (1 + 𝜏𝜏𝑡𝑡 )𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡 − 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 𝑣𝑣𝑡𝑡 + 𝜏𝜏̅𝑡𝑡 ,
where the tax rate 𝜏𝜏𝑡𝑡 is set to yield a desired reduction in consumption activities, and where 𝜏𝜏̅𝑡𝑡
represents a lump-sum redistribution of the “tax proceeds.” Given that Eichenbaum et al. (2020a) do
not allow for the accumulation of assets, that is, 𝑘𝑘𝑡𝑡−1 − 𝑘𝑘𝑡𝑡 ≡ 0, a forced reduction in consumption
necessarily implies a forced reduction in labor supply, 𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑡 . They find that even if individuals engage in
private prevention by cutting labor supply and consumption, lockdown measures, that is, increases in
𝜏𝜏𝑡𝑡 above zero, tend to raise welfare by greatly curtailing the death toll even if they magnify the
economic recession.

Collard et al. (2020) analyze the optimal timing of the intensity of lockdown. They find that optimal
containment provides for relatively rigorous lockdown early on, which should subsequently be
gradually relaxed with the progression toward herd immunity. They note, however, that measures
should remain in place to counter excessive incentives on the part of individuals to rush back into
activity. Notably, they find that the timing pattern very much hinges on whether or not the disease is
associated with the risk of mortality peaks due to hospital congestion. If these are not present, the
implementation of lockdown will be more gradual and less rigorous, as individual incentives for self-
protection are strong enough or even excessive due to their failure to account for the external benefits
from contributing to herd immunity. However, this result is overturned if individual failure to account
for contributing to the risk of hospital congestion calls for strong and early lockdown. The analyses by
Eichenbaum et al. (2020a) and Brotherhood et al. (2020) mirror these patterns.

Pointing out the lack of observability of infection with COVID-19, Eichenbaum et al. (2020b) consider
a setting in which individual prevention efforts depend on their state of information. Assuming that a
certain fraction of the population is (routinely) tested and thus fully informed about its infection status,
they show that testing without quarantining identified infected individuals may, effectively, worsen
outcomes, as in the absence of altruism those who are informed about an infection drop precautionary
reductions in their activity. Combined with quarantining, a testing strategy yields considerable welfare


                                                               22
gains, however. Bloom and Glied (1991) point out similar welfare issues about testing in the context
of HIV/AIDS.

Brotherhood et al. (2020) consider a similar setup, which, like Eichenbaum et al. (2020b), features
young and old individuals, differentiated disease states—mild/feverish, which could also be flu, and
severe/hospitalized—and altruism on the part of the infected. They show that testing triggers
additional preventive effort on the part of altruists who are revealed to be infected and is, indeed, a
prerequisite for targeted quarantine. 21 They also show that testing should be targeted at the young,
who, in the expectation of a mild course of disease, tend to be more reckless in their behavior while
uninformed, whereas quarantine measures should be targeted at the old. Acemoglu et al. (2020)
broadly confirm these findings within a social planner context. Outcomes can be improved further if
strict quarantine is to some extent replaced by measures that allow within-age-group mingling but not
across groups.

Glover et al. (2020) consider transfer payments to support individuals who are under lockdown to
amount to a costly redistribution. They show that optimal lockdown policies not only trade off the
future gains from a more favorable distribution of disease states against the instantaneous cost of
output, but also against the cost of redistributing income. The costs of transfers thus constrain
mitigation measures.

As a bottom line, while lockdown measures impose large macroeconomic costs to begin with, they are
typically warranted on welfare grounds. 22 The literature also tends to agree that they should be
introduced early to achieve maximum leverage in terms of controlling disease progression and, in the
absence of treatments or vaccinations, should subsequently be adjusted in a way that contains the
disease at “manageable” levels while at the same time containing the loss in output and consumption.
Here, sub-group-specific variations in the extent of quarantine tend to be much more effective and
thus conducive to containing the macroeconomic cost. They require the implementation of an
effective testing and tracking system. 23

          6.2 Treatment
Effective treatments accelerate recovery, in terms of our model an increase in 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 , or a reduction in
morbidity or mortality, that is, an increase in 𝜙𝜙𝑡𝑡𝐼𝐼 and a decrease in 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡𝐼𝐼 , respectively. Apart from the
immediate benefits to patients, treatments can have large macroeconomic value, especially for
diseases such as HIV that offer poor (or, indeed, no) prospects for natural recovery and that are
progressively debilitating and ultimately fatal. The macroeconomic gains to the development of
effective antiretroviral treatments for HIV have accrued through two channels: First, by restoring
productivity and curbing mortality, treatments have mitigated much of the loss in labor supply from
prime-age workers (e.g., Bor et al., 2012; Thirumurthy et al., 2012). Second, by raising the return to
human capital, the availability of treatments also fosters educational investments (Thirumurthy et al.,
2012). Similar arguments apply to the provision of treatments for malaria and other tropical diseases.



21 In contrast to Eichenbaum  et al. (2020a), Brotherhood et al. (2020) model age- and condition-specific quarantine by varying
a “preference” parameter for teleworking and home-based leisure activities. This is also the way they model altruism, which
thus has a “warm glow” nature rather than being based on the beneficiaries’ utility.
22 We have not touched here upon two additional important costs of extended lockdown related to (i) schools, which may

strongly inhibit the accumulation of human capital, and (ii) health care providers who are not essential for the treatment of
the infection, which may lead to rising mortality and productivity loss due to delayed diagnostics and treatment of other
conditions (Maringe et al., 2020).
23 Related analyses, leading to broadly similar results, include Alvarez et al. (2020), Bairoliya and Imrohoroglu (2020), Berger

et al. (2020), and Bethune and Korinek (2020). Caulkins et al. (2020) provide a rich analysis in which they show rather different
policies in respect to the timing of lockdown to yield similar outcomes.
                                                              23
The availability of treatments also bears on risk-taking behavior, as for example Chan et al. (2016) and
Greenwood et al. (2019) illustrate in the context of HIV. While changes in sexual practice in the context
of HIV would have little macroeconomic impact, the arrival of treatments for diseases such as COVID-
19 that spread easily through casual social interaction would have large effects on labor supply and
consumption. Eichenbaum et al. (2020a) show that even the prospect of a treatment could vastly
reduce social distancing and thus the economic recession that comes with it, albeit at an increase in
the loss to life before the treatment becomes available. 24

Providing treatments raises a policy challenge if budget or capacity constraints imply the treatments
are in insufficient supply, which is especially likely in the case of widespread and endemic diseases
such as HIV or malaria or in the case of new pandemics such as COVID-19 (e.g., Bloom et al., 2020f;
Emanuel et al., 2020). Anderson et al. (2012) study the nontrivial rationing problem that arises in a
setting in which a limited supply of treatments needs to be allocated among several subpopulations
who are subject to a susceptible–infected–susceptible (SIS) type of disease, such as malaria, where
recovered individuals turn susceptible again. They show that, counter to common policy practice,
minimizing the disease burden (= loss per infected × number of infected) requires that treatments be
concentrated on the subgroup(s) with the lowest share of infected individuals. The rationale behind
this seemingly counterintuitive allocation lies with the SIS dynamics, where treating a limited number
of infected protects a large number of healthy individuals from infection, which in turn bestows future
protection on those treated. Technically, this amounts to a (dynamic) nonconvexity of the allocation
problem, which is known to generate corner solutions. Bell and Gersbach (2009) come to a similar
conclusion in a model in which a budget-constrained policymaker can allocate funds to treatment and
educational subsidies in the face of an HIV epidemic. They find that targeting support to a limited
number of households is optimal when the objective is to enhance long-run growth perspectives. They
also show that if mortality is high, households should receive both treatments and educational
subsidies; this double support, however, reduces the number of recipients even further. While these
are stark conclusions, note that neither framework includes equality concerns in its objective.

         6.3 Prevention and eradication
In particular for diseases in which private prevention by way of behavioral constraint leads to possibly
large losses in economic output on top of individual utility losses, the introduction of effective vaccines
or other medical or nonmedical prophylaxis is a panacea when it comes to containing or even
eradicating an infectious disease. 25 Several issues arise in this context, however, which may require
further policy intervention.

First, whenever access to or utilization of vaccines or protective devices imposes a disutility or
monetary cost on the individual, underutilization typically occurs, as individuals do not internalize the
full benefits their immunity bestows on others. Chen and Toxvaerd (2014) summarize the conditions
for such an outcome and review the literature. Thus, appropriate subsidization of the price of
prevention, 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 , or even payments for uptake are required (see, e.g., Geoffard and Philipson, 1996,
1997; Gersovitz and Hammer, 2004, 2005; Gersovitz, 2011); alternatively, prevention measures may
need to be mandated at least for a part of the population. As outlined earlier, the problem becomes
particularly prominent if the prevalence of the disease is low: Geoffard and Philipson (1997) show that


24 Rowthorn and Toxvaerd (2020) study joint optimal prevention and treatment policies within a microeconomic SIS

framework where recovered individuals turn susceptible again. They find that multiple equilibria may arise but that a
decentralized allocation always tends toward too little prevention.
25 As another means of insuring against the welfare loss from pandemics, governments may stockpile antibiotics. Attema et

al. (2010) and Megiddo et al. (2019) study the option value of such policies based on calibrated models for the Netherlands
and the United Kingdom, respectively, and find that stockpiling is a preferred option if the risk of a serious outbreak is
sufficiently high.
                                                           24
as long as the full population cannot be covered, even compulsory vaccination programs may not be
sufficient for eradication. Another problem is that reductions in the infection rate that result from
introducing or improving preventive measures may be neutralized or even overturned through
increases in risky behaviors similar to the case in which treatments become available. Toxvaerd (2019)
shows that such disinhibition may not only boost disease prevalence, but also lead to a net reduction
in welfare following an improvement in the effectiveness of prevention.

Second, barriers to prevention may be particularly high within developing countries and relate to both
severe income and credit constraints and to a lack of information and education. Here, the
subsidization or free provision of protective goods, such as condoms against HIV/AIDS or bednets
against malaria and the provision of information on preventive measures have been shown to
overcome barriers to prevention by poor households (e.g., Cohen and Dupas, 2010; Ashraf et al., 2013).
Micro credits and insurance against income shocks have also been shown to play a role (Tarozzi et al.,
2014; Burke et al., 2015). Education, especially girls’ education, is considered to boost preventive
behavior, although evidence in the context of HIV/AIDs remains mixed (cf. Alsan and Cutler, 2013;
Behrman, 2015; Duflo et al., 2015). Finally, the empowerment of girls and women is considered to be
conducive to disease prevention (Bandiera et al., 2020).

Third, the development of new vaccines and medical treatments for hitherto unknown pathogens, or
for pathogens that become immune to current treatments, requires large upfront investments into
R&D. Due to the extensive testing required for safety and efficacy, the development of medicines is a
particularly lengthy process fraught with uncertainty. This implies that medical R&D absorbs large
quantities of resources and raises funding issues. In particular, if carried out by private companies, the
innovating firms will have to enjoy market power for them to secure the returns to their investments.
This gives rise to the well-known problem of an undersupply of prevention and the possible strategic
exclusion of poor consumers for the purpose of extracting profit (e.g., Kessing and Nuscheler, 2006;
Forslid and Herzing, 2015). An additional issue arises when it comes to the eradication of a disease.
Even if this is possible, private firms may be reluctant to provide the necessary supply for this, as they
would eliminate their own future market. Geoffard and Philipson (1997) argue that such a setting calls
for a deficit-financed eradication program, where future generations who benefit from the eradication
would be taxed in line with their benefits. 26 Similar to this, Kremer et al. (2020) are propagating
advance markets for new vaccines, where companies agree to sell at marginal cost but markup is
topped up by pre-committed donors.

Analysis of the macroeconomic implications of large-scale medical research into the prevention of
infectious diseases is scarce. What is known from the literature on medical and lifesaving innovations
in general is that although their development may curb economic growth, this typically enhances
welfare (Jones, 2016; Frankovic and Kuhn, 2018; Fonseca et al., 2020).

         6.4 Global issues
In the context of pandemics (e.g., the COVID-19 outbreak) or of cross-country dispersion of endemic
diseases (e.g., malaria or HIV), coordinated responses are essential for containment and eradication
(Laxminarayan, 2016). This applies in particular to the timely reporting of local outbreaks;
Laxminarayan et al. (2014) show empirically that reporting incentives depend on the circumstances:
for example, the availability of common pools of treatments or vaccines would encourage reporting
for the purpose of having early access, whereas their lack may discourage reporting for fear of trade

26Kremer and Snyder (2015, 2018) point out yet another distortion due to the (typical) presence of market power in the
pharmaceutical industry, which is that for many diseases the private returns to investments in treatments are likely to exceed
those from investments in prevention. They calculate that the deadweight loss from the provision of lucrative HIV treatments
rather than vaccines may amount up to 62% of the global gain from curing HIV (Kremer and Snyder, 2018).
                                                             25
sanctions (cf. Malani and Laxminarayan, 2011; Saak and Hennessy, 2018 for models of epidemiological
reporting games). Finally, initiatives toward the global eradication of infectious diseases lead to similar
free-riding incentives at the country level as they do at the individual level, the difference being that
countries are large players that can also enter negotiated agreements (e.g., Barrett, 2003). In this
context, an optimal policy for a rich country may entail the provision of financial aid to a poor country
in exchange for the poor country to shut down. This might be a particularly successful policy to prevent
a pandemic when the initial outbreak occurs in a poor country that has difficulties in coping with
shutdowns.

         6.5 Macroeconomic stabilization policies
To soften the short-run economic impact that is predominantly caused by behavioral and policy
reactions to the spread of an infectious disease and by rising uncertainty and supply chain disruptions,
macroeconomic stabilization policies can be useful. Expansionary fiscal 27 and monetary policies, which
have been applied on a large scale in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (see, for example,
International Monetary Fund, 2020), are widely agreed to have reduced its adverse macroeconomic
effects. However, in case of severe and fast-spreading epidemics, such as COVID-19, appropriate policy
responses are often difficult to enact. The reason is that such pandemics affect aggregate demand and
aggregate supply via different pathways within a rather short period of time. A priori what the relative
importance of these two dimensions are and whether deflationary or inflationary pressures will prevail
are unclear (cf. Balleer et al., 2020; Baqaee and Farhi, 2020; Brinca et al., 2020; Brodeur et al., 2020;
Guerrieri et al., 2020 for discussions). For example, if supply chain disruptions predominantly cause
the economic downturn (cf. Acemoglu and Tahbaz-Salehi, 2020), expansionary demand-side policies
might be ineffective in stabilizing employment and could cause inflationary pressures. If, by contrast,
uncertainty leads to a fall in investment and consumption, demand-side policies would be
comparatively effective. A similar ambiguity applies to many of the lockdown measures that bear down
on service markets, where again both demand and supply are affected.

Apart from these considerations, when COVID-19 broke out, many strongly affected countries faced
comparatively high debt burdens (such as Italy and Spain), which reduced the scope for fiscal policy
responses, and interest rates were comparatively low already, such that traditional expansionary
monetary policies ran against the zero lower bound constraint. Thus, other more unconventional
policies like massive amounts of quantitative easing and helicopter money have also been proposed
(see, e.g., Céspedes et al., 2020; Didier et al., 2020; Elenev et al., 2020 for discussions of such policies
and their effects).

At this point noting a potential conflict of objectives between expansionary economic policies that are
mainly aimed at increasing consumption and labor supply and health policies that actually aim to
reduce the interaction of people along the lines discussed previously is important. In this case the
optimal timing of policies is of crucial importance: opening up the economy too soon and providing
massive economic stimulus could actually increase the spread of infectious diseases as the experience
with COVID-19 in many countries at the time of writing (July 2020) plainly makes clear.

    7. Macroeconomic effects of and policies toward specific infectious
       diseases


27 Note that expansionary fiscal policies can come in many forms. While infrastructure investments are a typical example,

they require a long time period to be implemented and might come too late in case of a pandemic-driven recession. Other
measures such as wage subsidies, expansions of unemployment insurance, equity injections, and loan guarantees would work
more quickly (Céspedes et al., 2020; Didier et al., 2020; Elenev et al., 2020).
                                                           26
   We now provide an overview of selected major outbreaks of different diseases since World War II.
   Table 2 summarizes various diseases and outbreaks, the main affected world regions, the time period,
   and the number of infections and deaths as estimated by various sources.

   The late 20th and early 21st centuries have seen various infectious disease epidemics and pandemics.
   Many remain ongoing, such as HIV/AIDS, which had claimed 32 million lives by the end of 2018
   according to UNAIDS (2019); malaria, which caused about 400,000 deaths worldwide in 2018 according
   to the World Health Organization (2019a); and tuberculosis, with 1.5 million deaths in 2018 according
   to World Health Organization (2019b). For comparison, the all-cause mortality in 2017 was close to 56
   million deaths according to the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (2018). While HIV/AIDS and
   tuberculosis can be found worldwide, these diseases are endemic mostly in poor countries. The
   economic consequences of these diseases are substantial and discussed further in later sections, but
   fortunately, progress against HIV/AIDS and malaria has occurred over the last two decades. This cannot
   be said, however, for dengue fever, which apart from the emergence of new diseases (e.g., Ebola,
   SARS, MERS, Zika, COVID-19) is on the rise (cf. Bloom et al., 2018; Bloom and Cadarette, 2019). In the
   case of some diseases, the prospect of re-emergence exists should containment efforts be relaxed,
   which is particularly true for poliomyelitis. Unfortunately, in this context, efforts to rein in COVID-19
   through social distancing and lockdowns might lead to reductions in vaccination against other diseases,
   which could foster their re-emergence. This could be, for example, because visits to health centers for
   vaccination are reduced and resources otherwise used for vaccination against these diseases dry up
   (cf. Hogan et al., 2020). 28

     COVID-19 has interrupted many routine immunization programs. For example, WHO, UNICEF, and Gavi have reported that
   the pandemic is forcing 80 million children to at least temporarily forego vaccine protection against one or more disease-
   causing pathogens. This corresponds to roughly 60% of the world’s annual birth cohort. Such disruption threatens to elevate
   rates of vaccine-preventable diseases and their physical, mental, and cognitive health sequalae across the life cycle and to
   deprive individuals, families, and societies of the full health, economic, and social benefits of vaccines, which are often
   considerably larger than the narrow benefits of avoiding infection by the target pathogen and related medical care costs (see
   Bloom, Fan, and Sevilla (2018).

   Notes: We include those diseases from Table 1 for which the World Health Organization (2016) provides data on DALYs, YLLs,
   and YLDs. YLL measures the mortality impact of a disease and YLD the morbidity impact. By definition, the relation
   DALY=YLL+YLD holds. The economic impact of the diseases is calculated based on the rule of thumb suggested by the World
   Health Organization (2011) that the economic burden of one DALY is equivalent to between one and three years of lost per
   capita income. For the calculations we used global averages because for some countries the data for specific diseases are
   missing in the World Health Organization (2016) dataset. Per capita income in the year 2016 is taken from the World Bank
   (2020) and refers to purchasing power adjusted ID with a base year of 2017.



   In the following subsections, we discuss the economic consequences of HIV/AIDS, malaria,
   tuberculosis, influenza, and COVID-19 in more detail. The discussion is based on the pertinent
   economic literature on the economic consequences of these diseases.

   7.1 HIV/AIDS
   Having first emerged during the 1980s as a sexually transmitted disease affecting in particular sexually
   promiscuous communities in industrialized countries, HIV/AIDS quickly spread worldwide and
   subsequently turned into an endemic disease in Sub-Saharan Africa, where it continues to impose a
   large burden on welfare and economic development. Economic research on HIV/AIDS has covered
   many areas, including prevention incentives and labor supply effects (some of this quoted elsewhere
   in this paper). Here, we focus on a selection of macroeconomic-oriented works studying the two key
   pathways for HIV/AIDs (cf. Table 1), namely the reduction in labor supply and the consequences of
   high mortality (during its early stages) on human capital investments and fertility.

   Young (2005) estimates a Beckerian child quality–quantity tradeoff model relying on South African data
   and uses the resulting parameter estimates to simulate the effects of HIV on per capita GDP. In his
   framework, HIV reduces fertility to such an extent that the corresponding increase in human capital
   accumulation due to fertility reduction overcompensates the HIV-induced reduction in human capital
   of orphaned children. Based on these results, Young (2005) concludes that the overall effect of the HIV
   epidemic on South Africans who do not suffer from the illness is actually positive. In contrast to these
   results, Over (1992), Cuddington (1993), Corrigan et al. (2005), and Bell et al. (2006, 2007) calculate a
   comparatively large negative effect of HIV on the long-run level of per capita GDP, but in models based
   on exogenous fertility. Exogenous fertility switches off the main channel that Young (2005) considers
   in his analysis.

                                                              29
While Young (2007) corroborates his earlier results that HIV reduces fertility and thereby fosters
development, Fortson (2009) finds the negative effect of HIV/AIDS on fertility to be lower than shown
by Young (2005). In addition, Juhn et al. (2013) show that the epidemic has no effect on the fertility of
noninfected women (an important channel for the results of Young, 2005 to emerge), and Kalemli-
Ozcan and Turan (2011) and Kalemli-Ozcan (2012) even find a positive effect of HIV on fertility. In a
similar vein, Fortson (2011) estimates that the effect of HIV on human capital accumulation tends to
be more severe than Young (2005) shows because of the Ben-Porath mechanism that higher life
expectancy induces investments in education (Ben-Porath, 1967; Cervellati and Sunde, 2013), which
Young (2005) disregards in his analysis.

Azomahou et al. (2016) and Gori et al. (2020) build on these insights and construct models of the
impact of HIV on economic growth that are more in line with the empirical findings and that feature a
richer set of mechanisms than the one Young (2005) addresses. Allowing for an effect of the Ben-
Porath mechanism on human capital accumulation and endogenizing the saving choice of individuals,
Azomahou et al. (2016) find that HIV does not have a large short-run effect (which is consistent with
the empirical findings of Bloom and Mahal, 1997 and Mahal, 2004), but that the adverse long-run
growth effects can be sizeable and reduce per capita GDP by about 3%.

To summarize, while relevant mechanisms could lead to a positive economic impact of HIV/AIDS, as
suggested by Young (2005, 2007), these effects are empirically rather weak and likely to be dwarfed
by adverse economic effects that Young (2005, 2007) does not consider in his analysis.

7.2 Malaria
Malaria is another disease with a strong impact on labor supply through both mortality and morbidity,
but, to the extent that children become infected, also through reductions in the productivity of
education (cf. Table 1). To estimate the economic impact of malaria, Gallup and Sachs (2001) regress
the average growth rate of 75 countries between 1965 and 1990 on an initial malaria index and control
variables. According to their results, a 10% reduction in the malaria index predicts a sustained annual
increase in economic growth of 0.3 percentage points per year. Extrapolating beyond the variation in
their sample, Gallup and Sachs (2001) calculate that malaria eradication would imply a rise in per capita
income growth of 2.6 percentage points on average. More recent contributions confirm a positive
economic effect of malaria eradication, but conclude it is quantitatively much smaller (Lucas, 2010;
Berthélemy and Thuilliez, 2015).

Bleakley (2010) relies on malaria-eradication programs in Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, and the United
States around 1955 to identify the causal impact of malaria exposure in childhood on adult labor
productivity. He finds that disease eradication in the worst-hit Latin American countries boosts
incomes by 25%, while the figure for the United States (with a lower malaria exposure) was 12%. While
Bleakley (2010) finds mixed results on the effect of malaria eradication on years of schooling, he finds
a positive effect on literacy. Lucas (2010) corroborates this result, also finding a positive effect on
literacy and on years of schooling based on data from the malaria eradication campaigns in Paraguay
and Sri Lanka.

For a discussion of optimal malaria treatment strategies and how they change in the presence of
increasing resistance to drugs and with a change in the time horizon, see Laxminarayan (2004). Smith
et al. (2013) elaborate on the benefits of malaria eradication for countries when other countries do
not follow such a strategy and show that disease eradication can nevertheless be successful and
lasting. For the problems that require using the COI approach to estimate the burden of malaria see
Chima et al. (2003).

7.3 Tuberculosis
                                                   30
Given its large disease burden, as measured in DALYs, and resulting economic burden, which of the
diseases considered in Table 3 is second only to HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis has received surprisingly little
attention from economic analysis. While being associated with high levels of debilitating morbidity,
95% of DALYs lost result from premature loss in life years (see also Laxminarayan et al. 2007 on this
point). Thus, the channels through which tuberculosis affects the economy are similar to those for
HIV/AIDS, namely a loss in labor supply and a reduction in the return to human capital (cf. Table 1).

Employing a combined VSL and full income approach, Laxminarayan et al. (2007) evaluate the
economic burden for the 10-year period 2006–2015 for 22 high (disease) burden countries in which
tuberculosis is endemic. They find it to range between 2006 USD 3.33 billion in Zimbabwe to 1,175
billion in China. Strikingly, they also find that although high-burden countries in Sub-Saharan Africa
account for one third of the fatalities, they only account for one tenth of the burden. Laxminarayan
(2007) also assess the economic benefit of extending novel multicomponent (DOTS) treatment
programs that include directly observed treatment and short-term chemotherapy and find that the
benefits exceed marginal costs by a factor of 15 across the 22 high-burden countries.

Verguet et al. (2015) apply extended cost-effectiveness analysis (ECEA) to assess the impact of
universal public finance of tuberculosis treatments in India that is aimed at increasing uptake while at
the same time insuring households against catastrophic expenditure. ECEA incorporates the benefits
of financial protection into conventional cost-effectiveness analysis of medical treatments. The
authors find that health gains and insurance value accrue primarily to the poor, suggesting that
universal public finance may play a redistributive role. Verguet et al. (2017) use a simulation model to
assess the impact on the incidence of catastrophic costs for households of expanding aggressive
treatment strategies against tuberculosis in India and South Africa and facilitating access to treatments
through intensified case finding in South Africa. They find that more aggressive treatments would
reduce the incidence of catastrophic costs by 6–19%, predominantly benefiting the poor, whereas
more intensive case finding would lower catastrophic costs by 5–20% but only after a period of 5–10
years.

7.4 Influenza
That seasonal outbreaks of influenza have become a part of everyday life in many parts of the world
obscures both the human and economic toll of “the flu,” which is rising annually even in the absence
of deadly pandemic outbreaks such as the one in 1918 (see also Beach et al., 2020). As a
“commonplace” disease, the pathways are somewhat diluted, although major outbreaks are likely to
trigger strong behavioral and policy-induced reductions in labor supply and consumption (cf. Table 1).

Smith et al. (2009) study various scenarios of a (hypothetical) influenza pandemic and its impact on
the year 2004 U.K. economy. They identify annual losses ranging between 0.5% and 4.3% of GDP
depending on the assumptions about fatality. They find that losses fall to between 0.13% and 2.3% for
a prepandemic vaccine and to between 0.3% and 4.3% for a matched vaccine (single dosage). In a
related analysis, Keogh-Brown et al. (2010b) study the economic impact on the United Kingdom of an
influenza outbreak similar to the 1957 or 1968 one and find a relatively moderate GDP loss of 3.35%
during the first quarter of the outbreak and 0.58% during its first year. These figures increase to 9.5%
and 2.5% once behavioral reductions in consumption are accounted for. A more severe outbreak with
1% mortality would then lead to GDP losses of 29.5% and 6%, respectively. Keogh-Brown et al. (2010a)
and Smith et al. (2011) extend these analyses to cover pandemics across European economies and the
global economy and come to results within a similar order of magnitude.

Ward (2014) studies the value of an expanded influenza vaccination program against a U.S.
background. She finds considerable gains in terms of medical cost savings and avoided earnings losses
albeit subject to decreasing returns as coverage extends to nontarget groups. She also identifies strong
                                                   31
external benefits. Hollingsworth et al. (2011) study optimal mitigation strategies for an influenza
pandemic akin to the 1918 one. Given inherent tradeoffs between different policy targets, they
highlight a need for prespecifying policy priorities.

7.5 COVID-19
In the absence of complete and reliable evidence, much of the analysis on the economic burden of
COVID-19 remains somewhat tentative. Referring to recent modeling and evidence throughout all
parts of this paper, we focus here on a selection of studies that illustrate the scale of the issue.
Corresponding to the very strong behavioral and policy-induced reductions in consumption and labor
supply that are rooted in the fast spread of a new and dangerous pathogen (cf. Table 1), these studies
focus to large extent on the impact of lockdown measures.

Eichenbaum et al. (2020a) merge an SIR model with a simple general equilibrium macroeconomic
model sharing many of the features of the model proposed in Sections 4.1 and 4.2. Consumption goods
are produced with labor only, and both production and consumption entail the risk of infection.
Individuals fail to internalize that their own decisions to reduce their individual infection risk also
reduces the infection risk of others, which justifies governmental interventions to create a stronger
economic downturn. The model does not feature other preventive activities or individual
heterogeneities.

Eichenbaum et al. (2020a) show that their baseline SIR model of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United
States, without behavioral reactions and economic feedbacks, leads to 215 million persons being
eventually infected and 2.2 million eventually dying. In and of itself, this leads to a relatively mild
recession with aggregate consumption dropping by 2% from peak to trough. Behavioral reactions of
individuals and the corresponding general equilibrium feedback mechanisms lead to a more severe
recession, with the aggregate consumption drop being more than 9% from peak to trough but with
fewer people becoming infected and the death toll falling from 2.2 million to 1.74 million. Causal
econometric evidence from Korea corroborates these simulation results, where Aum et al. (2020) show
that even in the absence of lockdown policies, labor supply drops by 2% to 3% in response to COVID-
19 outbreaks.

Krueger et al. (2020) extend the model of Eichenbaum et al. (2020a) to allow for heterogeneity in
consumption goods and in labor supply. Some goods can be consumed at home without the need to
interact with others and thereby without the risk of infection (cf. Leibovici et al., 2020). By the same
token, some types of work can be done in a home office (cf. Dingel and Neiman, 2020). Krueger et al.
(2020) show that this reasonable extension changes the outcomes drastically in the sense that—as
compared with the model without heterogeneity— 80% of the economic decline is mitigated, while,
at the same time, 80% of deaths are avoided without any governmental intervention. 29 When
addressing governmental containment measures, which they model in terms of taxes on consumption,
Eichenbaum et al. (2020a) find that the optimal policy is to raise the tax over time in line with the
infection rate. In their optimal scenario the tax rate rises from 2.3% in the first period to 47.3% in
period 40. This leads to a much deeper drop in aggregate consumption (by 21% instead of 9%), but
saves 600,000 lives in the long run.

In a similar structured model, involving, however, heterogeneity in age, uncertainty about disease
state, and the possibility of testing, Brotherhood et al. (2020) examine the implications of a rich set of
lockdown policies for the calibrated U.S. economy. They show that while voluntary reductions in social


29 The results depend on the assumed elasticity of substitution and on the size of an autonomous infection risk. The decline

in the losses to both economic performance and lives relative to a setting without substitution are nevertheless substantial
in all scenarios.
                                                            32
interactions halve mortality and lead to an average loss of GDP of 3% in the laissez-faire economy,
testing (all symptomatic individuals) and quarantining (positive cases) policies have the potential to
reduce mortality by an order of magnitude and recuperate a significant share of the GDP loss. While
these effects diminish for imperfect or incomplete testing, they prove to be welfare superior
throughout. Universal lockdown policies tend to trigger a substantive decline in GDP. Even a mild
lockdown shutting down 25% of activity for one month will lead to an additional loss of GDP by 2%
relative to the benchmark without saving a substantial number of lives. Strikingly, the cost of a life
saved stands at USD 116 million and thus about tenfold the conventional VSL figures (Viscusi and Aldy,
2003).30 In contrast, a very strict lockdown, shutting down 75% of activity for 35 weeks leads to a drop
in GDP of 46% relative to the benchmark but virtually eliminates all deaths. In this case, the cost of one
life saved stands at only USD 16 million and thus close to the VSL. 31 In line with other authors (e.g.,
Acemoglu et al., 2020), they find that lockdowns that are targeted at the old are helpful in lowering
the GDP loss per life saved.

As these studies are cast against the backdrop of rich, industrialized economies, Alon et al. (2020) and
Arellano et al. (2020) model a COVID-19 outbreak from the perspective of developing and emerging
economies. Alon et al. (2020) take explicit account of the fact that developing economies tend to have
younger populations, lower fiscal capacity, a larger informal sector, and a lower health care capacity.
Their simulation results show that uniform lockdowns are considerably less effective in developing
economies than they are in developed economies: they only save about half as many lives per unit of
GDP lost. Conversely, the effectiveness of lockdowns targeted at the elderly population are
considerably more effective. The finding that the tradeoff between livelihoods and lives lost underlying
these findings hinges on a country’s income level is supported by empirical evidence in Decerf et al.
(2020). Taking a perspective on lockdown in emerging economies, Arellano et al. (2020) show that the
risk of a debt crisis may seriously inhibit lockdown polices and conclude that relaxing the tradeoff
between health and debt crises makes a strong case for debt relief.

     8. Conclusions
We assess the effects of modern infectious disease epidemics and pandemics on macroeconomic
performance by (i) describing the role of health in driving economic growth and well-being; (ii)
discussing standard frameworks used to calculate the economic burden of diseases; (iii) sketching a
theoretical framework to analyze the tradeoffs and the macroeconomic repercussions in the case of
epidemics; (iv) discussing policy interventions; and (v) providing an overview of various infectious
diseases of the late 20th and early 21st centuries, their human toll, and their economic effects.

In general, the economic effects of epidemics depend to a great extent on heterogeneities in three
dimensions: (i) disease-specific heterogeneities in terms of mortality, morbidity, infectiousness, and
prospects for recovery. The economic impact through the loss of labor is particularly high in the case
of diseases that predominantly affect prime-age workers rather than older adults or children. The
impact is also exacerbated if recovery from a disease is not possible (as in the case of HIV/AIDS) and if
diseases are transmitted through nonspecific social interactions, which has the potential to trigger
larger reductions in consumption and labor supply and thus more severe short-run recessions.
Endemic diseases with high infection risk, high morbidity and mortality, and poor chances of recovery
tend to reduce the return to human capital and stifle its accumulation, which compromises long-run

   Hall et al. (2020) estimate that individuals would be willing to forego 41% of their yearly consumption on average to avert
death from COVID-19 if the average COVID-19 mortality rate stands at 0.81%.
31
   Ichino et al. (2020) consider the tradeoff between lives saved and loss in GDP for different lockdown policies in the case of
Italy. Somewhat in contrast to the findings by Brotherhood et al. (2020), they show that from some point further increases in
the strictness of the lockdown are no longer effective in saving lives and only lead to a further loss in GDP.
                                                              33
growth and development by sustaining poverty traps. (ii) Heterogeneities at the population level in
disease susceptibility, such as the population share of older adults who might be more susceptible to
or be more severely affected by a disease. This has repercussions on infection dynamics and on the
extent to which medical resources are needed and lockdown measures need to be imposed. In this
context, the share of poor people who are at a higher risk of infection because they often need to rely
on public transport and often cannot work from home is also highly relevant. Poor individuals often
have no (or inadequate) access to health care, which prevents them from seeking diagnosis and
treatment with further repercussions on transmission. Finally, poor individuals must often work even
when sick, for example, because they do not have substantial savings to afford a long-term income
loss or because they have to support a large family. Here, a lot depends on the extent to which social
security systems can help to reduce the income loss of sick individuals and the extent to which poor
people get access to diagnosis and treatment. (iii) Cross-country heterogeneities are decisive in the
sense that richer countries might be able to sustain lockdown measures and social distancing for a
longer time period than poorer countries, in which many people depend on their ability to participate
in market activities. Optimal lockdown measures will therefore often be very different in rich countries
than in poor countries.

Overall and given these heterogeneities, some countries can cope comparatively well with epidemics
like HIV/AIDS, while for other countries such a disease implies a poverty trap from which they cannot
escape without massive assistance from other countries and donors. By the same token, a disease like
COVID-19 might come with enormous economic costs in rich countries but health systems might by
and large be able to cope with the disease. In poor countries, however, health systems might be
overwhelmed quickly (at much lower infection rates) such that death rates would increase, potentially
also for other diseases, for which treatment is postponed. For example, vaccination against other
dangerous infectious diseases, such as poliomyelitis, might drop because the programs cannot be
sustained in the face of another epidemic, leading to a re-emergence of the disease. Overall, an
epidemic that might mainly create economic hardship in rich countries could potentially lead to
humanitarian catastrophes in poor countries.

Heterogeneities and inequality not only affect the spread and the economic impact of epidemics, but
there is also the reverse channel of epidemics hitting people with lower incomes particularly hard. This
is because (i) working from home as a coping mechanism is often not feasible for many low-income
jobs; (ii) poor access to health care and insurance schemes and reliance on public transport increase
susceptibility to the diseases and the potential costs when falling ill; (iii) the increased incentive to
invest in automation in the course of epidemics predominantly lead to a replacement of routine and
low-wage jobs (Prettner and Bloom, 2020); and iv) while efforts to re-shore economic activity in the
face of supply chain disruptions and travel restrictions (e.g., in the production of medical supplies)
might be seen to present an opportunity for domestic workers, re-shoring tends to be associated with
more automated production, such that low-income persons would not benefit (Krenz et al., 2020) and
global inequality could rise. A particular challenge for policymakers is therefore to reduce the
inequality-increasing tendencies of epidemics when designing policies to cope with epidemic-induced
economic downturns.

We conclude on the note that while this paper has focused on the impact of epidemics on the
economy, an important reverse channel also exists relating to the impact of economic activity—and in
particular trade and labor migration—on the transmission of diseases (e.g., Oster, 2012b; Adda, 2016;
Qiu et al., 2020). Furthermore, the likely origin of the recent outbreaks of COVID-19, Ebola, and Zika—
but also more distantly of HIV/AIDS—in the transmission of pathogens from animals to humans
(zoonosis) has raised issues about the reverse pathway from economic development to the risk of
epidemics. While disease ecologists have studied intensively the relationship between habitat loss and
                                                   34
loss in biodiversity and the spread of zoonotic infections (e.g., Lloyd-Smith et al., 2009; Johnson et al.,
2015), much remains to be learned on the economic development aspects of the problem (Dobson et
al., 2020).
