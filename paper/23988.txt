                                          ABSTRACT

We document that the U.S. dollar exchange rate drives global trade prices and volumes. Using a
newly constructed data set of bilateral price and volume indices for more than 2,500 country
pairs, we establish the following facts: 1) The dollar exchange rate quantitatively dominates the
bilateral exchange rate in price pass-through and trade elasticity regressions. U.S. monetary
policy induced dollar fluctuations have high pass-through into bilateral import prices. 2) Bilateral
non-commodities terms of trade are essentially uncorrelated with bilateral exchange rates. 3) The
strength of the U.S. dollar is a key predictor of rest-of-world aggregate trade volume and
consumer/producer price inflation. A 1% U.S. dollar appreciation against all other currencies in
the world predicts a 0.6--0.8% decline within a year in the volume of total trade between
countries in the rest of the world, controlling for the global business cycle. 4) Using a novel
Bayesian semiparametric hierarchical panel data model, we estimate that the importing country's
share of imports invoiced in dollars explains 15% of the variance of dollar pass-through/elasticity
across country pairs. Our findings strongly support the dominant currency paradigm as opposed
to the traditional Mundell-Fleming pricing paradigms.

1    Introduction
Exchange rate fluctuations impact a country’s trade competitiveness, inflation, and output and
therefore have important consequences for its welfare and economic policy. It is common prac-
tice to estimate this impact by examining the pass-through of bilateral or trade-weighted ex-
change rates into export and import prices and volumes. This practice follows naturally from
the classic Mundell-Fleming paradigm of sticky prices and producer currency pricing whereby
exporting firms infrequently change prices denominated in their home currency. According to
this paradigm, the price an importing country faces when expressed in the importing country’s
currency fluctuates closely with the bilateral exchange rate. Accordingly, studies of exchange
rate pass-through focus on trade-weighted or bilateral exchange rate changes (see Goldberg and
Knetter (1997) and Burstein and Gopinath (2014) for surveys).
    Recent evidence by Goldberg and Tille (2008) and Gopinath (2015) question the Mundell-
Fleming assumption of producer currency pricing, as the vast majority of trade is invoiced in a
small number of “dominant currencies”, with the U.S. dollar playing an outsize role. Accordingly
Casas et al. (2016) develop a “dominant currency paradigm” where trade prices are sticky in dollars
and demonstrate that the value of a country’s currency relative to the dollar is a primary driver
of a country’s import prices and quantities regardless of where the good originates from, even at
annual frequencies. They provide empirical evidence supporting these predictions using customs
data for Colombia. However, no evidence exists on the the importance of dominant currencies
for global trade. Such an analysis requires trade price and volume indices at the level of country-
pairs, that excludes commodities, and covers many countries. This data is not readily available.
    In this paper we contribute to the literature by first constructing annual trade price and vol-
ume data for country pairs broken down by commodities/noncommodities. Specifically, we con-
struct harmonized annual bilateral import and export unit value and volume indices for 55 coun-
tries (yielding more than 2,500 dyads, i.e., trading pairs) from highly disaggregated UN Comtrade
data starting as early as 1989, depending on the country, and covering through 2015. The coun-
tries in our sample comprise 91% of the world’s total goods exports and imports in 2015.
    We then employ this data, merged with currency invoicing data from Gopinath (2015), to
examine the implications of the dominant currency paradigm for a large number of countries.
In order to estimate the cross-sectional heterogeneity of pass-through and its relation to dollar
invoicing, we employ a novel Bayesian semiparametric hierarchical panel data model.
    Our empirical results reject the Mundell-Fleming benchmark in favor of the dominant cur-
rency paradigm by establishing the following facts: 1) The dollar exchange rate quantitatively
dominates the bilateral exchange rate in price pass-through and trade elasticity regressions. U.S.

                                                2
monetary policy induced dollar fluctuations have high pass-through into bilateral import prices.
2) Bilateral non-commodities terms of trade are essentially uncorrelated with bilateral exchange
rates. 3) The strength of the U.S. dollar is a key predictor of rest-of-world aggregate trade volume
and consumer/producer price inflation. Specifically, a 1% U.S. dollar appreciation against all other
currencies in the world predicts a 0.6–0.8% decline within a year in the volume of total trade be-
tween countries in the rest of the world, holding constant various proxies for the global business
cycle. 4) The importer’s share of imports invoiced in dollars explains about 15% of the variance of
dollar pass-through/elasticity across country pairs. These results derive from fixed effects panel
regressions as well as a novel Bayesian semiparametric hierarchical panel data model. We now
elaborate further on each of these findings.
    First, we introduce the U.S. dollar exchange rate as an additional explanatory variable in price
pass-through and trade elasticity regressions. In standard price pass-through regressions, we doc-
ument that when country j’s currency depreciates relative to country i by 10%, import prices in
country j for goods imported from country i rise by 8%, suggestive of close to complete pass-
through at the one year horizon. However, adding the dollar to the regression knocks the coef-
ficient on the bilateral exchange rate from 0.80 down to 0.32 in the case when exporter-reported
prices are used, and from 0.76 to 0.16 when importer-reported prices are used. The coefficient on
the dollar exchange rate of 0.66 (0.78) dominates that of the bilateral exchange rate. This result
cannot be attributed to the correlation of the dollar with the global business cycle, as we control
for time fixed effects. Similarly, adding the dollar exchange rate to a bilateral volume forecasting
regression knocks down the coefficient on the bilateral exchange rate by a substantial amount.
The contemporaneous volume elasticity for the dollar exchange rate is around −0.20 across spec-
ifications and data sources, while the elasticity for the bilateral exchange rate is an order of mag-
nitude smaller at −0.03. We also show that the dollar’s role as an invoicing currency is indeed
special as it handily beats the explanatory power of the euro in price and volume regressions.
    To evaluate the impact of U.S. monetary policy shocks on bilateral trade, we isolate daily
dollar exchange rate changes on scheduled U.S. monetary policy announcement dates. As theory
predicts, we document that a tightening of U.S. monetary policy is associated with a nominal
appreciation of the dollar. Using only this subset of exchange rate changes in our regressions,
we estimate a high pass-through of the dollar exchange rate into bilateral import prices. The
impact of U.S. monetary shocks also significantly increases with the share of a country’s imports
invoiced in dollars.
    Second, the previous finding that prices respond to the dollar exchange rate but not the bi-
lateral exchange rate would imply that the terms of trade should not be sensitive to the bilateral


                                                 3
exchange rate, in sharp contrast to the Mundell-Fleming paradigm. More generally, if bilateral
trade is invoiced in a dominant currency (for some countries this could be the euro), we should
obtain low sensitivity to bilateral exchange rate changes. We indeed find this to be the case. In
a regression of changes in the bilateral non-commodities terms of trade on changes in the bi-
lateral exchange rate and the bilateral relative producer price index (PPI), the contemporaneous
coefficient on the exchange rate is indistinguishable from zero, with the 95% confidence interval
equal to [−0.013, 0.037] for data reported by exporters, and [−0.017, 0.035] for data reported by
importers. For comparison, the coefficient should be 1 under producer currency pricing and −1
under local currency pricing (i.e., pricing in the currency of the destination market), given fully
rigid nominal prices.
    Third, we demonstrate empirically that the strength of the U.S. dollar is a key predictor of rest-
of-world trade volume and inflation, even controlling for measures of the global business cycle.
We find that a 1% appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to all other currencies is associated
with a 0.6–0.8% contraction in rest-of-world (i.e., excluding the U.S. entirely) aggregate import
volume within the year. Furthermore, countries with larger dollar import invoicing shares experi-
ence higher pass-through of the dollar exchange rate into consumer and producer price inflation.
Whereas these findings are puzzling from the perspective of the traditional Mundell-Fleming
model due to its emphasis on bilateral exchange rates, they emerge naturally in the dominant
currency paradigm.
    Fourth, we exploit our rich panel data set to show that the cross-dyad heterogeneity in pass-
through coefficients is well explained by the propensity to invoice imports in dollars. We use the
importer’s country-level dollar invoicing share from Gopinath (2015) as a proxy for the invoic-
ing share of bilateral imports.1 Standard panel regressions with interactions show that increas-
ing the dollar invoicing share by 10 percentage points causes the contemporaneous dollar price
pass-through to increase by 2.0–3.5 percentage points. Using a flexible hierarchical Bayesian
framework to directly model pass-through heterogeneity, we estimate that the importer’s dollar
invoicing share explains 15% of the overall cross-dyad variance in dollar exchange rate pass-
through into prices. We also find that the importer’s dollar invoicing share affects the exchange
rate elasticity of trade volumes. These findings confirm the quantitative importance of the global
currency of invoicing, a key concept in the dominant currency paradigm.
    The Bayesian estimation procedure we develop allows the data to speak flexibly about the
extent and determinants of the cross-sectional heterogeneity of pass-through. We employ a ran-
   1
     Casas et al. (2016) use customs data to calculate export invoicing shares for Colombia at the bilateral level and
find small heterogeneity, implying that a country’s average should serve as a good proxy for some countries.



                                                          4
dom coefficients panel data model, where the distribution of the random coefficient on the dollar
exchange rate is allowed to depend nonparametrically on the dollar invoicing share as well as
unobserved determinants of pass-through heterogeneity. Unlike standard panel regressions that
can be informative about the average pass-through and the statistical significance of the deter-
minants of pass-through heterogeneity, the Bayesian approach allows us to quantify the overall
cross-sectional heterogeneity of exchange rate pass-through/elasticities and the relation of this
heterogeneity to dollar invoicing. The hierarchical aspect of the Bayesian inference procedure
can be thought of as striking an optimal bias-variance balance between two extreme approaches:
(1) constrained but precisely estimated panel regressions with cross-sectionally constant param-
eters and (2) unconstrained but noisily estimated dyad-by-dyad time series regressions. Despite
the high dimensionality of our semiparametric model, posterior sampling is handled efficiently
and robustly by the user-friendly open source software Stan (Stan Development Team, 2016).
    Given the magnitudes of our results and the global coverage of our data, we conclude that the
dominant currency paradigm is a more empirically relevant starting point than traditional mod-
eling approaches when analyzing the international transmission of shocks and optimal monetary
and exchange rate policy.

Literature review. Our exchange rate pass-through analysis appears to be among the first to
exploit a globally representative data set on bilateral trade volumes in addition to values. This
allows us to distinguish the effects of exchange rates on volumes and prices (more precisely,
unit values) at the level of country pairs. We use the cross-sectional richness of our data set
to investigate the determinants of differential pass-through, especially as it relates to currency
of invoicing. Our analysis appears to be the first attempt in the literature at quantifying both
the overall extent and the determinants of the heterogeneity of exchange rate pass-through and
elasticity across trade dyads.
    To our knowledge, the only other work that utilizes a similarly rich data set is Bussière et al.
(2016), who analyze trade prices and quantities at the product level. The goal of that paper is to
quantify the elasticity of prices and quantities to the bilateral exchange rate and check if Marshall-
Lerner conditions hold. In contrast, our goal is to understand the prominence of dominant cur-
rencies in international trade by comparing the importance of dollar and bilateral exchange rates
and by exploiting data on currency invoicing.
    The remaining literature on exchange rate pass-through falls into two main camps.2 First,
   2
    The trade gravity equation literature frequently uses extensive bilateral data sets, but the data is on trade values
without distinguishing between prices and volumes (see the review by Head and Mayer, 2015).



                                                           5
many papers have used unilateral/country-level time series, which limits the ability to analyze
cross-sectional heterogeneity and necessitates the use of trade-weighted rather than truly bilat-
eral exchange rates (e.g., Leigh et al., 2015). Second, a recent literature has estimated pass-through
of bilateral exchange rates into product-level prices (as opposed to unit values), but these micro
data sets are only available for a small number of countries (see the review by Burstein and
Gopinath, 2014).
    Our paper confirms that the findings of Casas et al. (2016) are relevant for the majority of world
trade, and we establish additional channels of U.S. dollar dominance. Casas et al. (2016) model
the dominant currency paradigm and test its implications for the dollar’s role in pass-through
regressions and for the terms of trade using product level data for Colombia. We depart from this
paper by providing evidence for the dominant currency paradigm using newly constructed import
and export price index data for 55 countries and over 2,500 country-pairs. Moreover, we relate the
heterogeneity in pass-through estimates to the dollar invoicing shares of countries, estimate the
impact of U.S. monetary policy shocks on bilateral import price pass-through, and demonstrate
that the strength of the dollar is a key predictor of rest-of-world trade and consumer/producer
price inflation.
    The findings in this paper help shed light on the literature on producer (Obstfeld and Rogoff
(1995), Corsetti and Pesenti (2001), Galı́ (2008)) versus local currency pricing (Betts and Devereux
(2000), Devereux and Engel (2003), Engel (2011)). Corsetti et al. (2010) provide an in-depth anal-
ysis of both. By demonstrating that global trade data is less consistent with these frameworks
than with dominant currency pricing, our results open up new avenues for research into the
consequences and determinants of currency invoicing under sticky prices.
    From a methodological perspective, our paper’s contribution is to introduce a semiparametric
Bayesian panel data model with cross-sectionally heterogeneous slope coefficients. Our specifi-
cation of the cross-sectional distribution of slope coefficients relies on the Mixture of Gaussian
Linear Regression nonparametric conditional density prior in Pati et al. (2013), who derive high-
level posterior concentration results. The MGLR prior extends the much-used Dirichlet Process
Mixture density prior to conditional density estimation.3 Liu (2017) uses the MGLR prior spec-
ification but places it on the unit-specific panel intercepts (rather than slopes), and she focuses
on forecasting rather than characterizing cross-sectional heterogeneity. Although our linear-in-
parameters specification is more restrictive than the frequentist non-parametric approaches of
Evdokimov (2010) and Chernozhukov et al. (2013), our Bayesian framework facilitates visualiza-
tion of the conditional pass-through distribution, uncertainty assessment, and model selection.

ysis. Section 3 describes our data set of bilateral trade unit values and quantities, exchange rates,
dollar invoicing shares, and U.S. monetary shocks. Section 4 presents panel regression evidence
on the average pass-through from bilateral, dollar, and euro exchange rates (or monetary shocks)

terize the cross-sectional heterogeneity of dollar pass-through and its relation to invoicing shares.
Section 6 shows that the strength of the U.S. dollar is a key predictor of rest-of-world trade vol-
ume and inflation. Section 7 concludes. Appendix A details the data set and Bayesian approach.

2    Conceptual framework
In this section we provide a simple conceptual framework along the lines of Proposition 2 in
Casas et al. (2016) to motivate the empirical analysis that follows. Define pij to be the log price
of goods exported from country i to country j measured in currency j, eij to be the log bilateral
exchange rate between country i and country j expressed as the price of currency i in terms of
currency j, and e$j to be the log price of a U.S. dollar in currency j. Suppose a fraction θi of these
exports are invoiced in the producer’s (country i) currency, a fraction θj in the local (destination
                                                                                   P
country j) currency and a fraction θu in the dominant currency (dollar) with k∈{i,j,u} θk = 1.
Import price inflation for country j for goods originating from country i is then

                  ∆pij,t = θj ∆pjij,t + θi ∆piij,t + ∆eij,t + θu ∆puij,t + ∆euj,t ,

where pkij,t stands for the price of goods imported by country j from i that are invoiced in the
                                                                               
currency k. Under Calvo pricing we have, ∆pkij,t = (1 − δp ) p̄kij,t − pkij,t−1 where p̄kij,t is the
reset-price for (ij) in currency k. Through substitution we can express import price inflation as
                                                                    X
                       ∆pij,t = θi ∆eij,t + θu ∆euj,t + (1 − δp )       θk ∆p̄kij,t ,
                                                                    k


where ∆p̄kij,t ≡ p̄kij,t − pkij,t−1 . In the very short run when δp → 1, we have the following bench-
marks for the changes in import prices and the terms of trade (TOT).

    • In the case of producer currency pricing (P CP ), θi = 1 and θj = θu = 0,

                ∆pij,t = 1 · ∆eij,t + 0 · ∆euj,t ,       ∆pji,t = −1 · ∆eij,t + 0 · ∆euj,t ,
                totij,t = ∆pij,t − (∆pji,t + ∆eij,t ) = 1 · ∆eij,t .


    • In the case of local currency pricing (LCP ), θj = 1 and θi = θu = 0,

                  ∆pij,t = 0 · ∆eij,t + 0 · ∆euj,t       ∆pji,t = 0 · ∆eij,t + 0 · ∆euj,t ,
                  totij,t = ∆pij,t − (∆pji,t + ∆eij,t ) = −1 · ∆eij,t .


    • In the case of dominant currency pricing (DCP ), θu = 1 and θi = θj = 0,

                 ∆pij,t = 0 · ∆eij,t + 1 · ∆euj,t ,       ∆pji,t = 0 · ∆eij,t + 1 · ∆eui,t ,
                  totij,t = ∆pij,t − (∆pji,t + ∆eij,t ) = 0 · ∆eij,t .


In summary, the predicted coefficients from a regression of (log) changes in import prices on
(log) changes in bilateral and dollar exchange rates differ qualitatively across the P CP , LCP ,
and DCP benchmarks, as do the implications for the terms of trade.
     A primitive assumption of Keynesian environments is that prices are sticky in the currency of
invoicing. This assumption is supported by direct measures of price stickiness for U.S. prices-at-
the dock in Gopinath and Rigobon (2008) and for Irish prices-at-the dock in Fitzgerald and Haller
(2013). Cravino (2017) provides indirect evidence of price stickiness using differential sensitivity
of Chilean export prices invoiced in different currencies to exchange rate shocks, similar to the
evidence in Gopinath et al. (2010).
     At longer horizons, some prices do adjust and the predictions depend on the response of reset
prices p̄kij,t to changes in eij,t . With endogenous currency choice and Calvo timing, Gopinath et al.
(2010) demonstrate that firms choose to price in currencies in which its reset price is most stable,
i.e., its desired pass-through conditional on a price change is low. Consequently, even at longer
(annual) horizons, we expect the divergent predictions across P CP , LCP , and DCP to hold.


3    Data
The core of our data set consists of panel data on bilateral trade values and volumes from Com-
trade. To this global data set we append macroeconomic country aggregates from the World


                                                  8
Bank’s World Development Indicators, financial variables from the Federal Reserve Bank of St.
Louis’s FRED database, and currency invoicing shares from Gopinath (2015). Finally, we construct
an annual series of U.S. monetary policy induced exchange rate changes.

Comtrade. UN Comtrade provides detailed customs data for a large set of countries at HS 6-
digit product level with information about the USD value, quantity, and weight of imports and
exports. This dataset makes it possible to compute volume changes over time for each product,
and use the value data to infer unit values. Once unit values are calculated, we compute Laspeyres,
Paasche and Fisher indices, both in their fixed base and chained forms to aggregate up from
the product level. We do various aggregations, the main one being across products we classify
as commodities and one for noncommodities. Given the inherent difficulty in drawing a line
between commodities and noncommodities, we define commodities fairly broadly as HS chapters
1–27 and 72–83 which comprise animal, vegetable, food, mineral, and metal products. We use
chained Fisher indices in the analysis that follows, except where noted.4
    We conduct this exercise at annual frequency, and for exporter and importer reported data
separately. Coverage of Comtrade at annual frequency over time and across countries is good. The
longest time span of the data is 1989–2015, although the coverage varies by dyad. Appendix A.1
breaks down the coverage by country. In 2015, the 55 countries in our sample are responsible
for 91.2% and 91.5% of the value of world goods imports and exports, respectively, as recorded in
Comtrade. For each reporting country, we construct indices for both imports and exports. This
gives us two sets of numbers for each bilateral trade flow, one as reported by the importer and one
as reported by the exporter, and allows us to do robustness checks by comparing our empirical
results across the two sets.
    The biggest challenge for constructing price and volume indices using customs data is the
so-called unit value bias, as argued by Silver (2007). Unit values, calculated simply by dividing
observed values by quantities, are not actual prices. Even at the narrowly defined product cate-
gories at 6-digit product level, there is likely to be a wide range of products whose prices may not
be moving proportionately. The implication is that if there are shifts in quantities traded within
the narrowly defined product categories, unit values would be influenced even when there may
not be any price movement. This creates a bias that the employed methodology takes a stab at
correcting for by eliminating products whose unit values have a variance higher than a threshold
and hence are more likely to suffer from the unit value bias.
   4
    The Fisher price index satisfies a number of tests laid out in index number theory and is flexible enough to
provide a good proxy for a large set of functional forms (Gaulier et al., 2008; IMF, 2009).



                                                       9
    Another challenge that arises from using Comtrade data is related to the use of different HS
vintages over time. HS classification is updated about every five years to ensure that the available
codings accurately reflect the variety of products being traded. This involves introducing codes
for new products, eliminating the old ones, and often regrouping existing products. While con-
cordances are readily available to facilitate the matching of HS codes across different HS vintages,
this process inevitably leads to a loss of information, especially in the case of data on quantities,
because the mapping of products across vintages is rarely one-to-one. To get around this prob-
lem, for the years in which there is a transition to a new HS vintage, we compute the indices
twice, once under the old vintage (using concordances) and once under the new one. This way,
only these transition years would be effected by the loss of information due to matching across
vintages. After that year, we switch to working with the new vintage. This method not only min-
imizes the loss of information but also allows us to include new products in the construction of
the indices. Boz and Cerutti (2017) provide further details of this method, including the strategy
for dealing with outliers and missing values, and a comparison with a similar dataset constructed
by Gaulier et al. (2008).
    In the final stage, we compare our unit value indices to those provided by the BLS for the U.S.,
the only country, to our knowledge, that collects import price indices based on price surveys by
origin. As shown in Appendix B.1, this comparison for the U.S. suggests that working with unit
values is acceptable, as the growth rates of the two series are broadly aligned for most trading
partners. Additionally, Boz and Cerutti (2017) find favorable results when comparing country-
level indices with those from the WTO and IMF World Economic Outlook.

Currency invoicing share. For currency invoicing shares we use the data set constructed by
Gopinath (2015). The export and import invoicing share for a country is a simple average of the
respective shares for the years in which it is reported over the period 1999–2014. For all countries
the invoicing shares tend to be fairly stable over time. Appendix A.1 lists the USD and euro import
invoicing share for the 39 countries in our sample with available invoicing data.

U.S. monetary shocks. We compute currency-specific annual U.S. monetary policy induced
exchange rate changes by summing across daily exchange rate changes on U.S. Federal Open
Market Committee (FOMC) announcement dates. We use the scheduled FOMC announcement
dates for 1990–2004 from Gürkaynak et al. (2005), supplemented with dates for 2005–2013 from
Nakamura and Steinsson (2016), as well as dates for 2014–2015 from the FOMC meeting calendar
on the website of the Board of Governors. There are a total of 219 scheduled announcement dates
from 1990–2015. On each of these dates, we compute the daily log change (relative to the previous

                                                 10
weekday) in the exchange rate vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar for each country in the Comtrade sample.
Daily exchange rate series were obtained from FactSet (close mid price).5 To obtain an annual
series for each country, we compute the unweighted sum of the log exchange rate changes on
FOMC dates in a given year.

Country-level and global macro data. We use the World Bank’s World Development Indi-
cators (WDI) database as the source for annual average exchange rates and macroeconomic data
for the world and for the countries in our sample. We obtain the WTI oil price, 1-year Treasury
bill rate, and VIX from the St. Louis Fed’s FRED database. See Appendix A.1 for details.


4        Bilateral pass-through, terms of trade, and the dollar
In this section we show that our global trade dataset is consistent with the dominant currency
paradigm: The U.S. dollar plays an outsize role in driving international trade prices and quantities.
We run fixed effects panel regressions at the dyad (country pair) level with exchange rates as the
independent variable, and either prices, terms of trade, or volumes as the dependent variables.
In all cases we find that bilateral (importer vs. exporter) exchange rates matter substantially less
than the exchange rate vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar. The effects of the dollar are stronger when the
importing country has a higher fraction of trade invoiced in dollars. The pass-through of the
subset of dollar exchange rate fluctuations that are due to U.S. monetary policy actions is high.
Finally, we show that the dollar’s quantitative dominance holds up in specifications that control
also for the euro exchange rate.
    All specifications below rely on Comtrade series that use Fisher price indices, data for non-
commodities goods only, and the preferred imputation and outlier truncation technique of Boz
and Cerutti (2017). In Appendix B.2 we show that our results are robust to alternative choices.


4.1        Exchange rate pass-through into prices
We first examine the pass-through of bilateral and dollar exchange rates to bilateral trade price
indices. Define pij to be the log price of goods exported from country i to country j measured in
currency j, eij to be the log bilateral exchange rate between country i and country j expressed
as the price of currency i in terms of currency j, and e$j to be the log price of a U.S. dollar in
    5
        FactSet corrects exchange rates for redenomination and currency substitution. We only use data on FOMC dates.

where λij and δt are dyadic and time fixed effects, respectively. Xi,t are other controls, namely
the change in the log producer price index of the exporting country i measured in currency i (and
two lags).
    For reference, we first consider the specification without the dollar exchange rate as an ex-
planatory variable. Regression Eq. (1) is a standard pass-through regression where bilateral im-
port prices are regressed on bilateral exchange rates. The estimates from such a regression are
reported in columns (1) and (4) of Table 1. Column (1) uses import prices of country j originating
from country i as reported by country i, and column (4) uses prices reported by country j. Under
perfect construction, these two should be the same, but that is not the case in practice. However,
we obtain similar estimates for pass-through. According to these estimates, when country j’s
currency depreciates relative to country i by 10%, import prices in country j rise by 8%, sugges-
tive of close to complete pass-through at the one year horizon.6 The second and third lags are
economically less important.
    Our main result in this section establishes the dominance of the dollar over bilateral exchange
rates in predicting trade price movements. Columns (2) and (5) report estimates from regression
Eq. (2). As is evident, including the dollar exchange rate sharply reduces the relevance of the
bilateral exchange rate. It knocks the coefficient on the bilateral exchange rate from 0.80 down
to 0.32 in the case when exporter-reported prices are used, and from 0.76 to 0.16 when importer-
reported prices are used. Instead, almost all of the effect is absorbed by the dollar exchange
   6
       With year fixed effects this should be interpreted as fluctuations in excess of world annual fluctuations.

rate.7 Notice that, due to our inclusion of time fixed effects, the apparent dominance of the dollar
cannot be an artifact of special conditions that may apply in times when the dollar appreciates or
depreciates against all other currencies, for example due to global recessions or flight to safety
in asset markets. Appendix B.2 shows that our results are robust to the choice of time sample.
    The cross-dyad heterogeneity in pass-through coefficients is related to the propensity to in-
voice imports in dollars. Columns (3) and (6) interact the dollar and bilateral exchange rates with
the share of invoicing in dollars at the importer country level, as in regression Eq. (3). Notice
that we do not have data on the fraction of bilateral trade invoiced in dollars, so we use the
importer’s country-level share as a proxy. As expected, the import invoicing share plays an eco-
nomically and statistically significant role for the dollar pass-through. Depending on whether we
use prices reported by exporters or importers, the regression results indicate that increasing the
dollar invoicing share by 10 percentage points causes the contemporaneous dollar pass-through
to increase by 2.0–3.5 percentage points. In Section 5 below we further quantify the importance
of the dollar invoicing share for explaining the cross-sectional variation in pass-through.
    Figs. 1 and 2 depict the regression results visually in the form of impulse response functions.
Fig. 1 shows the impulse responses of the bilateral import price level. The top row uses exporter
reported data, the bottom row importer reported data. The left column shows the bilateral pass-
through in the specifications without the dollar exchange rate, while the right column compares
the bilateral and dollar pass-throughs in specifications with both exchange rates. Fig. 2 illus-
trates the pass-through heterogeneity as a function of the invoicing share Sj , as implied by the
regression specifications with interactions. The figure focuses on three representative countries:
Switzerland (Sj = 0.13), Turkey (Sj = 0.59), and Argentina (Sj = 0.88). Although Fig. 2 suggests
that dollar pass-through is high even for low dollar invoicing shares, this particular finding ap-
pears to be an artifact of using country-level dollar invoicing shares rather than bilateral shares. If
we weight the pass-through regression by trade value shares, giving higher weight to dyads that
are responsible for a larger share of the importer’s total imports, the bilateral pass-through is es-
timated to exceed the dollar pass-through when the dollar invoicing share is low (e.g., Sj = 0.13).
   7
     While the exporter- and importer-reported data sets disagree somewhat about the level of bilateral pass-through,
the dollar pass-through is consistent across data sets. The dollar pass-through dominates in both data sets. The World
Bank views importer-reported data as more reliable since imports generate tariff revenues (World Bank, 2010), see
also Feenstra et al. (2005).

4.2    Terms of trade and exchange rates
The previously established fact that prices respond to the dollar exchange rate but not the bilateral
exchange rate implies that the terms of trade should not respond to the bilateral exchange rate.
We now test this hypothesis directly in our data by relating bilateral terms of trade to bilateral
exchange rates. In this subsection, a cross-sectional unit is defined to be an unordered country
pair, so that all trade flows between two countries i and j are associated with the cross-sectional
unit {i, j}. Define the bilateral log terms of trade totij = pij − pji − eij , a unitless quantity (i.e.,
export and import price indices are measured in the same currency). Moreover, let ppiij denote
the log ratio of PPI in country i divided by PPI in country j, with indices expressed in the same
currency.
    We consider the following regressions:

                                                     2
                                                     X
                             ∆totij,t = λij + δt +         αk ∆eij,t−k + εij,t ,                      (4)
                                                     k=0

                                          2
                                          X                     2
                                                                X
                  ∆totij,t = λij + δt +         αk ∆eij,t−k +         βk ∆ppiij,t−k + εij,t ,         (5)
                                          k=0                   k=0

where λij and δt are dyadic and time fixed effects. Regression Eq. (4) relates the growth rate of the
bilateral terms of trade to the growth rate of the bilateral nominal exchange rate (and two lags). As
discussed in Section 2, if exporting firms set prices in their local currencies (producer currency
pricing, PCP) and prices are sticky, the contemporaneous exchange rate coefficient α0 should
equal 1. On the other hand, if exporting firms set prices in the destination currency (local currency
pricing, LCP) and prices are sticky, the contemporaneous exchange rate coefficient should be
−1. However, if most prices are invoiced in U.S. dollars and are sticky in nominal terms, the
coefficients αk should be close to zero. Regression Eq. (5) controls for lags 0–2 of the growth rate
of the ratio of PPI in the two countries, since firms’ optimal reset prices should fluctuate with
domestic cost conditions.
    In line with the dominant currency paradigm, we find that bilateral exchange rates are vir-
tually uncorrelated with bilateral terms of trade. The results of the panel regressions are shown
in Table 2. If we do not control for relative PPI, the regression results indicate that the contem-
poraneous effect of the exchange rate on the terms of trade is negative, in direct contradiction
of PCP. While the negative sign is consistent with LCP, the magnitude is not, as the 95% confi-
dence interval equals [−0.11, −0.07] for data reported by exporters, and [−0.05, −0.02] for data

reported by importers.8 The coefficients on the first and second lags have opposite sign of the
contemporaneous coefficient but are very small in magnitude. When controlling for relative PPI,
the point estimates of the coefficients on the bilateral exchange rate shrink further toward zero,
and confidence intervals on these coefficients remain narrow. Hence, the results lend strong sup-
port to the prediction of the dominant currency paradigm: Terms of trade are unresponsive to
bilateral exchange rates.

    Attenuation bias is not a worry in this context, since the explanatory variables of interest (exchange rates) are
precisely measured, except perhaps for time aggregation issues at the annual frequency.

4.3    Trade volume elasticity
Having demonstrated the outsize role of the U.S. dollar in determining international prices, we
now show that the dollar also dominates the bilateral exchange rate when predicting bilateral
trade volumes.
    Table 3 shows the results from panel regressions of trade volume on bilateral and dollar ex-
change rates. Let yij denote the log volume of goods exported from country i to country j. Our
volume regressions take the same form as in the price pass-through regressions Eqs. (1) to (3), ex-
cept that the dependent variable is now the log growth rate ∆yij,t of bilateral trade volumes, and
the extra controls Xj,t (here indexed by j rather than i) consist of the log growth rate of real GDP
(and two lags) for the importing country j. These regressions do not capture structural demand
elasticity parameters, since we do not attempt to control for all relevant relative prices, and the
importer’s GDP growth is an imperfect proxy for the level of import demand. In particular, our
results will invariably conflate expenditure switching and shifts in aggregate import demand (for
example due to valuation effects on net foreign assets). We view these regressions as predictive
relationships that may inform future structural estimation exercises. Nevertheless, we will refer
to the coefficients on exchange rates as “trade elasticities” for simplicity.
    The volume regressions underline the dominant role played by the U.S. dollar. As in the
case of the price pass-through regressions, adding the dollar exchange rate to the volume re-
gressions knocks down the coefficient on the bilateral exchange rate by a substantial amount.
The contemporaneous elasticity for the dollar exchange rate is around −0.2 across specifications
and data sources, while the elasticity for the bilateral exchange rate is an order of magnitude
smaller. The data point to an interesting reversal in the years following the contemporaneous
effect, whereby import volumes tend to increase one year after a ceteris paribus depreciation of
the importer currency rate vis-à-vis the dollar. We discuss these lag dynamics below. Unlike the
price pass-through regressions, the interactions of exchange rate changes with the importer’s
dollar invoicing share are mostly imprecisely estimated here.
    Fig. 3 visually depicts the regression results in the form of impulse responses. The figure shows
the response of the level of bilateral trade volume to exchange rate shocks. The right column
shows results from regression specifications with both bilateral and dollar exchange rates. It is
apparent from the figure that the dollar exchange rate has a much more negative impact effect
than the bilateral exchange rate. Yet, the figure also shows that the effect of either exchange rate
on the level is essentially neutral at horizons of 1–2 years, due to the negative lagged terms in
Table 3. One potential explanation is that the ratio of import prices and domestic prices adjust
with a lag to exchange rate changes, implying that a year after the initial shock, relative prices

faced by consumers are mostly unchanged compared to the period before the shock. However,
we show in Appendix B.2 that this particular finding is driven by the early years in our sample,
as results on the 2002–2015 subsample point toward a large, permanent negative effect of dollar
appreciations on the volume of bilateral trade.
    Fig. 4 illustrates the trade elasticity heterogeneity as a function of the dollar invoicing share,
similar to Fig. 2. The point estimates of the impulse responses point toward an association be-
tween higher dollar invoicing shares and more negative trade elasticities, but the confidence
intervals are wider than in our earlier price pass-through regressions. Section 5 provides further
quantitative evidence on trade elasticity heterogeneity and its determinants.


4.4    Effects of U.S. monetary policy shocks
We now directly estimate the effects of U.S. monetary policy induced exchange rate changes on
bilateral trade. The dominant role played by the dollar in our earlier price and volume regressions
suggests that U.S. monetary policy actions that cause the dollar to fluctuate could have large
spillover effects on international trade prices and volumes. In this section we directly measure
the impulse responses with respect to U.S. monetary shocks.
     As described in Section 3, for each country we construct an annual measure of U.S. monetary
policy induced exchange rate fluctuations by summing daily log exchange rate changes on dates
with scheduled FOMC announcements. Let zj,t be the sum of these daily log changes in year
t for country j, where the exchange rate is measured in units of country j currency per U.S.
dollar. The use of daily exchange rate changes on FOMC announcement dates allows for a specific
interpretation of the shocks zj,t , whereas the overall exchange rate change ∆e$j,t arguably is an
amalgam of the effects of several distinct shocks. However, we do not claim that zj,t is solely
driven by U.S. monetary policy actions, or that all fluctuations in zj,t are necessarily “surprises”.
Because we are interested in a large number of currencies for a sample going back to 1990, we
cannot use high-frequency intra-day data as in Andersen et al. (2003), Gürkaynak et al. (2005),
and Nakamura and Steinsson (2016), for example.
     Daily and annual data are consistent with our interpretation of the U.S. monetary shock series.
U.S. monetary tightenings are associated with appreciations of the dollar against the currencies
in our sample: The daily correlation of log exchange rate changes (across all currencies) and
changes in the U.S. 1-year Treasury bill rate is 0.064 on FOMC dates in the period 1990–2007
(i.e., excluding the zero lower bound period). The standard deviation of daily log exchange rate
changes across all currencies is 0.72% on FOMC dates; it is 0.92% across all days in the 1990–2015
sample. The standard deviation of the annual (i.e., summed) monetary shock series zj,t is 2.6%,

                                                 21
compared to an annual standard deviation of 31.6% for overall log exchange rate changes ∆e$j,t
on the same 1990–2015 sample. The annual correlation of zj,t and ∆e$j,t is 0.17. We conclude that
our monetary shock series captures a small but nontrivial fraction of shocks to exchange rates
vis-à-vis the dollar.
    We measure the effect of U.S. monetary policy actions on bilateral trade prices using panel
fixed effects regressions as in Eqs. (1) to (3) in Section 4.1, except here we replace raw exchange
rate changes with our U.S. monetary shock series. Specifically, we replace the log change in
the bilateral exchange rate ∆eij,t with the U.S. monetary policy induced change in the bilateral
exchange rate, zj,t − zi,t , and we replace the log change in the dollar exchange rate ∆e$j,t with
the dollar exchange rate shock zj,t . We include lags 0–6 of the exchange rate shocks on the right-
hand side of our regression specifications, as our results below suggest that the pass-through of
U.S. monetary shocks is more gradual than the pass-through of raw exchange rate changes. We
continue to control for dyad and time fixed effects, as well as lags 0–2 of exporter PPI log growth.
    Fig. 5 shows that the average pass-through of U.S. monetary policy induced exchange rate
changes into bilateral import prices is high in the long run. The figure depicts the impulse re-
sponse functions of the bilateral price level to shocks.9 The left column is based on specifications
with only shocks zj,t − zi,t to the bilateral exchange rate, while the right column is based on
specifications that add shocks zj,t to the dollar exchange rate. We split the results by exporter
(top row) and importer (bottom row) reported data. The impact effect of shocks to both bilateral
and dollar exchange rates is about 0.3. However, in specifications with both bilateral and dollar
exchange rate shocks, the dollar pass-through rises to about 0.6–1.0 in years 4–6, depending on
specification, whereas the bilateral pass-through is negligible in the long run.
    Fig. 6 shows that the pass-through of shocks to the dollar exchange rate is strongly positively
associated with the importer’s dollar invoicing share Sj . As in Section 4.1, we report impulse
response functions for low, medium, and high levels of dollar invoicing, where the point esti-
mates and confidence intervals are computed from regressions with interactions. The association
between pass-through and dollar invoicing is even stronger for the U.S. monetary policy induced
shocks than for the overall exchange rate changes analyzed in Section 4.1. While the estimated
long-run pass-through of shocks to the dollar exchange rate is close to zero for a country like
Switzerland with Sj = 0.13, it is about 2.0–3.5 for a country like Argentina with Sj = 0.88, de-
pending on specification. These magnitudes are not directly comparable with the pass-through
magnitudes in Section 4.1, since a 1% monetary shock zj,t represents a much rarer occurrence

    Unlike for price pass-through, regressions of trade volumes on U.S. monetary shocks yield
very noisy results. This is a consequence of relatively low R2 values for volume regressions,
which we also found in Section 4.3, coupled with the limited variation in measured monetary
shocks relative to the variation in overall exchange rates. We therefore refrain from reporting
volume regression results here. It is an interesting topic for future research to develop more
comprehensive (and thus more volatile) measures of U.S. monetary policy shocks that can be
related directly to trade volumes.


4.5    The dollar versus the euro
We conclude this section by comparing the explanatory power of the dollar exchange rate with
that of the euro. We show that the dollar dominates both the bilateral exchange rate and the euro
in regression specifications that include all three exchange rates.
    The preceding panel regressions do not directly imply that the U.S. dollar is a uniquely im-
portant vehicle currency. In our regression specifications without interactions, we would have
obtained exactly the same coefficient estimates if we had used the euro exchange rate, say, in
place of the dollar exchange rate, since we control for time fixed effects. Nevertheless, our spec-
ifications with interactions indicated that the dollar may play a special role. Now we directly
compare the explanatory power of the dollar against that of the euro in panel regressions that
do not control for time fixed effects but instead control for observed global real and financial
variables.
    To measure bilateral price pass-through from the dollar and the euro, we run panel regressions
of the form
                         2
                         X                     2
                                               X                     2
                                                                     X
        ∆pij,t = λij +         αk ∆eij,t−k +         βk ∆e$j,t−k +         ξk ∆eej,t−k + θ0 Xij,t + εij,t ,   (6)
                         k=0                   k=0                   k=0


where eej,t denotes the log euro exchange rate in units of currency j per euro. Notice that we
omit time fixed effects, as is necessary to identify βk and ξk separately. In addition to lags 0–2 of
exporter PPI log growth, the controls Xij,t consist of the contemporaneous values of global real
GDP growth, global GDP deflator inflation, global export volume growth, growth in the WTI oil
price deflated by the global GDP deflator, and the log VIX. The time sample for regressions in
this subsection is 2002–2015 due to the introduction of the euro in 1999 and our use of lagged
exchange rate changes.

     Fig. 7 shows that the euro pass-through into prices is negligible on average, while the dollar
pass-through remains high when we control for the euro. The figure displays the regression
results in the form of impulse responses of the bilateral price level; corresponding regression
tables are available in Appendix B.2. We split by exporter (top) and importer (bottom) reported
data. The left column shows results for specifications that do not include the dollar exchange
rate, i.e., restricting βk = 0 in Eq. (6). The right column displays estimates of bilateral, dollar, and
euro pass-through from regressions with all three exchange rates. In the latter specifications, the
dollar pass-through is quantitatively much larger than the euro pass-through; indeed, the results
are close to those of Section 4.1 where we did not consider the euro at all. The euro pass-through
is quantitatively small at all horizons, and it is in fact estimated to be slightly negative. The
difference between the dollar and euro pass-through is statistically significant at conventional
significance levels. In Appendix B.2 we show through regressions with interactions that the
importer’s dollar and euro invoicing shares help explain the heterogeneity in pass-through.
     Similarly, we find that the dollar exchange rate has the largest predictive power for trade
volumes. We run panel regressions similar to Eq. (6), except with volume growth ∆yij,t on the
left-hand side, and we replace exporter PPI with lags 0–2 of importer real GDP growth in the
list of controls Xij,t . Fig. 8 shows impulse responses of the level of bilateral trade volume to
the bilateral, dollar, and euro exchange rates. The dollar exchange rate is the only one of the
three that has a quantitatively large negative association with trade volumes.10 Curiously, the
trade elasticity of the euro exchange rate is estimated to be positive both in the short and long
run, although the confidence intervals are consistent with economically small magnitudes.11 The
difference between the dollar and euro trade elasticities is significant at conventional significance
levels.


5        Determinants of pass-through heterogeneity
In this section we show that the cross-dyad variation in exchange rate price pass-through and
trade elasticity is well explained by the U.S. dollar’s dominance as invoicing currency. The theo-
retical framework underlying the dominant currency paradigm predicts that pass-through from
bilateral exchange rates to prices or quantities should vary across countries, depending on the
    10
      The different long-run level effect of the dollar in Figs. 3 and 8 is due to the difference in time sample, as discussed
in Appendix B.2.
   11
      It is an interesting topic for future research to investigate whether the positive predictive effect of euro appre-
ciations on bilateral import volume can be ascribed to valuation effects on net foreign assets that shift the overall
level of import demand.

share of imports invoiced in U.S. dollars. The panel regressions in the previous section indicate
that this interaction effect is statistically and economically significant for price pass-through. In
this section we directly estimate how important the interaction effect is relative to unobserved
factors affecting the cross-sectional heterogeneity of price pass-through and trade elasticities.


5.1     Bayesian model of pass-through heterogeneity
We employ a Bayesian hierarchical panel data model with cross-sectionally varying slopes. This
model optimally exploits the geographical and temporal richness of our data set. By explicitly
modeling the cross-sectional heterogeneity of pass-through, we are able to quantify how much of
this heterogeneity can be explained by the share of trade invoiced in U.S. dollars (for brevity, here
we use the term “pass-through” to describe the relationship between exchange rates and prices or
quantities). Such questions cannot be answered by linear panel models with interactions, as these
common-coefficients panel models are unable to quantify the overall cross-sectional heterogene-
ity of pass-through. We use a hierarchical Bayes framework with a nonparametric specification
for the distribution of pass-through coefficients conditional on the dollar invoicing share. We
demonstrate the ease of sampling from the posterior distribution by exploiting the flexible and
user-friendly Bayesian software package Stan.
    The hierarchical approach lets the data determine how much pass-through varies across trade
dyads.12 This approach can roughly be thought of as striking a balance between two extreme but
standard econometric methods. In one extreme, we could run dyad-by-dyad time series regres-
sions to determine dyad-specific pass-through coefficients. However, these pass-through esti-
mates would be highly noisy due to the availability of on average about 20 annual data points per
dyad, especially given the need to control for other covariates. In the other extreme, we could run
constant-coefficient panel regressions as in Section 4. While these are informative about average
pass-through as well as interaction terms, they are useless for estimating the extent and nature
of the overall cross-sectional heterogeneity of pass-through. Our hierarchical Bayes approach
models this heterogeneity directly and flexibly, allowing the entire panel data set to inform the
estimates of the distribution of pass-through as well as individual pass-through coefficients. Be-
ing a fully Bayesian method, uncertainty assessment and model selection is straight-forward.
  12
     At an abstract level, hierarchical Bayes methods treat certain prior parameters as unknown model parameters,
which themselves are endowed with prior distributions that get updated by the data. This approach is similar to
“empirical Bayes” or classical “random effects” methods, which in effect estimate the prior distribution (here: the
distribution of pass-through coefficients) from the data.




                                                        27
Model. The outcome equation of the model is a linear panel data model with dyad and time
fixed effects, except some of the coefficients are allowed to vary across dyads:

                                 Yij,t = λij + δt + γij0 Rij,t + θ0 Xij,t + εij,t .                               (7)

In our applications, the outcome Yij,t will be price or quantity log growth, while the covariates
Rij,t with cross-sectionally varying coefficients γij will be the contemporaneous log growth rates
of the bilateral and U.S. dollar exchange rates, Rij,t = (∆eij,t , ∆e$j,t )0 . The covariates Xij,t with
cross-sectionally constant coefficients θ include lags of the exchange rates as well as the other
exogenous controls used in Section 4.13 We impose a standard random effects assumption on the
dyad-specific effects, λij ∼ N (α, τ 2 ) (i.i.d. across dyads), and assume Gaussian errors εij,t ∼
N (0, σ 2 ) (i.i.d. across dyads and time).14 We place independent diffuse half-Cauchy priors on τ
and σ and independent diffuse Cauchy priors on the intercept α, the time fixed effects δt , and the
cross-sectionally constant coefficients θ. See Appendix A.2.1 for details on the prior.
     To economize on the number of parameters, we impose the assumption that the sum of the
pass-through coefficients on the bilateral and dollar exchange rates is constant across dyads:
γij,1 + γij,2 = γ̄ for all (i, j). This restriction is motivated by the institutional fact that, in most
countries in our sample, trade that is not invoiced in dollars is instead invoiced in local currency,
so dyads with high dollar pass-through should exhibit low bilateral pass-through, and vice versa.
The restriction on the vector γij implies that the outcome equation can be written

                   Yij,t = λij + δt + γij,1 (∆e$j,t − ∆eij,t ) + γ̄∆eij,t + θ0 Xij,t + εij,t .                    (8)

This restricted outcome equation can be written in the general form (7), with γij a scalar, Rij,t =
∆e$j,t − ∆eij,t , and subsuming the term γ̄∆eij,t in the covariate terms θ0 Xij,t . We assume this
notation in the following.
   A key part of the model is the cross-sectional distribution of dollar pass-through conditional
on the dollar invoicing share. We continue to denote the importer’s observed dollar invoicing
share by Sj . For maximal flexibility, we use a nonparametric specification of the conditional dollar
pass-through distribution γij | Sj , while letting the hyperparameters of the prior be updated by
  13
      All probability statements in this section are conditional on the covariates Rij,t and Xij,t . In particular, we
assume strict exogeneity of all covariates, and γij is independent of Xij,t conditional on Rij,t .
   14
      In the panel regressions in Section 4 we do not find evidence of economically significant serial correlation in
the idiosyncratic errors. Identification of the full distribution of random slopes in linear panel data models is only
possible under a priori restrictions on the persistence of the idiosyncratic regressions errors (Chamberlain, 1992;
Arellano and Bonhomme, 2012).

the data. Specifically, we follow Pati et al. (2013) and Liu (2017) and assume that, conditional on
the importer’s dollar invoicing share, the dollar pass-through coefficient is drawn from a Mixture
of Gaussian Linear Regressions (MGLR):

independent across dyads (i, j). Thus, the dollar pass-through γij is drawn from one of K nor-
mal distributions, each with possibly different mean and variance parameters. The priors on the
hyperparameters µ0,k , µ1,k , and ωk are described in Appendix A.2.1. The mixture probabilities
πk (Sj ) are allowed to depend flexibly on the dollar share. We adopt the “probit stick-breaking”
specification of Pati et al. (2013),
                       (
                           Φ(ζk (s)) k−1

                                         (1 − Φ(ζj (s))) for k = 1, . . . , K − 1,
            πk (s) =           PK−1 j=1                                            ,                s ∈ [0, 1],
                           1 − j=1 πj (s)                for k = K,

where Φ(·) is the standard normal CDF. As in Liu (2017), we place independent nonparametric
Gaussian process priors on the functions ζk (·) for k = 1, . . . , K − 1. See Appendix A.2.1.
   The nonparametric prior on the cross-sectionally varying dollar pass-through coefficients al-
lows the data to speak flexibly about our key question of interest, the extent to which the dollar
invoicing share can explain pass-through heterogeneity. MGLR priors, as defined above, can ac-
commodate a wide variety of shapes of the conditional density of γij | Sj , including heavy-tailed,
skewed, and multimodal conditional distributions. Since the mixture probabilities πk (Sj ) depend
on Sj , the functional form of the conditional distribution is allowed to change as the dollar in-
voicing share Sj varies. In particular, we do not impose that the distribution of γij shifts linearly
with Sj .15 Pati et al. (2013) show that, if K = ∞, MGLR priors yield posterior consistency in
nonparametric conditional density estimation problems under weak assumptions. We instead al-
low the data to inform us about the choice of the number K of mixture components, using the
Bayesian Leave-One-Out (LOO) cross-validation model selection criterion of Gelfand et al. (1992)
and Vehtari et al. (2017), cf. Appendix A.2.2.
  15
       It is only the distribution conditional on a mixture component k that is assumed to shift linearly.

Posterior sampling. We use the Bayesian statistics software package Stan to draw from the
posterior distribution of the model parameters (Stan Development Team, 2016). Stan produces
samples from the posterior using the No U-Turn Sampler of Hoffman and Gelman (2014), a variant
of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (Neal, 2011).
From an applied user’s perspective, Stan has the advantage that it only requires the probability
model to be specified in “natural” mathematical language (like the equations above). The software
then automatically computes the posterior density and tunes the MCMC procedure. Stan achieves
robust and rapid mixing in our high-dimensional hierarchical model, without requiring priors to
be conjugate. Appendix B.3 details the performance of the MCMC routine.


5.2    Results: price pass-through
We find that the importer’s share of dollar invoicing explains a substantial fraction of the hetero-
geneity in dollar pass-through into prices, confirming a key channel in the dominant currency
paradigm. Below we summarize the most important features of the posterior distribution for our
purposes, while Appendix B.4.1 provides additional details on other parameters.
    Our empirical specification broadly follows Section 4. In terms of the general Bayesian model
in Eq. (7), we set Yij,t = ∆pij,t . As extra covariates in Xij,t , we use the exporter’s log PPI growth
and one lag each of log PPI growth, bilateral exchange rate log growth, and dollar exchange rate
log growth (second lags were found to be unimportant in Section 4). Here we focus on results that
use Comtrade data reported by importers, for the reasons discussed in Section 4.1. We remove
a few dyads whose data have gaps in the middle of the sample. Since we require data on the
importer’s dollar invoicing share, our final sample consists of 1856 dyads for a total of 35,398
observations (average of 19.1 years per dyad).
    Our preferred specification uses K = 2 mixture components for the conditional distribution
of dollar pass-through coefficients given the dollar invoicing share. The LOO model selection
criterion indicates strong support for K ≥ 2 against K = 1, but the criterion is mostly flat
for K = 2, 3, . . . , 8. Because the posterior summaries below are virtually unchanged across
these values of K, we prefer to show results for the more parsimonious model K = 2 here.
Appendix B.4.2 provides results for the richer K = 8 specification.
    Fig. 9 shows that a higher importer (country-aggregate) dollar invoicing share is associated
with a rightward shift in the cross-sectional density of dollar pass-through. The figure focuses
on three invoicing shares: a low one (Switzerland), a medium one (Turkey), and a high one (Ar-
gentina). While the cross-sectional heterogeneity in pass-through is large, there is a noticeable
overall rightward shift in dollar pass-through when going from a low-Sj country to a high-Sj

country. Based on posterior median estimates, the mode of the γij distribution shifts by about
0.10 when the dollar invoicing share increases from Switzerland to Argentina levels. This is a
substantial shift when compared to the estimated cross-dyad interquartile range of γij of 0.13
(see below).16
    Fig. 10 plots the posterior conditional mean and standard deviation of the conditional distribu-
tion γij | Sj across all observed values of Sj . The figure confirms that the three conditional densi-
ties plotted in Fig. 9 are representative of the entire observed distribution of Sj values. Although
not assumed a priori by our model, the conditional mean E[γij | Sj ] appears approximately linear,
with a slope that is broadly consistent with the linear model with interactions in Section 4. The
conditional standard deviation appears to be fairly constant across Sj values, although the pos-

     Recall that our data set is limited to using country-level dollar invoicing shares for the importer, Sj , as opposed to
the ideal of dyad-specific invoicing shares. We conjecture that the quantitative importance of the importer’s country-
level dollar invoicing share provides a lower bound on the importance of the (unobserved) dyad-level invoicing share.

terior uncertainty is large. However, the conditional distributions are heavy-tailed, as evidenced
by the fact that the LOO criterion strongly prefers the K = 2 mixture model to the K = 1 model
with normally distributed heterogeneity.
    Fig. 11 provides further evidence that dollar pass-through is high on average but highly het-
erogeneous, and about 15% of the cross-dyad variance of dollar pass-through is explained by the
importer’s dollar invoicing share. The figure shows histograms of the posterior draws of the
cross-dyad median and interquartile range (IQR) of γij for the 1856 dyads in the sample. The
median dollar pass-through is consistent with the panel regressions in Section 4 (median median
0.76), but there is substantial heterogeneity in pass-through across dyads (median IQR 0.13), a fact
we would not have been able to establish using standard linear panel regressions. The figure also
plots the histogram of posterior draws of the cross-sectional correlation coefficient of γij and Sj ,
after winsorizing γij by 5% in each tail to reduce the influence of outlier dyads. There is a clear
positive correlation (median correlation 0.39), again demonstrating that dyads with high dollar
pass-through also tend to have a high importer dollar invoicing share. By squaring the correla-
tion, we obtain the R2 value in a cross-dyad regression of (winsorized) dollar pass-through on
the importer’s dollar invoicing share. The posterior median indicates that the importer’s dollar
invoicing share explains 15% of the cross-dyad variance in dollar pass-through, with 95% equal-
tailed posterior credible interval [7.1%, 24.6%]. Thus, knowledge of the importer’s country-level
dollar invoicing share substantially improves the ability to explain cross-dyad heterogeneity in
price pass-through, as predicted by the dominant currency paradigm.


5.3    Results: trade elasticity
Similar to the price pass-through results, we find that the cross-dyad heterogeneity of the elas-
ticity of trade quantities with respect to the dollar exchange rate is related to the dollar invoicing
share. However, the results in this subsection generally come attached with higher posterior
uncertainty. Appendix B.4.1 provides additional results on parameters not highlighted below.
     Our empirical specification again follows Section 4. We set Yij,t = ∆yij,t in Eq. (7). We control
for one lag of bilateral and dollar exchange rates, as well as the contemporaneous value and lag
of importer log real GDP growth. The sample of dyad-year observations is the same as for the
price pass-through results.
     We report results for K = 4 mixture components. The LOO model selection criterion strongly
favors K = 3, 4, 5 against either K ≤ 2 or K = 6, 7, 8. K = 4 has a slightly higher LOO score
than K = 3, 5. However, we remark again that the results presented below are little changed
across specifications with K ≥ 3. We report results for K = 8 in Appendix B.4.2.

                                 Figure 14: See caption for Fig. 11.


    Fig. 12 shows that the conditional density of the dollar trade elasticity (expected to be a neg-
ative number, as also estimated in Section 4) shifts leftward when the importer’s country-level
dollar invoicing share increases. That is, the higher the dollar invoicing share, the larger in mag-
nitude is the dollar trade elasticity, on average. Notice, however, that the credible bands are
much wider here than for the price pass-through results. This is consistent with the larger stan-
dard errors on the interaction terms in the trade elasticity panel regressions in Section 4. Fig. 13
shows the conditional mean and standard deviation. While the posterior medians indicate that
the conditional mean function is downward-sloping over most of the range of Sj , the function is
estimated with substantial uncertainty.
    Fig. 14 summarizes the posterior of the sample distribution of γij . The median γij is in line
with the panel regression results in Section 4 (median median −0.11), but the heterogeneity is
substantial (median IQR 0.09). Again we find a strong (here: negative, as expected) correlation
between γij and Sj (median correlation −0.41), after winsorizing γij at 5% in each tail. Thus,
trade elasticities with respect to the dollar are highly heterogeneous, but dyads with the largest-
in-magnitude dollar elasticities tend to be the dyads with the highest importer dollar invoicing
share. The 95% equal-tailed posterior credible interval for the R2 in a cross-dyad regression of
(winsorized) dollar elasticity on the importer’s dollar invoicing share is [2.6%, 34.0%].

6     Aggregate implications of dominant currency pricing
Finally, we show that the dominant currency paradigm has important implications for how the
strength of the U.S. dollar affects aggregate trade volume and inflation in the rest of the world.


6.1    Effect of U.S. dollar on rest-of-world trade
Underscoring the quantitative significance of the dominant currency paradigm, we argue that the
U.S. dollar has substantial predictive power for aggregate trade among countries in the rest of the
world. That is, the dollar is important for predicting global trade, even when excluding countries’
direct trade with the U.S. Specifically, a 1% U.S. dollar appreciation against all other currencies in
the world predicts a 0.6–0.8% decline within a year in the volume of total trade between countries
in the rest of the world, holding constant various proxies for the global business cycle.
    We measure the elasticity of rest-of-world trade volume to the U.S. dollar by aggregating up
from our richest bilateral panel regression specification in Section 4. This produces informative
results that exploit our panel data set, unlike a simple annual time series regression of global
trade on an effective dollar exchange rate index. Consider the following regression model with
bilateral, dollar, and euro exchange rates, as well as interactions with dollar and euro import
invoicing shares:

                                                               e

                                                       e
                                        P2               

                                    + λij + θ0 Xij,t + εij,t .                                     (9)

Here Sj and Sje are the importer’s country-level dollar and euro invoicing shares, respectively,
while λij is a dyad fixed effect. Because we are interested in the effect of a dollar appreciation
against all other currencies, we do not control for time fixed effects. Instead, we control for the
same proxies for the global business cycle as in Section 4.5. Coefficient estimates for the above
panel regression on the post-2002 (post-euro) sample are given in Appendix B.2.
   The outcome of interest to us here is the response of rest-of-world (i.e., ex-U.S.) aggregate trade
volume to a 1% appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to all other currencies, holding constant the
global business cycle. Let wj denote country j’s total non-commodity import value from all coun-

tries except the U.S. in some reference year, normalized so that j6=US wj = 1.17 We conceptual-
ize the rest-of-world aggregate trade bundle as a Cobb-Douglas aggregate of individual-country
(gross) imports with weights wj . According to the bilateral interactive regression model (9), the
                                                     P
ceteris paribus effect of a 1% dollar appreciation on j6=US wj ∆yij,t , the weighted rest-of-world
imports from destination i, is given by
                                P                                        P
                                    j6=US   wj (βk + ψk Sj ) = βk + ψk      j6=US   wj Sj

k years after the appreciation, for each import destination i other than the U.S. Thus, to measure
the response of rest-of-world aggregate imports to a dollar appreciation, we simply have to com-
pute the impulse response of trade volume for an importer j whose U.S. dollar invoicing share
                   P
happens to equal j6=US wj Sj , the weighted average dollar invoicing share, computed using our
ex-U.S. import value weights wj . In practice, wj depends on the year in which import values
                                                                      P
are measured, but Appendix B.2 shows that the weighted average j6=US wj Sj fluctuates tightly
around a mean of 0.40 in the 2002–2015 sample, so we use the 0.40 value for our exercise.
    Fig. 15 shows that rest-of-world aggregate import volume contracts markedly following an ap-
preciation of the dollar against all other currencies. A 1% ceteris paribus dollar appreciation leads
to a 0.6–0.8% contraction in rest-of-world trade volume within the year (depending on whether
exporter or importer reported data is used), and this contractionary effect persists out to two
years. While our regression specification cannot be interpreted structurally, the magnitude of
the predictive effect underscores the importance of taking the dominant currency paradigm into
account. In contrast, the Mundell-Fleming framework leaves no role for the strength of the U.S.
dollar to influence trade volumes among countries in the rest of the world.


6.2       Spillovers from U.S. dollar to foreign inflation
Our results imply that fluctuations in the strength of the U.S. dollar, for example those caused by
U.S. monetary policy actions, have spillover effects on foreign inflation. We have shown that the
U.S. dollar exchange rate passes strongly through to bilateral import prices measured in the im-
porter’s currency, especially for countries whose imports are heavily invoiced in dollars. Given
a non-negligible import content in consumption, this implies that U.S. dollar movements will di-
rectly affect foreign CPI inflation, as discussed by Gopinath (2015). Moreover, if foreign firms
behave in a monopolistically competitive way, foreign producer prices will react to changes in
foreign import prices, although perhaps with a lag. Hence, the direct effect of U.S. dollar move-

ments on foreign CPI inflation may be amplified by endogenous producer responses.
    We now provide direct country-level regression evidence on the effects of the U.S. dollar
exchange rate on foreign consumer and producer prices. Gopinath (2015) computed back-of-the-
envelope estimates of these spillovers based on estimated country-level import price pass-through
and the import content of consumption. We instead directly regress countries’ CPI or PPI on the
dollar exchange rate. Additionally, we investigate the interaction of the dollar exchange rate and
the dollar import invoicing share.
    Specifically, we consider the country-level panel regression

inflation/high-depreciation episodes in the 1990s.18 We apply small-sample corrections to the
clustered confidence intervals, as recommended by Imbens and Kolesár (2016). See Appendix B.2
for details and regression tables.
     Fig. 16 displays the impulse response function of the CPI or PPI level to a 1% depreciation
of the local currency vis-à-vis the dollar. The top row shows results for CPI pass-through, and
the bottom row PPI pass-through. The first column shows the average impulse responses, corre-
sponding to a regression specification without interactions, i.e., ψk = 0 in Eq. (10). The average
pass-through of the dollar into CPI (resp., PPI) is 11% (resp., 28%) within the year, rising to a
cumulative pass-through of 23% (resp., 43%) after two years. The remaining three columns in
Fig. 16, which are based on the specification with interactions, show that the dollar pass-through
is larger for countries that have a substantial fraction of imports invoiced in dollars. Although the
confidence intervals are wide due to the small number of country clusters, the regression table

     The results are very similar if we use the full 1992–2015 sample but drop country-year observations for which
the arithmetic CPI inflation rate exceeds 30% annually (0.26 log inflation rate).


                                                                                                39
in Appendix B.2 shows that the contemporaneous interaction term is statistically significant at
the 10% level for both the CPI and PPI specifications, and also at the 5% level for the CPI speci-
fication. Hence, it appears that countries which invoice more in dollars experience higher dollar
pass-through into consumer and producer prices. We caution, though, that the magnitude of the
pass-through is imprecisely estimated when controlling for country and time fixed effects.
    Point estimates for analogous specifications with U.S. monetary policy induced exchange rate
fluctuations are consistent with the patterns documented above for raw exchange rate pass-
through. However, the variation in the monetary policy series zj,t is insufficient to deliver in-
formative confidence statements. The regression table is presented in Appendix B.2.


7    Conclusion
To understand the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on trade, the practice is to regress im-
port/export prices and volumes on bilateral or trade-weighted exchange rates. When viewed
through the lens of the Mundell-Fleming paradigm where prices are assumed to be sticky in the
producer’s currency, this is the appropriate regression specification.
    However, using newly constructed trade price and volume indices for over 2500 country pairs,
we document that the relevant predictor for bilateral trade prices and volumes is not the bilateral
exchange rate but the dollar exchange rate, even where the U.S. is on neither side of the trade
transaction. A 1% U.S. dollar appreciation against all other currencies in the world predicts a
0.6–0.8% decline within a year in the volume of total trade between countries in the rest of the
world, controlling for the global business cycle. We also demonstrate that the impact of the
dollar exchange rate is increasing in the fraction of a country’s trade that is invoiced in dollars.
We estimate that the importing country’s share of imports invoiced in dollars explains 15% of the
variance of dollar pass-through/elasticity across country pairs. These findings strongly support
the dominant currency paradigm as the empirically relevant framework for understanding the
international transmission of shocks and for policy analysis.
    On a methodological note, our Bayesian analysis demonstrates the ease with which rich hier-
archical econometric models can be estimated with the user-friendly open source software Stan.
We expect that semiparametric hierarchical panel data analysis will prove useful also in other
empirical settings where understanding cross-sectional heterogeneity is of primary importance.

A.1     Data
Here we provide further details on the Comtrade, WDI, and FRED data.

Comtrade country summary statistics. Table 4 lists summary statistics on the number of
observations for the 55 countries in our merged Comtrade/WDI dataset. The table also lists the
share of imports invoiced in U.S. dollars and euros for the 39 countries for which we observe
these measures (cf. Gopinath, 2015).

World Development Indicator data. The exchange rate is the World Bank’s “alternative con-
version factor” series (PA.NUS.ATLS), which corrects for redenominations and currency substitu-
tion, and is measured as an annual average of daily rates. Producer prices are given by the whole-
sale price index (FP.WPI.TOTL). Real GDP is measured at market prices in constant U.S. dollars
(NY.GDP.MKTP.KD). The GDP deflator is given by the ratio of nominal GDP (NY.GDP.MKTP.CD)
and real GDP. Consumer prices are constructed from CPI inflation rates (FP.CPI.TOTL.ZG), or if
inflation is not available, CPI levels (FP.CPI.TOTL). We use data for 1989–2015 only.

FRED data. We obtain the WTI oil price (POILWTIUSDA), VIX (VIXCLS), and 1-year Treasury
bill rate (DTB1YR) from the St. Louis Fed’s FRED database. Annual series are averages of daily
indices.


A.2     Bayesian analysis: priors and model selection
A.2.1   Hyper-priors

Here we describe the remaining parts of the prior not specified in the main text. We incorporate
time fixed effects δt by adding T − 1 dummies in the covariate vector Xt , so the parameter vector
θ includes these parameters. We impose the following priors, all mutually independent:

                             α ∼ Cauchy(0, 5),        θj ∼ Cauchy(0, 5),

                         σ ∼ HalfCauchy(0, 1),        τ ∼ HalfCauchy(0, 1).

Cauchy(0, a) is the centered Cauchy distribution with interquartile range 2a. HalfCauchy(0, a)
is the restriction of the Cauchy(0, a) distribution to the positive real line. Since the units of our

covariance kernel

            C(s1 , s2 ; A) = exp{−A(s1 − s2 )2 } + 0.0001 × 1(s1 = s2 ),                    s1 , s2 ∈ [0, 1].

The second term on the right-hand side above helps avoid numerical issues in the warm-up phase
of the MCMC algorithm, but it is small enough to negligibly affect the final output (the dollar
invoicing share Sj is measured as a fraction between 0 and 1).

A.2.2    Bayesian leave-one-out cross-validation

The Bayesian Leave-One-Out (LOO) cross-validation criterion of Gelfand et al. (1992) is given by
the cross-sectional sum of leave-one-out predictive densities
                       X
           LOO =            log f (Yij | Rij , Xij , Y−(ij) , R−(ij) , X−(ij) )
                       ij
                       X          Z
                   =        log       f (Yij | Rij , Xij , ϑ) f (ϑ | Rij , Xij , Y−(ij) , R−(ij) , X−(ij) ) dϑ.
                       ij


Here ϑ collects all model parameters. Yij = (Yij,1 , . . . , Yij,T ) collects all observed outcomes for
dyad (i, j) across time, and similarly for the covariates Rij and Xij .20 The notation Y−(ij) means
all observed outcomes for dyads other than (i, j), and similarly for R−(ij) and X−(ij) . The LOO
criterion is large when the model yields good (leave-one-out) out-of-sample fit, given knowl-
edge of the covariates. This is similar in spirit to the well-known non-Bayesian leave-one-out
cross-validation criterion. We use a Pareto-smoothed importance sampling estimate of LOO, as
developed by Vehtari et al. (2017) and implemented in Stan.

  19
     Because the mixture component labels are not identified, we additionally impose the normalization µ0,1 <
µ0,2 < · · · < µ0,K . Stan accomplishes this by reparametrizing the vector (µ0,1 , . . . , µ0,K )0 into an unconstrained
parameter, while adjusting for the Jacobian of the transformation in the posterior density.
  20
     Since we have an unbalanced panel, the dimension of Yij , Rij , Xij actually varies across dyads.

B.1    Data: Comparison of Comtrade and BLS price series for the U.S.
Here we compare our unit value indices to survey price indices from the U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics. The BLS provides U.S. import price indices by locality of origin for Canada, E.U., France,
Germany, U.K, Latin America, Mexico, Pacific Rim, China, Japan, ASEAN, Asia Near East, and
Asian Newly Industrialized countries. As these price indices are constructed from surveys, their
comparison with our unit value based indices can help gauge the effectiveness of our techniques
to deal with the unit value bias and other potential mismeasurement inherent in customs data.
    To arrive at comparable series, in this subsection we follow BLS in using Laspeyres indices
of total (commodities and non-commodities) goods prices from our data set. For regions with
multiple countries, we aggregate country level growth rates using Comtrade import values with
a two year lag. Still, the series are not fully comparable because BLS’ preferred price basis is f.o.b.
(free on board) while import values recorded at customs are c.i.f. (cost, insurance and freight),
and not all countries included in BLS regions are in our database.
    Our indices constructed from Comtrade unit values track the BLS import price indices fairly
well, as shown in Figs. 17 and 18. These figures compare the linearly detrended logged indices,
since our regressions use log growth rates and absorb any disparity in average growth rates in
the intercept. The growth rates of our indices for Canada, Japan, Mexico, and the aggregated
Latin America and Asia Near East match those of BLS remarkably well. The comparison with
some Asian countries suggests that a unit value bias may still be present, causing the unit value
series to be somewhat more volatile than the BLS price series. Nevertheless, for every country
group and individual country except Germany, the correlation coefficient between the Comtrade
and BLS growth rates is high. Finally, the match for European countries seems acceptable, with
the year 2008 being an exception. A closer inspection of the case of Germany reveals that a
couple of products (transport vehicles) with large import shares experienced substantial unit
value decreases that year according to Comtrade, leading our indices to decline while the BLS
index shows an increase.

sample. We compute results for the subsample 2002–2015, roughly corresponding to the second
half of our data set, and also corresponding to the sample used for the euro regressions in Sec-
tion 4.5. Figs. 19 and 20 show price and volume impulse responses for the 2002–2015 subsample
that correspond to the full-sample results in Figs. 1 and 3 in Section 4. The price pass-through
impulse responses of bilateral and dollar exchange rates are similar to the full-sample results.
However, the post-2002 USD cumulative trade elasticity is substantially negative at lags of 1 and
2 years, whereas the level effect is close to zero at lags 1 and 2 on the full sample.

Euro regressions. Tables 6 and 7 display the results of the price pass-through and trade elas-
ticity regressions in Section 4.5 involving the euro exchange rate. The regressions do not control
for time fixed effects but do include the aggregate control variables listed in Section 4.5. Specifi-
cations (1) and (4) focus on the bilateral and euro exchange rates, specifications (2) and (5) add the
dollar exchange rate, and specifications (3) and (6) include interactions with the dollar and euro
import invoicing shares. Sje is the importing country’s share of imports invoiced in euros from
Gopinath (2015). The interactions are statistically and economically significant and mostly have
the expected signs in the price pass-through regressions: A higher share of euro (resp., dollar)
invoicing implies a higher pass-through from the euro (resp, dollar) exchange rate. In constrast,
the interaction terms are imprecisely estimated in the trade elasticity regressions.

Weighted average dollar invoicing share. Fig. 21 depicts the weighted average dollar import
                 P
invoicing share j6=US wj Sj used in Section 6.1, where the ex-U.S. non-commodity import value
weights wj have been computed for each year in our sample. Notice that the weighted average
fluctuates tightly around a mean of 0.40.

CPI and PPI regressions. Table 8 displays the results of the country-level regressions used
for constructing the CPI and PPI impulse responses in Fig. 16. The table displays 95% confi-
dence intervals rather than standard errors because the small number of countries necessitates the
use of small-sample corrections. Specifically, we use the bias-reduced “LZ2” clustered variance-
covariance matrix estimator, along with Student-t critical values and the “BM” data-dependent
degrees of freedom measure, as developed by Imbens and Kolesár (2016).

Robustness to data choices. We now show that our panel regression results are robust to
a number of deviations from the baseline specifications in Section 4: using raw data instead
of imputed and outlier-adjusted, using total goods indices rather than non-commodities, and
changing the price index definition.
    Table 9 provides exchange rate price pass-through regression results for three variations of
our baseline specification. For brevity, we focus on importer-reported data and the specification
with bilateral and USD exchange rates as regressors (but not interactions). The first data column in
the table repeats our baseline results from column 5 in Table 1. The second to fourth data columns
vary one of each of the following data choices relative to the baseline: using raw data instead of
imputed and outlier-adjusted, using total goods instead of non-commodities, and using Laspeyre
price indices instead of Fisher. Across all these variations, the USD exchange rate quantitatively
dominates the bilateral exchange rate, and the magnitudes of the contemporaneous and lagged
coefficients are similar to the baseline. As expected, the R2 of the regression is substantially
smaller when outlier product categories are not removed.
    Table 10 displays trade elasticity regression results for the same three variations of our base-
line specification. We again use importer-reported data and the specification with bilateral and
USD exchange rates as regressors (no interactions). The first data column in the table repeats
our baseline results from column 5 in Table 3, while data columns two through four consider the
same variations around the baseline as in Table 9. Our baseline results are quantitatively robust
to these variations, except for the case where we use raw data instead of the imputed and outlier-
adjusted data. In the raw data, trade volumes appear uncorrelated with the dollar exchange rate,
conditional on the bilateral exchange rate. We strongly prefer the cleaned data set used in this
paper, since the raw Comtrade data exhibits several extreme outliers in the product category and
time dimensions, as well as non-randomly missing data points (Boz and Cerutti, 2017).


B.3    Bayesian analysis: MCMC settings and diagnostics
We execute Stan through Matlab R2016b using MatlabStan 2.7.0.0, which in turn calls CmdStan
2.14.0. For each model specification, we run Stan’s No U-Turn Sampler for 2,500 iterations after
discarding 1,000 warm-up iterations, storing every 5th draw. The MCMC routine is initialized
at parameter values drawn uniformly at random (after the parameters have been transformed to
unconstrained support). We use Stan’s default settings for adaptively tuning the MCMC routine
in the warm-up phase. Our results are completely insensitive to the initialization.
    The sampler robustly delivers near-independent draws from the posterior distribution in rea-
sonable time. The stored posterior draws of most model parameters exhibit essentially zero serial

correlation after a handful of lags. The only parameters that do not exhibit rapid mixing are those
MGLR parameters µ0,k , µ1,k , ωk , Ak that correspond to mixture components k with low posterior
probability πk (·) in model specifications with large K, but these parameters negligibly influence
the features of the posterior that we care about. Depending on K and the random initial parame-
ter draw, it takes 2–60 hours to run the MCMC routine for each specification on a personal laptop
with a 2.30 GHz processor and 8 GB RAM (no parallel computing is involved). In our experience,
it is often sufficient to run the algorithm for 2–4 hours to get a sense of the results.


B.4     Bayesian analysis: Supplementary results
B.4.1   Additional model parameters

For completeness, we now report posterior summaries of the model parameters that are not of
primary interest to us.
    First we report results for the price pass-through model with K = 2. Fig. 22 reports the
posterior distribution of the cross-sectionally constant regression coefficients. The results are
consistent with the panel regressions in Section 4. In particular, the lagged exchange rate changes
are economically insignificant. The posterior for the parameter γ̄ (the sum of the dollar and
bilateral pass-throughs) is concentrated close to 1, indicating near-complete total pass-through
within a year. Fig. 23 reports the posterior of the mean α and standard deviation τ of the random
effects distribution for the dyad-specific effects λij , as well as the idiosyncratic standard error σ.
    Figs. 24 and 25 provide the same posterior summaries for the trade elasticity model with
K = 4. Again, these results are consistent with the panel regressions from Section 4.

B.4.2   Robustness to number of mixture components

Here we show that the results in Section 5 are robust to varying the number K of components in
the MGLR prior for the cross-sectional distribution of dollar pass-through. Specifically, we here
report results for K = 8. Figs. 26 and 27 are the K = 8 analogues of the price pass-through
Figs. 9 and 11 (which had K = 2), while Figs. 28 and 29 are the K = 8 analogues of the trade
elasticity Figs. 12 and 14 (which had K = 4). Clearly, the additional mixture components in the
K = 8 specifications receive very low posterior probability.
