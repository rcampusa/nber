Factor Abundance Theory in a Historical Context

Heckscher-Ohlin theory has been confounded by empirical contradictions dating back to

the paradox unearthed by Wassily Leontief.1 Following the notation and methodology of

Jaroslav Vanek (1968), scholars have focused both on goods trade and its relationship to

factor abundance (Edward E. Leamer 1980), as well as the factor content of trade itself

(Harry P. Bowen, Leamer, and Leo Sveikauskas 1987). To try to deal with the Leontief

paradox in the Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek (HOV) theory one can allow for differences in

cross-country productivities (Daniel Trefler 1993). To get an even closer fit, other

modifications have been suggested by Trefler (1995) and Donald R. Davis and David E.

Weinstein (1999) such as home bias in consumption, non-traded goods, and models

without factor price equalization. Still, there remains a huge gap between theory and

reality. Trefler (1995) coined the term ‚Äúmissing trade‚Äù to depict the extent to which

measured trade is still negligible compared to the prediction of the pure theory.

        Were they here to comment, Heckscher and Ohlin might not condone the use of

their theory in today‚Äôs very different global economic environment, but the fathers of

trade theory might be impressed by the technical apparatus we have developed to

evaluate their ideas. It is fair to say that their original exposition (Eli F. Heckscher and

Bertil Gotthard Ohlin 1991) lacks for solid empirical evidence. They drew heavily on

introspection and casual empiricism about trade between, and factor intensities in, the

New and Old Worlds‚Äîfor example, as in Ohlin‚Äôs discussion of trends in wages and land

rents in Europe and Australia (pp. 91‚Äì92). By the standards of modern empirical analysis

we might consider this kind of evidence anecdotal‚Äîbut can we do any better? For a

fairer test of their own creative efforts, would not Heckscher and Ohlin wish for us to


    1
       Leontief (1953a) shocked everyone when he computed a U.S. input-output table for 1947 and
discovered that the seemingly capital-abundant and labor-scarce United States was actually engaging in net
labor export via trade, with a capital-labor ratio in imports 60 percent higher than exports.

                                                    1
take our considerably refined empirical skills back in time and at least test the model in

the historical context for which it was first designed? This is our goal. By bringing to the

discussion new data from a different economic and political era, we can gain a new

perspective.

        In many ways, the pre-1914 period of economic liberalization and shrinking

transport costs offers a superb historical laboratory for trade theory, and, by extension for
the study of the political economy of a globalizing world. A strand of the economic

history literature has already found strong support in that era for several features of

standard theory, including predictions of factor price convergence and the pattern of

goods trade.2 In their book Globalization and History (1999), Kevin H. O‚ÄôRourke and

Jeffrey G. Williamson blend these findings into a broader study of goods and factor

market integration, its causes and impacts, in the period 1870 to 1914. Political scientists

are also rightly fascinated by this period, for related reasons. Path-breaking studies such

as Ronald Rogowski‚Äôs Commerce and Coalitions (1989) introduced a new approach to

comparative political economy informed by trade theory‚Äôs penetrating insights on

comparative advantage, factor endowments, factor rewards, and political cleavages

between interest groups. In this broad multidisciplinary literature the Heckscher-Ohlin

model stands as a central explanatory device, so it is essential that we be sure of its

accuracy and usefulness. Until now we have not seen any direct tests of its validity in the

manner of factor content studies: our paper fills that gap.

        Several features of the pre-1914 era make it a potentially better laboratory for

testing pure trade theory compared to today. We know, first, that there were much lower

trade barriers then than now, and this could be why the theory fails in the present where




    2
      On factor price equalization see Kevin H. O‚ÄôRourke, Alan M. Taylor, and Jeffrey G. Williamson
(1996) and O‚ÄôRourke and Williamson (1994). On goods trade and factor endowments see Antoni
Estevadeordal (1993).

                                                2
tariffs and quotas lead to ‚Äútoo little‚Äù trade.3 Second, in the last century, certain

endowments were very skewed in their distribution, most famously the agricultural land

that differentiated the endowments of the New World from the Old. Today, in contrast,

many of the countries studied have much more similar endowment patterns: there may be

enough variation to reveal missing trade, but the omission of economies with radically

different endowments is a weakness.4 Third, we note that there were considerable

divergences in productivity across countries circa 1913, just as there are today. Over the

course of the twentieth century we have seen dramatic productivity convergence only

within a narrow club of countries‚Äîmostly the OECD. 5 By doing our tests circa 1913, we
are in no way making the problem simpler for ourselves by avoiding an essential

ingredient in the ‚Äúmissing trade‚Äù puzzle: the possibility of international productivity

differences.6


    3
       On trade barriers then and now see, for example, World Bank (1991). Tariff levels were in the single-
or low-double-digit range before 1914, and much larger in the postwar period, especially in developing
countries. Quotas were virtually nil before 1914, and considerable in the late postwar period. Supporting
this idea, recent work by Dalia Hakura (1996) suggests that the contemporary missing trade problem has
not been as serious in a set of trading countries with lower trade barriers, namely the European Union.
     4
       For example, Davis and Weinstein (1999) find inevitably that OECD countries are clustered together
with similar capital-labor ratios, a feature arising from those countries‚Äô similar levels of development and
endowments. Their Rest-of-the-World data point lies far away from the OECD group, but this gives a great
deal of leverage to one point, so much so that it is thought prudent to exclude it from the tests as a
sensitivity check. And in terms of data quality, the Rest-of-the-World point uses less consistent data,
making for a more fragile procedure.
     5
       The first studies of long-run convergence (Moses Abramovitz 1986; William Baumol 1986) used the
16-country data of Angus Maddison (1982). Baumol was the first to note the postwar failure of
unconditional convergence in wider samples that included less-developed countries. The origin of this
failure was first identified by Steven Dowrick and Duc-Tho Nguyen (1989); they found conditional
convergence controlling for investment and population growth.
     6
       However, as Elhanan Helpman (1998) notes, productivity differences create another puzzle: namely,
where do these differences in productivity originate? In historical work, a disturbing answer was brought to
the fore by the controversial work of Gregory Clark (1985). He found no compelling economic reason why
one New England cotton textile operative performed as much work as 1.5 British, 2.3 German and nearly 6
Greek, Japanese, Indian or Chinese workers. After controlling for capital intensities, breakdowns, human
capital, learning, and other effects, Clark was forced to admit the possibility of a purely cultural origin of
the differences.

                                                      3
Tests

Consider the standard Heckscher-Ohlin theory, in a world of C countries, I industries, and
F factors. Let the net output in country c be Xc (I √ó 1). The factor content of Xc is BXc,

where B is a matrix (F √ó I) of factor content coefficients. We make the standard

assumptions that each country is within the cone of diversification, factor price

equalization holds, and B is uniform across countries. Full employment implies that
BXc = Vc, where Vc (F √ó 1) is the factor endowment of country c. With the standard
assumption of uniform homothetic preferences, consumption Cc (I √ó 1) in country c

equals the country share of world expenditure (assumed equal to world output in this
study) sc times world consumption C W . By world market clearing, C W = XW = Œ£cXc.

Hence, Cc = sc X    W
                        , and the net goods trade T c             of    country     c equals

Tc = Xc ‚Äì Cc = Xc ‚Äì sc XW. If we denote world factor endowment by VW = BXW, then

                                     BTc = Vc ‚Äì sc VW.                                    (1)

Here, the left-hand side vector is measured factor content of trade (denoted MFCTf) and
the right-hand side is predicted factor content of trade (denoted PFCTf). Four tests of

equation (1) have been deployed in the contemporary literature, usually one factor at a

time and using the set of countries c as the sample:

‚Ä¢   The sign test focuses on whether the direction (i.e., sign) of MFCTf matches that of

    PFCTf. The results are displayed in terms of the fraction of correct predictions.
‚Ä¢   The variance ratio test (VR) asks on whether the variance of MFCTf is as large as
    PFCTf. If the theory were a perfect fit, the ratio of the variances would be unity.

‚Ä¢   The slope test calculates the slope coefficient from a regression of MFCTf on PFCTf.

    Again, if the theory were a perfect fit the slope would be unity.

‚Ä¢   The t-test reports the t-statistic for the slope test where the null is a zero slope. This

    test can detect a positive and significant relationship of endowments to trade, though

    it need not be one-for-one.


                                              4
What support for pure Heckscher-Ohlin theory have such tests yielded when applied to

contemporary data? Precious little. As measured by the sign tests, the successful

prediction rate just for the direction of factor trade is very poor, usually less than 50

percent‚Äîsaid to be ‚Äúno better than a coin flip‚Äù (Trefler 1995). The ‚Äúmissing trade‚Äù

problem in modern data squashes the variance ratio to less than 5 percent (0.03 in Trefler

1995; 0.0005 in Davis and Weinstein 1999), and the slope estimates turn out small,
sometimes negative‚Äîalbeit insignificant‚Äîvalues (Xavier Gabaix 1997; Davis and

Weinstein 1999). We shall now try to see how well the theory fitted the facts in its own

time.7


Data, Coding, and Aggregation

Data on net trade for the period circa 1913 were collected by Estevadeordal (1993) for

C = 18 countries: Argentina, Australia, Austria-Hungary, Belgium, Canada, Denmark,

Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden,

Switzerland, United Kingdom, and United States. The sources used were official national

reports of trade statistics, originating from such agencies as the Board of Trade (U.K.) or

the Department of Commerce (U.S). The principal problem in ensuring consistency

across countries was to set up a universal classification scheme for industries, since, prior

to World War Two, no standards had been developed and each country used its own

classification. The solution was to laboriously construct country-specific concordances

that would map each country‚Äôs sectors into selected sectors of the Standard International

Trade Classification (SITC, Revised 1961) at the two-digit level. In this way Tc was
constructed for I = 55 sectors expressed in U.S. dollars at market exchange rates.8



    7
       We are limited by data constraints from testing more embellished models such as Davis and
Weinstein (1999) in a historical setting such as this, an issue we take up in the conclusion.
     8
       For all the data described in this section, figures were collected for the year closest to 1913. Exchange
rates were taken from international compendia of exchange rates, where available, or from national sources.

                                                       5
        National product estimates were taken from Brian R. Mitchell (1980, 1983) and

Maddison (1995) and expressed in U.S. dollars at market exchange rates, providing the

basis for expenditure shares sc.9

        Endowment data Vc for C = 18 countries were collected by Estevadeordal (1993)

for F = 5 types of factor: capital stock, skilled and unskilled labor force, agricultural land,

and mineral resources (the latter proxied by annual production data). We made new

capital stock estimates for 1913 using a perpetual-inventory method applied to pre-1913

annual investment rates and real outputs (Maurice Obstfeld and Taylor 2002). The results

gave capital-output ratios for the terminal year 1913, and multiplying by national

products yielded capital stocks in U.S. dollars. The labor force figures originate from

Maddison (1982) and Mitchell (1980, 1983), using interpolation between census years.

The data on agricultural land in hectares is largely from the League of Nations (1927).

Mineral resources were estimated based on the value of annual production of coal and

petroleum plus twelve other minerals and ores; quantities were drawn principally from

Richard Pennefather Rothwell (various issues) and Mitchell (1980, 1983); prices from

Neal Potter and Francis Christy (1962).10
        We also need a factor use matrix B, which depends on the direct factor use matrix

Bd and the input-output matrix A. Calculating B = Bd(I ‚Äì A)‚Äì1 is straightforward if data on

technology can be found to construct Bd and A. In the pure version of the theory and
empirics it is assumed that B is constant across countries. The objective can then be




    9
       We do not calculate consumption or expenditure shares directly, but rather assume they are equal to
income or output shares. That is we set sc = GDPc/GDPw, and not, following the trade-balance correction of
Trefler (1995) as sc = Cc/Cw. This correction makes no material difference to our results.
    10
       The twelve ores are bauxite; copper; iron; lead; manganese; nickel; phosphate; potash; pyrites;
sulphur; tin; and zinc. Some data was also drawn from national sources of mineral production for various
countries.

                                                    6
easily met if we can construct B for just one country, and, like Trefler (1993, 1995) we

pick the United States as the source of the B data.11

         Construction of a historically useful direct factor use matrix B d for the U.S. is

possible using the study of Mary Locke Eysenbach (1976).12 She used the BLS-Leontief

1947 input-output table as the basis of her 165-industry classification scheme. Her capital

and labor coefficients came from the census of 1899, and her natural resource

coefficients, via Vanek (1963), from the 1947 input-output table. Already, the composite

nature of her sources alerts us to the fact that her estimated B d is not built from a

consistent database at one point in time, and this drawback should be kept in mind.

However, with this matrix available, it was straightforward to construct a concordance

mapping the 165 industries into the aggregated classification based on I = 55 industries

codes of the SITC scheme.

         Another inconsistency problem with B d arises because the categories (and the
figures for the U.S.) do not exactly match the endowment data Vc. This is not a problem

for all inputs. Total labor is a commensurate count measure in both cases. For capital

input, Eysenbach has a single stock measure expressed in U.S. dollars that we take as

corresponding to our factor endowment definition of capital, up to a deflator. She

measures nonrenewable resource inputs in the same units (dollars) as our endowment

measure of mineral resources, up to a deflator. However, her renewable resources

measure is not the same (neither in definition nor in units) as our endowment category of

agricultural land. Here there is likely to be an insurmountable discrepancy between the


    11
        A less restrictive but very data-intensive formulation would examine allow B to vary across
countries. See Davis and Weinstein (1999), who were fortunate to find this information easily to hand in a
consistent form in the OECD input-output database. Unfortunately, we have no consistent source of input-

        Gavin Wright (1990) used Eysenbach‚Äôs data in his study of resource abundance and U.S. industrial
success from 1879 to 1940. The methodology in Wright‚Äôs study followed in the Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek
tradition and examined the renewable and nonrenewable resource factor contents of exports and imports at
the benchmark dates.

measurement concepts of the two sides. This will invalidate some of our tests: consistent

units are needed for a meaningful benchmark of unity in the slope coefficient and

variance ratio tests. However, we can still deploy the sign test and t-test to see if the

directions of factor trade accord with theory.13

         Our final data collection task was to find a suitable input-output matrix A.

Leontief‚Äôs 1947 input-output table is famous but the date is too late for our purpose;

luckily, he also constructed a less well-known input-output table for the closer date of

1919 that we can employ here (Leontief 1953b). However, the 1919 input-output table

was built around a smaller classification scheme of only 41 industries, so yet another

concordance problem had to be solved in order to usefully align this dataset with the 55-

sector SITC classification scheme used in all the previous calculations. Considering the

extent of the overlap and consistency between these two classifications, we developed an




    13
        A summary of units is as follows. Labor is measured as the size of the workforce, and skilled and
unskilled are based on Eysenbach‚Äôs census data on the left, and on literacy rates across countries on the
right. (We do not use Eysenbach‚Äôs skilled and unskilled labor disaggregation, because it is based on wages
and occupational classifications, whereas the only cross-country V data we have partitions skilled and
unskilled labor by literacy.) Capital is measured in dollars, and uses Eysenbach‚Äôs U.S. census measure of
factor use on the left-had side and a perpetual-inventory estimate of capital stocks on the right.
Nonrenewable resources are in dollar terms from Eysenbach‚Äôs census data on the left, and from
Estevadeordal‚Äôs minerals measure on the right. Renewable resources are not commensurate on the left and
right of Equation (1), being based on Eysenbach‚Äôs dollar-value census data on the left and Estevadeordal‚Äôs
measure of agricultural land areas on the right. Eysenbach‚Äôs data does introduce deflation problems. Labor
and capital in B are per 1919 dollar, but we found the differences with 1913 dollars were small enough not
to change the results. Likewise, she measures nonrenewable resources in 1947 dollars per dollar of 1947
output, and here deflation must account for any changes in the relative price of nonrenewable resources
from 1913 to 1947. However, our preliminary investigation showed the price trend for such resources in the
United States to be almost exactly that of the GDP deflator, so again we made no price correction. When all
is said and done, then, how consistent are the two sides of the equation? One test is to ask if (B US XUS)f
 / VUS f = 1 for each supposedly commensurate factor f, since we have X data for the U.S. from Leontief‚Äôs
input-output table. For labor and capital we find the ratio is about 0.5 to 0.6, for nonrenewable resources
about 1.8. We deem this a remarkably good fit given the disparate sources of data (from 1919 input output
tables to 1947 resource coefficients to 1913 endowments) and the substantial manipulation of the data via a
three-way concordance mapping.

aggregation scheme of I = 25 industries shown in Table 1 via a new set of

concordances.14

          Of course, having to shift to such a high level of aggregation is always regrettable,

but particularly so here. We know that the use of output-weighted data (necessary to

preserve full-employment conditions) can cause downward bias in MFCT, as Feenstra

and Hanson (2000) demonstrated. Some industries within an aggregate sector may

intensively use an abundant factor and tend to export more, but an output-weighted

aggregation will not capture this, since it will not preserve the value of the factor content

of trade. Sadly, given the limitations of the historical data, we cannot avoid this problem.

Results

The results of applying the four tests (sign, t, variance ratio, and slope) to 18 countries are

shown in Table 2, Panel (a). We examine four individual factor types plus a set of pooled

factor types. In cases where the factors are pooled, we need to worry about the

commensurability not only on each side of the equation, but also from one type of factor

to the next. Units of, say, labor and capital, will never be commensurate in a physical

sense, so econometric adjustments are needed to permit valid estimation, specifically to

ensure homoskedasticity. Following Trefler (1995), we weight each observation by
œâfc = 1/(œÉ f s c1/2) where the œÉ f are the standard deviations of the pure HOV error term

MFCTfc ‚Äì PFCTfc for each factor f, and where sc is an adjustment for country size.15
           The results are quite discouraging. For capital and labor all the tests offer almost

no support for the theory. The sign test reveals a predictive power no better than a coin

flip. The t-tests are insignificant and often of the wrong sign. The variance ratio and slope

tests confirm that the fit is very poor, the slope is almost a horizontal line, and overall the

model can explain less than 1 percent of the overall variance of the dependent variable. In

other words, the model is performing in its historical setting just as badly as it performs



    15
         This is our preferred specification, but alternative weighting schemes produce similar results.

with contemporary data, and it shows measures of fit as appallingly low as those from the

present that we discussed earlier.

         So far so bad, but our hopes pick up a little bit when resources are considered. For

renewable resources, the non-commensurability problem confines us to the sign test and

the t-test, but the results are more favorable. The sign test rises to 67 percent and the

slope is significant and positive. For non-renewable resources, we can run the full battery

of tests, and we find the best fit of all. The sign test shows that we get the direction of

trade right for this factor in almost 4 out of every 5 cases, the t-ratio is a respectable 2.4,

the variance ratio is 0.38 and the slope is 0.35. Finally, what the regressions are telling us

can also be shown graphically, and Figure 1 depicts the scatter plots for the five cases in

Panel (a). The poor fit for labor and capital is immediately apparent given the diffuse

cloud of dots seen in each case. For resources, the basis for a tighter fit is also clearly
visible, and the pooling is a m√©lange of the two.

         Such results, though disappointing, are not too surprising given the equally weak

findings of the recent literature using the basic, unadorned specification of the HOV

hypothesis. To address these problems, various enhancements of the basic specification

have been proposed. These looser specifications appeal to theory as a basis for adding

additional parameters that allow for a better fit: for example, adjustments for factor

productivity differences and home bias in consumption. We now apply each of these

refinements to the historical data.


Factor Productivity Adjustment

Could the poor results be simply a manifestation of the Leontief problem? That is, could

we be measuring factor endowments incorrectly in raw units instead of in effective units?

Trefler (1993) showed that a way to correct for this problem is to rescale the endowment
vector Vfc by some measure of relative productivity. If such a productivity correction Œ¥c is

common to all factors in one country, then we would arrive at a productivity-corrected
endowment vector of the form VÃÉfc = Œ¥ c Vfc , and the analysis can then proceed as before. As

a proxy for Œ¥c, we use the relative GDP per capita, following Trefler.16

         The results are shown in Table 2, Panel (b). By our reading, productivity

adjustments do help the model fit better, by reducing ‚Äúmissing trade,‚Äù confirming the

    16
      In each case we set U.S. equal to 1. GDP per capita measures were taken from Maddison (1991).
Similar results were obtained using relative real wages from Williamson (1995) as a proxy for Œ¥c.

                                                12
findings on contemporary data. The sign test rises well above the coin-flip level for

capital, and improves for both types of resources. For non-renewable resources the slope

rises to 0.52 and the variance ratio to 0.51. However, the joy is short-lived, since slopes

and variance ratios are still demoralizingly low for both capital and labor, although the

ratio of 0.18 for labor is still quite high by the standards of contemporary tests (where the

ratio is normally is less than 0.1). Again, the pooled tests come out somewhere in
between the good results for resources and the poor results for labor and capital, as

expected.

         Are we justified in using GDP per capita as a productivity proxy? If this were an

imperfect measure of overall factor productivity, either due to measurement error, market

failures, or deviations from pure Hicks-neutral technological shifts, then our results might

be polluted. One way around this is to ‚Äúlet the data speak‚Äù by estimating the implied
technology shift parameters, rather than imposing them. In this method, the parameters Œ¥c

are chosen to maximize the fit of HOV equation, subject to the normalization that
Œ¥US = 1.17 Accordingly, we estimate the corresponding variant of equation (1):

Tests are based on a regression of measured (left-hand side) versus predicted (fitted

values on right-hand side). This method cannot be attempted on a single factor type since
it would exhaust all degrees of freedom. We have to pool, so we must use Trefler

weighting and omit renewable resources. The results appear in column (1) of Table 3.

Here the findings are somewhat encouraging. We use up 17 out of 54 degrees of freedom

(17 parameters, 54 observations), but to good effect. Over all factors, the sign test shows

successful predictions in more than 4 out of 5 cases, the t-ratio is very significant, the

         Obviously, in a less interesting exercise, we can scale each factor and country, with a free choice of
Œ¥ fc, then we can obtain a perfect fit in the HOV model by using all degrees of freedom. (Trefler 1993;
1995).

variance ratio is 0.54 and the slope of 0.55 is not to be sneezed at. We also reject the null
restriction Œ¥c = Œ¥US = 1. However, a break down of the variance ratio test by factor shows

that, again, the good fit for resources remains the driving force for these results

(VR = 0.64). Missing trade is still overwhelming for labor and capital (VR < 0.05).
        Do the implied Œ¥c make sense? In a sharp theoretical insight that illuminated some

confusion in the debate Gabaix (1997) warned of the pitfalls of comparing the implied Œ¥c

                                                    14
to seemingly-independent measures of productivity, such as GDP per worker, and using

these results for inference about the fit of the HOV theory. For example, in the case of

labor, the measures are not independent at all. In fact, even if there is complete missing

trade, the productivity correction turns out to be exactly a weighted total productivity
measure. We can report that our Œ¥c look quite reasonable upon inspection, and they have a

correlation with GDP per capita of about 0.7. But (to repeat) this says nothing at all about

the fit of the HOV theory: only missing trade tests can do that. Still, the correlation is not

irrelevant: it should reassure us that any better fit was achieved without the data having to

be manipulated through implausible productivity corrections.18

         We should not overlook the main points here. The results look ‚Äúrelatively‚Äù good.

For comparison, the overall variance ratio was about 0.21 (or 0.39) in Table 2 without

(respectively, with) the imposed productivity correction. And there is some improvement

over the results on contemporary data: according to Trefler and Susan Chu Zhu (2000,

Table 1), the highest all-factor VR of 0.33 was found by Trefler (1995), with all other

examples yielding an overall VR less than 0.09. Hence, our historical study provides

stronger support for the idea that the Leontief hypothesis will play an important part in

reconciling the HOV theory to the data. But the results are not perfect, and we know that

the fit for individual factors like capital and labor is poor, whilst the fit for resources is

much, much better.


Home Bias in Consumption

A second extension to the basic model, also due to Trefler (1995), allows for home bias

in consumption. This extension admits Armington preferences where country c

consumption is now a weighted combination of home goods and foreign goods,


    18
      Another check involves simple inspection of the implied Œ¥ c, and an appeal to introspection to
determine whether they look reasonable. They do, but with some exceptions. It might be questioned, for
example, whether Norway really languished with a productivity of merely 10 percent of the U.S. level.

                                                 15
Cc = sc[Œ±cXc + Œ±c*(XW ‚Äì Xc)], with Œ±c > 1 and Œ±c* < 1. National budget balance requires

Œ±c sc + Œ±c*(1 ‚Äì sc) = 1, so one can eliminate the Œ±c. Here, the estimating equation (1)

becomes

                                         BTc = Œ±c*(Vc ‚Äì sc VW).                                        (1‚Ä≥)

One way to estimate the Œ±c* is to impose ‚Äúworld‚Äù market clearing, F restrictions of the
form     Œ£c BTc = Œ£c    Œ±c* (Vc ‚Äì sc VW) = 0.19 Another is to let the Œ± c* be free: since 18
countries do not comprise the entire world, most likely              Œ£c BTc = 0 fails to hold. 20 We
follow Trefler and impose restrictions but the results are not much different when the
paramaters are free. In the case (1 ‚Äì Œ±c*) = 0, we have no home bias and revert to the

standard theory. In the case (1 ‚Äì Œ± c*) = 1 we have complete home bias. Values of

(1 ‚Äì Œ±c*) between zero and one are assumed to correspond to a varying degree of home

bias.

          Already, we can intuitively see what is going to happen. Suppose the home bias
were constant across countries, with Œ±c* = Œ±*. Clearly, a regression based on (1‚Ä≥) will

then set Œ±* equal to the slope from (1) and the fit will improve dramatically. A corollary

of the OLS algebra is that the implied slope of measured (left-hand side) versus predicted

(fitted values on right-hand side) will be unity by construction! This eliminates the slope

test as a meaningful criterion. However, the other tests are still good‚Äîfor example, the

variance ratio is not necessarily equal to unity in these regressions, nor is the R2.
          The results of applying these tests are shown in columns (2) and (3) of Table 3.
Again, if we want to allow for country-specific parameters we can only gain sufficient
degrees of freedom by pooling. We indicate whether an (imposed) productivity correction




    19
       For simplicity, we omit the (empirically less-relevant) adjustments for trade imbalances discussed by
Trefler (1995). Equation (1‚Ä≥) is estimated by OLS with the F linear restrictions imposed.
    20
       We do indeed find that in all cases the null restriction Œ£ c BTc = 0 is rejected, perhaps because of
significant trade with countries outside the sample.

                                                       16
is included (2) or not (3).21 Compared to Table 2, the sign test improves in column (2) a
little (0.74 versus 0.50), but deteriorates in column (3) (0.65 versus 0.72), suggesting that
once a productivity correction is used, the home bias effects are of little help. The
variance ratio in both cases rises far above one, perhaps disconcertingly too far in the
direction of excessive (not missing) trade. But of greater concern are the implied home
bias parameters themselves. Judging whether these are reasonable is again a matter for
our introspection, but many of these estimates are beyond the bounds of what theory
permits. It is not clear what is implied by a value of (1 ‚Äì Œ±c*) that is outside the interval
[0,1]. Although the standard errors on the are large‚Äîone cannot reject the hypothesis that
all the coefficients lie in the unit interval‚Äîthe point estimates remain disturbing given
their extremely wide range. Thus, we react to the home-bias extension rather
pessimistically. Like Trefler (1995), we find some strange implied values for the
(1 ‚Äì Œ±c*) coefficients that make little sense in theory. Undoubtedly some kind of home-
bias effect will be a necessary part of a complete trade theory; but, given that the results
here are not markedly better as judged by fit, we are skeptical as to the usefulness and
relevance of the home-bias correction for our sample, at least in this form.


Conclusion

We have shown how it is possible to implement a test circa 1913 of the HOV theory. For

labor and capital the fit of the model is close to nonexistent. For resources, there is

evidence that the model fits really quite well. Introducing extensions to the model, the fit

is much improved by a Leontief-style productivity correction, but the results of a home

bias correction appear, in many cases, quite implausible.

         If we stand back for a moment, we can ask, following Trefler and Zhu (2000),

whether our empirical approach constitutes a ‚Äúcure‚Äù or merely a ‚Äúdiagnosis‚Äù of the failure

of the HOV model in its original historical context. We take away an overall impression


    21
        Though feasible, there would be few degrees of freedom left if we estimated both a productivity
correction (17 parameters) and a home bias correction (18 parameters). We did try such regressions. They
were not edifying. Among other problems, they implied negative productivity parameters, another reason
for us to suspect the home bias approach employed here.

                                                  17
that the modified HOV model is still dysfunctional in its own time, but not as

pathologically so as it is today. Knowing that skewed resource endowments were key

motivations for Heckscher and Ohlin, adherents of their approach might take some

comfort in the fact that missing trade appears less severe in the case of resources. But

with respect to the full set of factors, the simple factor-content approach seems to work as

well in its own time as it does today‚Äîthat is, not very well at all.
       Our historical tests therefore bring us to the same pessimistic point that the

contemporary literature arrived at in 1995‚Äîthe year Trefler announced the mystery of

the ‚Äúmissing trade.‚Äù For devotees of the Heckscher-Ohlin model, missing trade turns out

to be just as big a mystery a century ago. It could yet be seen as an even bigger mystery

given the historical and institutional circumstances of that time.
