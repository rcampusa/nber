Can macroprudential foreign exchange (FX) regulations on banks reduce the financial and
macroeconomic vulnerabilities created by borrowing in foreign currency? To evaluate the
effectiveness and unintended consequences of macroprudential FX regulations, we develop a
parsimonious model of bank and market lending in domestic and foreign currency and derive four
predictions. We confirm these predictions using a rich dataset of macroprudential FX regulations.
These empirical tests show that FX regulations:(1) are effective in terms of reducing borrowing in
foreign currency by banks; (2) have the unintended consequence of simultaneously causing firms
to increase FX debt issuance; (3) reduce the sensitivity of banks to exchange rate movements, but
(4) are less effective at reducing the sensitivity of corporates and the broader financial market to
exchange rate movements. As a result, FX regulations on banks appear to be successful in
mitigating the vulnerability of banks to exchange rate movements and the global financial cycle,
but partially shift the snowbank of FX vulnerability to other sectors.

          I. Introduction

          The global financial crisis has prompted renewed interest in tools to reduce
    macroeconomic and financial vulnerabilities, strengthen financial systems, and improve
    country resilience. A key component of this strategy is greater use of macroprudential tools —
    such as countercyclical capital buffers, tighter reserve ratios, leverage ratios, and restrictions
    on loan-to-value and debt-to-income ratios. Several papers have analyzed the use and
    effectiveness of many of these tools. 1 One type of tool, macroprudential foreign exchange (FX)
    regulations, however, has received less attention, despite the long-standing research
    documenting the vulnerabilities associated with currency mismatch.

          This paper seeks to fill this gap. It provides a detailed assessment of macroprudential
    regulations on the use of foreign currencies by banks, including theoretical predictions of how
    they could work and then empirical assessments of their direct and unintended consequences
    using a rich new dataset. We find that macroprudential FX policies are effective in
    accomplishing their primary goal of reducing bank exposure to foreign currency risk. But do
    they simply shift the risk elsewhere—similar to “shifting a snowbank” (a pile of snow) from
    one place to another? We find some evidence of a “shifting snowbank” effect, as reduced FX
    lending from banks causes some firms to increase FX debt issuance to investors. This shifting
    is only partial, however, so that aggregate exposure to FX debt declines. Our results also show
    that these FX regulations reduce the sensitivity of banks to currency movements, but are less
    successful at reducing the sensitivity of the corporate sector and the broader economy. As a
    result, although macroprudential FX regulations can substantially improve the resilience of
    the banking sector to the global financial cycle, the benefits to the broader economy may be
    more moderate, as some vulnerability shifts to other sectors that may be less informed and
    make less efficient lending choices.

          Exposure to foreign currency borrowing and currency mismatch has been a habitual
    concern, especially in emerging markets. Foreign currency exposure can increase a country’s
    vulnerability to sudden stops, currency depreciations, and financial and banking crises, as well
    as limit the ability of the exchange rate and monetary policy to respond to shocks (Rey, 2013).
    Despite these concerns, foreign currency exposure has continued to increase—especially in
    the corporate and household sector. 2 For example, over our sample period from the mid-


1   Cerutti et al. (2015) and Forbes (2018) are recent surveys of this extensive literature.
2   See Acharya et al. (2015), Bruno and Shin (2016), Chui et al. (2014, 2016), and Du and Schreger (2016).
                                                                                                              1
    1990s through end-2014, total FX borrowing in international debt securities and bank loans
    more than tripled to about $12 trillion USD. FX borrowing has continued to grow since the
    2008 crisis—with cross-border FX borrowing in international debt securities and FX loans
    increasing by around $2.5 trillion USD between 2009 and 2015—a sharp contrast to almost
    no change in comparable cross-border borrowing in local currency over the same period.
    Concerns about the macroeconomic and financial risks related to FX exposure have increased
    interest in using macroprudential FX regulations.

         Evaluating the effects of macroprudential FX measures has been challenging, however,
    partly due to insufficient data linked to the limited experience with these tools until recently,
    and partly due to identification challenges related to macroprudential regulations being
    introduced as a response to financial and macroeconomic developments. 3 An evaluation
    should assess not only the direct effects of these measures on the intended sector of the
    economy (such as banks), but also any spillovers or leakages as firms, banks, and other entities
    respond to the regulations. These types of unintended consequences have been highlighted in
    analyses of other types of macroprudential regulations and capital controls. 4 If these leakages
    and substitution effects occur, can these macroprudential policies achieve their primary goal
    of reducing aggregate country vulnerability to currency risk?

         This paper attempts to tackle these challenges in an assessment of the direct and indirect
    effects of macroprudential FX regulations on banks and the broader economy. We develop a
    parsimonious model of bank versus market lending, building on the seminal work of
    Holmstrom and Tirole (1997), but adding the dimension that lending and borrowing is also
    differentiated between domestic and foreign currencies. Domestic firms seek funding from
    lenders, but have private information about their productivity. Banks can screen firms at a
    cost and identify unproductive, low-productivity, and high-productivity firms, while market
    investors can only lend indiscriminately. Funding in foreign currency is cheaper than in
    domestic currency, but subject to exchange rate risk. When the domestic currency depreciates,
    low-productivity firms and their associated banks default. Macroprudential FX regulation
    increases banks’ cost of funding in foreign currency (if the regulation is a liability-side
    measure) or the equilibrium lending rate to firms (if an asset-side measure). Banks stop


3 Papers which include some discussion of macroprudential FX regulations as part of their broader analyses of
macroprudential tools are: Nier et al. (2011), Cerutti et al. (2015), Vandenbussche et al. (2015), and Avdjiev et al.
(2016b). Two papers which focus on FX regulations are De Crescenzio et al. (2017) and Aguirre and Repetto (2017),
but neither consider the leakages, broader effects on the economy, or sensitivity to currency movements.

                                                                                                                   2
lending to low-productivity firms, which respond by shifting some of their foreign currency
borrowing from banks to investors. Total factor productivity declines, as FX lending shifts to
investors (who cannot screen) and a share of FX lending shifts to less productive firms. The
overall impact on welfare is ambiguous and reflects a tradeoff between two forces: FX
regulation provides the benefit of reducing the social cost of bank failure after depreciations
at the cost of reducing output due to the less efficient allocation of FX lending.

     Our simple framework yields four testable implications for how macroprudential FX
regulations affect bank and corporate borrowing, cross-border capital flows, FX exposure in
different sectors of the economy, and macroeconomic vulnerability to exchange rate
movements. After an increase in macroprudential FX regulations: (1) banks borrow and lend
less in foreign currency (with no change in their borrowing in local currency); (2) firms shift
away from bank borrowing and increase their FX borrowing from market investors (with no
increase in firm and bank non-FX borrowing from investors); (3) banks are less exposed to
exchange rate movements; and (4) firms experience some reduction in their exposure to
exchange rate movements, but less than for banks.

     To test these four predictions, we build a rich data set on macroprudential FX
regulations, defined as policies directed at the broader financial system (compared to
prudential regulations that target individual institutions) and that are based on the currency
denomination of the capital transaction. The dataset is based on four sources that each
document and measure macroprudential FX regulations in different contexts or for different
countries: Shim et al. (2013), Vandenbussche et al. (2015), Cerutti et al. (2017) and Reinhardt
and Sowerbutts (2018). Our resulting data set includes information on macroprudential
regulations in 48 countries over the period 1995-2014. It has broader country and period
coverage of macroprudential FX regulations, as well as a more detailed categorization of
different types of regulations, than previously available.

     The empirical analysis confirms the four testable implications of the model, as well as
provides additional details on how tighter macroprudential FX regulations affect (or do not
affect) different types of cross-border capital flows, banks, and sensitivity to currency
movements. These results suggest that macroprudential FX regulations on banks are
successful in accomplishing their direct goals — of reducing the FX exposure of banks and
sensitivity of banks to currency movements. There is also some evidence that this occurs
because the regulations reduce domestic lending in FX, increase the average rate at which

                                                                                                  3
    banks lend, and reduce the share of banks’ non-performing loans, partly by reducing the
    number of entities to which they lend. The FX regulations, however, also appear to have the
    unintended consequence of causing companies to partially shift their FX funding toward
    international debt issuance, thereby mitigating the reduction in the aggregate exposure of the
    economy to FX risk. These results are robust to a series of sensitivity tests, including attempts
    to control for any potential endogeneity in the country’s decision to adjust FX measures.

         The magnitudes of the estimates also suggest that these direct and indirect effects of
    macroprudential FX regulations are meaningful. A tightening of FX regulations causes banks
    to reduce their cross-border borrowing in FX by about a third, a reduction equivalent to about
    0.5%-0.7% of GDP. For major emerging markets, such as Brazil or Indonesia, this is
    equivalent to reducing cross-border bank FX borrowing by more than half. At the same time,
    corporates increase FX debt issuance by about 10% of median annual FX debt issuance for the
    full sample, equivalent to a 15%-20% increase in FX corporate debt issuance for emerging
    markets such as Brazil and Indonesia. Combining these various estimates suggests that FX
    regulations still cause a meaningful reduction in the aggregate FX borrowing of the country—
    as the reduction in cross-border FX bank borrowing is substantially greater than the increase
    in FX corporate debt issuance—but that 10%-16% of the aggregate FX exposure shifts from
    banks to other sectors (such as investors and non-bank financial institutions). The effects are
    larger if the FX measures focus on bank liabilities instead of bank assets.

         Our results have several important implications. They support a growing body of
    research showing that macroprudential regulations can be effective at accomplishing their
    direct goals 5—in this case significantly reducing the FX exposure of banks to currency
    movements. This result is particularly relevant for the debate on how to address long-standing
    concerns about vulnerabilities related to foreign currency borrowing and currency mismatch. 6
    These vulnerabilities have prompted some countries to consider the use of capital controls.
    Our results suggest that any such countries could instead consider macroprudential FX
    regulations—especially countries for which capital controls (but not macroprudential FX
    regulations) are illegal, such as in the European Economic Area and in some trade agreements.

        The analysis also supports a rapidly growing literature that shows that even when
 macroprudential FX regulations work in terms of their direct goals, there can be leakages and
 unintended consequences. 7 Ranciere et al. (2010) highlight the importance of incorporating
 these potential leakages in any analysis of the impact of macroprudential FX regulations. In
 our analysis, these leakages are smaller than the direct effects of FX regulations, but still
 significant and economically meaningful.

         Finally, this paper moves beyond most other work on macroprudential regulations by
 assessing if the regulations achieve the broader goal of improving financial resilience. The
 results suggest that macroprudential FX regulations can improve the resilience of the banking
 sector to currency fluctuations, but do less to improve the resilience of the broader economy
 to currency fluctuations. This may still provide net benefits by improving the resilience of
 banking institutions that can create broader systemic vulnerabilities, just as when the
 snowplow moves the snow off the road, it makes the road system safer. Yet, just as the snow
 plow inevitably pushes a portion of the snow to block your driveway, macroprudential FX
 regulations can also shift some vulnerability to other sectors that are outside the regulatory
 perimeter. These other institutions may be harder to monitor and less well informed than
 banks, less able to screen for the risks inherent in corporate borrowing in FX, and less able to
 handle subsequent losses after a depreciation. This shifting snowbank of risks could mitigate
 some of the benefits of the macroprudential FX regulations.

        This paper proceeds as follows. Section II presents the theoretical model of bank and
 market lending in domestic and foreign currency. Section III describes the data, including the
 compilation of the dataset on macroprudential FX regulations. Section IV presents the
 empirical framework and reports results on the direct and indirect effects of FX regulations
 on bank and firm borrowing and debt issuance, including tests assessing the impact of different
 measures and sensitivity tests. Section V assesses the impact of the regulations on bank and
 corporate vulnerability to currency movements, including how this corresponds to other
 measures of bank performance. Section VI concludes.

          II. Theoretical Model

          Before assessing the impact of macroprudential FX regulations, we develop a simple
    framework of bank versus market lending in domestic or foreign currency. This framework
    shares with the seminal work of Holmstrom and Tirole (1997) the emphasis on asymmetric
    information between lenders and borrowers, with banks as special lenders because of their
    ability to reduce the consequences of asymmetric information at a cost. In Holmstrom and
    Tirole (1997), banks can monitor firms to reduce their moral hazard problem—a channel that
    is absent in our model. Instead, we focus on how asymmetric information affects a lender’s
    choice of the currency of their loans, where screening allows banks to identify more productive
    firms that are more likely to remain solvent after currency depreciations. 8 While Holmstrom
    and Tirole (1997) consider an environment with a single good, we consider two goods in order
    to allow for a choice between foreign and domestic currency. Our model is not intended to
    explain all of the factors that go into firm borrowing decisions, but instead provide structure
    and a framework for the key channels evaluated in the empirical analysis in the paper. 9

          To begin, assume that there are two dates, 𝑡𝑡 = 0, 1, and a domestic D and a foreign F
    good. Let 𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡 be the exogenous exchange rate (the value of D goods in terms of F goods) at date
    𝑡𝑡. We focus on FX risk (that is, the volatility of the exchange rate), with no changes to its
    expected level, which we normalize to one, 𝐸𝐸0 [𝑒𝑒1 ] = 𝑒𝑒0 ≡ 1. Specifically, the exchange rate
    process is bivariate and can involve either depreciation or appreciation:

                      𝑒𝑒1 ∈ {𝑒𝑒𝐿𝐿 , 𝑒𝑒𝐻𝐻 } ,                                                 (1)

      where 𝑒𝑒𝐿𝐿 < 1 < 𝑒𝑒𝐻𝐻 and the probability of an appreciation is Pr{𝑒𝑒1 = 𝑒𝑒𝐻𝐻 } ≡ 𝑞𝑞 ∈ (0, 1).

          The economy is populated by four groups of risk-neutral agents: domestic firms, banks,
    investors, and savers. There are many banks, investors, and savers, each of whom take the
    observable funding and lending rates as given and make zero profits due to competition. 10 A
    unit continuum of savers is each endowed with 𝐾𝐾𝐷𝐷 units of the domestic good and 𝐾𝐾𝐹𝐹 units of
    the foreign good, respectively. The outside option of savers is given by constant-returns-to-
    scale technologies that yield 𝑟𝑟𝐷𝐷 and 𝑟𝑟𝐹𝐹 < 𝑟𝑟𝐷𝐷 at 𝑡𝑡 = 1, respectively. Thus, banks and investors
    can fund themselves in domestic and foreign currency at these rates. Banks and investors are

8 Stiglitz and Weiss (1981) is a seminal paper modelling bank screening in a one-good economy.
9 For example, the model and paper do not attempt to explain structural differences across countries in the reliance
on bank funding versus other forms of funding.
10 Our results can be generalized to a setting in which lenders and firms share the surplus from lending.

                                                                                                                  6
 hedged, so they obtain funding in the currency of the loan to firms. 11

        At 𝑡𝑡 = 0, a unit continuum of firms 𝑗𝑗 ∈ [0,1] has a domestic investment opportunity
 normalized to unit size. Since firms do not have their own funds, they seek to borrow from
 either banks or investors in either domestic or foreign currency. Firms are heterogeneous in
 the productivity of their opportunities, which yield a safe return 𝐴𝐴𝑗𝑗 at 𝑡𝑡 = 1. Firm productivity
 is private information, but the distribution is publicly known and can take three values:

                     𝐴𝐴𝑗𝑗 ∈ {0, 𝐴𝐴𝐿𝐿 , 𝐴𝐴𝐻𝐻 },                                                (2)


 where 0 < 𝐴𝐴𝐿𝐿 < 𝐴𝐴𝐻𝐻 . A firm has low productivity with probability Pr�𝐴𝐴𝑗𝑗 = 𝐴𝐴𝐿𝐿 � ≡ 𝑝𝑝𝐿𝐿 ∈ (0, 1), and
 high productivity with probability Pr�𝐴𝐴𝑗𝑗 = 𝐴𝐴𝐻𝐻 � ≡ 𝑝𝑝𝐻𝐻 ∈ (0, 1 − 𝑝𝑝𝐿𝐿 ). There is universal
 protection by limited liability. If a firm cannot repay a loan at 𝑡𝑡 = 1, the bank or investor seizes
 its assets. A bankrupt firm receives zero and, for simplicity, the bank or investor recoups its
 asset value fully. Our results extend to partial recovery upon firm default.

        Relative to investors, banks are special in that they have access to a screening
 technology. Upon paying a fixed cost, 𝑐𝑐 > 0, a banker can identify the productivity of firms;
 that is, a banker who screens observes 𝐴𝐴𝑗𝑗 . In contrast, the investors do not observe firm
 productivity and, therefore, may be subject to adverse selection. This difference in screening
 technology is the only source of heterogeneity across different types of lenders.

        A. Lending in Domestic Currency

        To start, suppose that funding in foreign currency is unavailable (𝐾𝐾𝐹𝐹 = 0). Let 𝑅𝑅𝐷𝐷 denote
 the competitive lending rate in domestic currency offered by screening banks. In equilibrium,
 this rate covers the costs of funding in domestic currency and screening:

                     𝑅𝑅𝐷𝐷∗ = 𝑟𝑟𝐷𝐷 + 𝑐𝑐 .                                                      (3)

        Unproductive firms, 𝐴𝐴𝑗𝑗 < 𝑅𝑅𝐷𝐷∗ , do not receive funding in domestic currency from banks,
 while productive firms do. Funding in domestic currency is relatively expensive, so only high-
 productivity firms may attract funding in domestic currency from screening banks:




11 Such prudential behavior would arise endogenously if banks or investors had charter value (Keeley, 1990). Evidence

also suggests that banks are hedged against direct FX risk (e.g., Brauning and Ivashina, 2017; Borio et al., 2017).
                                                                                                                   7
                        𝐴𝐴𝐿𝐿 < 𝑟𝑟𝐷𝐷 + 𝑐𝑐 < 𝐴𝐴𝐻𝐻 .                                                         (4)

         As shown in Illustration 1, firms with 𝐴𝐴𝑗𝑗 ∈ {0, 𝐴𝐴𝐿𝐿 } receive no funding and do not invest,
 while high-productivity firms with 𝐴𝐴𝑗𝑗 = 𝐴𝐴𝐻𝐻 receive funds, invest, and make a safe profit, 𝜋𝜋𝐷𝐷 =
     𝐴𝐴𝐻𝐻 − 𝑅𝑅𝐷𝐷∗ > 0, which is the entire surplus from lending and investment. We assume that
 demand for domestic funding can be met, 𝐾𝐾𝐷𝐷 > 𝑝𝑝𝐻𝐻 . When lending is only in domestic
 currency, little credit and investment occurs, but both firms and banks never default.




           Illustration 1: Banks lend in domestic currency to high-productivity firms.


         To complete the analysis, we study when banks choose to screen. The resulting
 conditions also ensure that investors choose not to lend to firms in domestic currency (because
 investors and non-screening banks are identical). Intuitively, the screening cost must be low
 relative to the consequences of adverse selection faced by investors. 12

         B. Lending in Domestic and Foreign Currency

         We consider 𝑝𝑝𝐿𝐿 < 𝐾𝐾𝐹𝐹 < 1 − 𝑝𝑝𝐻𝐻 , so foreign capital can cover the financing needs of all
 low-productivity firms, but not that of all zero- and low-productivity firms together. We
 construct an equilibrium in which banks choose to screen and lend to low-productivity firms
 in F and to high-productivity firms in D. This equilibrium requires (i) low-productivity firms
 to default after depreciation and (ii) high-productivity firms to prefer stable funding in 𝐷𝐷 over
 cheaper funding in 𝐹𝐹. Let 𝑅𝑅𝐹𝐹 be the competitive lending rate in foreign currency. A bank that
 screens has opportunity costs 𝑟𝑟𝐹𝐹 + 𝑐𝑐; it receives 𝑅𝑅𝐹𝐹 after an appreciation and the liquidation

12There are two conditions. First, if 𝜌𝜌𝐷𝐷 > 𝑟𝑟𝐷𝐷 + 𝑐𝑐 = 𝑅𝑅𝐷𝐷∗ , where 𝜌𝜌𝐷𝐷 is the lending rate of investors, then only firms 𝐴𝐴𝑗𝑗 ∈
                                                                                 1−𝑝𝑝𝐿𝐿 −𝑝𝑝𝐻𝐻
{0, 𝐴𝐴𝐿𝐿 } may borrow. The investor receives zero from the proportion                         of unproductive firms and 𝐴𝐴𝐿𝐿 from the
                                                                                1−𝑝𝑝𝐻𝐻
residual proportion of low-productivity firms (due to partial default, 𝐴𝐴𝐿𝐿 < 𝜌𝜌𝐷𝐷 ). For investors not to choose to lend at
                                                                                                             𝑝𝑝
this rate, the funding cost in domestic currency must exceed the expected revenue from lending, 𝑟𝑟𝐷𝐷 > 𝐿𝐿 𝐴𝐴𝐿𝐿 . Second,
                                                                                                                  1−𝑝𝑝𝐻𝐻
if 𝜌𝜌𝐷𝐷 ≤ 𝑟𝑟𝐷𝐷 + 𝑐𝑐, then high-productivity firms 𝐴𝐴𝐻𝐻 may also seek funding from investors. The best possible rate investors
can receive is 𝜌𝜌𝐷𝐷 = 𝑟𝑟𝐷𝐷 + 𝑐𝑐. Then, investors do not lend in domestic currency when the funding cost in domestic
currency exceeds the expected revenue from lending, (1 − 𝑝𝑝𝐿𝐿 − 𝑝𝑝𝐻𝐻 ) ∗ 0 + 𝑝𝑝𝐿𝐿 𝐴𝐴𝐿𝐿 + 𝑝𝑝𝐻𝐻 𝜌𝜌𝐷𝐷 < 𝑟𝑟𝐷𝐷 , which results in an
                                                  (1−𝑝𝑝𝐻𝐻 ) 𝑟𝑟𝐷𝐷−𝑝𝑝𝐿𝐿 𝐴𝐴𝐿𝐿

 repayment after an appreciation requires 𝐴𝐴𝐿𝐿 𝑒𝑒𝐻𝐻 ≥ 𝑅𝑅𝐹𝐹∗ . Using 𝑞𝑞𝑒𝑒𝐻𝐻 + (1 − 𝑞𝑞)𝑒𝑒𝐿𝐿 = 1, we obtain
 𝐴𝐴𝐿𝐿 ≥ 𝑟𝑟𝐹𝐹 + 𝑐𝑐, which results in the intuitive ordering of firm productivity and funding costs:

                                 0 < 𝑟𝑟𝐹𝐹 + 𝑐𝑐 ≤ 𝐴𝐴𝐿𝐿 < 𝑟𝑟𝐷𝐷 + 𝑐𝑐 < 𝐴𝐴𝐻𝐻 .                                             (6)

 Borrowing in D yields a low but stable profit 𝜋𝜋𝐷𝐷 > 0. In contrast, borrowing in F is cheaper. If

                                      .   Intuitively, high-quality firms prefer stable funding in domestic currency

 over a high loss after a depreciation (associated with foreign currency funding).

           Given the competitive lending rate by screening banks, when is it optimal for investors
 to lend in foreign currency? Let investors offer a rate 𝜌𝜌𝐹𝐹 . If 𝜌𝜌𝐹𝐹 > 𝑅𝑅𝐹𝐹∗ , only unproductive firms
 can be attracted, which cannot be optimal. Thus, 𝜌𝜌𝐹𝐹 ≤ 𝑅𝑅𝐹𝐹∗ . Suppose only firms with low
 productivity are attracted, while high-productivity firms continue to borrow in domestic
 currency. 13 The highest possible benefit for investors arises for 𝜌𝜌𝐹𝐹 = 𝑅𝑅𝐹𝐹∗ , receiving
  𝑝𝑝𝐿𝐿
        (𝑞𝑞𝑅𝑅𝐹𝐹∗    + (1 − 𝑞𝑞)𝐴𝐴𝐿𝐿 𝑒𝑒𝐿𝐿 ). Thus, lending from investors in foreign currency is profitable if the
 1−𝑝𝑝𝐻𝐻

 screening cost saving is higher than the cost of adverse selection:

                                               1−𝑝𝑝𝐿𝐿 −𝑝𝑝𝐻𝐻
                                 𝑐𝑐 > 𝑐𝑐 ≡        𝑝𝑝𝐿𝐿
                                                                   𝑟𝑟𝐹𝐹 .                                              (7)




13When investors also attract high-productivity firms, one can show that lending from investors is profitable in this
                                                                     𝑟𝑟                             𝑒𝑒 𝑝𝑝 𝐴𝐴 +𝑝𝑝 𝐴𝐴
case whenever the screening cost is sufficiently high, 𝑐𝑐 > 𝑐𝑐̂ ≡ (𝑝𝑝 𝐹𝐹 ) − 𝑟𝑟𝐷𝐷 + (1 − 𝑞𝑞) �𝐴𝐴𝐻𝐻 − 𝐿𝐿 𝐿𝐿 𝐿𝐿 𝐻𝐻 𝐻𝐻�.
                                                                                     𝑒𝑒𝐻𝐻   𝐿𝐿 +𝑝𝑝𝐻𝐻            𝑒𝑒𝐻𝐻    𝑝𝑝𝐿𝐿 +𝑝𝑝𝐻𝐻
                                                                                                                                                   9
        In sum, the availability of cheap funding in foreign currency increases firm investment
 as low-productivity firms also receive funds and invest. The downside of this FX-lending
 induced credit boom is greater exposure to FX risk. After the domestic currency depreciates,
 low-productivity firms default and banks suffer losses. Illustration 2 shows this equilibrium
 with both domestic and foreign currency lending (but without macroprudential regulation).




 Illustration 2: Equilibrium for 𝒄𝒄 < 𝒄𝒄. Banks lend in domestic currency to high-
 productivity firms and in foreign currency to all low-productivity firms.



        This model therefore implies that high-quality firms receive domestic funding from
 banks (the preferred option to avoid currency risk), and lower-quality firms receive riskier
 funding in foreign currency. It is also possible that high quality firms prefer funding in foreign
 currency, possibly because they export and therefore have a natural hedge against currency
 risk. We explore this extension below in part E.

        C. Macroprudential FX Regulation of Banks

        Consider a regulator concerned about the financial stability of banks due to a social cost
 of bank failure ∆> 0. When the regulator imposes a macroprudential tax 𝜏𝜏 > 0 on banks, what
 is the impact on funding and lending, the sensitivity to FX risk, and welfare?

            i. Liability-side measures

        With a macroprudential tax on funding for banks in foreign currency (a liability-side
 measure), the effective cost of borrowing for banks after the tax is 𝑟𝑟𝐹𝐹 + 𝜏𝜏. If screening banks
 were to lend in F to low-productivity firms, the competitive lending rate would be: 14

                                     𝜏𝜏
                     𝑅𝑅𝐹𝐹∗∗ = 𝑅𝑅𝐹𝐹∗ + > 𝑅𝑅𝐹𝐹∗ .                                                (8)
                                     𝑞𝑞




14 The conditions for default after depreciation and high-productivity firms preferring borrowing in domestic currency

are relaxed. Low-productivity firms are assumed to continue to repay fully after appreciation, 𝐴𝐴𝐿𝐿 ≥ 𝑟𝑟𝐹𝐹 + 𝑐𝑐 + 𝜏𝜏.
                                                                                                                   10
      For intermediate screening costs, banks lend in F without a tax, but stop doing so after
the tax, where banks still lend to high-productivity firms in domestic currency:

                   1−𝑝𝑝𝐿𝐿 −𝑝𝑝𝐻𝐻
                                𝑟𝑟𝐹𝐹   − 𝜏𝜏 ≡ 𝑐𝑐𝐿𝐿 ≤ 𝑐𝑐 < 𝑐𝑐.                                       (9)
                      𝑝𝑝𝐿𝐿


      The benefit of taxing FX borrowing by banks is to reduce FX lending by banks (to zero
in our stylized model) and, therefore, reduce the probability of a (socially costly) default of
banks after depreciation. In expectation, his benefit amounts to (1 − 𝑞𝑞) ∆. There is a partial
substitution from bank lending in F to investor lending in F, as low-quality firms now obtain
some funding through FX bond issuance. Since investors are not subject to FX regulation, they
can still obtain funding in F at the rate 𝑟𝑟𝐹𝐹 and lend to firms of productivity 𝐴𝐴𝑗𝑗 ∈ {0, 𝐴𝐴𝐿𝐿 }.

      There is also a cost, however, associated with the tax on FX borrowing by banks. Not all
low-productivity firms receive FX funding because of the capacity constraint, 𝐾𝐾𝐹𝐹 < 1 − 𝑝𝑝𝐻𝐻 , so
                   𝐾𝐾𝐹𝐹                                                                                      1−𝑝𝑝𝐻𝐻 −𝐾𝐾𝐹𝐹
only a fraction            ∈ (0,1) of these firms continue to be funded. Also, a fraction                                   of
                  1−𝑝𝑝𝐻𝐻                                                                                       1−𝑝𝑝𝐻𝐻

unproductive firms are funded in 𝐹𝐹, so domestic output decreases after macroprudential FX

                                                        .   Illustration 3 shows the equilibrium.




Illustration 3: Equilibrium after macroprudential FX regulation of banks.

      Foreign currency borrowing from investors is feasible as long as adverse selection is not
                                                                                                            𝑝𝑝𝐿𝐿
too severe (Akerlof, 1970). Competitive investors are repaid from the fraction                             1−𝑝𝑝𝐻𝐻
                                                                                                                    of low-

quality firms, receiving 𝑒𝑒𝐿𝐿 𝐴𝐴𝐿𝐿 after depreciation, with full repayment 𝜌𝜌𝐹𝐹∗ after appreciation.
Thus, the competitive lending rate of investors is:

                                                         1−𝑝𝑝𝐻𝐻
                                                                𝑟𝑟𝐹𝐹 −(1−𝑞𝑞)𝑒𝑒𝐿𝐿 𝐴𝐴𝐿𝐿
                                                          𝑝𝑝𝐿𝐿
                                             𝜌𝜌𝐹𝐹∗   =                𝑞𝑞
                                                                                        .           (10)
                                                                                                                             11
 To ensure that investors can still attract low-quality firms, 𝑒𝑒𝐻𝐻 𝐴𝐴𝐿𝐿 ≥ 𝜌𝜌𝐹𝐹∗ , the share of low-
 productivity firms must be high enough (in order to limit the extent of adverse selection):

                                                 𝑝𝑝𝐿𝐿 𝐴𝐴𝐿𝐿 ≥ (1 − 𝑝𝑝𝐻𝐻 ) 𝑟𝑟𝐹𝐹 .        (11)

               ii. Asset-side measures

          Next, we show that if a macroprudential tax is applied to bank lending in foreign
 currency (an asset-side measure) instead of to bank funding in foreign currency, the result is
 qualitatively identical. If screening banks were to lend in F to low-productivity firms, the
 competitive lending rate would be 𝑅𝑅𝐹𝐹∗∗∗ = 𝑅𝑅𝐹𝐹∗ + 𝜏𝜏 > 𝑅𝑅𝐹𝐹∗ . Paralleling the previous analysis, we
 derive an intermediate range of screening costs such that banks lend in F only without a tax:

                        1−𝑝𝑝𝐿𝐿 −𝑝𝑝𝐻𝐻
                           𝑝𝑝𝐿𝐿
                                     𝑟𝑟𝐹𝐹   − 𝑞𝑞 𝜏𝜏 ≡ 𝑐𝑐𝐴𝐴 ≤ 𝑐𝑐 < 𝑐𝑐,                  (12)


 where 𝑐𝑐𝐿𝐿 < 𝑐𝑐𝐴𝐴 . Thus, the range of screening costs for which a given tax reduces bank FX
 lending and shifts to funding in foreign currency by investors (through debt issuance) is larger
 for liability- than for asset-side measures. Intuitively, a higher funding cost in foreign currency
 (from liability-side measures) affects the bank in all states, while a higher lending rate in
 foreign currency (from asset-side measures) only matters when the firm survives.

               iii. Evaluating the impact of macroprudential FX regulation

      Our model shows that macroprudential FX regulations generate both benefits and costs to
      the broader economy. The primary benefit is avoiding bank failure after depreciations
      (caused by a default of firms borrowing in FX)—with the attendant social and economic costs
      documented elsewhere. 15 The primary cost of FX regulations is a reduction in domestic
      output due to the credit rationing in foreign funding for low-productivity firms, since
      investors who cannot screen (mis-)allocate some FX lending to unproductive firms. Taken
      together, macroprudential FX regulation enhances welfare if and only if:

                                                                  1−𝑝𝑝𝐻𝐻 −𝐾𝐾𝐹𝐹

15   For estimates of the cost of bank defaults, see Laeven and Valencia (2013).
                                                                                                      12
 FX regulation is more likely to be welfare enhancing if the social cost of bank default is
 higher, or if the output loss from reduced FX lending to low productivity firms is smaller.

         iv. Sensitivity to FX risk

     The sensitivity of banks and firms to FX risk changes after macroprudential regulation.
To clarify how it changes, we consider the interim range of information costs derived in the
previous two subsections, 𝑐𝑐𝐴𝐴 < 𝑐𝑐 < 𝑐𝑐, such that banks lend to low-productivity firms in F
without regulation and investors lend after FX regulation. After FX regulation, the exposure
of banks to FX risk is reduced, while the exposure of investors increases.

     More specifically, in our model, realized bank profit before FX regulation is sensitive to
FX risk and can be expressed as:

                           1−𝑞𝑞
                 𝜋𝜋 𝐵𝐵 =          (𝑟𝑟𝐹𝐹 + 𝑐𝑐 − 𝐴𝐴𝐿𝐿 𝑒𝑒𝐿𝐿 ) > 0 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑒𝑒 = 𝑒𝑒𝐻𝐻 ,   (14)
                            𝑞𝑞


                 𝜋𝜋 𝐵𝐵 = 𝐴𝐴𝐿𝐿 𝑒𝑒𝐿𝐿 − (𝑟𝑟𝐹𝐹 + 𝑐𝑐) < 0 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑒𝑒 = 𝑒𝑒𝐿𝐿 .             (15)

 In contrast, after macroprudential FX regulation, no bank lends in F and no bank fails after
 a depreciation of the domestic currency. The realized bank profit from lending in 𝐹𝐹 after
 regulation is zero for both realized exchange rates and completely insensitive to the
 exchange rate (since no lending occurs). Balancing this reduction in bank exposure to FX
 risk, investors increase their lending in F, and therefore increase their equity’s sensitivity to
 FX risk. The exposure of firms that still receive FX funding is unchanged, but some firms no
 longer receive FX funding. As a result, the net effect is only a small reduction in firm
 sensitivity to currency movements (and less of a reduction than occurs for banks).

     D. Testable implications of the model

     This section has developed a stylized model of informed bank and uninformed market
lending in domestic and foreign currency. This model yields four testable implications about
the effects of FX macroprudential regulation of banks:

     (1) Banks borrow and lend less in foreign currency (but do not change their borrowing
in domestic currency).




                                                                                                 13
         (2) Some firms shift away from banks to increase their FX borrowing from market
 investors (with no increase in non-FX borrowing by firms and banks).

         (3) Banks’ exposure to exchange rate movements declines significantly.

         (4) Firms' exposure to exchange rate movements declines moderately, and by less than
 that for banks.


         E. An extension with exporters

         In an effort to keep the model parsimonious and focus on the key channels that are the
     focus of the empirical analysis, we do not explicitly differentiate between smaller, more
     domestically-focused firms and larger, export-oriented firms. This differentiation could be
     important, however, if exporting firms have a natural hedge against currency movements
     and are therefore be more likely to obtain cheap funding in foreign currency, irrespective of
     whether macroprudential FX regulations are in place. 16 Therefore, we have also developed
     a version of the model to incorporate this scenario.

         More specifically, evidence suggests that exporters tend to be larger and more productive
     than non-exporters (e.g., Bernard et al., 2003, Melitz, 2003), so we extend our framework
     to assume that some high-productive firms are exporters. A fraction of their output 𝐴𝐴𝐻𝐻 is a
     good that is priced in 𝐹𝐹, offering a natural hedge against FX risk. The status of exporters is
     publicly observable, so investors can infer that these firms have high productivity. Hence,
     the competitive lending rate is 𝜌𝜌𝐸𝐸∗ = 𝑟𝑟𝐹𝐹 . This cost of market funding in 𝐹𝐹 to exporters is
     cheaper than bank funding in either currency, so exporters prefer to obtain funding from
     investors in 𝐹𝐹–irrespective of macroprudential FX regulation.

         All of the key implications from the model developed above continue to hold, except that
     now exporters default less often after a depreciation of the domestic currency. This lower
     default probability is partly due to their natural hedge (with a share of production priced in
     F), and partly due to their cheaper funding. Specifically, for an intermediate depreciation
                                  𝑟𝑟 −𝜙𝜙𝐴𝐴 𝐹𝐹     𝐻𝐻
     𝑒𝑒𝐿𝐿 ∈ [𝑒𝑒𝐿𝐿 , 𝑒𝑒�𝐿𝐿 ], where 𝑒𝑒𝐿𝐿 ≡ (1−𝜙𝜙)𝐴𝐴   , an exporting firm does not default after having received
                                             𝐻𝐻

     market funding in 𝐹𝐹, but would have defaulted after receiving bank funding in 𝐹𝐹.



16For example, Kalemli-Ozcan et al. (2016) show that exporters have a higher share of dollar debt than non-exporters
in Latin American firms.
                                                                                                                 14
          III.         The Data

          This section discusses the data used for the empirical analysis. It is divided into two
 parts. The first provides details on the newly compiled dataset on macroprudential FX
 regulations that is central to this paper. The second discusses the additional explanatory and
 control variables used in the analysis.

          A. Data on Macroprudential FX Regulations

          We define macroprudential FX regulations as regulations that discriminate based on the
 currency denomination of a capital transaction. 17 Macroprudential FX regulations usually
 focus on the domestic banking system and can be implemented by the government, the central
 bank, or the national prudential regulator. Our measures of macroprudential FX regulations
 do not include capital controls—which discriminate by the residency of the parties involved in
 the transaction—although there is substantial overlap in these two types of measures given
 that transactions between residents and non-residents are more likely to involve FX. Also,
 while our measures are macroprudential, as they are directed at systemic risks to the entire
 financial system stemming from FX flows and exposures, some measures (such as sectoral FX
 capital risk weights) can also be classified as microprudential regulations (which generally
 target the resilience of individual financial institutions).

          To construct our database, we draw on four sources on macro-prudential regulations:
 Shim et al. (2013), Vandenbussche et al. (2015), Cerutti et al. (2017), and Reinhardt and
 Sowerbutts (2018). Each of these datasets uses different sources and has a different focus—
 but includes some information on macroprudential FX regulations. More specifically, Shim et
 al. (2013) provides verbal descriptions of policy events broadly related to the housing sector
 for 60 countries at a monthly frequency from 1990-2012. Vandenbussche et al. (2015)
 provides detailed data on a broad range of macroprudential policy actions for 16 countries
 from Emerging Europe over the period 1997-2010. Cerutti et al. (2017) uses an IMF database
 on country surveys to provide measures for 12 macroprudential policies, including on FX- and
 local-currency reserve requirements, in a set of 64 countries over 2000-14. Finally, Reinhardt
 and Sowerbutts (2018) build a database on macroprudential policy actions for 60 countries
 starting in 1995. For more details on the construction of this dataset on macroprudential FX




17   Throughout the paper, we use the terms “macroprudential FX regulations” and “FX regulations” synonymously.
                                                                                                                  15
 regulations, see Appendix A in Ahnert et al. (2018).

        After combining these sources, our dataset includes information on 132 changes in
 macroprudential FX regulations from 1995 through 2014 (on a quarterly basis) that represent
 either a tightening or loosening in regulation. This full sample includes both advanced and
 emerging economies, but we exclude reserve-issuing countries (i.e., long-standing members
 of the Euro Area, the US, Switzerland and Japan) to focus on countries more vulnerable to
 currency mismatches and the global financial cycle. We also exclude offshore centers, as
 defined by the BIS in International Banking Statistics, with the exception of Singapore and
 Hong Kong. This leaves us with a sample of 48 countries for our main empirical analysis. 18
 Some countries have made no changes to macroprudential FX policy, while others have made
 more than ten. There is good coverage of countries in Asia, Europe, and South America, but
 coverage is more limited for the Middle East and Africa. 19

        Figure 1 shows the cumulated changes in all macroprudential FX regulations from 1995
 through 2015. Any adoption or tightening of each regulation in the dataset is counted as a +1,
 and any reduction or removal is a -1, with the graph showing the cumulated total on the given
 date. The figure shows a general trend of tightening FX regulations since the mid-2000s,
 interrupted by a brief period of loosening during the Global Financial Crisis. In our dataset,
 these macroprudential FX regulations can be further disaggregated into those focusing on
 banks’ FX assets and those on banks’ FX liabilities. 20 More specifically:

   •    FX Asset-side Measures (in blue) include all policies aimed at the FX assets of
        domestic banks. These generally focus on restricting FX lending to corporates and
        households in the domestic economy. These measures include FX capital regulations for
        banks (such as provisioning rules or risk weights associated with FX-lending). These also
        include lending standards for FX loans, incorporating both quantitative lending
        standards (such as loan-to-value (LTV) ratios or debt-to-income (DTI) ratios for FX
        loans), and qualitative lending standards for FX loans (such as amortization
        requirements for FX loans).


18 The full list of countries is reported in Table A1 in Ahnert et al. (2018), with the cumulated number of changes in

each type of macroprudential regulation by country.
19 Our sample includes 17 advanced economies and 31 emerging markets (as classified by the BIS in their International

Banking Statistics). Advanced economies increased their use of FX regulations towards the end of the sample, but
emerging markets account for the vast majority of FX regulatory actions.
20 These two categories can be further disaggregated into various subcategories. We do not focus on the more detailed

disaggregation in this paper, however, as the sample size becomes too small to yield meaningful results.
                                                                                                                   16
 •   FX Liability-side Measures (in red) include all policies aimed at the FX liabilities of
     domestic banks. These measures generally focus on the funding decisions of banks and
     include FX reserve requirements and FX liquidity requirements (such as liquidity
     coverage ratios or taxes on non-core FX liabilities). These measures tend to specifically
     target FX flows with a short maturity.

     The shaded areas in Figure 1 show the cumulated actions for these two types of FX
 measures, with 30 cumulated liability-side regulations and 37 cumulated asset-side
 measures at the end of the sample period. Asset-side FX regulations started to be adopted
 more rapidly just before the global financial crisis, and then experienced another surge
 around 2010-11, but have since been adopted at a more moderate pace. Liability-side FX
 regulations were adopted more gradually from 2002-2006, after which use fell by about
 half, until after 2010 they regained attention and their use roughly doubled during 2010-
 13. These different types of macroprudential FX regulations could have different effects on
 the economy. For example, measures targeting banks’ FX liabilities might affect their FX
 lending to all their borrowers, while asset-side measures might only restrict FX lending to
 specific borrowers (for example those lacking a natural hedge).

     For a final cut of the data, Figure 2 uses the same categories to break out the number of
times each macroprudential FX measure was either tightened or loosened. This is useful to
better understand what is driving the cumulated statistics in Figure 1, as “no change” in the
cumulated graphs could mask no change in the given regulation by any country, or a number
of countries which tightened the measure while an equal number simultaneously loosened.
Figure 2 shows that, in many periods, the latter is the case—with some years when a large
number of countries simultaneously tightened and loosened different policies. Figure 2 also
provides more detail on the phases of tightening and loosening in macroprudential FX
regulations shown in Figure 1.

     B. Data on International Capital Flows and other Variables

     This section begins by discussing the international capital flow variables on bank and
corporate borrowing that will be the focus of the empirical tests. It closes with a discussion of
the various control variables.

     To begin, in order to test model prediction #1 on the impact of FX regulations on cross-
border loans to banks, we use quarterly data from the BIS International Banking Statistics
                                                                                                17
 (IBS), which reports both FX and non-FX gross capital inflows to banks. These data are
 expressed as a percent of annual GDP (calculated as 4-quarter moving averages). 21 In order to
 test model prediction #2 on the spillover effects of the regulations, we use data from the BIS
 International Debt Statistics (IDS), which includes debt securities issued by domestic
 headquartered companies on international markets in FX and non-FX.

        Figure 3 graphs several of these measures which will be a focus of the empirical analysis.
 Figure 3a shows the evolution of cross-border loans to banks as a percent of GDP, broken into
 loans in FX (red) and non-FX (blue). This shows the decline in cross-border lending since
 around the crisis, with basically all of the decline occurring in FX lending. Figure 3b shows
 international debt issuance over the same period, also broken down into FX (solid lines) and
 non-FX borrowing (dashed lines), and further distinguished into borrowing by banks (green)
 and corporates (orange). This shows that international debt issuance in FX has increased
 fairly steadily since the crisis for corporates, but fallen for banks. Non-FX borrowing by
 corporates has been fairly flat, and for banks has decreased. These graphs are only suggestive,
 but the trends agree with the model’s prediction; after a tightening in macroprudential FX
 regulations (such as after the 2008 crisis), cross-border FX lending by banks declines (with
 no change in non-FX lending by banks), while corporate debt issuance in FX increases (with
 no increase in corporate non-FX debt issuance or bank debt issuance in FX or non-FX).

        The empirical analysis also includes a number of control variables that merit discussion.
 These variables were chosen to be consistent with existing literature, most closely following
 recent work on the determinants of cross-border bank flows in Avdjiev et al. (2016a) and
 Bruno and Shin (2016). An innovation in our control variables is that when we calculate the
 exposure of country i to certain variables in other countries, we weight the respective variable
 by country i’s “financial exposure” instead of its trade exposure. As shown in Lane and
 Shambaugh (2010) and Bénétrix et al. (2015), this can be important when countries have
 different currency than trade exposures (such as many emerging markets which are more
 exposed to US dollar movements than predicted based purely on trade patterns). A sensitivity
 test shows that this weighting does not impact the key results.

        We include five variables in our baseline specification, focusing on variables with some
 time variation so that they are not absorbed in the country fixed effects. These controls are:


21In the BIS banking statistics, capital ‘flows’ are calculated as estimated exchange rate-adjusted changes in stocks;
therefore they should not be affected by exchange-rate valuation effects. See Appendix A of this paper.
                                                                                                                   18
          •   Changes in non-FX macroprudential regulation: measured by calculating any
 change in macroprudential regulations in the four datasets discussed above (from Shim et al.,
 2013; Vandenbussche et al., 2015; Cerutti et al., 2017; and Reinhardt and Sowerbutts, 2018)
 for country i. Then any changes in FX regulations are removed. The resulting measure is
 reported as +1 for any new use/tightening of any non-FX macroprudential regulation, and a -
 1 for any reduction/removal. The variable is the sum of its contemporaneous effect as well as
 three lags. Appendix A in Ahnert et al. (2018) discusses the compilation in more detail.

          •   Real GDP growth: measured as quarterly real GDP (yoy) growth based on IMF
 statistics. This is a standard control to capture changes in country-specific returns.

          •   Exchange rate volatility, weighted based on country financial exposure: calculated
 as: = std t (∑ wnF,t ⋅ ∆enF,t ) , where std t () is the standard deviation at quarterly frequency and ∆enF,t is

 the weekly change in the bilateral exchange rate between the domestic economy and foreign
 country n. This controls for the relative riskiness of FX- versus non-FX loans (see Rosenberg
 and Tirpak, 2009 and Brown and De Haas, 2012).

          •   Interest rate differential, weighted based on country financial exposure: calculated
 as = itD − ∑ wnF,t ⋅ inF,t , where itD is the domestic (D) nominal interest rate in quarter t; wnF,t is the

 (annual) financial weight of foreign (F) country n in quarter t; inF,t is the foreign interest rate of

 country n in quarter t, and n captures the major currencies/currency areas (USD, GBP, EUR,
 YEN, CHF). This controls for the return/funding costs of FX loans relative to the
 return/funding costs of non-FX loans. 22 The weightings place more weight on the relative
 funding differentials for the most relevant countries/regions.

          •   Sovereign rating: measured as the change in sovereign rating, based on data from
 Trading Economics in order to capture any changes in country-specific risk.

          •   Financial openness: measured using the Chinn-Ito (2008) index of financial
 openness. This is a standard control to capture any capital controls or other factors affecting
 the ease by which banks or firms can borrow internationally.

          Additional details on these independent variables are provided in Appendix A.

                                                                                                               19
        IV. Empirical Results: Direct Effects and Leakages of Macroprudential FX
 Regulations

        This section formally tests how macroprudential FX regulations affect different
 components of capital inflows, building on the theoretical framework developed in Section II.
 It begins by developing the specification that will be used for the remainder of the section.
 Then it reports the central results on how macroprudential FX regulations affect various types
 of capital flows in domestic and foreign currency for banks and corporates. For this baseline
 analysis, we aggregate the different types of macroprudential FX regulations. The section ends
 with tests for different effects of the disaggregated measures of macroprudential regulations.
 It is worth noting that a key aspect of this series of tests is not just the effects of
 macroprudential FX regulations on certain types of capital flows (such as bank borrowing in
 FX), but also whether there are no effects on other types of capital flows (such as bank
 borrowing in non-FX). These “non-effects” suggested in the empirical model are also an
 important a part of the hypothesis testing and provide a useful check that any results are not
 driven by omitted variables that would affect all types of capital flows.

        A. Estimation Framework

        To test the first two predictions on how macroprudential FX regulations affect bank and
 corporate borrowing in domestic and foreign currency, we use a cross-country panel
 regression framework with country- and time-fixed effects. We control for domestic and
 global factors over time, similar to the specifications used to predict international capital flows
 (or just international banking flows) in Forbes and Warnock (2012), Bruno and Shin (2016),
 and Avdjiev et al. (2016a). More specifically, our baseline equation is:

                     𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 = 𝛼𝛼 + ∑3𝑘𝑘=0 𝛽𝛽1 𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 + 𝛾𝛾 ′ 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝛿𝛿𝑖𝑖 + 𝛿𝛿𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 ,   (16)

 where Fi,t is the measure of quarterly gross cross-border capital inflows for the respective
 sector of country i (discussed in Section III.B). 23 The variable fxmi,t-k captures changes in
 macroprudential FX measures (discussed in Section III.A), expressed as a dummy variable


23 Quarterly capital inflows are scaled by annual GDP, which is calculated as a 4-quarter moving average of annual

data to avoid breaks due to annual GDP rising or falling from Q4 to Q1. We scale by annual GDP rather than quarterly
GDP because the sum of the contemporaneous coefficient and three lags on fxmi,t reported in the regression tables can
then be read as the effect on capital flows to annual GDP over a one year period.
                                                                                                                  20
 that takes the value of +1 if restrictions on FX lending or borrowing are tightened (and −1 if
 they are loosened). To account for potential time lags in the impact of these policies, we
 include the contemporaneous value of fxmi,t as well as its three lags, and evaluate their joint
 effect by testing if the sum of all four coefficients is significantly different than zero. Xi,t-1 is a
 set of control variables (discussed in Section III.B); δi are country-fixed effects and δt are
 global time effects. The sample period is 1996 Q1– 2014 Q4.

        Several details of this specification and variables merit further discussion. 24 First, the
 left-hand side variable, Fi,t, is measured in several different ways in order to test the different
 predictions of the model and better understand the direct and indirect effects of the
 macroprudential FX regulations. More specifically, in order to test model prediction #1 on the
 impact of the regulations on cross-border loans to banks, Fi,t is measured as FX or non-FX
 gross capital inflows to banks, as well as the FX share of total capital inflows to banks. In order
 to test model prediction #2 on the spillover effects of the regulations, Fi,t, is measured as FX
 and non-FX net international debt issuance by corporates and banks, as well as the change in
 the FX share of total net debt issuance by each group. (Extensions also consider the impact of
 regulations on total loans to banks and total debt issuance by corporates.)

        A second noteworthy feature of equation (16) is the measure of macroprudential FX
 regulation, fxmi,t-k. This is measured as a dummy variable capturing the changes in
 macroprudential FX regulations and discussed in more detail in Appendix A of Ahnert et al.
 (2018). In our main analysis, this aggregates all of the different types of macroprudential FX
 regulations, but in some extensions it only includes changes in FX regulations targeting bank
 assets or those targeting bank liabilities, disaggregated as discussed in Section III.A.

        A final important point in equation (16) is the time fixed effects (δt), which are included
 to control for all global factors common across countries in each period. These global factors
 have been shown to be an important driver of global capital flows, such as in Forbes and
 Warnock (2012), Rey (2013), and Avdjiev et al. (2016a), but there are different views on which
 factors are most important (such as the role of global risk or monetary policy in advanced
 economies). By controlling for a global-time fixed effect, we do not need to take a stance on


24 To ensure that large observations are not
                                           driving the results, all dependent and independent variables are winsorised
at the 2.5% level (except for variables based on bounded indices). In order to account for exchange rate valuation
effects, changes in shares are calculated based on a series of stocks calculated by adding cumulated exchange rate
adjusted changes in bank loans and deposits or net issuance of debt securities to initial stocks. Before winsorising the
resulting shares, we exclude changes in shares above +100% or below -100%.
                                                                                                                     21
 exactly which global factors are important, or worry about time effects shared by all countries
 that are difficult to measure. To show that this assumption does not affect our main results,
 however, we also report tests where we include standard global variables that have been
 shown to be associated with global capital flows (such as global volatility, global growth, and
 changes in US monetary policy) instead of this common global-time fixed effect. These
 different specifications of global factors have no meaningful impact on the key results.

          All the independent variables are lagged by one quarter (or by one year in the case of
 GDP growth) to reduce endogeneity concerns. Additional details on each of these independent
 variables are provided in Appendix A.

          B. Baseline Results: Direct and Spillover Effects of Macroprudential FX
 Regulations

          To test these predictions, Table 1 begins by testing for the effects of FX regulations on
 gross cross-border loans from international banks to domestic banks—using the specification
 in equation (16) and the data discussed in Section III. According to Hypothesis #1, increased
 macroprudential FX regulations should reduce the volume of FX borrowing and share of FX
 borrowing by banks, with no significant effect on banks’ non-FX borrowing. The first three
 columns report reduced-form results with no control variables, columns (4) through (6)
 report results with the full set of controls discussed in Section III (plus the global-time
 dummies), and columns (7) through (9) report results with explicit controls for global factors
 (global volatility, global growth, and changes in US interest rates), instead of the global-time
 fixed effects. 25 Each set of three columns repeats the analysis for the same three variants of
 the dependent variables for each specification (FX capital inflows, the share of FX inflows in
 total inflows, and non-FX inflows), a pattern repeated in each set of our tests for the respective
 variables. Also, to simplify an interpretation of the results, the coefficients on macroprudential
 FX regulations and non-FX regulations are reported as the sum of the quarterly coefficient
 estimates (∑3𝑘𝑘=0 𝛽𝛽1 ), with a reported p-value to indicate if the sum is jointly significant. These
 are written in italics, with no parentheses around the p-values, to clarify that this is distinct
 from the other coefficient estimates reported with standard errors (in parentheses).

          The coefficient estimates in Table 1 support the predictions on how macroprudential FX
 regulations affect international borrowing by domestic banks. Tighter macroprudential FX


25 The   global variables follow the capital flow literature, such as Forbes and Warnock (2012) and Avdjiev et al. (2016a).
                                                                                                                       22
 regulations are correlated with a significant decrease in foreign currency borrowing by banks
 and in the FX share of total international borrowing by banks, over the subsequent year. To
 put the magnitude of these estimates into context, cross-border FX loans to banks fall over a
 one-year period by 0.50% – 0.66% of GDP following a tightening in FX regulations. This
 suggests the effect of macroprudential regulations on cross-border FX loans to banks is large
 and meaningful. FX loans are around 1.9% of GDP at the median of our sample (across
 quarters when inflows were positive), suggesting that tighter FX regulations corresponds to a
 decline in FX cross-border loans by banks of about one-third. Or, to put this in the context of
 individual countries, consider Brazil and Indonesia—two countries which have been
 concerned about FX exposure. In both countries, FX loans to banks are a little less than 1% of
 GDP, suggesting that an increase in macroprudential FX regulations corresponds to a
 reduction in FX loans to banks by over half.

        In contrast, and as also expected, the increase in macroprudential FX regulations does
 not have a significant effect on non-FX borrowing by banks (columns 3, 6, and 9). Banks do
 not significantly increase their borrowing in local currency to compensate for their reduced
 borrowing in FX. Corresponding estimates for the impact of macroprudential FX regulations
 on total international borrowing by banks (not reported) show that the aggregate effect is
 weakly negative—as expected—but only significant at the 10% level. This suggests that the
 reduction in international FX borrowing by banks after tighter regulations is not fully
 compensated for by increased non-FX borrowing.

        The other coefficient estimates in Table 1 generally have the expected sign, albeit with
 mixed significance.26 The coefficients that are most often significant are those on GDP growth
 and sovereign ratings—which suggest that faster growth and higher ratings are significantly
 correlated with increased capital inflows, especially in foreign currency. The global variables
 also have the expected signs in columns (7) through (9), with lower volatility, higher global
 growth, and lower US interest rates correlated with stronger FX borrowing by banks. The
 other results are basically unchanged when these global control variables are included,
 suggesting that their effects are largely captured in the global-time effects (in columns 1-6).

        Next, Table 2 follows the same format as Table 1, except now tests how macroprudential
 FX regulations affect international debt issuance by domestic corporations (Hypothesis #2).

26 An increase in non-FX macroprudential regulations is usually positively associated with cross-border inflows, albeit

generally insignificant. This could indicate that increased regulation increases confidence in the financial system and
thereby supports greater inflows, as tentatively found in Reinhardt and Sowerbutts (2015) and Forbes et al. (2015).
                                                                                                                   23
 The coefficient estimates on macroprudential FX regulations in Table 2 again have the
 predicted effects. Tighter macroprudential regulations are correlated with a significant
 increase in foreign currency debt issuance by corporates, and a significant increase in the
 share of corporate debt issued in FX by corporates, with no significant effect on non-FX debt
 issuance. The magnitude of these effects continues to be economically meaningful, albeit
 substantially smaller than that of increased regulations on international bank flows. More
 specifically, international debt issuance by corporates increases by 0.05% to 0.06% of GDP
 following a tightening in FX regulations. This suggests the effect of macroprudential
 regulations on cross-border FX corporate debt issuance is moderate, given that net FX debt
 issuance is around 0.6% of GDP (at the sample median when net FX debt issuance was
 positive). For some countries, however, the impact is substantially larger. For example, in
 Brazil and Indonesia FX debt issuance is 0.26% and 0.36% of GDP, respectively, suggesting
 that tighter FX regulations correspond to roughly a 15% to 20% increase in this issuance.

        Combining the results of Tables 1 and 2 allows us to assess the aggregate effects of an
 increase in macroprudential FX measures on country exposure to FX risk through banks, as
 well as the degree of “shifting snowbanks” (i.e., the substitution of FX exposure from banks to
 investors who hold the new FX corporate debt issuance). This shifting of FX risk can be
 calculated as the ratio of net FX debt issuance by corporates to international FX loans to
 banks. This ratio indicates that after an increase in FX regulations, about 10% of the decline
 in FX exposure in banks shifts to corporate debt issuance (and thereby to investors and other
 non-bank financial institutions). 27 This suggests that even though increased macroprudential
 FX regulations on banks leads to some “shifting snowbanks” of currency risk to other sectors
 of the economy, namely investors in our framework, there is still a meaningful net reduction
 in aggregate FX borrowing in the economy.

        To complete the hypothesis testing and better understand the full set of relationships for
 which data is available (including those not formally included in the model), Appendix Table
 B1 reports several additional results. Columns (1) through (3) test for any impact of FX
 regulations on cross-border loans to non-banks. Although this data includes loans to non-
 bank financial institutions as well as corporates, and therefore does not exactly test the


27 Another way to calculate this ratio would be to adjust
                                                        for the fact that not all FX lending by banks goes to corporates—
with recently enhanced BIS data showing that on, average, 62% of FX loans from banks to non-banks are lent to the
corporate sector (with the remainder lent to households, government and non-bank financials). Taking this into
account, the “shifting” effect of FX exposure would be about 13% (instead of 10%). This new BIS data, however, is only
available for limited countries (Canada, Cyprus, Denmark, United Kingdom, Korea, Sweden and South Africa).
                                                                                                                     24
 channel in the model (which only focuses on corporates), it finds no significant effect of FX
 regulations on cross-border loans to non-banks. This would agree with the model’s prediction
 of no significant effect on cross-border loans to corporates.

        Next, we examine the impact of macroprudential FX regulations on domestic lending by
 banks to corporates. The theoretical model suggests that domestic lending by banks in FX
 should decline (corresponding to the reduction in bank cross-border funding in FX), with no
 significant decline in domestic bank lending in domestic currency. Unfortunately, our lending
 dataset only includes cross-border capital flows and does not have information on domestic
 lending. Therefore, to test this channel, we use enhanced BIS data that provides information
 on domestic lending in both local and foreign currencies. 28 This data, however, has several
 limitations: it only begins in 2012Q3 (thereby truncating our sample in roughly half); it only
 covers 30% of the countries in our sample; and it is only available for lending to non-banks
 (which includes non-bank financials) and not just corporates (as in the model). With these
 important caveats, the results in columns (4) through (6) of Appendix Table B1 support the
 main predictions of the model. 29 An increase in FX regulations corresponds to a significant
 reduction in FX domestic lending by banks to non-banks (largely corporates) over the next
 year, with no significant effect on non-FX lending by banks to non-banks. 30

        Finally, as an additional set of tests to “complete the story”, columns (6) through (9) of
 Appendix Table B1 report estimates of the effect of increased FX regulations on international
 debt issuance by banks. The estimates find no significant effect at the 5% level of increased FX
 regulation on international debt issuance by banks—whether measured as foreign currency
 issuance, the FX share of issuance, or domestic currency issuance. This supports the model’s
 predictions, and sharply contrasts with the results for corporate debt issuance (a significant
 positive effect of macroprudential FX regulations on FX issuance). If anything, Table B1
 suggests that there may be a weakly negative effect for bank debt issuance—albeit only
 significant at the 10% level for FX inflows. This weakly negative impact on bank FX debt
 issuance may reflect the overall reduction in bank exposure to FX risk after increased FX
 regulations. It is unsurprising that banks reduce this risk more through loans than net debt
 issuance, however, as bank loans tend to be shorter-term in maturity than debt securities, and


28 This is a relatively new series in their International Banking Statistics.
29 The specification and control variables are the same as in Table 1 and the other columns in Appendix Table B1,
except with robust standard errors (instead of clustering by county) due to the much more limited sample.
30 The coefficient on the share of FX lending is negative (as expected), but insignificant. This reflects the small decline

in non-FX domestic lending, mitigating the impact on the ratio of FX lending.
                                                                                                                       25
 FX regulations primarily target debt/loans at shorter maturities.

        This combination of results provides evidence that macroprudential FX regulations have
 the intended direct effect of decreasing bank borrowing in FX, but also have the unintended
 consequence of causing corporations to take on more international debt in foreign currency.
 The fact that corporations do not simultaneously increase international debt issuance in
 domestic currency, and that banks do not significantly increase debt issuance in any currency,
 also suggests that these results are not capturing some type of omitted variable that would
 lead to a general increase in international borrowing or debt issuance in foreign currency.
 Macroprudential FX regulations only correspond to an increase in corporate FX debt
 issuance—but not an increase in other forms of international corporate borrowing (through
 debt or bank loans), nor bank corporate debt issuance.

        C.   Macroprudential FX Regulations: The Role of Type and Magnitude

        Macroprudential FX regulations appear to effect international borrowing and debt
 issuance. But do different types of macroprudential FX regulations have different effects on
 banks and corporates? The theoretical model shows that regulations targeting the liability-
 side of bank balance sheets (i.e., aimed at raising the cost of FX funding of domestic banks)
 work through somewhat different channels than those targeting the asset-side (i.e., aimed at
 raising the cost of bank FX lending to households and corporates in the domestic economy). This
 section tests for any differential effects of the various forms of macroprudential FX
 regulations. These results should be interpreted cautiously, however, as these finer divisions
 of different forms of macroprudential FX regulations imply that there are more limited
 degrees of freedom for the analysis.

        To begin, we focus on any differential effects if the FX macroprudential regulations
 target banks’ assets or liabilities, using the definitions discussed in Section III.A. 31 Results are
 shown in Table 3, which repeats the baseline framework from Tables 1 and 2, with the full set
 of control variables and global-period dummy variables. 32 The results are similar for asset-
 and liability-based measures when assessing the effect on cross-border loans to banks, but
 differ when assessing the impact on FX debt issuance by corporates. More specifically, both
 asset- and liability-side FX measures are correlated with a significant decrease in FX


31 We have also examined effects using narrower definitions of FX regulations, but the number of regulatory actions
quickly becomes so limited that results become sensitive to minor changes in specification and country inclusion.
32 Results are basically identical when the individual global variables are included instead of the global-time dummy.

                                                                                                                  26
 borrowing by banks—with the magnitude of the coefficient estimated to be larger for asset-
 side regulations, but only significant at the 10% level in column (8). For both measures, FX
 regulations continue to have a positive effect on FX debt issuance by corporates—but this
 effect is only estimated to be significant (at either the 5% or 10% level) for liability-side
 regulations. The magnitude of the coefficient on FX debt issuance is also estimated to be about
 three times larger for liability-side than asset-side regulations (In both cases, there continues
 to be no significant effect on non-FX debt issuance by corporates and banks.).

        These results suggest that both asset- and liability-side FX measures are effective in their
 direct goal of reducing cross-border loans to banks in FX. Only the liability-side measures,
 however, may also have the unintended side-effect of increasing FX debt issuance by
 corporates. Repeating the calculations to gauge the degree of “shifting”, an increase in
 liability-side FX measures causes FX debt issuance by corporates to increase by 16% of the
 reduction in FX loans by banks (instead of 10% when all FX regulations are aggregated). 33 In
 other words, liability-side regulations appear to cause more “shifting snowbanks” of currency
 vulnerability from banks to other sectors. As a result, asset-side regulations may better
 improve a country’s resilience to currency movements, as they decrease bank exposure to
 currency risk but simultaneously generate less shifting of this risk to other sectors.

        One possible reason for these differential effects, as suggested in the theoretical model,
 is that liability-based measures affect all forms of bank funding in all states of the world. In
 contrast, asset-based measures only affect bank lending, and often only certain segments of
 bank lending (such as through mortgages) — thus affecting a smaller share of bank balance
 sheets and having a smaller aggregate effect. Closely related, if asset-side regulations primarily
 affect bank lending to households, while liability-side regulations affect lending to both
 corporates and households, it is natural that tighter liability-side FX regulations correspond
 to a greater response in the corporate sector. Supporting this hypothesis, in some countries
 most FX regulations target the asset-side, a large share of which are regulations on LTV ratios,
 DTI ratios, and other aspects of FX lending for mortgages (such as in Hungary and Poland).
 A final possible explanation is the maturity of the capital flows targeted by these different
 measures. FX liability-based measures tend to focus on shorter-term inflows, while FX asset-
 based measures tend to focus on longer-term maturities. As macroprudential measures often


33 This is calculated as 0.0788 (Table 3, column 4) divided by 0.487 (Table 3, column 1). If one also incorporates that

only about 62% of FX loans from banks to non-banks are likely lent to the corporate sector, the degree of shifting
increases to 26%.
                                                                                                                  27
 involve a greater relative cost for short-term than longer-term capital flows, these shorter-
 term flows are the ones most affected.

        Macroprudential FX regulations could have different effects based not only on whether
 they target assets or liabilities, but also based on how large the change in the regulation is.
 Assessing the intensity of changes in macroprudential regulation is difficult, however, because
 most data on macroprudential regulations only records whether the regulation is tightened or
 loosened using dummy variables (as in our data set). This is the standard treatment in the
 literature, because it is impossible to compare discrete changes in different types of
 regulations (i.e., a 10% increase in FX reserve requirements is unlikely to correspond to a 10%
 increase in the FX liquidity coverage ratio). It is even difficult to compare changes of the same
 magnitude in a specific FX regulation across countries, given different definitions and
 coverage (i.e., a 10% increase in the liquidity coverage ratio can mean very different things
 based on the country’s definition of what qualifies as a liquid asset). A few papers have shown
 that having more macroprudential measures in place or “major” changes in regulations
 generate larger effects, results that are intuitive but do not provide concrete information on
 how a given change in a regulation would be expected to affect a key outcome variable. 34

        In an effort to move beyond this standard treatment of macroprudential regulations, we
 extend our analysis to estimate the impact of concrete changes in specific regulatory
 instruments. More specifically, we focus on two databases which provide information on the
 intensity of macroprudential FX policies, albeit in a limited sample or for a limited set of
 measures. First, Cerutti et al. (2017) includes data with information on the intensity of FX
 reserve requirement changes for a sample similar to ours. 35 Second, Vandenbussche et al.
 (2012) includes information on the intensity of other types of regulations: foreign currency
 liquidity requirements, the maximum ratio of foreign currency loans to own funds, risk
 weights on foreign currency mortgage loans, consumer loans and corporate loans. These more
 detailed data, however, have two important disadvantages: the data ends in 2010 (thereby
 missing a period of active use of macroprudential FX regulations) and the data is only
 available for Eastern Europe (thereby severely limiting country coverage).



34 More specifically, Cerutti et al. (2017) create a measure which is the sum of the number of different types of

macroprudential measures in use. Forbes et al. (2015) classify a subset of their measures of capital controls and
macroprudential measures as those which were “major”, based on the attention by investors, financial analysts, or
international financial institutions (as assessed by coverage in analyst reports, IMF papers, and surveys).
35 Specifically, the authors state that given the mostly quantitative nature of reserve requirements, values above or

below 1 and –1 for their index can capture the intensity in the changes (with the index ranging from -3 to +5).
                                                                                                                 28
        Keeping these caveats in mind, the resulting estimates give some idea of the magnitude
 of the effects from these specific FX regulations. First, a large increase in reserve requirements
 on foreign currency borrowing (proxied by the quantitative index taking a value of 5) leads to
 a decline in FX loans to banks by 0.46% of GDP and an increase in FX international debt
 issuance by 0.15% of GDP. Second, an increase in the foreign currency liquidity requirement
 by 10pp reduces FX loans to banks by 2.9% of GDP and increases international FX debt
 issuance by corporates by 0.36% of GDP. Third, a tightening in the maximum ratio of FX loans
 to own funds from 400% to 200% reduces FX loans to banks by around 1% of GDP and
 increases FX debt issuance by corporates by 0.05% of GDP. Finally, an increase in the risk
 weight on foreign currency mortgage loans, consumer loans or corporate loans by 50pp above
 the local currency risk weights reduces FX inflows to banks by 0.26%, 0.46% or 1.83% of GDP,
 respectively, and corresponds to an increase in FX international debt issuance by corporates
 by about 0.07% of GDP in each case. All of these estimated effects of specific changes in FX
 regulations have the expected sign, and several of the estimates (such as for foreign currency
 liquidity requirements) are consistently significant despite the limited sample size. 36

        D. Endogeneity and Other Sensitivity Tests

        The finding that macroprudential FX regulations significantly reduce bank borrowing in
 FX and increase corporate debt issuance in FX are central to understanding the impact of
 these regulations, so we next perform a series of robustness checks, including specifications
 that should better identify the exogenous component of macroprudential regulations. For
 each test, we focus on whether macroprudential FX regulations decrease international bank
 borrowing (or share of borrowing) in FX and non-FX, and whether they increase corporate
 debt issuance (or share of debt issuance) in FX and non-FX (Tables 1 and 2, respectively). We
 do not report all of the “non-results” that are not significant (nor expected to be significant),
 as they continue to be insignificant in all of the tests discussed below.

     One potential concern with the baseline analysis is that trends in our dependent variables
 could be driving changes in macroprudential policy instead of vice-versa (i.e., endogeneity). 37
 For example, increased corporate debt issuance in FX could heighten concerns about risks to
 domestic financial stability related to aggregate FX exposure, causing policymakers to tighten

36 Detailed results are available on request. Each of these estimates are based on regressions using the same format as
the baseline regressions in Tables 1 and 2, including all of the control variables and global time effects.
37 Omitted variable bias is also a frequent concern in cross-country empirical papers, as some hard-to-measure

variables could simultaneously affect cross-border capital flows and FX regulations. This is less of a concern in our
framework, however, due to the tests for “non-results” corresponding to our main results (as in Section IV.B).
                                                                                                                   29
 regulations on banks’ exposure to FX and thereby reduce aggregate FX exposure and/or bank
 lending in FX. To better control for endogeneity, we adopt an alternative approach that
 estimates an “exogenous” shock to macroprudential policy, following the approach used in
 Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2013) to estimate more exogenous fiscal policy shocks and in
 Furceri et al. (2016) to estimate more exogenous monetary policy shocks. We estimate a first-
 stage regression of FX regulations on a range of variables that could affect the implementation
 of these regulations. Then, we use the residuals from this regression, which should be a more
 exogenous measure of changes in FX regulations, as the explanatory variable in our baseline
 regressions (instead of using our -1/0/1 measure of changes in macroprudential FX
 regulations).


     Table 4a presents results from these first-stage regressions estimating a more exogenous
 measure of changes in macroprudential FX regulations based on a range of models and data
 sources. 38 The results in columns (1) through (4) suggest that stronger GDP growth, domestic
 credit growth, house price growth, increased financial openness, greater use of non-FX
 regulations, and faster expected GDP growth over the next year are all positively associated with
 increases in FX regulations. Each of these variables usually has the expected sign, but most are
 not individually significant. This captures the well-known challenge of predicting exactly when
 macroprudential regulations are adjusted. The one exception is the coefficient on exchange rate
 appreciation, which suggests that larger appreciations consistently correspond to increases in
 macroprudential FX regulations. Columns (5) and (6) also add lagged values of the dependent
 variables from our baseline analysis in order to remove any impact of any trends in these
 variables that could be driving the variation in FX regulation.

       Next, we use the residuals from the six different specifications in Table 4a as more
 exogenous measures of changes in FX regulations in our baseline model in equation (16).
 Table 4b reports the subsequent results (with each column of Table 4a corresponding to a row
 in Table 4b) for the key coefficients on FX regulations estimated as in columns 4 and 5 of
 Tables 1 and 2. The results support the key conclusions from the main analysis; tighter FX
 regulations correspond to a significant increase in the level and share of cross-border FX loans
 to banks and a significant decrease in the level and share of cross-border FX debt issuance by
 corporates. The results are also usually robust across the six different specifications using



38 The selection of variables draws on the limited literature on what determines the use of macroprudential and

prudential regulations more broadly, including Cerutti et al. (2015) and Cerutti et al. (2017).
                                                                                                           30
 different variables to predict changes in FX regulations. 39

        In addition to these tests that focus on better identifying the exogenous components of
 macroprudential FX regulation, we also perform additional robustness checks to test for any
 impact of sample composition, variable definitions, and other factors that could be affecting
 the key results. Two tests are reported in Appendix Table B2: when offshore centers (Hong
 Kong and Singapore) are excluded, and when the quarters around the global financial crisis
 (from 2008Q3 through 2009Q2) are excluded. We have also repeated the analysis when only
 tightening in macroprudential FX measures are included (not loosening or removals), and
 when the variables are not financially weighted (as discussed in Section III). Then we drop
 one country at a time (to exclude any impact from a country with frequent adjustments in
 regulations). We have also added controls for: the current account balance as a share of GDP
 (to proxy for net capital inflows), institutional quality, and aggregate financial exposure. 40 In
 this series of tests, the main results discussed above are unchanged and continue to support
 our main hypotheses. Tighter FX regulation of banks is correlated with banks borrowing less
 in foreign currency, with no significant effect on their non-FX borrowing. Tighter FX
 regulation is also correlated with firms increasing their FX debt issuance, substituting away
 from banks, with no significant effect on firms’ and banks’ non-FX debt issuance.

        Taken as a whole, these results suggest that FX regulations are successful in
 accomplishing their direct goal — of reducing the FX exposure of banks — but also have the
 unintended consequence of corporations shifting away from banks and obtaining some FX
 funding through other sources—primarily through debt issuance in foreign currency to
 investors. This “shifting snowbank” is only partial, as the reduction in international FX
 borrowing by banks is larger as a percent of GDP than the estimated increase in FX debt
 issuance by corporates. Both effects, however, are not only significant, but economically
 meaningful. The estimates also confirm the various other predictions of the theoretical model,
 including the variables for which there is not expected to be a significant impact of
 macroprudential FX regulations, such as on bank cross-border borrowing in domestic
 currency, and corporate and bank issuance of non-FX debt.




39 The only results which are not significant at the 5% level across all specifications are when house price growth is
included in the first stage regressions. The data on house price growth is more limited and restricts the sample size,
excluding a number of countries which have changed FX regulations.
40 Institutional quality is measured by the rule of law and aggregate financial exposure is measured relative to GDP

using the Bénetrix et al. (2015) data. Both are described in more detail in Appendix A.
                                                                                                                   31
     V. Empirical Results: Macroprudential FX Regulations and Resilience to
Currency Movements

     This section assesses how macroprudential FX regulations on banks affect the exposure
of banks and the broader economy to exchange rate movements. If the primary motivation of
macroprudential FX regulations is to reduce the vulnerability of the economy to sharp
currency movements, do the regulations achieve this goal? Does the reduction in FX
borrowing by banks significantly reduce bank exposure to currency movements? And if so,
through what channels? If bank exposure to currency risk declines, does the exposure largely
shift to other sectors of the economy, so that the aggregate vulnerability of the economy is not
meaningfully improved?

     This section attempts to go one step beyond most other work assessing the direct and
spillover effects of macroprudential FX regulations by also testing if the regulations attain one
of their ultimate goals: reducing the vulnerability of the economy to exchange rate
movements. As discussed in the introduction, there is longstanding evidence of the
multifaceted risks and challenges created by exposure to currency movements. If
macroprudential FX regulations can mitigate these challenges and risks, they could provide
substantive benefits to the broader economy. This approach of testing for the potential effects
on country resilience builds on the academic literature identifying ways to increase the
effectiveness of regulation in order to strengthen its welfare impact (e.g., Nier et al., 2011,
Mendicino et al., 2015, Agénor 2016, and IMF-FSB-BIS, 2016).

     A. Empirical Framework and Data

     The theoretical model developed in Section II provides guidance on how
macroprudential FX regulations affect the relationship between exchange rate movements
and banks’ and corporates’ stock returns. More specifically, the model yields two hypotheses
on the impact of an increase in macroprudential FX regulations: banks’ exposure to exchange
rate movements declines (so that their stock returns are less sensitive to exchange rate
movements) and firms’ exposure to exchange rate movements will also decline, but not by as
much as for banks. These are testable implications #3 and #4 from the model.

     In order to test if macroprudential FX regulations on banks affect bank and corporate

                                                                                                32
 sensitivity to currency movements, we estimate the following equation: 41

             ∆𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽 ∆𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 + 𝛿𝛿 𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡


                                                       +µ ∆𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 × 𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 + 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 ,    (17)

 where ∆epricei,t is, in country i and quarter t, the return of a stock market index covering
 financial sector firms or the corporate sector, respectively (depending on the hypothesis
 tested). 42 Next, ∆exratei,t is the growth rate of a financially-weighted exchange rate (where an
 increase is defined as an appreciation of the domestic currency) and fxmi,t is a measure of FX
 regulation that captures the cumulated policy stance over the current and the last three
 quarters. 43 Following Baele et al. (2010), controlsi,t contains a set of variables that affect stock
 returns through channels other than the exchange rate, such as standard macro factors,
 liquidity factors and risk premium factors, as well as a global volatility index as a proxy for
 global influences. Finally, αi are country-fixed effects that capture time-invariant differences
 between countries (e.g., differences in the level of economic or financial development). Details
 on the sources and construction of the variables are in Appendix A. 44

        The focus of the analysis is the response of stock returns to a change in the financially-
 weighted exchange rate. This is represented by the marginal effect of the exchange rate
 movement on stock returns, which is a function of the policy stance of the FX regulations:

                        ∆𝑒𝑒𝑝𝑝𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡
                                             = 𝛽𝛽 + µ 𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 .                                                        (18)
                        ∆𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡


        Our theoretical model shows that an appreciation of the domestic currency leads to an
 increase in the ex-post profits of banks and corporates, so that β is expected to be positive.
 Furthermore, if FX regulation is effective in reducing the exposure of banks and corporates to
 exchange rate movements, the coefficient µ should be negative, so that a tightening of FX


41 In related work, Bruno and Shin (2016) examine how depreciations affect equity prices and Bekaert and Mehl (2017)
assess the sensitivity of equity markets to global and regional equity returns.
42 We do not have precise measures of returns for just banks or just corporates. Therefore, we use financial stock returns

(which is largely banks) to proxy for bank returns, and we use the overall stock return index (which includes corporates,
banks, and non-bank financial institutions) to proxy for corporate returns. To better isolate corporate returns from this
broad index, we also construct a series of corporate stock returns. The key results are unchanged.
43 In equation (17), fxmi,t is measured as the sum of the contemporaneous value of the FX measure plus its three lags.

We do not include the contemporaneous value and its three lags separately (as in the analysis in Section IV, equation
(16)) to make the calculation of the interaction term in equation (17) straightforward. The smaller country sample in
equation (17) also limits the number of lagged and interaction terms that can be included relative to in Section IV.
44 All variables (except global volatility) have been winsorized at the 2.5% level to reduce the impact of outliers.

                                                                                                                                         33
 regulations (i.e., an increase in fxmi,t) would reduce exchange rate sensitivity. Since banks are
 directly affected by FX regulation, however, and corporates can switch to market-based FX
 borrowing and therefore not reduce their foreign currency borrowing by as much as banks, we
 would expect the coefficient µ to be more negative for banks than for corporates.

        B. Main Results

        Table 5 presents the results on a sample of up to 24 countries over the period 2000Q1 to
 2014Q4. 45 For most results, we report one set of specifications for financial stock returns
 (representing banks’ stock returns) as the dependent variable and another set for broad
 market stock returns (representing corporates’ stock returns). Columns (1) and (2) only
 include the three variables central to our exchange rate sensitivity tests, while columns (3) and
 (4) add standard controls for equity return regressions (the baseline). We will focus on the
 first three variables in each column: the cumulated FX regulation measure; the financially-
 weighted exchange rate (defined so that positive is an appreciation of the domestic currency);
 and their interaction. The signs of the other control variables are generally similar for
 financials and the broad market indices and have the expected signs, albeit some have
 fluctuating significance. 46

        In each of the specifications in columns (1) - (4), the coefficients on FX regulations are
 insignificant—albeit usually negative and larger for financials—possibly indicating that
 increased macroprudential FX regulations on banks could reduce bank stock returns. The
 coefficient on the exchange rate is positive and significant in each case, suggesting that
 currency appreciation corresponds to higher stock returns (as predicted in the model).

        Most important for our analysis, the coefficient on the interaction term (the coefficient
 µ in equations (17) and (18)) is negative in each of the four columns. This suggests that
 increased macroprudential FX regulations reduce the sensitivity of banks and corporates to
 exchange rate movements. This coefficient, however, is only negative and significant at the 5%
 level for bank returns (columns (1) and (3)), and the estimated magnitude of the coefficient is
 over 50% larger for banks than corporates in each case. This suggests that macroprudential


45 Standard errors are clustered by country. The country sample is limited by the availability of the financial stock

returns variable. The countries for which data is available for this analysis are: Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Czech
Republic, Denmark, Hong Kong SAR, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway,
Philippines, Poland, Singapore, South Africa, Sweden, Thailand, Turkey, United Kingdom, and Vietnam.
46 For example, higher stock returns are correlated with higher industry production growth, lower inflation, a reduction

in interest rates, higher stock market turnover, and a lower level of global volatility.

                                                                                                                        34
 FX regulations reduce banks’ sensitivity to exchange rate movements more than that for the
 broader economy—as predicted.

        The magnitudes of the coefficients in Table 5 also provide more information on the size
 of these effects. Focusing on the columns with the full set of controls in columns (3) and (4),
 when the cumulated measures of macroprudential FX regulation is neutral, a 1 percentage
 point depreciation in the financially-weighted exchange rate leads to a decrease in stock
 market returns for financials by 1.46 percentage points and for the broad market by 1.18
 percentage points. When FX regulations are tightened, the same depreciation corresponds to
 a 0.67 percentage point decline in returns for financials and 0.75 percentage point decline for
 the broader market. Hence, tighter macroprudential FX regulations reduce the sensitivity of
 stock returns to exchange rate shocks for both banks and the broader economy, but the effect
 is almost twice as large for banks (and insignificant for corporates).

        Next, since the broad market index is only a rough proxy for corporate stock returns (as
 this includes banks as well as non-bank financial institutions), column (5) shows results when
 an artificially-constructed measure of corporate stock returns is used instead of the broad
 market index. This proxy is calculated by regressing the broad market return index on the
 financial return index and taking the residual. This should better isolate the impact on
 corporate returns—but should be interpreted cautiously as this regression could also remove
 the effects of any omitted variables that affect both corporate and financial stock returns. With
 this caveat, the estimates support the model’s predictions that FX macroprudential
 regulations reduce corporate sensitivity to exchange rate movements by less than that for
 banks. More specifically, the coefficient on the interaction term between FX regulation and
 the exchange rate is insignificant and positive—a sharp contrast to the negative and significant
 coefficient for the financial index, as well as to the negative and sometimes weakly significant
 coefficient for the broad index. Since the coefficient estimate is insignificant, we are cautious
 about interpreting the sign of the effect on corporates—but instead can conclude that this
 result suggests any effect of macroprudential regulations on the sensitivity of corporates to
 exchange rate movements is small and insignificant. 47



47It is also possible, however, that these estimates understate the reduction in FX exposure due to the differential
impact on small firms. More specifically, smaller firms are more likely to rely on banks for funding, and if FX
regulations cause banks to reduce their FX lending to these smaller firms, these firms may be unable to issue debt on
international markets. These smaller firms would therefore be forced to reduce their FX borrowing and exposure—
whether by shifting to local currency borrowing or not borrowing at all. These effects would not be captured in the
empirical analysis as these smaller firms are also less likely to be included as part as the main equity index.
                                                                                                                  35
      The final four columns of Table 5 further explore this relationship between
macroprudential FX regulations and sensitivity to exchange rate movements under two
scenarios when the impact of exchange rate movements on stock returns is expected to be
larger than average: for emerging markets (which tend to have greater exposure to FX) and
for larger exchange rate movements. An extensive literature focuses on the greater sensitivity
of emerging markets to exchange rate movements (e.g., Eichengreen and Hausmann, 1999;
Acharya et al., 2015; Chui et al., 2014 and 2016), so columns (6) and (7) repeat the main results
(with the full set of controls) for only the emerging markets in our sample. Other work has
suggested that the impact of exchange rate movements on the economy may be non-linear
and greater after large movements, especially depreciations (e.g., Kappler et al. 2013)—so
columns (8) and (9) report results only for large exchange rate movements, defined as
movements in the exchange rate below the 10th percentile and above the 90th percentile. In
both of these scenarios, the key signs and significance from the base case remain unchanged—
but the estimated magnitudes of the coefficients are all larger. For example, and most relevant
to this paper’s analysis, tighter macroprudential FX regulations correspond to a greater
reduction in the exchange rate sensitivity of emerging markets, and to all countries after large
exchange rate movements, than occurs for the full sample.

      Finally, Appendix Table B3 reports a final set of robustness checks—all of which agree
with the main results in Table 5. Columns (1) and (2) use the first lags of all control variables
to mitigate endogeneity concerns. Columns (3) and (4) exclude the variables for the stock
market turnover ratio and the rule of law, as both were interpolated from annual to quarterly
frequency. Next, columns (5) and (6) exclude 2008Q4, which was a period of very sharp
exchange rate movements (corresponding to the collapse of Lehman Brothers). We have also
repeated the analysis using dollar exchange rates (instead of financial-exposure weighted
exchange rates) to calculate exchange rate movements for each country (∆𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 ).

       In each of these sensitivity tests, the key results are unchanged. Macroprudential FX
regulation significantly reduces the sensitivity of bank stock returns to exchange rate
movements. The sensitivity of stock returns for the broader economy may also be reduced, but
this effect is often insignificant and smaller than that for banks.

        C.        The Channels Through Which FX Regulations Affect Banks

         The last section has shown that macroprudential FX regulations correspond to a
  significant reduction in the sensitivity of bank stock returns to exchange rate movements; but
                                                                                              36
     how does this occur? This section provides some initial evidence, focusing on the key
     mechanisms suggested in the theoretical model and for which data for our cross-section of
     countries (particularly emerging markets) is available. Specifically, Section II.C. highlights
     three channels through which FX regulations could affect banks’ lending outcomes:

         • The lending rate that banks charge to their customers increases, due to the tax from
     the regulations.
         • The number of firms that borrow from banks declines, because the associated rise in
     borrowing costs forces low productivity firms to shift from bank funding to investor funding.
         • The share of non-performing bank loans falls, because low productivity firms borrow
     less from banks, thereby reducing banks’ shares of low-quality borrowers.

           Table 6 reports empirical evidence on these three effects using annual data. 48 For each
     test, we report two results: the coefficient from a regression of the variable of interest on
     changes in FX regulations (as defined above) with country and time fixed effects, and then the
     same specification with additional time-varying controls for each country’s business and
     financial cycle (captured by real GDP growth and credit growth, respectively).

           Columns (1) and (2) report results for the relationship between FX regulations and
     banks’ risk-adjusted lending rate. Both coefficients on the FX measures are positive and
     significant (at least at the 10% level), as expected; a tightening of FX regulations makes lending
     more expensive and increases the lending rate that banks charge to their customers. Next,
     Columns (3) and (4) report results for the relationship between FX regulations and the
     number of borrowers from banks. Both coefficients are negative (as expected), but
     insignificant. 49 Columns (5) and (6) assess the relationship with the share of banks’ non-
     performing loans. Both coefficients on FX regulations are again negative, as expected, and
     significant (at least at the 10% level). This supports the prediction that tighter FX regulations
     reduce the share of non-performing loans.

           All in all, these results provide additional support for the key mechanisms highlighted
     in the theoretical model on how tighter macroprudential FX regulations affect banks. These
     also provide additional support for how these regulations could reduce bank sensitivity to
     currency movements—by reducing the share of loans made to the low productivity firms that


48See Appendix A for more information on data definitions and sources.
49When the analysis is repeated with only FX measures targeting bank assets, both coefficients remain negative and
become significant (at the 5% level).
                                                                                                               37
 are more sensitive to currency movements, and therefore reducing banks’ share of non-
 performing loans. These results are not definitive empirical tests, however, and should simply
 be interpreted as conditional correlations which provide supporting evidence for the key
 channels highlighted throughout this paper.




     VI. Conclusions

     A growing literature is beginning to document how macroprudential tools can improve
financial stability and reduce the amplification of systemic risk. This literature, however, is
also beginning to document how these tools often have unintended consequences. One
macroprudential tool which is becoming more widely utilized, but has received relatively less
attention in academic research, is regulations on FX exposure. This is despite longstanding
evidence that foreign currency exposure can generate important economic vulnerabilities.

     This paper attempts to address this gap by analyzing the incidence and impact of
macroprudential FX regulations. It develops the key concepts in a theoretical model, compiles
a dataset with detailed information on these regulations over time, and then uses it to test the
predictions of the model. The results show that after an increase in macroprudential FX
regulations: (1) banks borrow and lend less in foreign currency (with no change in their
borrowing in local currency); (2) firms shift away from bank FX borrowing and increase their
FX borrowing from market investors (with no increase in firm and bank non-FX borrowing
from investors); (3) banks are less exposed to exchange rate movements; and (4) firms
experience some reduction in their exposure to exchange rate movements, but less than for
banks. Each of these results supports the main predictions of the model. This combination of
results suggests that even if macroprudential FX regulations on banks accomplish their direct
goals and significantly reduce bank vulnerability to currency movements, they also generate
meaningful leakages and partially “shift the snowbanks” of FX vulnerability to other sectors
of the economy.

     Although these empirical results are robust to a number of extensions and sensitivity
tests, several caveats are important. The underlying data on foreign currency borrowing may
miss important aspects of bank and firm FX exposures. For example, the data includes limited
information on firm or bank exposure to foreign currency that occurs without crossing borders
(such as if a local household makes a bank deposit in foreign currency). The data also does not

                                                                                               38
 incorporate any transactions or changes in exposure that occur entirely through trading or
 lending in a third country (as often occurs in financial centers). Moreover, the analysis does
 not include information on hedging—whether natural or in financial markets—which could
 reduce an entity’s vulnerability to currency movements even if it has large gross FX positions.
 Many of these data challenges, however, might be expected to bias estimates toward zero,
 thereby suggesting some of the effects estimated in the paper could actually be larger if better
 data existed. For example, if firms respond to tighter FX regulations at home by issuing FX
 debt abroad and selling it to a foreigner (with the entire transaction in London), this leakage
 would not be captured in our analysis.

        Another important caveat is that the analysis in this paper does not provide a full cost-
 benefit calculation of the impact of macroprudential regulations—either in the theoretical
 model or the empirical analysis. Macroprudential regulations can have much broader costs
 and benefits than those explored in this paper—such as on the distortions created as firms,
 banks and individuals find other ways to reduce the impact of the regulations (perhaps by
 shifting business to other countries with a different regulatory framework). A full test of these
 various effects is beyond the scope of this paper—but would be a promising avenue for future
 work (with datasets better targeted to address these questions).

        With these caveats, the results in this paper have important implications for the
 application of macroprudential policy. One key implication is for the debate on capital
 controls versus macroprudential policy. Countries concerned about excessive borrowing in
 foreign currency may consider capital controls (especially for bank borrowing in FX, which is
 particularly volatile and linked to booms and busts 50). Macroprudential regulations on banks,
 however, appear to be effective in reducing this vulnerability in the financial system without
 resorting to capital controls—controls which are illegal in some contexts (such as for EU
 members and in some trade agreements). Although macroprudential bank regulations can
 also generate leakages (such as an increase in FX debt issuance by corporates), capital controls
 can also generate costs and unintended consequences—including other ways of “shifting the
 snowbank” of FX risks to different sectors of the economy. 51




50 See Hoggarth et al. (2016).
51For example, Keller (2018) shows that capital controls can cause banks to increase FX lending to domestic firms
(in order to better hedge their foreign currency deposits when international hedging becomes more expensive),
thereby causing an increase in the foreign currency exposure of domestic companies. For other evidence on the costs
and distortions created by capital controls, see Forbes (2007).
                                                                                                                 39
        A final set of implications for the application of macroprudential policies is the
 importance of the regulatory perimeter and implications for aggregate welfare if
 macroprudential policies partially shift risks from the regulated sector to unregulated sectors.
 Our results suggest that macroprudential FX regulations can reduce risks in a systemically-
 important sector of the economy (banks). This needs to be balanced, however, against any
 increase in risks in other sectors which are in the “shadow” and potentially less well
 understood than those in the regulated sector. 52 Are these shadow investors less informed
 and/or less able to manage exchange rate movements than banks? Do the regulations
 generate other costs, such as by reducing output due to the less efficient allocation of FX
 lending by investors which lack the knowledge from banks’ screening activities? Even if the
 overall FX exposure of the economy falls, does this benefit outweigh other costs of the
 regulation? Just as a fresh snowbank rarely stays white for long, the impact of
 macroprudential regulation on country resilience can quickly get muddy.




52 Bengui and Bianchi (2014) explore this question in a model of the impact of capital controls, a model which finds

that the controls reduce risk on regulated agents but increase risk taking in the “shadow” economy.

Table 1: Hypothesis #1 - FX regulations and cross-border debt flows to banks
The table shows the estimated parameter values from a panel regression of equation (16). All columns include country and time (quarter) fixed
effects. The dependent variables are estimated exchange rate-adjusted changes in the stock of cross-border loans from international banks to
domestic-resident banks, for loans denominated in foreign or domestic currencies, each expressed as a % of annual GDP. The columns labelled FX
Share use the same data, but express the dependent variable as the change in the share of FX-denominated loans divided by total loans. In columns
7-9, the estimates control for key global factors individually, instead of including a global-time dummy (δt) in equation (16).
Data are from the BIS International Banking Statistics and the split between FX and non-FX components of loans is based on authors’ estimates.
All data is discussed in Section III, with additional information in Appendix A. FW indicates “financially weighted”. The sample period is 1996 Q1
– 2014 Q4. Robust standard errors are clustered at the country level and reported in brackets. ***/**/* is significant at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels,
respectively.

Table 2: Hypothesis #2: FX regulations and cross-border debt issuance by corporates
The table shows the estimated parameter values from a panel regression of equation (16). All columns include country and time (quarter) fixed effects. The
dependent variables are net issuance of debt securities issued by domestic corporates for debt denominated in foreign or domestic currencies, each expressed as
a % of annual GDP. The columns labelled FX Share use the same data, but express the dependent variables as the change in the share of FX-denominated
debt issuance divided by total debt issuance.
Data are from the BIS International Debt Statistics. All data is discussed in Section III, with additional information in Appendix A. FW indicates “financially
weighted”. The sample period is 1996 Q1 – 2014 Q4. Robust standard errors are clustered at the country level and reported in brackets. ***/**/* is significant
at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.

Table 4: More exogenous measures of macroprudential FX regulations
Table 4a shows results of first-stage regressions of changes in macroprudential FX regulations on a range of explanatory variables.
Table 4b then uses the residuals of these six different first-stage regressions as a more exogenous measure of macroprudential FX
regulations in equation (12), replicating column 4 of Tables 1 and 2. The “Model” number listed in each row in Table 4B corresponds
to the same numbered column in Table 4a. See notes to Tables 1 and 2 for more details, and Appendix A for variable definitions.

Table 5: Market vulnerability to currency movements
The table shows the estimated parameter values from a panel regression of equation (17). All columns include country fixed effects. The dependent variables are stock
returns of financials (“Fin.”; which is primarily banks), the broad market (“Broad”; which includes banks, non-bank financials, and corporates) and corporates (“Corp”;
which is an estimate of corporate returns). All columns control for the cumulated FX regulation measure (summed over the current and the last three quarters), the
financially weighted exchange rate (defined as an appreciation of the domestic currency) and their interaction term. Column (5) uses a proxy for corporate stock
returns, estimated as the residual of a regression of the broad return index on the financial index. Columns (6) and (7) restrict the sample to emerging markets.
Columns (8) and (9) are based on the full sample, but include only large exchange rate movements (i.e., values below the 10th and above the 90th percentile in the
distribution of exchange rate movements). The specifications and data are discussed in Sections III and VI. Additional information is provided in Appendix A. The
sample period is 2000 Q1 – 2014 Q4. Robust standard errors are clustered at the country level and reported in brackets. ***/**/* is significant at the 1%, 5%, and 10%
levels, respectively. The larger value of each coefficient pair in absolute terms is marked in bold.

Table 6: Additional effects of FX regulations on banks
The table shows the estimated parameter values from panel regressions of three banking sector variables on changes in FX regulations with country and time fixed
effects, and then the same specification with additional time-varying controls for each country’s business and financial cycle (captured by real GDP growth and credit
growth, respectively). The data frequency is annual. The three banking sector variables are "Risk-Adj. Lending Rate" = Risk premium on lending (lending rate minus
risk free treasury bill rate, %); "Number of Borrowers" = Borrowers from commercial banks (per 1,000 adults); "Share of NP Loans" = Bank non-performing loans to
total gross loans (%). All dependent variables are obtained from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators Database and winsorized at the 2.5 percent level.
Cum. FX Regulation corresponds to the cumulated FX regulation measure (summed over the current and the last three quarters) used in the previous table. Robust
standard errors are clustered at the country level and reported in brackets. ***/**/* is significant at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.

     Appendix A: Data Sources, Definitions, and Summary Statistics

     We use two databases on international capital flows in order to measure debt and bank capital
     flows into FX and non-FX denominated flows: the BIS International Banking Statistics (IBS) data
     for cross-border bank loans provided by international banks 53 and the BIS International Debt
     Statistics (IDS) for the issuance of debt securities of domestic banks and corporates on
     international debt markets (and hence potentially bought by all types of creditors, i.e., banks and
     non-banks).
     For the IBS (international loan) data, the currency denomination of cross-border bank loan
     liabilities needs to be estimated using information on cross-border bank loan assets from all BIS-
     reporting countries to a large set of countries. This is because only a fraction of the countries in
     our sample are BIS reporters and even for BIS reporters we only have information on the FX-loan
     liabilities of the banking system and no information on the balance sheet of non-banks.
     Consequently, we match information on the currency denomination of loans by international
     banks with the currency in use in the receiving country to determine whether a specific currency-
     lending pair can be classified as FX or non-FX from the perspective of the receiving country.
     For the IDS (international debt) data, data on residency basis include information on the currency
     denomination of debt issuance. The data refer to debt securities issued by domestic headquartered
     entities on international markets. This is a key component of the portfolio debt category in the
     balance of payments.
     Additional information on control variables is listed in Appendix Table A1.

data for disaggregating loans to non-banks into loans to non-bank financials, households and corporates, but this time
series is too short for our empirical analysis (starting in 2014 Q1).

Note: Quarterly capital inflows are scaled by annual GDP which is calculated as a 4-quarter moving average of annual data to avoid breaks due to annual GDP rising
or falling from Q4 to Q1. We scale by annual GDP rather than quarterly GDP because the sum of the contemporaneous coefficient and three lags on fxmi,t in equation
(16) can then be read as the effect on capital flows to annual GDP over one year.

Appendix Table B3: Sensitivity analysis of market vulnerability to currency movements
The table shows the estimated parameter values from a panel regression of equation (17). All columns include country fixed effects. The dependent variables are
stock returns of financials (“Fin.”; which is primarily banks), the broad market (“Broad”; which includes both banks, non-bank financial institutions, and corporates)
and an artificial series of corporate stock returns (“Corp.”; corresponding to the residuals of a regression of broad market stock returns on financial stock returns).
Columns (1) and (2) lag all the control variables (except the first three) by one quarter. Columns (3) and (4) exclude the Stock Market Turnover Ratio and the Rule
of Law variables, which are interpolated from annual to quarterly frequency. Columns (5) and (6) exclude 2008Q4, which contains the largest exchange rate
movement in the sample. The specifications and data are discussed in Section III. Additional information is provided in in Appendix A. The sample period is 2000
Q1 – 2014 Q4. Robust standard errors are clustered at the country level and reported in brackets. ***/**/* is significant at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.
The larger value of each coefficient pair in absolute terms is marked in bold.
