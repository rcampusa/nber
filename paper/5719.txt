         Price level targeting (without base drift) and inflation targeting (with base drift) are compared

under commitment and discretion, with persistence in unemployment.          Price level targeting is often

said to imply more short-run inflation variability and thereby more employment            variability than

inflation targeting. Counter to this conventional wisdom, under discretion a price level target results

in lower inflation variability than an inflation target (if unemployment          is at least moderately

persistent).   A price level target also eliminates the inflation bias under discretion and, as is well

known, reduces long-term price variability. Society may be better off assigning a price level target

to the central bank even if its preferences correspond to inflation targeting. A price level target thus

appears to have more advantages than commonly acknowledged.

 1   Introduction


 “Priw stability”    is often rmmmended        as a god for monetary policy. Price stability has been

 interpreted in different ways, though. Price stability can be interpreted as ptia              level stability,

 that is, a stationary price level with low varianm.          In practim, price stability h= often been

interpreted as low and stable infidion.           As is well known, unless above-average ifiation             is

followed by below-average inflation, this restits in base drift of the price level. Bsse drift in

the price level implies that the prim level kma            non-trend-stationary, and the variance of the

future price level increases without bounds with the for~t               horizon. This is obviously rather

far from literal prim stability. I shall refer to a monetary policy regime M prim level taqetzng

or infiattin taqei!ing, depending upon whether the goal is a stable pri~ level or a low and stable

itiation   rate, where the latter allows base drift of the pri~ level.

     In the real world, there are currently several monetary policy regimes with explicit or implicit

idation    targeting (see Haldane (1995) and Leiderrnan and Svensson (1995)), but there are no

regimes with explicit or implicit price level targeting.           Whereas the Gold Standard may be

interpreted as implying implicit price level targeting, Sweden during 1931-33 may so far have

been the only regime in history with explicit prim level targeting (cf. Fisher (1934) and Jonu.ng

(1979)).

     Even if there are no current examples of prim level target regimes, prim level targeting

has received incre=ing       interest in the monetary policy literature, and several recent papers

compare inflation targeting and price level targeting.           Several papers are collected in Bank of

Canada (1994). Duguay (1994) summarims th~                  papers and others and provides a thorough

discussion of the issues involved, see also Fischer (1994) and Gtiart             and Vifials (1994). Some

papem compare ifiation       and price level targeting by simulating the effect of postulated reaction

functions (Lebow, Wberts and Stockton (1992), Fillon and Tetlow (1994), Haldane and Salmon

(1995)).   Other papem compare the properties of postulated simple stochastic processes for

inflation and the prim level (Duguay (1994), Fischer (1994)).              A frequent restit, emerging as

the conventional wisdom, is that the choim between price-level targeting and inflation targeting

involves a trade-off between low-frequency price level unmrtainty on the one hand and high-

frequency ifiation     and output uncertainty on the other. 1 Thus, price level targeting has the

   1 The ~ult k emphasized in Lebow, Robert and Stockton (1992), Ftier          (1994), and Haldane and Salmon
(1995). In mntrast, Fillon & Tetlow (1994) report that in their simu]atiom prim level targeting r~ults in less
irdlationvariabilitybut in more output variability than Mation targeting. No explanation is offeredbeyond the
observationthat the resultsindicatestrong serialmrrelation of the price level. Duguay (1994) does not report the

 advantage of reduced long-term variability of the prim level. This should be beneficial for long-

term nominal mntracts and intertemporal d~isions,                 but mmea at the cost of incremed short-

term variability of idation       and output. The intuition is straightforward: In order to stabilize the

price level under price level targeting, higher-than-average ifiation             must be sumeedd         by lower-

than-average idation.        This should rau.lt in higher ifiation        variability than inflation targeting,

sinm in the latter H         base level drift is accepted and higher-than-average i~ation                need only

be su*d           by average inflation. Via nominal rigiditi~, the higher ifiation             variability should

then result in higher output variability,2

     Applying poatulatd       monetary policy reaction functions, ‘instrument rules’, evokes the issue

of whether these reaction tictions           are optimal for reasonable objective functions of the cen-

tral bank, and whether they are consistent with the realistic situation when the central bank

acts under discretion and mmmitment to an optimal or a simple second-best rule (like those in

McCaUurn (1990) or Taylor (1994)) is not possible (cf. Laidler (1993)). Similarly, applying pos-

tulated pr~ses        for ifiation   and the price level evoka the issue of whether these are consistent

with a reasonable equilibria.

    The purpose of this paper is to mmpare pri~                  level and tiation       targeting, but the pa-

per departs from the previom literature on price level veraus inflation targeting by applying a

principal-agent approach: the decision rules considered are the endogenous decision rules that

result when society (the principal) ~signa (delegates) an inflation target or a price level tar-

get to a central bank (the agent) scting under discretion.                In mmparison, the mrresponding

endogenous decision rules under commitment are also reported, although the focus is on the

discretion case. The reaction functions are henm endogenous, given central bank objectives and

mnstraints, including available mmmitment technology.

    The paper follows Svensson (1996) in interpreting inflation targeting 59 including an ex-

plicit iflation    target and an implicit employment target, with an implicit relative weight on

employment stabilization. This is motivated by the existence of target bands in actual inflation

targeting regimes, indicating that some short-term inflation variability may be ~ptable                         due

prioe level, although for mme of the parametersstudied that varian~ is actually 1- under price level targeting

    2 Hall (1984, 1986) provid= argumenfi for prim stability. McCallum (1990) argurs that price level targeting
providesa relativelysmall gain in long run price predictabili~, sine prim levelvariability (for the U. S.) is already
relatively small under inflation targeting. Gerlach (1993) interprets inflation targets ss a ‘target zone’ for the
price level. Scarth (1994), Crawfordand Du~uier       (1994), and Koni~ny (1994) buss variousaspeck of price
targeting and inflationtargeting.
   Base drift in money supply is distinct from base drift in the prim level. AS shown by Walsh (1986), ~me degree

to imperfect mntrol over idation          but perhaps also in order to dmpen              employment fluctua-

tions; the fact that no inflation targeting central bad           seems b behave as if it wants to attain

the inflation target at any coat (cf. Haldane (1995) and kiderman                and Svensson (1995)); and

by wording in King (1995) that indicates that the inflation targeting Bank of England is not

an “ifiation     nutter” with zero weight on employment stabilization.                  Price level targeting is

consequently interpreted as including an explicit price level target, together with an implicit

employment target. 3

    The paper considers the realistic ~         when output and employment is persistent. The degree

of persistence in employment is ind~            crucial for the results: Without persistence, a trivial

trade-off between long-term price level variability and short-term itiation                   variabilityy arises.

With at least moderate persistent,          counter to the mnventional wisdom, there is no trade-off

between price level variability and inf4ation variability.           Prim level targeting then results in

lower inflation variability than itiation      targeting. This r~ult is due to the endogenous decision

rule that results under discretion for different targets.          Under inflation targeting the decision

rule is a linear feed-back n..de for inflation on employment.            Then the variance of tiation           is

proportional to the varianm of employment. Under prim level targeting, the decision rule is a

linear feed-bd     rule for the price level on employment. Then inflation is a linear function of the

first diflemna of employment. The varianm of ifiation              is then   proportional to the varianm of

the fist differenm of employment. With at least moderate persistent,                 the variance of the &t

differenm of employment is less then the variance of employment.

    In addition, a prim level target has the advantage of eliminating any ifiation                      bias that

reatits under discretion if the employment target ex~s              the natural rate of employment. It is

repl~     by a harmless price level bias. kdeed, with at least moderate persistence, even if society

prefers to minimize inflation variability rather than prim level variability, it will be better off by

=signing a prim level target to the mntral b~              rather than a     itiation     target. The variance

of idation     will be lower, there is no idation      bias, and with expectations inmrporating price

level targeting, employment variability will be the same as under idation                 targeting.4

2   Inflation   targeting


The treatment of tiation     targeting under peraistenm follows Svensson (1996), which in turn

builds on the recent extension of the analysis of rul~ and discretion in monetary policy to

the case of persistence in Lockwood and Philippopoulos (1994), Jomson (1995) and Lockwood,

Miller and Zhang (1995), The short-run Phillips curve is




where lt is (the log) employment rate in period t, o and p are mmtants (a >0 and O s p < 1),

nt = pt —pt_ 1 is the (log of the gross) inflation rate, pt is the (log) prim level, n: denotes price

level expectations in period t – 1 of the prim level in period t, and et is an i.i.d. supply shock

with mean O and variance U2, The private sector has rational expectations.             That is,


                                                 7r; = Ec_lfit,                                      (2.2)


where Et– 1 denotes expectations conditional upon information available in period i! – 1, which

includes the realization of all variablea   Up    to   and including period t — 1, as well as the constant

parameters of the model. The short-run Phillips curve corresponds, for instance, to a situation in

which nominal wagea for period t are set one period in advanw, b~ed on expect atiom in period

t – 1, without knowing the supply shock Etin period t. The (long-run) natural employment rate,

which I identify with the unmnditional mean of the employment rate, E[lt], is for mnvenience set

equal to zero. The autoregressive term arisea, for instance, in wage setting models where trade

unions set nominal wages one period in advanm, disregarding non-union workers’ preferences

and only taking inti account union members’ preferences for real wages and employment, and

where union membership dependa on previous employment.

    The social preferences are repr~ntd          by the social loss function



                                       v = El-J ~p~-lLt

The period loss function is characterized by three parameters: n“ is the socially best ifiation

rate, 1● is the socially best employment rati, and A > 0 is the social weight on employment

stabilization relative to inflation stabilization, The (log of the) smially best employment rate,

be interpreted aa a measure of the distortion in the labor market that causes the socially bat

employment level to exmd          the natural employment level. Alternatively, 1“ can be interpreted

as a measure of the extent to which the employment target is overambitious.                         The role of the

overambitious employment target in the analysis is to introduce a benefit from itiation                  surprises.

As noted in the literature, such benefits can also arise for other reasons, for instance, if a surprise

real depreciation of the nominal public debt is less distortionary than explicit taxation. For the

purpose of this paper, it is not crucial that the employment target is above the natural rate.5

      The central bank is for simplicity assumed to have perfect mntrol over the ifiation                  rate Zt.

It sets the itiation    rate in each period after having observed the current supply shock Ct.6


2.1    Commitment

                    V-(lt-l)   = mi; Et.l          ;     (7r, - m“)z + A (1~- 1“)2] + pv”(l,)                 (2.5)

subject to (2.1) and (2.2). The lagged employment rate enters as a state variable. Here nt may

depend on both the supply shock et md the lagged employment rate lt_l, whereas n; may only

depend on lt_ 1. The indirect loss function V“ (lt_l)              will be quadratic and can be written

                                                                         1*2

      It is shown in the appendix that the optimal nde is

We see that the optimal i~ation            response to supply shocks is larger under persistence (p >0,

~~ > O) than without (p = y; = O). Since.current employment changes affect future employment,

it becomes more important to stabilize employment; hence ifiation                                  is allowed to fluctuate more.

Note that inflation only depen& on the private information of the mntral bank; any dependence

on information known by the private sector just goes into expectd                                  itiation,   which adds to the

loss function without affmting employment; cf. Persson and Tabellini (1993).

the optimal rule, ~ = b“. With persistent,       we have ~2 > y; (see appendix), and by mmparing

(2.15) and (2.8) we see that, under discretion, there is a stabilization bim in that the inflation

mmes even more important to stabilize the employment rate, which requires a stronger inflation

Thus, nominal inmme targetingis not exactly equal k price level targeting with A = 1; the cross term enters as
well. The Werenm is, of cou~, that nominal iucome level targeting implies a mnatant unitary marginal rate of
substitution between the price level and the employment rate, regardl~ of the levels of the variables.

subject to (3.1) and (3.2), The prim level ~ may depend on the lagged employment rate and

the current supply shock; expectations p: depend on the lagged employment rate only.

      The decision problem is identical to that of an ifiation                 target under commitment,   (2.5),

exmpt that pt and p; replu             Tt and T*. Thus the indirect 10SSfunction is unchanged. With the

same reasoning ~ above, the optimal decision rule is

3.2    Discretion

Under discretion, the decision problem of the mntral bank can be written


                       v(lt_l) =   Et-l ~n      ~ (Pt-P;)2+A(it            - 1“2) ] + Bv(lt)       ,      (3.7)

where the minimization in period t is subject to (2.1) but is done for given price level expect a-

tions pf. Thus the central bank no longer internalizes the effect of its decisions on price level

expect ations, although it takea into ~unt                that changes in current employment will affect

current expwtations of future pria levels (this is incorporated in ~(lt)).


                                                          11
    Except for the change in variables from nt to pt, the decision problem is the same as under
itiation targeting. Thus, the indirect 10ssfunction will be the same w under ifiation          targeting.

By the same argument as above the decision rule futills

where 6 is given by (2.15), ~1 and ~2 are given by (2.16) and (2.17), and the same existence

condition is med.      The employment rate will behave as (2.14).

    With persistence, the prim level response to supply shocks is larger under discretion than

under commitment.      Sinm, under discretion, the future price level bias depends on current

employment, it becomes even more important to stabilize employment. This requires a stronger

prim level response. The price level under price level targeting behaves precisely as the inflation

rate under inflation targeting, with an average and state-mntingent ptiu            level bi= instead of

an itiation   bias.

    The results are summarized in Table 3, the mlumn for Discretion. The future price level is

where I have used (3,4). We see that there is no average ifiation       bias under price level targeting,

row (6), although there is a state-cent ingent inflation bias, row (5). The conditional variance of

inflation is the same aa under tiation     targeting, row (7), whereas the unmnditional varianm is

different, row (8).

   Indeed, comparing itiation    under idation     targeting and price level targeting, we note that

inflation under inflation targeting is a linear function of employment (Table 1, row (4)), whereas

under price level targeting it is a linear function of the first diffemnti of employment (Table 2,

row (4)). The unmnditional varianm of these are by Table 2 related as


                                 Var [it – 1~-~]= 2(1 – p)Var [1~].

Sinm the unconditional varianm of the fist difference of the employment rate is lower than the

unconditional variance of output if p > ~, it follows that the unconditional variance of inflation

is lower under prim level targeting if the employment rate is at least moderately persistent. If

1“ = O, p > ~ is both necessary and sticient                for a lower varianm of ifiation   under prim level

targeting; if 1“ >0, p > ~ is sticient           but not n~sary.

4   Evaluation     of price level target equilibria                 with ifiation      target      preferences


E social preferences mrrespond to the price level period 10SSfunction (3.3), it is obvious that a

price level target equilibrium is preferable to an inflation target equilibrium. The two equilibria

have identical employment behavior, but in the inflation target equilibrium the prim level is

non-trend-stationary      and furthermore grows faster than the target price level by the inflation

bias.

    If social preferences mrrespond to the ifiation            target period loss function (2.4), can the price

level target equilibrium still be preferable? That is, would it be preferable to assign a price level

target to the central bank even if social preferences mncern inflation rather than the price level.

In order to answer this question, both equilibria must be evaluated with the inflation-target

social loss function.     For the ifiation        target quilibriurn,    the relevant indirect loss function is

defined in the d=ision problem (2.11) and given by (2.12), with the mefficients $1 and ~z given

by (2,16) and (2.17). The aficient              ~0 is derived in the appendix and given in (A. 16).

    The value of the inflation-target social loss fiction               for the price level target equilibrium,

denoted by VP(lt_l), is defied       M

where (3. 10) and (2. 14) is substituted for nc and lC. This value function will be quadratic and

can be written

                                                                                                           (4.2)

where the ~fficients      ~, R and % remain to be determined.

    In order to answer the question above, I thus need to mmpute
                                                                               .
                                                                                                           (4.3)


This is done in detail in the appendix. However, it is intuitively clear that price level targeting

is better than ifiation     targeting if society has inflation target preferences (if there is at least

moderate employment persistent),           since with price level targeting (i) the variability of inflation

is less, (ii) any inflation bias is eliminated, and (iii) employment behavior is the same.

    This result can be further illuminated by a direct comparison of the decision rules. The

optimal rule under commitment with inflation targeting is (2.7).                    Due to (2.10), it can be

written

                                     7rt
                                           ‘T”–l–ab”

                                                   l–ah

Clearly, under discretion, price level targeting may deliver a better approximation to the optimal

tie    (4.4) than inflation targeting   The -fficient       ~~   is the same under both kinds oft argeting

(although larger than under commitment).           Unemployment behavior is the same. There is no

average itiation bias under prim level targeting, and, with enough persistence, the first difference

of the employment rate, lC— /t. 1, is a better approximation to the unanticipated change in the

employment rati, lt —pit– 1, than jmt the employment rate, lt.

      This comparison of decision rul~ abo reveals that price level targeting under discretion does

not deliver the optimal rule for inflation targeting under commitment. Svensson (1996) examines

how modified inflation targets can improve the discretionary equilibrium with persistence in

employment and compares with Rogoff (1985) ‘conservative’                  central banks and with Walsh

(1995)-Persson and Tabel.lini (1993) linear inflation contracts.


5     Conclusions


Amrding       to m emerging, although not completely unanimous (cf. Dillon ad              Fellow (1994))

conventional wisdom, the choice between prim level targeting and itiation              targeting involves

a trade-off between (1) less low-frequency price level variabilityy and (2) less high-frequency

itiation and employment variabihty. This mnventional wisdom arises from the use of exogenous

react ion functions or exogenous inflation and price level processes, which may or may not be

consistent with objwtives and constraints (including commitment technologies) faced by central

banks. In contrast, this paper examines price level and itiation targeting by deriving endogenous

decision rules and equilibrium prim level and itiation           pr~ses,    when central banks have been

assignd prim level or ifiation     targets and, realistically, act under discretion and f=     persistent

employment.

      In this framework, prim level targeting naturally results in lower low-frequency price level

variability than inflation targeting. However, if employment persistent           is at le~t moderate, it

also radts     in lower high-frequency idation     variability, munter to conventional wisdom. The


                                                    15
reason is that under inflation targeting ifiation     depends on the employment rate, whereas under

price level tmgeting it depends on the change in the employment rate; with sficient            persistent,

the change in the rate is less variable than the rate itself.

    In addition, prim level targeting eliminates the average itiation              biw that results under

ifiation   targeting when the implicit employment target is lower than the natural employment

rate,

    If society’s preferences mrrespond to price level targeting, prim level targeting is clearly

better than ifiation   targeting, since the latter results in a non-trend-stationary        prim level and,

when there is an inflation bias, in a price level that increasingly deviates from the target price

level. If society’s preferenms instead correspond to tiation           targeting, because of the reduced

inflation variability and inflation biaa, it is stall better for society to assign a prim level target

to the mntral bank (if employment persistent              is at least moderate).   This result mn also be

understood with reference to the optimal rule under commitment.                    Under commitment     and

ifiat ion targeting, itiation   depends only on the private information of the central bank, in

this w     the supply shock. Under discretion and idation            targeting, inflation depends on the

employment rate; under prim level targeting itiation depends on the change in the employment

rate; when employment is persistent, the latter is a better approximation to the supply shock

than the former .

   The paper has demonstrated the importance of employment persistent                  for the results, and,

I hope, the benefits of deriving endogenous decision rules for assigned targets rather thm using

postulated reaction functiom.

   In the model used here price level targeting and i~ation          targeting result in the same employ-

ment variability. This is because both regimes readt in the same conditional one-period variance

of the prim level and the idation     rate (although the unconditional variability of one-period in-

flation, and the mnditional more-than-one-period           variance of the prim level and ifiation     rate,

are lower under pri~ level targeting), and ordy the unanticipated part of one-period price move-

ments affect employment.

   However, if nominal wages are downwmdly rigid, anticipated negative inflation (deflation)

would increase real wages and increase employment. This may increase employment variability;

in particular it may redum avemge employment. The eff~t haa &n                studid   by Lebow, Roberts

and Stockton (1992), Crawford and Dupaaqtier (1994), Fillon and Tetlow (1994) and Akerlof,

Dickens and Perry (1996).       For given ifiation    variability, the effect depends on the average



                                                     16
inflation rate, regardless of whether there is price level or inflation targeting. The effect is hence

 an argument for a positive inflation target under i~ation        targeting and a prim level target that

increases at a steady rate during priw level targeting, since that would reduce the frequency of

deflation. However, the reduced variability of inflation under price level targeting still seems to

be an argument in favor of price level targeting. Productivity growth will in any cue reduce the

effect, For the Unitd         States, Lebow Stockton and Wascher (1995) report empirical evidence

that indicate little downward rigidity and very small aggregate output effects of reducing U.S.

ifiation    to zero, and in simulations Fillon and Tetlow (1994) also report small output effects.

Akerlof, Dickens and Perry (1996) find larger output and unemployment effects, though.                Any

degree of downward nominal rigidity is, however, likely to be endogenous and regime dependent

and hence decrease with less ifiation. 11

    Nonnegative nominal interest rates have also been used as an ar~ent            for a positive inflation

rate, sins     low or negative idation       could then result in too high real interest rates, and in

particular prevent monetary policy from being sufficiently expansionary in recessions (Summers

(1991)). But, Lebow (1993) shows that monetary policy can still be expansionary by using other

instruments than interest rates on government bonds and bills, if these interest rates occasionally

fall to zero. In simulations Fuhrer and Madigan (1994) find very small effects on output from

nonnegative nominal interest rate9. The problem will be smaller, if future real interest rates

are generally higher than in the 1960s and the 1970s. For a given average itiat ion rate, the

reduced itiation       viability    under prim level targeting again seems to speak in favor of price

level targeting.

    In any case, to the extent that downwardly rigid nominal wages and nonnegative nominal

interest rates imply a positive average inflation rate, there is no principle difficulty with a price

level target which incre~          at a steady rate, since that does not redum the predictability of the

price level.

    The parameters of the Phillips curve (the slope, the degree of persistence, and the variance of

supply shocks) might not be invariant to a shift from ifiation        targeting to price level targeting.

It is not obviom, though, whether the parameters are likely to change and if so, in what direction,

-pecially    since conditional variances (and average inflation in case the employment target equals

the natural rate) are the same in the two regimes, Clearly a more elaborate analysis with explicit

microfoundations       of the Phillips curve, is then required.

    Will random walk measurement errors of the price level provide an argument agaimt price

level targeting?    No, for if there are such me~urement     errors, there will be an unavoidable

random walk mmponent to the ‘true’ pri~ level, but tiation      targeting will add another random

walk mmponent, making the variance of the prim level still higher under inflation targeting than

under prim level targeting.

    What is the effect of mntrol errors? Suppose there are i,i.d. control errors, qt, on the price

level, with varianm u;. Under itiation    targeting, this will add a; to the varianm of iflation.

Under price level targeting, this will be added twim to the variance of inflation, which means

that the degrm of persistent     must be somewhat higher (than a half), in order to make the

itiat ion varianm less under price level targeting (unless the variance due to mntrol errors is so

huge as to dominate all other SOW-of       variability).

    Do social preferenm    mrrespond to inflation targeting or price level targeting? What are the

social benefits of redud    long-term uncertainty of the prim level? This seems to be an under-

researched area (see Konieczny (1994) and Duguay (1994) for discussion).        There are obvious

informational and computational benefits of a stable, or at least predictable, unit of account

for intertemporal decisions and for decisions that occur relatively infrequently. Although these

benefits are obvious, they are difficult to asses quantitatively.    Standard mnomic     theory is

certainly at a disadvantage assessing such costs, sinm it relies on the assumption on unbounded

mmputational capacity of agents. I believe that we have to some extent become so used to a

randomly incr-ing     price level that we have grown blind to the information and computation

costs it imposes,   It h= been argued that the analog       to length and other physical units is

revealing: Suppose that the meter or the foot were to be randomly redud       each year. We cotid

certainly live in such a world; we would only have to keep track of which year meter or foot

things were measured in, and we mtid carry a card in our wallets with the appropriate mnversion

factors, We muld certainly live in such a world; but it wotid no doubt be a mnsiderable struggle.

For some reason, we have come to ~pt       such a state of tiairs in the economic sphere.

   ReduA     long-term uncertainty wotid obviously reduce the unmrtainty associated with long-

term nominal contracts, like long-term nominal bonds.       But if the mst of such unmrtainty is

significant, why is it not circumvented by indexation?     One possibility is that the information

and computational mst of indexation is itself substantial; the fact that citizem seem to shift to

foreign currency as a unit of ~unt    ody when domestic inflation goes above 20-30 percent per

year has been quoted as evidenm that those costs maybe quite substantial (Konieczny (1994)).

More work on formal models of the asts of long-term pri~ level uncertainty would be very

welcome.

                                                                                                        (A.7)

where I have used (2.12). The marginal loss of increased ifiation            expectations have vanished

from the first order condition.

      Taking expectations of (A.8) gives




Combining (2. 1), (2.2), (A,8) and (A,9) givea a feedbwk rule of the form

Unemployment will be given by (2.14),

      In order to detetine   ~1 ad     ~2, I substitute (A.1O) and (2.14) into (2.11). Using (2.12) to

identify the coefficient for l?. 1 results in


                                    ?2 = (~+   P?2)P2 + (~ + 972)2~2P2.                                (A.12)

This is a second-degree equation in ~2, which henm has two potential           roots, The equation has
real roots if and only if the first existenm rendition

                                                                                                       (A,13)

holds. Only the smaller solution, (2. 17), is relevant (see Lockwood&        Philippopoulos        (1994) and

Svensson (1996)).

    If the second term on the right-hand side of (A.12) were zero, 72 would equal T;, cf. (2.9).

Sinw the term is positive, 72> y;.

    Identifimtion of the coefficient for it-l, ~1, results in (2.16). In order to ensure that there is

a fite    solution to ~1, the second existence condition

                                         pp [1 + (A + P32)a2] <1                                      (A.14)


                                                       20
must hold. The condition has a natural interpretation: The expression on the left hand side
of the inequality is the dimunti          total increaae in the employment rate in period t of a unit

increase in the employment rate in period t – 1, when inflation in period t is held constant.

The total effect mnsists of the direct effect, p, and the indirect effect via redud                    inflation

expect ations, ~   ~,    cf. (A.9). If this discounted effect is above unity, the present value of the
                 t
eff=t in all future periods will be unbounded.

     With (2. 17) one can show that (A.14) is equivalent to


                                                                                                          (A.15)


It is shown in Svensson (1996) that for some parameter values (A. 15) is more binding than

(A.13). More prwisely, the complete existence condition is (i) for ~ < p <1 and 0< ~ < ~,

~s~l,(ii)for~~p<land~=~,                        A< Al=      A2, and(iii)   for O<p    <land      ~<~<1,

A < A2 < Al. If 1“ = O, only (A.13) is relevant.12

Let me start with the first term on the right-hand side of (4.3). Identifiation                of the constant

% in (4.1) and (4.2) results, after some algebra, in


                                                                                                           (B.1)


From (A. 16) we have


                                                                                                           (B.2)


Thus

                                                                                                           (B.3)

   12 The conditiom (A.14) and (A. 15) do not appear in the analysiaof kckwood and Philippopoulos (1994),
since they mume that 1“ = O.
   If a in (2.1) equale unity (as in bckwood and Philipppouloe (lU)        and in Lockwood, Miller and Zhang
(1995)), the ~tenm     mnditione appear rather restrictive. Lf~ = 0.95 and p = 0.4 (0.8), we have ~     = –1.25
(0.4), ao (A.15) appli=. Then A2 = 0.98 (0.06), ~mtively.     U a insti  equala0.2, the mrresponding AZ valu~
are 25 times larger, that is, 24.5 (1.58). The co-riding   valua for Al are 1.18 (0.M) for a = 1, and 29.6 (1,58)
for a = 0.2.


                                                      21
 The first term on the right-hand side is negative and obviously arises b=use                        the price level target

 equilibria       has no average inflation bias. The second term depends on the difference between

 the -fficients       % and ~z, that is, the convexity of the indirect loss function. Identification of

Win     (4.1) and (4.2) gives

                                             ~=        ~P2+(+,)2(1-P)’                                               (B.4)

In order to facilitate comparison, by (All)                    and (A. 12), ~z can be written as13

The difference between ~ and ~z is negative when p > ~, since the idation                            rate is less sensitive

to lagged employment under prim level targeting if P > ~. A given level of 1~.1 in period t – 1
will give rise to a squared idation               term in period t equal to (&)’(1            -P)2J:-I      ~der   aPrice

sequence of such terms requires diwunting                      by ~p’).

     Finally, let me look at the sand              term in (4. 3), corresponding to the linear term in the value

functions. Identifying the linear term in (4,1) and (4.2) gives

                                                        <=_*.                                                        (B.7)

In order to facilitate mmparison, I use (A, 11), (All)                    and (2.16) with some algebra to rewrite

This difference mises since an increase in /t. 1 reduces the lees function more under inflation

targeting   the resulting reduction in nt is more beneficial sinm the average inflation bias is

positive under ifiation     targeting.

    The unconditional mean of (4.3) is

We see that if h = k, we have Var [zt]P < Var [rt]T if and only if h = k > ~.

    Fischer (1994, Figure 2.4 and Footnote 45) mmpar~                      (C.2) and (C.4) with h = Oand k = 0.5,

for which case k <1 – 2h2 and Var[rt]P = $s2 >Var[rt]r                       = S2; the itiation    variance is higher

under price level targeting.

    Duguay (1994) examines the processes (Cl)            and (C.3) for different values of h and k. Typical

values used are h = 0.5 and 0.7 (tiation         targeting such that 75% oft he adjustment of inflation

towards the target is achievd         in 2 and 4 perid            (years), respectively),      k = 0.7 (price level

periods (years)), and s 2 —

scaled by 100).15 Let me use these values and mmpute the unmnditional variance of inflation.

For th=      values, k > 1 – 2h2, the variance is less under price level targeting, and we get

Var[nt]r = 1.33 and 1.95, respectively, and Var[~t]P = 1.18. Now the variance of ifiation                              is

lower under price level targeting.

    Duguay (1994) d-          not report this unmnditional standard deviation of one-period inflation;

instead he reports the conditional standard deviation of the price level and the average inflation

rate, fl~         and       vart~     = - T-t     ~for different time horizons T – t. Tables Al and A2
                        P
summarize some results for the pr-ses             (Cl)    and (C.3).
    What univariate processes for idation            and the price level do tiation               targeting and price
level targeting under discretion result in? Under inflation targeting (2.13) implies lt= +(7rt                         -

~). Using this in (2.14) results in


                                       nt = (1 – p)a +        p7rt-1       + &t.                                 (C.6)


Thus, disregarding the mnstant, itiation         targeting correspond               to the prmss    (Cl)   with h=p.

Under price level targeting (3.8) implies lt = ~              (pt – at). Using this in (2.14) gives


                                                                                                                 (C.7)
where fit = pt – at. Thus, the pr~s                for fi corresponds to the process (C. 3) with k = p. The

corresponding ifiation    process will be
