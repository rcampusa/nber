              PRODUCT INNOVATIONS, PRICE INDICES AND THE (MIS)MEASUREMENT
                                OF ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE


                                     ABSTRACT
      The goal of this paper is to address the problem of 'product innovations'
(i.e. new goods. increased variety, and quality change) in the construction of
price indices and, by extension, in the measurement of                        economic   performance.
The   premise      is     that     a       great     deal of technical progress takes the form of
product innovations, but conventional economic statistics fail by and large to
reflect them. The approach suggested here consists of two stages:                           first.     the
benefits    from        innovations          are     estimated   with   the   aid of discrete choice
models. and second, those benefits are used to                      construct    'quality     adjusted'
price indices. Following a discussion of the merits of such approach vis a vis
hedonic    price        indices,       I     apply     it to the case of CT (Computed Tomography)
Scanners. The main finding is that the rate of decline in the real price of CT
scanners was a staggering 55% per year (on average) over the first                          decade     of
the   technology.        By contrast,              an hedonic-based index captures just a small
fraction of the decline.               and    a     simple    (unadjusted)    price   index    shows    a
substantial     price       increase over the same period. Thus, conventional economic
indicators might be missing indeed a great deal of the welfare consequences of
technical advance, particularly during the initial stages of the product cycle
of new products.
