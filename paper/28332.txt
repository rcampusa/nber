This paper analyzes the spatial distribution of refugees over 1987-2017 and establishes several
stylized facts about refugees today compared with past decades. Refugees still predominantly
reside in developing countries neighboring their country of origin. However, compared to past
decades, refugees today (i) travel longer distances, (ii) are less likely to seek protection in a
neighboring country, (iii) are less geographically concentrated, and (iv) are more likely to reside
in a high-income OECD country. The findings bring new evidence to the debate on refugee
responsibility-sharing.

1         Introduction
By the end of 2017, the world had witnessed its highest recorded number of forcibly
displaced people worldwide to date at 68.5 million persons, including 3.1 million asylum-
seekers and 25.4 million refugees.1 While that number includes 4.0 million refugees from
older conflicts in Afghanistan and Somalia, 10.1 million of these are from the more recent
crises in Syria, Myanmar, and South Sudan.
        The 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (complemented by the 1967
Protocol) determines that refugee status shall be granted to any person who finds her
or himself displaced "owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race,
religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion" (Art.
1.A.2.). Signatory states commit to provide treatment "no less favorable than nationals
of foreign countries in the same circumstances" with respect to employment (Art. 17),
housing (Art. 21), education, and public relief (Art. 22 and 23).
        Most importantly, the Convention underlines the need for solidarity among countries
in sharing the responsibility for hosting refugees. Yet, the non-refoulement clause (Art.
33) implies that first countries of contact with asylum seekers are often those who have
to provide protection. Other signatories, on the other hand, can voluntarily decide on
their involvement in responsibility-sharing, potentially leading to free-riding (Suhrke
1998, Bubb, Kremer and Levine 2011). This creates a fundamental imbalance across
UN Member States, with political and fiscal constraints of host countries having been
associated with a lack of adequate assistance (Hathaway and Neve 1997, Crisp 2003)
and an additional reason for setting up refugee camps (Smith 2004).
        On December 17, 2018, the United Nations General Assembly affirmed the Global
Compact on Refugees (UN General Assembly 2018), after two years of extensive consul-
tations led by UNHCR with UN Member States, international organizations, refugees,
civil society, the private sector, and experts. The Global Compact on Refugees opens
by stressing that "there is an urgent need for more equitable sharing of the burden
of and responsibility for hosting and supporting the world's refugees, while taking ac-

    Asylum seekers have crossed a national border and have applied for international protection. When
asylum is granted, they become refugees. These figures only include refugees and asylum-seekers under
the mandate of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Palestine refugees
account for another 5.3 million persons and are under the mandate of the United Nations Relief and
Works Agency for Palestine refugees in the Near East (UNRWA).

count of existing contributions and the differing capacities and resources among States."
It formally "intends to provide a basis for predictable and equitable burden- and
responsibility-sharing among all United Nations Member States, together with other rel-
evant stakeholders as appropriate." Underpinning the global debate on responsibility-
sharing is the assumption that "the grant of asylum may place unduly heavy burdens
on certain countries" (UN General Assembly 2018), typically countries neighboring a
conflict area. In this perspective, the number of refugees a country is to host is simply
a function of its geography.
   This paper examines empirically the proposition that the hosting of refugees falls
disproportionately on neighboring countries, which in most cases are in the developing
world. To do so, we use data on worldwide bilateral refugee stocks compiled by UNHCR
to examine the spatial distribution of refugees and its evolution over time. Our period
of analysis is 1987-2017.
   Our main findings can be summarized as follows. While refugees still remain over-
whelmingly in a country neighboring their country of origin, the past decades have seen
a trend towards greater geographic diffusion. We begin by showing that the global pop-
ulation of refugees has been increasingly dispersed across host countries, as captured
by a falling Herfindahl index of host-country shares.
   We then document several features of the data underlying this greater diffusion,
using four outcome measures of refugee spatial distribution. First, we compute the av-
erage distance refugees have traveled between their country of origin and their country
of destination. The average distance traveled by refugees has increased substantially
over time. Next, we look at the probability that source and host countries are con-
tiguous, and show that the share of refugees going to an adjacent country has fallen.
Third, we construct a measure of refugee spatial dispersion by computing the Herfind-
ahl index of refugee shares by source country. The Herfindahl index of refugee shares
fell substantially over time, indicating that refugees from a given conflict are now more
dispersed across host countries.
   These results paint a picture of a more globalized and far-reaching refugee network
and imply a more equal distribution of the responsibility for hosting refugees, albeit
with the backdrop of highly unequal distribution to start with. To get some indication


                                           3
about where refugees go, we compute the share of refugees seeking protection in high-
income OECD countries. We find that high-income OECD countries host an increasing
share of the global refugee population. As of 1990, under 5 percent of refugees resided in
a high-income OECD country. This share grew to nearly 25 percent by the mid-2000s,
before falling somewhat to 15 percent, still triple the 1990 value.
   To alleviate compositional issues, we project the matrix of distances traveled on
source country fixed effects and time effects. Source fixed effects control for time-
invariant country characteristics, and thus allows us to rule out that changes over time
in average distance traveled by refugees are driven by differences over time in which
countries experience conflict. Moreover, analyzing each refugee situation as an event-
study, we observe that the increased spatial dispersion of refugees is a phenomenon that
occurs at the onset of a situation rather than the outcome of geographical diffusion over
time.
   The theoretical literature on refugee hosting has advocated for an international
system of quotas (Hathaway and Neve 1997), which could even be tradeable (Schuck
1997). However, there are few empirical analyses of refugee data that can inform policy.
A notable exception is Dreher, Fuchs and Langlotz (2019), which looks at bilateral aid
flows and argues that donor countries use aid as a way to reduce the flow of refugees
entering their territory. As such, they establish the existence of some form of bargaining
with transferable utility between potential host countries. To further the debate on
refugee hosting, Bubb et al. (2011) discuss a system of financial transfers from richer
countries to poorer ones for hosting refugees and at the same time distinguishing the
international protection of asylum seekers from economic migration. One could see
such mechanisms at work in recent cooperation agreements between the EU and third
countries such as Jordan or Turkey (Temprano Arroyo 2019).
   The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data used in
the analysis. Section 3 presents the results. Section 4 concludes.

2         Data
Our analysis is primarily based on data on refugee stocks compiled by the UNHCR.
UNHCR annually publishes the data on refugee stocks by source and destination coun-
try pair. The term "refugee" includes both refugees and asylum seekers. Under the
1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol, a refugee
is defined as "a person who has been forced to flee his or her country because of per-
secution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a
particular social group" (Art 1.A.2.).
        The UNHCR Population Statistics Reference database contains data for the period
1951 ­ 2017 (released on June 19, 2019). The data set compiles annual stocks of refugees
and asylum seekers at the source-destination level for 197 destination and 223 source
countries. The ultimate source of the data is the authorities of each receiving country.
While in principle there are observations going back to 1951, coverage prior to the
late 1980s is too sparse to be usable. Thus, our analysis covers the period 1987-2017.
Overall, we have 112,522 non-zero observations for bilateral stocks over the period
1987-2017.
        Since the data are not recorded at the individual level, we cannot reliably calculate
refugee flows. Thus, the main variable used in the analysis is the refugee stocks. By
definition, the stock of refugees in any particular year mixes individuals that arrived at
different times. Since our main object of interest is changes in refugee behavior over
time, analyzing stocks will if anything attenuate temporal differences.
        To better approximate flows, we restrict the sample to large refugee events. A
refugee event begins in the year in which the global stock of refugees from a particular
source country first exceeds 25,000. An event ends when the stock falls below 25,000,
or 10 years after initiation if the destination is an OECD country, whichever comes
first.2 Capping the termination date of the event also puts earlier and later years in
the sample on a more equal footing, as stocks in later years contain earlier vintages of
refugees. An added benefit of restricting the sample to large refugee events is that this
procedure also removes source countries with small numbers of refugees, who fled not

    For OECD countries, UNHCR does not include most individuals who have been in the country
for more than 10 years in their published refugee statistics.

due to armed conflict but for more idiosyncratic reasons. We check robustness of this
approach in two ways: (i) using all of the refugee stock observations available in the
data set, and (ii) computing refugee flows as the positive time differences in refugee
stocks from year to year (setting negative time differences to zero). The results are
robust to these two alternatives.

3     The Globalization of Refugee Movements
How is the responsibility for hosting refugees shared? To get a better sense of the
spatial distribution of refugees across countries, we first construct a measure of refugee
dispersion. Namely, we compute a host country Herfindahl index, which measures
how concentrated or dispersed refugees are across all destination countries worldwide.
Concretely, the (weighted) destination Herfindahl index is defined as

                                                                  2
                                                         Rdt
                                 Htd   =       dt                     ,
                                           d             d Rd t


where Rdt is the total number of refugees at destination d at time t, so the denominator
is simply the global stock of refugees. Refugee numbers Rdt are weighted by dt . When
dt = 1, the result is the textbook Herfindahl index, which takes a value of 1 if one
country ends up hosting all the refugees in the world and converges to 0 if every coun-
try hosts the same number of refugees. Alternatively, a GDP-weighted version of the
                                                                           GDPdt
destination Herfindahl index is calculated by setting dt = 1 -            GDPworldt
                                                                                      and accounts


                                                    7
for trends in countries' relative sizes.




                    Figure 2: Destination Herfindahl Index, 1987-2017

Note: This figure plots the destination Herfindahl indices (unweighted and GDP-weighted) of refugee
dispersion.


    Figure 2 displays the trends in the global destination Herfindahl. It shows a drop in
the geographic concentration of refugees worldwide over the past 20 years. Arguably,
such dispersion could be driven by a greater diffusion of refugees for any given conflict,
or an increased geographical spread of episodes of forced displacement due to conflict.
To gain a more complete understanding of this trend, we turn to an analysis from the
source country perspective.


The geographic distribution of refugees: unconditional trends

Figure 3 presents the main results of the paper. It displays four indicators that highlight
the spatial dimensions of the globalization of refugees. Panel (a) plots the average
distance traveled by a refugee for each 5-year period between 1987 and 2017. There is

Note: This figure plots the average distance traveled by a refugee, the share of refugees finding them-
selves in a contiguous country, the average Herfindahl index of refugee shares by source country, and
the share of refugees finding themselves in a wealthy OECD country.


a pronounced upward trend: the average distance traveled rises from around 1300km
at the beginning of the sample to 2200km in the mid-2000s, before settling at around
1800km in the last decade. Panel (b) plots the share of refugees that find themselves
in a country that shares a land border with their country of origin. At the beginning of
the sample 95 percent of refugees were in a country contiguous with their home country.
That share fell to 77 percent in the the period 2012-2017.
    Another manifestation of the increasing geographical reach of refugees is the greater
number of destination countries to which they go. Similar to the global destination
Herfindahl index above, we construct a source-specific Herfindahl index that captures
whether refugees from a given source country diversify their destinations over time.
That is, for a specific source country s and year t, the source Herfindahl index is




                                                                                                      9

                                              d        d Rsd t

where Rsdt is the number of refugees from s in d at time t. The source Herfindahl index
takes a maximum value of 1 when all the refugees from s go to a single d, so that d's
share is 1. The lower is the Herfindahl index, the more spread out is the pattern of
refugee flows across destinations.
    We then compute the simple mean of Hst for each year, and plot the 5-year averages
of this mean. Figure 3, panel (c) reports the results. There is a substantial decrease in
the Herfindahl of destination shares over time, from an average of 0.62 at the beginning
to 0.36 at the end. The fall in the Herfindahl indicates greater diversification of refugee
flows across locations over time.3
    Finally, to isolate the increasing impact of refugee inflows on high-income countries,
panel (d) plots the share of the global refugee stock in high-income OECD country
destinations.4 The increasing importance of wealthy countries as hosts of refugees is
evident.


Frictionless benchmark While we are not making any normative statements on the
optimal spatial distribution of refugees, we compare the actual spatial distribution with
the one obtained in alternative benchmark scenarios. In particular, we recompute these
four measures in the counterfactual world where the number of refugees leaving each
source country is the same as in the data, but is distributed uniformly across all the
countries in the world in proportion to the destinations' total GDP. The counterfactual
                                         c
stock of refugees in d from source s is Rsdt thus computed as

                                  c                   GDPdt
                                 Rsdt = Rst ×
                                                    d world GDPd t

      Because the Herfindahl is a simple average across source countries at a point in time, it may be
dominated by smaller source countries, which do not account for much of refugee flows. To check
whether this is driving the results, we also examined the evolution of the average Herfindahls for only
the top 10 and top 5 source countries in each year (which countries are in the top 10 or 5 changes from
year to year, as different countries undergo conflicts). The pattern of increased source diversification
is quite similar for the top source country samples. The results are available upon request.

      High-income OECD countries in our sample are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark,
Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway,
Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and United States. We thus exclude the
newer members of the OECD, such as South Korea, Mexico, or Turkey.


                                                  10
Perhaps it is unrealistic to expect refugees to diffuse frictionlessly literally across the
entire globe. We thus compute a variant in which refugees diffuse uniformly to only
countries within 5000km of the source:

        c,5k                       GDPdt
       Rsdt  = Rst ×                                    d is less than 5000km from s
                            d dist(s,d)<5000   GDPd t
              = 0 otherwise.


   Table 2 summarizes the 4 main diffusion measures in this counterfactual world,
and compares them to the data for each 5-year period. Two clear patterns emerge.
First, a uniform distribution of refugees either worldwide or within a 5000km radius
would imply much larger distances traveled, much lower contiguous share, much lower
Herfindahl, and a much higher share going to the wealthy OECD group. The differences
provide a stark illustration of the starting point of the paper: the current sharing of
the responsibility for hosting refugees is far from proportional. In the data, refugees
are much more concentrated in nearby and poorer countries than would be the case
if there were no geographic or policy frictions. Second, there is little or no trend in
these counterfactual patterns over time. The observed distribution of refugees today is
closer to this counterfactual distribution than it was at the beginning of our sample.
This suggests that the patterns of greater diffusion documented above are not driven
by underlying trends in the "frictionless" counterfactual benchmark.


Understanding the trends

Changes in composition We first assess whether the time trends documented above
are driven by the changing composition of refugee source countries over time. For
instance, if conflicts that give rise to refugee flows occurred in more remote countries
in the more recent periods, then the distance traveled would increase. This would not
be because it is now easier for refugees to travel farther, but rather because of the
changing geography of conflict. To rule out pure compositional changes, we estimate
the following regression at the source-time period level:


                                Outcomest = t + s + st ,                               (1)

Figure 4: Trends in refugee reach, time effects controlling for source effects, 1987-2017

Note: This figure plots the time effects on the average distance traveled by a refugee, the share of
refugees finding themselves in a contiguous country, the average Herfindahl index of refugee shares by
source country, and the share of refugees finding themselves in a wealthy OECD country. Throughout,
source country effects are netted out.


where Outcomest is one of the four outcomes reported above ­ log average distance
traveled by a refugee, share of refugees going to a contiguous country, the Herfindahl
index of destinations, or share in a high-income OECD country ­ from country s in
time period t, and t and s are time and source country effects.
    Source country effects imply that we are exploiting time variation within a source
country over time in how far refugees travel. The coefficients of interest are the time
effects t . The regression is weighted by total refugee stock, to obtain estimates of how
outcome variables changed at a refugee, rather than country level. Standard errors are
clustered at the source country level.
    Panel (a) of Figure 4 plots the time effects for the average distance traveled along
with 95 percent confidence intervals. Since the distance traveled is in logs, the coeffi-



                                                                                                   13
cients are interpretable as the percentage increase in the average distance traveled by a
refugee in period t relative to the omitted period, which in our case is the first 5 years of
data. The upward trend is evident, and the differences with respect to the initial period
are statistically significant. In the final 5-year period, the average distance traveled is
about 40 percent larger than in the first period. This proportional difference is quite
similar in magnitude to the unconditional increase reported in Figure 3. Panel (b) re-
ports the time effects on the share of refugees found in a contiguous country. Since the
left-hand side is a share, the time effect point estimates correspond to the difference in
that share relative to the initial period. The share of refugees in a contiguous country
falls by 16 percentage points after controlling for source effects. Once again, this differ-
ence is not far from the unconditional difference. Panels (c) and (d) plot the time effects
on the Herfindahl and the share going to high-income OECD countries, respectively.
The trends evident in unconditional data are equally strong when controlling for source
country effects and total refugee outflow. For all four outcome variables, the differences
between the initial and later periods are highly statistically significant.


Impact vs. diffusion over time We next address the question of whether the trends
documented in Figures 3-4 are due to the initial decision of refugees of where to flee
from their homeland, or subsequent movements to third countries. Note that we cannot
answer this question definitively without individual-level panel data. In our data, we
do not observe the country from which a refugee entered their current host country,
and thus cannot tell whether a given refugee in a given host country came from their
homeland, or from yet another host country.
   Nonetheless, we perform the following exercise. We are working with a set of refugee
events defined in Section 2. An event is combination of a source country, a year of onset,
and an end year. Thus, we can compute the evolution of all of our outcome variables
­ distance, contiguous share, Herfindahl, and share in high-income OECD ­ for each
specific event and each year following its onset. We then plot these outcome variables
in event time, with year 0 indicating the initial year of the event, up to year 10 of the
event.
   Figure 5 plots the four outcome variables in event time, for events starting in 4
different sub-periods. The main conclusion from this figure is that the differences across

time in refugee reach are already apparent at the initiation of a refugee crisis. That
is, distance traveled by a refugee rises monotonically from earlier to later refugee crises
already in years 1 to 3 of a refugee crisis. While the pictures are somewhat noisy, it is
not the case that the globalization of refugees trends documented above are due purely,
or even primarily, to stronger diffusion of refugees over time.


Robustness

Finally, we assess robustness of the results in a number of dimensions. First, since the
beginning of our data, a number of country boundaries have changed. Prominent exam-
ples are the unification of Germany, the breakup of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia,
and the independence of South Sudan. To check whether the results are driven by
changing country boundaries, Appendix Figure A1 reports the time effects conditional
on source effects in a sample of entities where country definitions and boundaries are

                                                                                                           15
fixed throughout the sample period. There is virtually no difference in the results.
   Second, we control for the total (log) stock of refugees from country s in time period
t when estimating equation (1). Controlling for the overall stock of refugees allows for
non-linear effects of total outflows on spatial diffusion. For example, refugees might
end up more geographically dispersed during relatively larger refugee events if greater
refugee numbers create stronger political opposition in receiving countries, limiting
the number of individuals in any single country. On the other hand, large flows of
refugees might differ from smaller ones in their composition: if the marginal refugee
is less mobile, then larger total stocks will coincide with less geographical dispersion.
Appendix Table A1 shows the results of estimating (1) controlling for total stocks
from s. The coefficients on refugee stocks are consistently negative and significant for
three of the four outcomes of interest. However, the magnitude of these coefficients is
small, suggesting that the scale of a forced displacement crisis has little bearing on the
subsequent geographic dispersion of refugees. Appendix Figure A2 reports the time
effects controlling for total stock. There is virtually no detectable difference relative to
the baseline.
   The third set of robustness checks probes our definition of refugee stocks. Appendix
Figure A3 replicates the analysis using all refugee stocks available in the data, without
constraining the sample to refugee events. The results are very similar to the baseline.
Taking another approach, Appendix Figure A4 instead uses refugee flows. As argued
above, without individual-level data, flows cannot be computed precisely. We build
flows by taking annual time differences in stocks by source-destination pair. In some
instances, stocks fall over time. Since we do not have confidence that a reduction in
stocks represents a return to the home country ­ as opposed to transition to another
host country ­ we set flows to zero whenever the difference in stocks is negative. As
evidenced in the figure, the point estimates of the time effects and their statistical
significance are quite similar for flows to the baseline.
   Fourth, it may be that the destination-specific conditions (such as the global finan-
cial crisis) also affect the distance traveled by refugees, or the probability of not going to
a contiguous country. To account for this possibility, we net out the time variation in the
destination country conditions as follows. In step 1, we project the refugee stocks at the


                                             16
source-destination-year level on source-time, destination-time, and source-destination
fixed effects in a gravity-like specification:


                           Ref ugeessdt = st + dt + sd + sdt .


We estimate this equation by Poisson Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood (Eaton, Kortum
and Sotelo 2012), pooling countries and years (and thus including observations with zero
bilateral stocks). We then construct a destination-adjusted refugee stock by subtracting
the destination-time effect from the actual stock:


                       AdjustedRef ugeessdt = Ref ugeessdt - dt .


Then, we compute the average distance traveled, share of refugees going to a contiguous
country, the Herfindahl index of destinations, and share in wealthy OECD countries
using this adjusted refugee data set instead of the actual data. Appendix Figure A5 re-
ports the results. Netting out destination-time effects prior to carrying out the analysis
leaves the main results virtually unchanged.



4     Conclusion
Our analysis suggests that the assumption underpinning the debate on responsibility-
sharing may need to be partly revisited. Countries neighboring a conflict do host a
majority of refugees and are hence bearing a disproportionate portion of the respon-
sibility for providing asylum to those who are fleeing from violence and oppression.
Yet, the share of refugees who move to further-away destinations, including OECD
countries, has been growing over time. In other words, responsibilities are increasingly
shared across countries.
    As it explores the notion of responsibility-sharing, the challenge for the international
community is hence to determine how such trends can be sustained, at a pace which
is optimal from a protection perspective, but also taking into account economic and
political considerations across all potential refugee-hosting countries.
    In parallel, it is important to recognize that the current distribution remains deeply


                                                 17
uneven. This is especially problematic as most refugee-producing crises are protracted,
implying that the composition of the "main host countries" remains somewhat stable
over large periods of time. Sharing the responsibility for hosting refugees also implies,
therefore, that increased support is warranted to maintain the current system and the
international protection that it provides for those who are subject to persecution and
violence.

Figure A3: Trends in refugee reach, time effects controlling for source effects, all stocks,
1987-2017

Note: This figure plots the time effects on the average distance traveled by a refugee, the share of
refugees finding themselves in a contiguous country, the average Herfindahl index of refugee shares by
source country, and the share of refugees finding themselves in a wealthy OECD country. Throughout,
source country effects are netted out. The outcome variable is total stocks of refugees.

Figure A4: Trends in refugee reach, time effects controlling for source effects, flows,
1987-2017

Note: This figure plots the time effects on the average distance traveled by a refugee, the share of
refugees finding themselves in a contiguous country, the average Herfindahl index of refugee shares by
source country, and the share of refugees finding themselves in a wealthy OECD country. Throughout,
source country effects are netted out. The outcome variable is total stocks of refugees.
