Why Are Prices Sticky? The Dynamics of Wholesale Gasoline Prices

                                           ABSTRACT

The menu-cost interpretation of sticky prices implies that the probability of a price change should
depend on the past history of prices and fundamentals only through the gap between the current
price and the frictionless price. We find that this prediction is broadly consistent with the behavior
of 9 Philadelphia gasoline wholesalers. We nevertheless reject the menu-cost model as a literal

description of these firms’ behavior, arguing instead that price stickiness arises from strategic

considerations of how customers and competitors will react to price changes.

1. Introduction.


       The failure of prices to adjust immediately to changes in fundamentals is

central to many of the key issues in economics. Why don’t prices change every day?

This paper investigates 9 individual gasoline wholesalers, and tries to predict on

which days a given firm will change its price. We use the regularities uncovered to

draw conclusions about the forces that may prevent prices from changing.

       Our starting point is Dixit’s (1991) model of price determination with a fixed

cost of changing prices. According to this framework, the past history of the firm’s

prices and fundamentals should help predict a price change only through the current

gap between price and fundamentals. The model further implies a particular

functional form, and allows interpretation of the coefficients in terms of parameters

of the optimization problem facing the firm. We compare these predictions with

those from more flexible, atheoretical forecasting models.

       We find that in many respects the Dixit framework serves quite well. The

gap between price and fundamentals indeed appears to be the most important factor

influencing the probability of a price change, and the Dixit functional form seems

reasonably appropriate as well. We do find statistically significant departures from

the predictions of the model for almost all the firms we study, though there is

surprising heterogeneity across firms in the form that this departure takes. The most

common finding contrary to the model’s predictions is an asymmetric response to

positive and negative price gaps. If the gap between the target and actual price is

small in absolute value, a typical firm is more likely to raise its price when the
                                                                                    3



current price is a little below its target than it is to lower the price when it is an

equivalent amount above the target. On the other hand, if the gap between target and

actual price has become large in absolute value, firms are quicker to change the price

when their price is too high compared to when it is too low.

        Another implication of the Dixit model that appears to be inconsistent with

our data is the structural interpretation of the estimated coefficients. In order to fit

the observed infrequency of price changes, one would need to assume that both the

firm’s uncertainty about future fundamentals, and the amount by which it changes

the price when it does change, are quite large. Both parameters can be inferred

directly using data other than the frequency of price adjustment, and these inferred

values are an order of magnitude smaller than the structural estimates.

        We conclude that although a cost of changing prices is likely an important

factor in accounting for sticky prices, a typical firm’s calculation is not accurately

described as a tradeoff between an administrative cost of changing price and loss of

current profits, as presumed in the Dixit framework. Instead, the cost of changing

prices seems more likely to be due to how the firm expects its customers and

competitors to react to any price changes.

        The plan of the paper is as follows. Section 2 reviews previous literature.

Section 3 develops the models we will use to try to predict whether the price changes

on any given day. The data used in this study are described in Section 4. Section 5

reports empirical results for the menu-cost model. Section 6 reports results for the

alternative statistical models. Section 7 concludes.

2. Previous literature.

       The phrase “sticky prices” has been interpreted to mean different things by

different researchers. One branch of the literature has used the expression to refer to

a gradual distributed lag relating prices to changes in fundamentals, such as the

lagged response of retail to wholesale prices or wholesale to bulk prices for

individual commodities (Borenstein, Cameron and Gilbert 1997; Borenstein and

Shepard, 2002; Levy, Dutta, and Bergen, 2002), or the gradual response of aggregate

wages and prices to macroeconomic developments (Sims, 1998). Theoretical

explanations of such sluggishness include the suggestion that customers are less

alienated by a string of small price changes than a single large change (Rotemberg,

1982), physical barriers to rapid adjustment of production or inventories (Borenstein

and Shepard, 2002), and gradual processing of information (Sims, 1998).

       By contrast, the focus of the present paper is on the discreteness of the price

adjustment process-- fundamentals change continuously whereas prices change only

occasionally. There are three main explanations for this form of price stickiness.

One interpretation is based on the administrative expenses associated with changing

a posted price, such as the cost of printing new catalogs. The quintessential example

is the cost a restaurant must pay in order to print a new menu, and for this reason this

class of models is often described as “menu-cost models.” In these models, in

response to a change in fundamentals, the firm either makes no change in the price or

else adjusts completely to the new optimum. Theoretical treatments of such pricing
                                                                                5



behavior were provided by Barro (1972), Sheshinski and Weiss (1977, 1983),

Benabou (1988), Dixit (1991), Tsiddon (1993), Chalkley (1997), Aguirregabriria

(1999), Danzinger (1999), Hansen (1999), and Bennett and LaManna (2001), among

others.1

       Although such costs are presumably quite small, they could nevertheless

exert a significant economic influence (Mankiw, 1985; Blanchard and Kiyotaki,

1987). Levy, et. al. (1997) sought to measure directly the costs of changing prices

for five supermarket chains, and found these to be 0.70 percent of revenues. They

found that the supermarket chain with higher menu costs changed prices much less

frequently than the others. Dutta, et. al. (1999) similarly estimated the costs to be

0.59 percent for drugstore chains. However, more detailed microeconomic evidence

is difficult to reconcile with the menu-cost explanation. Direct surveys suggest that

managers do not take these costs into account in pricing decisions (Blinder, et. al.,

1998, and Hall, Walsh, and Yates, 2000). Carlton (1986) studied industrial prices

and Kashyap (1995) investigated catalog prices. Both noted that when firms change

prices, they often do so in very small increments, behavior inconsistent with the

simple menu-cost interpretation. Other studies that reach a similar conclusion

include Cecchetti’s (1986) analysis of magazine prices, Benabou’s (1992)

investigation of retail markups, Lach and Tsiddon’s (1993) and Eden’s (2001) study

of Israeli supermarket prices, and Carlson’s (1992) survey of price changes.

Supermarket scanner data further reveal a tendency of the price to return to its earlier
                                                                               6



value after a sale (Levy, Dutta, and Bergen, 2002; Rotemberg, 2002), a form of

stickiness that could not be explained in terms of the cost of posting a new price.

       A second explanation for the discreteness of price adjustment posits the

discrete arrival of market information. Calvo (1983) proposed that firms are subject

to random shocks that “prevent them to observe and verify changes in the ‘state of

nature’ that would otherwise lead to price changes” (p. 384). Eden (1990, 2001)

suggested that price stickiness arises from the fact that firms must precommit to

capacity constraints before knowing the realization of the money supply. Mankiw

and Reis (2002) proposed that each period, only a fraction of wage setters receive

new information about the economy and are able to adjust their plans accordingly. If

acquisition of information requires a fixed expenditure of resources, such

information-based stories could be fit into the menu-cost framework in which the

cost associated with changing the price is not a physical cost of posting a new price

but rather a personnel or management cost in determining a new value for the price.

Calvo-type models have recently become popular explanations for observed

aggregate price dynamics; see for example Galí and Gertler (1999) and Sbordone

(2002), or, for a dissenting viewpoint, Bils and Klenow (2002).

       A third explanation for price stickiness is the feared response by customers or

competitors if the firm changed its price. Stiglitz (1984) discussed asymmetric

customer responses with costly search, limit pricing and entry deterrence, and

coordinating collusive behavior as possible explanations, whereas Rotemberg (2002)

suggested that consumers punish sellers whose prices they deem to be “unfair.”
                                                                                             7



        The goal of this paper is to fit an explicit optimizing menu-cost model of

price dynamics developed by Dixit (1991) and Hansen (1998) to observed data.

This generalizes the Sheshinski and Weiss menu-cost model employed in Dahlby’s

(1992) analysis of Canadian automobile insurance premiums in a very critical

direction, allowing the frictionless optimal price to be stochastic rather than

deterministic. We investigate whether this model can account for the dynamic

adjustment of individual wholesale gasoline prices to changes in bulk spot prices.

By further comparing this structural model with atheoretical summaries of pricing

dynamics, we hope to shed light on which of the three explanations (menu costs,

information processing, or market responses) best fits the observed facts.



3. Models of pricing dynamics.

        a. The Dixit menu-cost model.

        Let p(t) denote the log of the price charged by the firm and p * (t ) the log of

the target price, where time is regarded as continuous. The firm chooses dates t1,

t2,… at which to change price so as to minimize

                       ∞                                                                
                  E t0 ∑  ∫ e − ρ t k[ p (t i −1 ) − p * (t )]2 dt  + ge − ρ ti  

with p (t 0 ) = p * (t 0 ) given and

                  dp * (t ) = σdW (t )

for W(t) standard Brownian motion. Here g is a lump-sum cost of changing the price

of the good, the scalar k controls the cost of deviating from the target price, and σ is
                                                                                                   8



the standard deviation of the change in the target price. Dixit (1991) and Hansen

(1999) showed that the solution is to change the price to p (t i ) = p * (t i ) at any date ti

for which | p (t i −1 ) − p * (t i ) |= b , with the optimal maximal deviation b given by

                                  1/ 4

                           k    

        Suppose that the firm is following this policy, and is charging a price p(t) at

date t. One can approximate the probability that the price changes between dates t

and t + 1 by the probability that | p (t ) − p * (t + 1) |> b . Note that for the upper bound,

        Pr[ p (t ) − p * (t + 1) > b] = Pr{[ p (t ) − p * (t ) − b] > [ p * (t + 1) − p * (t )]}

              p (t ) − p * (t ) − b    

                      σ             

for Z ~ N(0,1) and Φ(.) the cumulative distribution function for a standard Normal

variable. Reasoning analogously for the lower bound, the probability of a change in

the price between t and t + 1 can be approximated by

                                p (t ) − p * (t ) − b          p (t ) − p * (t ) + b 

                                                                                     

For observed discrete-time data, let xt = 1 if the price changes on day t and zero

otherwise. The log of the likelihood of observing the sample {x1, x2,… xT} is then

given by2
                                                                                           9




        ∑ {x                                                                    }
        T −1
(3.4)          t +1   log h( p t , p t* ) + (1 − xt +1 ) log[1 − h( p t , pt* )] .
        t =0


        b. Atheoretical logit specification.

        The second model we investigate is an atheoretical specification in which the

probability of a price change at t + 1 depends on a vector of variables zt observed at

time t, which includes pt , pt* , and their lagged values. We assume that zt helps to

forecast the probability of a price change based on a logistic functional form,

(3.5)   ht +1 = exp(z t ' γ ) /[1 + exp(z t ' γ )]

where ! is a vector of parameters, to be estimated by maximizing the likelihood

        T −1
(3.6)   ∑ {x
        t =0
               t +1   log ht +1 + (1 − xt +1 ) log(1 − ht +1 )}.


        c. The Autoregressive Conditional Hazard model.

        Our third approach attempts to model the serial correlation properties of the

observed sequence {xt} using an approach proposed by Hamilton and Jorda (2002).

Their starting point was the Autoregressive Conditional Duration model developed

by Engle and Russell (1998). Let un denote the number of days between the nth and

the (n + 1)th time that a firm is observed to change its price, and let !n denote the

expectation of un given past observations un-1, un-2, ..., u1. The ACD(1,1) model

posits that this forecast duration is obtained by a weighted average of past durations,


(3.7)   ψ n = αu n −1 + βαu n −2 + β 2αu n −3 + β 3αu n −4 + L + β n− 2αu1 + β n −1α u ,

for u the average length of time observed between price changes. In the exponential

ACD specification, if the expected length of time until the next price change is !n = 3
                                                                                     10



days, the probability of a price change tomorrow is 1/3. More generally, if n(t)

denotes the number of times the firm has been observed to change its price as of day

t, the probability of a change on day t + 1 would be

(3.8)   ht +1 = 1 / ψ n (t ) .

The forecast probability of a change is thus the reciprocal of a weighted average of

recent durations between changes. Hamilton and Jorda proposed a generalization of

the exponential ACD specification in which expected duration depends linearly on

other variables observed at t in addition to lagged durations, replacing (3.8) with

(3.9)   ht +1 = 1 /[ψ n ( t ) + γ ' z t ].

Again the log likelihood is obtained by using this expression for ht+1 in (3.6), which

is maximized with respect to ", #, and !.

        A probability must fall between zero and unity. To ensure this condition, we

replace the denominator of (3.9) with the larger of [ψ n (t ) + γ ' z t ] and 1.0001, and

employ a differentiable smooth pasting function for the transition for values between

1.0001 and 1.1, as detailed in Hamilton and Jorda (2002).



4. Data.

        Refined gasoline is transported by pipeline from New York to Philadelphia,

where it is stored and resold in smaller wholesale lots either directly to individual

retail gasoline stations or to independent “jobbers” who in turn may resell it to the

retailers. We purchased daily prices for all of the wholesalers of Philadelphia

gasoline for 1989 to 1991 from Oil Pricing Information Services
                                                                                     11



(http://www.opisnet.com/). Although we have Saturday observations for part of the

sample, for consistency we use only Monday through Friday data throughout the

analysis, treating the Friday to Monday change the same as that between any two

consecutive days. Apart from weekends, for five of the firms we have no missing

observations over the three-year period. Firm 4 and Firm 6 are missing observations

at the end of the sample, and Firm 9 is missing observations at both the beginning

and the end of the sample. Firm 7 is missing 3 observations in the middle, which we

treated by artificially setting ht+1 = 1 for the day following this gap, in effect

dummying out its influence. Several other Philadelphia wholesalers had more

extensive missing observations and were not used in the analysis.

        We base our target price series pt* on the cash price of unleaded gasoline

delivered to the New York Harbor, as quoted by the New York Mercantile Ex-

change. These data were obtained from Datastream (http://www.datastream.com/).

We assume that each wholesaler’s target price pt* is a constant mark-up over the

NYMEX price, where we estimate this desired mark-up for each firm from the

average value of pt − pt* over the sample. The wholesalers set their price to go into

effect at midnight. Hence pt+1 should respond to pt* but not to pt*+1 .

        The data for the 9 firms used are summarized in Table 1. The average mark-

ups range from 2 to 4 cents per gallon. The NYMEX price of gasoline changes

almost every day, whereas these wholesalers typically change their price every two

or three days. This is the essential friction that we seek to explain.
                                                                                   12



        The Dixit model assumes that pt* follows a random walk, which appears to

be an excellent description of these data. For example, OLS estimation of an AR(2)

model for first differences of pt* for firm 1 results in(standard errors in parentheses)

        ∆p1*t = 0.016 + 0.057 ∆p1*,t −1 − 0.018 ∆p1*,t − 2 + e1t .
               (0.103) (0.036)           (0.036)

All three coefficients are individually statistically insignificant, and a test of the joint

null hypothesis that all three are zero is accepted with a p-value of 0.44. We also

regressed ∆pt* on 12 monthly dummies, accepting the null hypothesis of no

seasonality with a p-value of 0.43. All of these results are fully consistent with the

Dixit assumption that pt* follows a random walk.



5. Results for the menu-cost model.

        Our first step was to use the menu-cost model to predict the days on which

each firm would change its price. Let PNY ,t denote the bulk price (in cents/gallon) in

New York, Pit the price charged by wholesaler i in Philadelphia, $it = log(Pit/PNY,t) the

percentage gap, and δ i = T −1Σ Tt=1δ it the average percentage mark-up for firm i. We

replaced pt − pt* in expression (3.3) with δ it − δ i and then chose b and % so as to

maximize (3.4) for each firm. These maximum likelihood estimates of b and % and

reported in the first two columns of Table 2.

        As a first check on the reasonableness of these estimates, we calculate the

implied value of g, the cost imputed to the firm each time it changes the price,
                                                                                         13



relative to k, the parameter governing the curvature of its profit function. Note from

rearrangement of (3.1) that

                 b4
        g/k =        ,
                6σ 2

estimated values of which are reported in the third column of Table 2. To interpret

these values, consider a monopolistic firm facing demand curve Qt = At Pt −γ , γ > 1

and total cost CtQt, for Qt the level of output, Pt the level of prices, and Ct the

constant marginal cost. Profits are given by

                Π t = At Pt1−γ − Ct At Pt −γ .

In the absence of menu costs, profit maximization calls for setting

                          γ
                Pt * =           Ct .
                         γ −1

Let pt = log Pt and pt* = log Pt* . Write profits as

                Π t ( pt ) = At exp[(1 − γ ) pt ] − Ct At exp(−γpt ).

                                                                                            ∂pt2         p t = p t*



                             = Π t ( pt* ) − kt ( pt − pt* ) 2

for kt = (γ/2)QtCt. Maximizing profit is thus approximately equivalent to minimizing

kt ( pt − pt* ) 2 . Hence the estimate of g/k can be interpreted as the ratio of the cost of

changing prices (g) relative to one-half of total costs times the elasticity of demand

((γ/2)QtCt). For example, with a demand elasticity of & = 2, the estimate g/k can be

interpreted as menu costs as a fraction of total costs. The fact that the values of g/k

found in Table 2 are typically well below 1% is thus a very encouraging indicator of

the plausibility of these estimates.

       Two alternative checks of the menu-cost model are more troubling. The

estimate of % in the second column of Table 2 is based solely on the frequency with

which firm i changes prices, that is, solely on the probability that xt+1 = 1 given

pt − pt* . (We will suppress the i subscript for clarity in this discussion). In the

structural model from which (3.3) was derived, the parameter % corresponds to the

standard deviation of daily changes in pt* . Under our assumptions, this magnitude

can also be inferred directly from the standard deviation of log (PNY,t/PNY,t-1), which

is reported in the fourth column of Table 2. This direct estimate is typically smaller

than the MLE estimate in column 2 by a factor of 5. In other words, firms are acting

as if they have much more uncertainty about where the future fundamentals are

headed than is warranted given the observed behavior of the New York price.
                                                                                   15



                                                   ^
       If our proxy for the firm’s target price pt* differs from the true target price

                             ^
pt* by measurement error ( p t* = p t* + u t ) , this might account for an overly large

estimated value for %(MLE). However, one would expect measurement error to also

result in an overly large value for %(direct), which is based on the observed standard

              ^
deviation of pt* . The puzzle is not simply the large value for %(MLE), but further

the difference between %(MLE) and %(direct).

       A separate issue on the plausibility of the parameter estimates is the

estimated value of b. According to the model, in continuous time whenever the firm

changed the price, it should do so by exactly b. For a typical firm, this corresponds

to a 10-15% change in prices. We report in column 5 of Table 2 a direct estimate of

b based on the median absolute value of the logarithmic change in price for those

days when the firm did change its price. This is an order of magnitude smaller than

the MLE in the first column for almost all firms.

       To summarize, the parameter estimates imply a ratio of b2 to % that is

reasonable given a menu-cost interpretation of pricing, but the level of b is much

larger than can be reconciled with the observed magnitude of price changes, and the

level of % is much larger than can be reconciled with the difficulty in forecasting the

the price of bulk gasoline in New York Harbor. The basic mechanism that accounts

for sticky prices in the Dixit model is that the firm tolerates a spread between pt and

pt* in the anticipation that future changes in pt* may make a change in pt

unnecessary. That such a trade-off accounts for the firm’s decision not to change its
                                                                                     16



price is difficult to reconcile with the rational level of uncertainty about pt* and the

magnitude of the price change that the firm will ultimately end up making.

        Our results thus reinforce Borenstein and Shepard’s (2002) conclusion that

menu costs can not account for the sluggish behavior of wholesale gasoline prices.

They base their conclusion on distributed lag regressions involving spot and futures

prices. We study here a different kind of sluggishness, the fact that particular spot

prices remain frozen for several days, but reach the same overall conclusion.



6. Comparison with other models.

        In this section we explore a variety of alternatives to the Dixit menu-cost

model. Let capital letters denote levels rather than logs, so that ∆ it = Pit − PNY ,t is

the difference in price between Philadelphia and New York in cents per gallon,

∆ i = T −1Σ Tt=1 ∆ it is the average mark-up reported in column 2 of Table 1, and

| Pit − Pit* |=| ∆ it − ∆ i | is the absolute value of the deviation of the firm’s current

price from the target.

        A logit framework affords a flexible class of models for characterizing the

dynamics of price changes. We first consider a model in which the probability of a

price change depends on the same variables as in the menu-cost model,

(6.1)   z it = (1, | Pit − Pit* |)' ,

but with a logistic functional form for the probability (expressions (3.5) and (3.6))

rather than the menu-cost functional form ((3.3) and (3.4)). The value of the log
                                                                                         17



likelihood achieved with the logistic functional form is compared with that for the

menu-cost specification in columns 1 and 2 of Table 3. The menu-cost specification

does better for 3 of the firms and the logit specification does better for the other 6,

though the values of the log likelihood are quite close in most cases. Since the

logistic functional form does as good or better job of describing the data, it offers a

convenient framework for investigating the role of additional explanatory variables

besides | Pit − Pit* | as factors that may influence the decision to change prices.

        We first investigate the Calvo possibility that information processing delays

rather than a physical cost of posting new prices could account for the stickiness of

prices by testing for delays in the response of firms to available information.

According to the menu-cost model, only the current day’s gap | Pit − Pit* | should

predict a price change on day t + 1. If there are delays in a firm’s ability to process

information, the previous day’s gap | Pi ,t −1 − Pi *,t −1 | may contain additional predictive

power. Column 1 of Table 4 reports the p-value for a likelihood test of the null

hypothesis that the coefficient on | Pi ,t −1 − Pi *,t −1 | is zero, when this is added as a third

explanatory variable to (6.1). This test finds evidence of information delays for only

2 of the 9 firms.

        Next, we look for evidence of the Rotemberg (1982) suggestion that the firm

deliberately stretches out price changes so as to keep from upsetting customers, as in

the quadratic adjustment cost model. Let w1i(t) denote the date of firm i’s most

recent price change as of date t. Thus, if the firm changed the price on day t, then

w1i(t) = t. If the firm changed the price on day t - 2 and left it at that level on days t -
                                                                                            18



1 and t, then w1i(t) = t - 2. If the firm only partially adjusted the price on date w1i(t),

intending to make additional changes shortly, then the size of the gap remaining after

the previous correction | Pi , w1i ( t ) − Pi*, w1i (t ) | should help to predict a price change over

and above the value of the current gap | Pi ,t − Pi*,t | . Column 2 of Table 4 finds no

evidence of gradual price adjustment for any of the firms. Taking the results of

columns 1 and 2 together, we conclude that for most firms, the hypothesis that the

probability of a price change depends on the past only through the value of

| Pi ,t − Pi*,t | appears to be consistent with observed pricing behavior, so that this

qualitative prediction of the menu-cost story is consistent with the data.

         A more telling way to distinguish the menu-cost and information hypotheses

from a response to market concerns is to look for evidence of possible asymmetry. It

is commonly believed that firms are willing to increase their prices in response to a

rise in costs, but either are slow to react or do not adjust fully to a drop in costs.

Borenstein, Cameron, and Gilbert (1997), Peltzman (2000), and Ball and Mankiw

(1994) suggested some reasons why we might find asymmetries in prices. For the

gasoline market in particular, Borenstein, Cameron, and Gilbert (1997) used an

error-correction model to estimate cumulative adjustment functions using monthly

data. They found asymmetry in the price responses of spot gasoline to crude oil and

retail gasoline to wholesale, though not in the link we investigate, wholesale gasoline

to spot. Balke, Brown and Yucel (1998) reported more mixed evidence of

asymmetry with weekly data depending on how one estimates the cumulative

adjustment functions. Karrenbrock (1991) concluded that retail gasoline firms raise
                                                                                                          19



prices within a month of cost increases but take up to two months to lower them.

Godby, et. al. (2000) found little evidence of asymmetry in the response of weekly

Canadian retail gasoline prices to crude oil prices.

        We revisit this asymmetry question using our daily data, exploring the effect

of the sign of the price gap on the probability of a price change on any given day. Let

'it be a dummy variable taking on the value of unity if Pi ,t − Pi*,t ≥ 0 and zero

otherwise. A logit model with asymmetric effects could be estimated by letting

(6.2)    z it = [θ it ,θ it ( Pi ,t −1 − Pi *,t −1 ), (1 − θ it ),−(1 − θ it )( Pi ,t −1 − Pi*,t −1 )]'

and comparing (6.2) with (6.1) (which it nests) by a likelihood ratio test. This test is

reported in the final column of Table 4. Here the evidence of a deviation from the

menu-cost model is more widespread. For 4 of the 9 firms, we would reject at the

5% level the null hypothesis of symmetry with respect to price increases and

decreases, and nearly reject for one other.

        Table 5 reports parameter estimates for the asymmetric logit model based on

(6.2). For all but two of the firms, the coefficient on (1 - 'it) is larger than the

coefficient on 'it, which means that the firm is more likely to raise the price when

Pit − Pit* = −ε than it is to lower the price when Pit − Pit* = ε for ( a small positive

number. A second source of asymmetry is that, for every firm, the coefficient on

θ it ( Pit − Pit* ) is bigger than the coefficient on − (1 − θ it )( Pit − Pit* ) . This means that

the firm is less likely to raise the price when Pit − Pit* = −ε than it is to lower the

price when Pit − Pit* = ε for ( a large positive number. Figure 1 gives a visual
                                                                                20



representation of this asymmetry, plotting the value of (3.5) for zit given by (6.2) as a

function of Pit − Pit* for each of the 9 firms. The graphs indicate the probability that

the firm would change its price on day t + 1 as the gap between Pt and Pt* varies

from -20 to +20 cents per gallon.

       Such a pattern of asymmetry seems much more likely to be due to concerns

about the responses of customers or competitors to price changes than to

administrative costs of changing prices. For example, being the first firm to make a

big price increase may be costly in terms of customer trust and loyalty, leading firms

to postpone such a move even if it means selling at a loss for a short while. By

contrast, being the first with a small price increase may be much less important for

customer loyalty.

       The conclusion that concerns about the response of customers or competitors

to price changes is the central explanation for price stickiness is also consistent with

Borenstein and Shepard’s (2002) observation that wholesale gasoline prices adjust

most gradually to changes in costs in the less competitive markets, and is also

consistent with the explanations for price stickiness that emerge from the direct

surveys of Blinder, et. al. (1998) and Hall, Walsh and Yates (2000). 3

       Finally, we look for evidence of general serial dependence in the timing of

price changes using the ACH model.4 We first fit an ACH model that ignores all

information other than the recent frequency of price changes, choosing " and # so as

to maximize the likelihood given by (3.6)-(3.8). This was successful for firms 1, 5,

and 6. For the remaining firms, we had difficulty obtaining convergence of the ACH
                                                                                   21



specification without a constant term (zt = 0). To keep within a two-parameter

family, for these firms we estimated an ACH(1,0) model (# = 0) and included a

constant term (zt = 1). For firm 3, the estimated " parameter was negative, indicating

negative serial correlation; if this firm changed its price quickly on the previous

interval, it is more likely to be a little slower next time. Column 3 of Table 3 reports

the value for the log likelihood achieved by a two-parameter ACH model for each of

the firms. The pure time-series model offers an improvement over the menu-cost

specification for only one firm, and does substantially worse for most. We interpret

this as further support for the claim that the history of prices matters for the

probability of a price change only through the current value of the price gap.

       We next explored a nested model in which both the price gap and time-series

terms enter, by estimating an ACH model of the form of (3.9) with zt given by (6.1),

and investigated whether the price gap captures all the dynamics by testing the

hypothesis " = # = 0. The p-value for this hypothesis test is reported in the first

column of Table 6. We find a statistically significant contribution at the 5% level of

lagged durations in two of the firms, and a nearly statistically significant contribution

in two others.

       To see whether our conclusions from Table 4 were proxying for some general

features of omitted serial correlation, we repeat those hypothesis tests in a base

model that includes nonzero " and # as well as the vector of variables zt as in (6.1).

The conclusions in Table 6 are very similar to those in Table 4. We continue to find

some evidence of information delays for firms 1 and 3 but no evidence of partial
                                                                                   22



adjustment for any of the firms. The evidence of asymmetry (column 4 of Table 6) is

also very similar across firms as was found in Table 4, and the pattern of asymmetry

(Table 7) is very similar to what we found for the logit specification in Table 5.

Note that while γ' z t appears in the numerator of (3.5), it is in the denominator of

(3.9), causing coefficients to switch signs. Figure 2 plots the probabilities of a price

change as a function of the price gap implied by the ACH estimates in Table 7. In

the ACH model, the probability of a price change is also influenced by the past

history of price changes. To construct Figure 2, we set !it equal to its average value

for firm i. The overall patterns in Figure 2 are quite similar to those we found from

the asymmetric logit specification in Figure 1.

        As a final way to compare the various models explored, we look at the

Bayesian criterion suggested by Schwarz (1978). This measure penalizes the log

likelihood by subtracting (r/2) times the log of the number of observations, where r

is the number of parameters used by the model. The SBC is reported in the final

columns of Tables 2, 5, and 7. This criterion penalizes additional parameters more

heavily than the hypothesis tests relied on earlier, so that, despite the statistical

significance of the various departures from the menu-cost framework documented

above, the SBC would end up selecting one of the two-parameter models of Table 3

over any of the specifications in Tables 5 or 7. The menu-cost model was always

close to having the best performance of any of the two-parameter models.

Particularly impressive is the fact that for two of the firms (firm 1 and firm 9), the
                                                                                23



menu-cost model performed the best by Schwarz’s criterion of any of the models

considered.



7. Conclusions.

       The menu-cost interpretation of price stickiness implies that the past history

of the firm’s prices and fundamentals should help predict a price change only

through the current gap between price and fundamentals. This appears to be a

reasonable parsimonious summary of the pricing behavior observed for most of the 9

gasoline wholesalers we studied. Although we can find other variables that also help

predict price changes, the price gap appears to be the most important magnitude. In

this respect, we might liken the hypothesis to Samuelson’s (1965) and Fama’s (1970)

suggestion that stock prices follow a random walk; although not literally true, it

seems to be a good approximation.

       We found surprising heterogeneity across firms in the way that their pricing

behavior seems to deviate from the menu-cost model. Some firms seem to

experience a delay in processing information. For most firms, we found some

evidence of asymmetry. For big changes, firms are more reluctant to increase prices

than to lower them. For small changes, by contrast, firms are more reluctant to lower

prices than to raise them.

       Even ignoring these possible departures from menu-cost behavior, it is

difficult to accept the menu-cost model as a literal description of firms’ pricing

behavior. Although the size of the estimated menu costs are of a reasonable
                                                                                              24



magnitude, the model imputes to firms much more uncertainty about fundamentals

than is warranted by the data, and would call for much larger price changes than

firms actually make.

         Our overall conclusion is that firms’ decision to change prices is based on the

trade-off between the benefits of having an optimal price and some sort of cost

associated with changing the price itself. However, the evidence suggests that this

cost is not an administrative cost that is associated with a price change per se, nor a

failure to obtain adequate information. Instead it seems to reflect strategic

considerations of how customers and competitors will react to a particular change.

  Other models allowing both a fixed cost of changing prices (implying discreteness) and a convex
penalty (implying gradual responses) include Konieczny (1993) and Slade (1998, 1999).
2
  Equation (3.4) is more general than the model actually estimated, which depends on pt and pt*

only through the difference ( p t − pt* ). This is important because whereas pt and pt* are each

I(1), the difference ( p t − pt* ) is I(0). The reader will note that in all the estimations below, the
arguments of h(.) are always such I(0) transformations, thus avoiding some of the econometric issues
raised by Park and Phillips (2000).
