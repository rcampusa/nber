INTRODUCTION
         Marijuana use among youths continues to rise despite community, state, and national
efforts to educate and inform individuals of the harmful effects of drug use and abuse. For
example, between 1990 and 1997 marijuana use among 12- to 17-year-olds more than doubled,
increasing from 4.4% to 9.7% (U.S. DHHS, 1998). The dramatic increase in marijuana use poses
new challenges to decision-makers developing policies to curb drug use among youths. Further
complicating efforts to create effective drug control policies are cross-sectional studies that show
an interdependence between alcohol and marijuana use (DiNardo and Lemieux, 1992; Chaloupka
and Laixuthai, 1997; Pacula, 1998; Model, 1993). The results of these studies emphasize the
importance of understanding the interdependence of widely used substances such as alcohol,
tobacco, and marijuana and suggest that policies affecting one substance may have unintended
consequences on the others. Understanding these interdependencies is especially relevant in light
recently announced $0.45 per pack cigarette price increase (announced in November, 1998 in
response to a $206 billion tobacco industry settlement with 46 states). Policymakers want to
know whether proposals intended to reduce smoking or drinking among youth have unintended
consequences among youth and the general population that may cause marijuana use and other
substance use to rise.

        The goal of this paper is to further explore these interdependencies using a rich database
on drug use—the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA), a nationally
representative survey of the U.S. noninstitutionalized population age 12 and older. The detailed
questions on substance use contained in the NHSDA allow us to better understand how
marijuana use responds to changes in policies that affect the price and availability of marijuana,
alcohol, and tobacco. We focus our analyses on two age groups of interest—youths age 12 to 20
and adults age 21 to 30. We make these age distinction for several reasons. Recent trends show
dramatic changes in marijuana use for youths age 12 to 20. Also, many children first experiment
with alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana in their teens. Finally, the age 21 cutoff is logical for
alcohol because it is the legal drinking age in all states for the years of this study, 1990-1996.
We perform parallel analyses for youths and adults.

        The specific aim of this paper are to estimate the demand for marijuana for youths and
adults as a function of the policies and prices that affect its use. Often times empirical demand
models of marijuana use are not a function of own-prices because marijuana prices are not
consistently available. In the absence of the price of marijuana, much of the literature (discussed
below) includes policies that proxy for the price of marijuana. We follow the practice of
including policies as a proxy for price. These policies include the fraction of police arrests that


                                                 3
are for marijuana possession (i.e., do increased police efforts raise the price of using marijuana
and discourage use?); and state marijuana laws that specify fines and jail sentences for
possession; state-level marijuana eradication programs aimed at reducing the availability of
marijuana (as measured by state-level marijuana eradication programs funded by the Drug
Enforcement Administration [DEA]). We also include prices for alcohol and tobacco to capture
the possibility that these substances are economic complements or substitutes. In addition,
because of our concern that unobservable state-level variables may bias the coefficients on the
policies and price variables, all models include state fixed effects.

         The results of this paper will help guide the creation of comprehensive policies that curb
the use of marijuana in two ways. First, we quantify the effects of policies aimed at curbing the
use of marijuana, allowing policymakers to evaluate alternative policy options. For example, we
provide estimates of the impact of police efforts to enforce marijuana possession laws and the
DEA’s Domestic Cannabis Eradication/Suppression Program (hereafter called the Cannabis
Eradication Program). The latter program funds states to reduce the supply of marijuana grown
in their states by identifying and eradicating marijuana greenhouses, cultivated plots, and wild-
growing marijuana, or “ditchweed.” Second, we present results that clarify the interdependencies
between the demand for of alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana use. With an understanding of these
interdependencies, policymakers can take into account how policy changes directed at one
substance affects the demand other substances.


PREVIOUS STUDIES
        In this section we discuss the previous studies that have examined the interdependence of
alcohol, cigarette, and marijuana demand. Although most research on this topic has focused on
youths, a few studies have examined the general population. In general, this literature has found
conflicting results regarding the interdependence of alcohol, cigarette, and marijuana demand.

       DiNardo and Lemieux (1992) were the first to analyze the joint demand for both alcohol
and marijuana. Using state-level tabulations from Monitoring the Future (MTF)—an annual
survey of high school seniors—the authors show that increases in the minimum legal drinking
age (MLDA) decreased alcohol consumption among youths but also had the unintended
consequence of increasing marijuana use.

       Chaloupka and Laixuthai (1997) applied a similar approach to DiNardo and Lemieux’s
(1992) using individual level data from the 1980-1989 MTF surveys. Because of confidentiality
concerns over marijuana use data, Chaloupka and Laixuthai were not able to estimate marijuana


                                                 4
use data, but they were able to estimate the effect of marijuana decriminalization laws and
marijuana prices on alcohol consumption. Their results suggest that marijuana decriminalization
leads to large and statistically significant decreases in the frequency of alcohol use, implying that
youths switched from alcohol to marijuana. However, combining data on the wholesale and
retail price of marijuana for 1989 from the DEA’s STRIDE database with the 1989 cross-section
of the MTF survey led to mixed results. The authors found that increases in the wholesale price
of marijuana led to increases in the frequency of alcohol use, whereas increases in the retail price
of marijuana led to decreases in alcohol use.

        Thies and Register (1993) were the first to use individual-level data to describe how
marijuana and alcohol use changes in response to policy changes. Using data from the National
Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY), the authors’ showed the minimum legal drinking age
laws and marijuana decriminalization laws did not have a statistically significant effect on
alcohol or marijuana use. Their study did not include prices for marijuana or alcohol in either
the alcohol or marijuana use equations.

       In her analysis of hospital emergency room drug episode cross-sectional data (collected
by the Drug Abuse Warning Network, or DAWN), Model (1993) reports that alcohol and
marijuana are substitutes. The author finds that emergency room episodes involving alcohol
were significantly lower in states where marijuana is decriminalized than in those where it was
not. This finding suggests that, because the penalties for possessing marijuana are lower in
decriminalized states, individuals switched from consuming alcohol to marijuana. Model also
finds more marijuana-related episodes in decriminalized states.

        More recently, Pacula (1998) uses the 1984 wave of the NLSY to estimate the joint
demand for both alcohol and marijuana using a sample of roughly 5,000 individuals. Pacula
estimates both alcohol and marijuana demand directly and shows that increasing beer taxes
decreases the prevalence and consumption of alcohol and decreases the prevalence of marijuana
use. The minimum legal drinking age also decreases the prevalence of alcohol use but has no
effect on the prevalence of marijuana use.

        A study by Saffer and Chaloupka (1998) analyzes the demand for alcohol, marijuana,
cocaine, and heroin for individuals of all ages using the 1988, 1990, and 1991 NHSDAs. The
authors estimate the demand for marijuana as a function of marijuana decriminalization laws,
similar to that used by Chaloupka and Laixuthai (1997), however, they do not include marijuana
prices. Their results show that marijuana decriminalization increases the probability that an
individual consumes marijuana by 4% to 6%. The authors also examine own- and cross-price


                                                  5
effects for the demand for alcohol, heroin, and cocaine. They found increases in the price of
alcohol lead to decreases in marijuana use in the past month. Overall, their findings are similar
to those found in this study that alcohol and illicit substances are economic complements.

        Finally, Chaloupka, Pacula, Farrelly, Johnston, O’Malley, and Bray (1998) examine the
relationship between marijuana and tobacco use by 8th-, 10th-, and 12th-graders from the 1992-
1994 MTF cross-sectional data. The authors find that jail sentences, fines and the price of
cigarettes did not have a statistically significant impact on the probability of marijuana use.
However, they find that youths are more likely to use marijuana and to use marijuana more
frequently if they live in a state that has decriminalized the possession of small quantities of
marijuana. Because of the short timeframe, the authors did not include state fixed effects because
there was not enough variation within states over time to identify price/policy effects in this time
period. However, there was a statistically significant negative relationship between the amount
of marijuana consumed by current users of marijuana and the price of cigarettes and fines for
marijuana possession. These results suggest that marijuana and tobacco are economic
complements.

         In summary, the results of these studies emphasize the importance of understanding the
interplay among policies that affect marijuana, alcohol, and tobacco. However, no clear
consensus has emerged from these studies, perhaps because of limitations in the availability of
appropriate data. Another explanation for why there is no clear consensus in the literature is the
failure in all existing studies to control for unobserved state-specific characteristics. Several
studies rely on an indicator variable for states in which marijuana is decriminalized without
controlling for state fixed effects. It is not clear whether this indicator variable is detecting the
impact of the laws on use or other state-specific characteristics that may be correlated with use,
such as the willingness to accept alternative behaviors or lifestyles. Because other price and
policy variables used in the literature are measured at the state level, these too may capture
unobserved characteristics of the state. Failing to control for these unobserved characteristics
may bias the estimate of the effects of all state policy and price variables.

        The analyses presented below address both of these issues. We first estimate the demand
for marijuana as a function of the state marijuana possession fines and jail sentences, police
enforcement, and the Cannabis Eradication Program mentioned above (and described in more
detail below) as reported by the DEA. The data for this program are reported annually for each
state and vary both over time and over states. We include state fixed effects to control for
unobserved state-level characteristics in all models. By including these fixed effects, we are able



                                                  6
to distinguish the effects of unobserved state characteristics from the effects of state policies and
prices.


DATA
        In this study, we used data from the NHSDA. The NHSDA, an annual survey that began
in 1971, has become a key national indicator of the nation’s drug use behavior and problems.
The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) sponsored the NHSDA from 1974-1992 and
SAMHSA has sponsored the surveys since 1992.. The NHSDA is designed to provide data on
the extent of drug use and abuse by the noninstitutionalized civilian population age 12 and older
in the United States (SAMHSA, 1992; 1994).

        We combined 1990-1996 NHSDA data to provide estimates of the own- and cross-price
and policy effects on the demand for marijuana. In all 6 years, the NHSDA used identical survey
questions for the prevalence of past-year and past-month use of marijuana and the same five-
stage area probability sample design. The NHSDA was revised in 1994, resulting in some non-
comparability of pre- and post-1994 estimates, particularly tobacco use. For this reason, we do
not explicitly model cigarette demand in this paper. Sampling weights were computed based on
the probability of selection at each stage, and these weights were used in all analyses.

         Because of the sensitive nature of the survey topic, self-administered answer sheets were
used for marijuana use questions to increase the confidentiality and anonymity of the
respondents’ answers. This format was designed to minimize underreporting of substance use,
which is a potential limitation of self-reported surveys (Hoyt and Chaloupka, 1993). In a 1990
field test of various survey instruments, Turner, Lessler, and Devore (1992) found that the self-
administered format of the NHSDA decreases the underreporting of substance use compared to
an interviewer-administered format.

        Although the NHSDA is the only survey that provides detailed and consistent data on
drug use among members of the household population in the coterminous United States, the
NHSDA has a number of limitations. First, as mentioned above, the data are self-reports of drug
use, so their value depends on respondents’ truthfulness and memory. Although the self-
administered format of the NHSDA decreases the underreporting of substance use in general,
any given individual’s propensity to report substance use may be affected by the degree of
privacy during the interview. To examine the sensitivity of our results to the degree of privacy,
we include the interviewer’s report of the degree of privacy during the interview as a
supplemental covariate in our demand equations.


                                                  7
        Second, the survey is cross-sectional rather than longitudinal. Thus, individuals are
interviewed only once and are not followed for additional interviews. The surveys therefore
provide an overview of the prevalence of drug use at specific points in time rather than a view of
how drug use changes over time for groups of individuals. Therefore, conclusions about the
relationship between marijuana use and the policies and prices that affect its use should be
interpreted carefully. The results presented below should be considered correlational rather than
causal.

        Third, a small proportion (roughly 1%) of the U.S. population is excluded from the
surveys. With the exception of 1991, the subpopulations excluded are those residing in
noninstitutional group quarters (e.g., military installations, college dormitories, group homes),
those in institutional group quarters (e.g., prisons, nursing homes, treatment centers), and those
with no permanent residence (e.g., the homeless and residents of single rooms in hotels). In
1991, the target population was extended to all 50 states and included residents of
noninstitutional group quarters and civilians living on military bases. If the drug use of excluded
groups differs from that of the household population, the NHSDA may provide slightly
inaccurate estimates of drug use in the total population. This may be particularly true for the
homeless and prison populations.


ANALYSIS VARIABLES
        The dependent variable used in our analyses is an indicator variable for any past-month
use of marijuana. The demographic controls used in our analyses are all self-reported measures
from the NHSDA public use files. These controls consist of gender, age, number of people
living in the household, number of children under age 12 in the household, marital status, race,
family income, current school enrollment status, education, and size of the MSA of residence. In
addition to these self-reported variables, we also included two interviewer-reported variables:
urban/rural status of the respondent’s current residence and an indicator for the degree of privacy
during the interview.

        In addition to the data contained in the NHSDA, we included state-level information on
prices and policies that affect the use of marijuana, which were merged with the NHSDA. The
data include the prices of alcohol and tobacco, arrest information on alcohol and marijuana
violations, and other marijuana enforcement activities.

       Specifically, we included data from the Cannabis Eradication Program from the DEA.
This program is funded by the DEA and is operated as a partnership between DEA and state and


                                                 8
local agencies to reduce the supply of marijuana. The eradication program eliminates both wild-
growing marijuana (“ditchweed”) and cultivated marijuana grown in greenhouses and tended
plots. We focused on the annual number of cultivated plants that are eradicated in each state
because ditchweed often has much less tetrahydracannabinol (THC), the psychoactive
component in marijuana. To create a more uniform statistic that can be compared from state to
state, we adjusted the number of cultivated plants by each state’s population to create the number
of plants eradicated per million residents. Ideally, to be able to interpret this variable as a proxy
for the price of marijuana we would like information on the proportion of the total marijuana
supply that is eradicated. Unfortunately, information on supply is not available and therefore our
ability to proxy for price is limited. In absence of information on total supply, it is possible that
in years when supplies are abundant, the amount eradicated increases but the amount eradicated
as a proportion of total supply may decrease (and hence the price would decrease).

        We also gathered arrest information from the Uniform Crime Reports for 1990-1996.
These data include the number of marijuana possession violations, public drunkenness
violations, and total arrests at the county level. These data were then aggregated to the state
level. However, because not all counties and not all areas within counties report arrest data, we
also included a coverage indicator that represents the fraction of the state that reports arrest data.
Because increases in marijuana and alcohol violations may simply be a function of increased use,
we divided the number of possession/drunkenness arrests by the total number of arrests as a
proxy for enforcement effort.

       We also have state marijuana law data on fines and jail terms for various quantities of
marijuana possession for 1991-1994 and 1996 that we collected from state legal codebooks. The
marijuana possession laws specify the maximum and minimum jail terms and penalties for
varying amounts of possession. In other words, states usually specify fines and penalties for an
ounce of marijuana and then another set of penalties for some larger quantity. We characterize
these data by including the minimum fine for any positive amount of marijuana.

       Data on cigarette prices come from the Tax Burden on Tobacco, an annual report from
the Tobacco Institute that contains state-level information on state and federal excise taxes and
average state cigarette retail prices (Tobacco Institute, 1997).

       Alcohol price information comes from the American Chamber of Commerce Research
Association’s Inter-City Cost of Living Index, a quarterly report of prices for various
commodities and services for over 250 cities (1997). From these data we constructed state




                                                  9
annual average prices of beer, wine, and liquor. Because beer is the most commonly consumed
alcoholic beverage, we use the price of beer to proxy for the price of alcohol.

       Summary statistics (mean, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation) of both NHSDA
survey data as well as state-level policy and price data are listed in Table 1 for both age groups.


METHODS
       This section describes our methodology to study the demand for marijuana using pooled
independent cross-sections of the 1990 to 1996 NHSDAs. Because we are concerned with the
contemporaneous effects of prices and policies that affect marijuana use, we define current users
of marijuana as those who have had any use in the past month.

        In this paper we focus on the decision to use marijuana and not the amount or frequency
of marijuana use. Future analyses will explore average daily consumption among current users
with ordinary least squares regressions. These addition analyses will also include state laws
governing the sales of tobacco to minors and other clean indoor air laws as reported by the
Coalition on Smoking OR Health’s State Legislative Actions on Tobacco Issues. The current
analyses include state fixed effects that control for much of this variation across states. This approach
follows the “two-part” model that has been used extensively in the health economics field to
model the demand for medical care (Duan et al., 1983), smoking (Evans and Farrelly, 1998;
CDC, 1998), and drinking (Manning, Blumberg, and Moulton, 1995; Chaloupka and Wechsler,
1996).

       To address the impact of prices and policies on the decision to use marijuana, we pose the
following demand specification for marijuana:

        prob(M > 0) = Φ(g0 + g1PM1 + g2PM2 + bX + fYear + hState)                               (1)

where M is current marijuana use (past 30 days), X is a vector of sociodemographic variables
described above, and Φ is the standard normal cumulative density function. Because marijuana
price data are not consistently reported, we included data on several policies that affect its use.
PM1 represents the intensity of marijuana law enforcement and PM2 is the level of state
cannabis eradication. We expect the sign of g1 to be negative so that as the police focus a
greater percentage of their time pursuing marijuana arrests, the less likely individuals will be to
consume marijuana. The sign of g2 is ambiguous. Increasing efforts to eradicate fields of
marijuana may signal a good growing year or more successful attempts at identifying sources of



                                                    10
marijuana. In addition, because, unlike alcohol and tobacco where there are state taxes that
affect prices, the market for marijuana may easily extend beyond the state.

        We then checked the sensitivity of our own-effects results by including cross-price
effects for alcohol and cigarettes:

     prob(M > 0) = Φ(g0 + g1PM + g2PA + g3PC + bX + fYear + hState)                           (2)

where PA is the price of alcohol and PC is the price of cigarettes. The contemporaneous effects
of all prices on the probability of marijuana use are represented in Equation (2). If g2 > 0, those
who live in high alcohol-price states are less likely to consume alcohol (all else equal) and are
more likely to smoke marijuana. If this is true, then marijuana and alcohol are economic
substitutes. However, if taxing alcohol decreases alcohol demand and decreases the demand for
marijuana, then g2 < 0 and the two goods are economic complements. In other words, people
who live in high alcohol-price cities/states are less likely to consume alcohol and less likely to
consume marijuana.

         From both Equations (1) and (2) we constructed demand elasticities for participation (any
use) that indicate how sensitive demand is to prices and policies. Although it is not a price
elasticity, we calculated elasticities for the Cannabis Eradication Program because having a such
a “unitless” measure facilitates comparisons of the results across regressions.

        The prevalence and intensity of marijuana use may vary from state to state because of
characteristics about the state not captured by the policy variables above. To account for this
variation we include state indicator variables or state fixed effects. Analyses without state
indicator variables may improperly attribute the effect of policy characteristics about the state
not captured in the policy variables. In the absence of state fixed effects the results inferred from
state-level data on prices and policies may reflect a combination of both individual state
characteristics and the effects of the price and policy variables. The advantage of including state
effects in a pooled independent cross-sectional data set is that we control for all unobserved state
differences, including attitudes, preferences, and other state idiosyncratic characteristics that may
affect demand.

        Despite the advantages of including state effects, many previous studies have not
included them in addition to state-level prices because of concerns over the amount of within-
state variation in prices and policies over time. Without sufficient variation in the price/policy
variables of interest within a state over time, it is not possible to identify both the state-specific
effect and the price/policy variable. In response to this concern, researchers have often omitted


                                                  11
state effects in favor of regional effects. While this is a reasonable approach given data
limitations, results from these models should be interpreted carefully. If there is not sufficient
variation in the key policy variables of interest, these variables may simply reflect prevailing
attitudes and behaviors within a state rather than the behavior changes that are a result of these
variables. In this paper we have sufficient variation to include state effects. To make stronger
conclusions about the causal relationship between marijuana use and the prices and policies that
affect its use requires longitudinal surveys and sufficient variation in prices/policies to determine
their effects on marijuana use. In absence of longitudinal individual data on drug use, we feel
that cross-sectional pooled across years that include state effects is the strongest approach given
these data. To demonstrate the potential sensitivity of results to the exclusion of state effects, we
also report the results of models that include only regional effects.

        To include the effects of national policies (e.g., changes in the national excise taxes on
alcohol, increased national efforts to curb the supply of drugs entering the U.S.) and other secular
trends into our analyses, we included year indicator variables in the pooled independent cross-
sectional data set. Although it is difficult to attribute changes in the national prevalence and
intensity of marijuana, alcohol, and tobacco from year to year to specific policy changes, the
inclusion of year indicators capture a combination of the effects of national policies and other
nationwide secular trends.


RESULTS


Youths Age 12 to 20
         We first report the results of our models for youths age 12 to 20. Table 2 shows both the
own-effects model and the model that includes own- and cross-price/policy effects (the results
for all coefficients are in the appendix). We report the marginal effects, standard errors, and
participation elasticities from the probit models. The own-effects model shows that increased
police enforcement appears to have no effect on the probability of use among youths. The
elasticity is nearly zero and the marginal effect is very imprecisely measured. The marginal
effect of the Cannabis Eradication Program implies that it may not serve as a proxy for price—
the elasticity is very small, 0.027, and statistically significant. Further investigation showed that
higher eradication efforts were also not strongly correlated with survey respondents’ self-
reporting of the difficulty of obtaining marijuana. As a point of comparison for all of these
results, Saffer and Chaloupka (1998) show that the effect of decriminalizing marijuana leads to
an increase in marijuana use in the past 30 days by 4%.



                                                 12
         When we include prices for beer and cigarettes, there is little change in the own-effects.
However, we do find statistically significant effects for these prices. The results indicate that
alcohol and cigarettes are economic complements of marijuana. Higher cigarette prices lead to
decreased probability of marijuana use among youths, as do higher beer prices. The cross-price
elasticity for cigarettes is –0.49. This falls within the range of estimates obtained by Chaloupka
et al. (1998) who use cross-sectional data from the MTF Surveys from 1992-1994 of 8th, 10th,
and 12th graders. The NHSDAs also include high school dropouts. The cross-price elasticity of
beer is –1.05. Therefore, recent assertions that raising the price of cigarettes will encourage
youths to shift from cigarettes to marijuana is not supported in these data.


Adults Age 21 to 30
        The results for adults age 21 to 30 are quite different from those for youths (see Table 3).
The own-effects model shows that increased enforcement of marijuana laws as measured by a
greater percentage of total arrests involving marijuana possession is negatively associated with a
decreased probability of marijuana use in the past 30 days. This effect, which is statistically
significant, yields an elasticity of –0.157. Thus, if marijuana law enforcement increases by 10%,
the probability of marijuana use among adults age 21 to 30 decreases by 1.6%. The results of the
Cannabis Eradication Program show a negative and marginally statistically significant
relationship to marijuana use. However, as we stated above, it is difficult to interpret a causal
relationship between changes in this variable and changes in marijuana use.

        When we include price effects for beer and cigarettes, the own-effects remain fairly
stable. The participation elasticity for marijuana possession enforcement increases slightly to –
0.176. We find no statistically significant cross-price effects for beer and cigarettes, however,
the signs indicate a weak complementary relationship.


Marijuana Fines/Penalties
         In addition to the models presented above, we collected data on marijuana fines from
various years of the Bureau of Justice Statistics’ annual Sourcebook on Criminal Justice
Statistics as well as state legal code books. These data are complete for 1991-1994 and 1996.
Once again, these results show that the policies directed at curbing marijuana use have no effect
on youth marijuana use; however, the cross-price effects remain negative and statistically
significant (see Table 4). For adults, we do find a statistically significant relationship between
increased median marijuana possession fines and decreased probability of marijuana use. The
resulting elasticity is only –0.008. Therefore, a doubling of the current median fines would


                                                13
decrease the probability of marijuana use by 0.8%. Although this effect is small, it is a relatively
inexpensive policy to enact. The other effects are very similar to the previous models for adults.


State Versus Regional Effects
        To check the sensitivity of our results to the inclusion of state effects, we re-estimated the
models presented in Tables 2 and 3 including 9 census regional effects in place of the state
effects. The results from the youth model remained qualitatively the same but the elasticities
changed somewhat. More dramatic changes were found in the adult model. The coefficient on
the marijuana possession arrest and the cannabis eradication variables changed from negative
and statistically significant in the state effects model to positive and statistically insignificant
(P=0.11 and P=0.35 respectively). In addition, the coefficient on the price of beer changed signs,
but remained statistically insignificant while the coefficient on the price of cigarettes remained
positive but was statistically significant. The sensitivity of our results to the inclusion of state
effects reinforces our belief that conclusions about policy variables in analyses without state
effects may reflect the influence of both individual state characteristics and the effects of the
price and policy variables. Therefore, the more conservative approach to determine price and
policy effects separately from state characteristics requires that state effects be included in the
specification.


DISCUSSION
        Our results suggest that raising the price of alcohol or tobacco decreases the probability
of marijuana use among youths, while the policies targeted at curbing marijuana use do not
appear to influence marijuana use among youths. A very different pattern emerged for adults
who are apparently responsive to both increased police enforcement of marijuana laws and
higher fines for marijuana possession. In addition, adults’ use of marijuana is responsive to the
price of beer and cigarettes. We attribute these differences to several potential factors. Because
the costs associated with marijuana possession involve both probability or risk of being caught
and a subsequent fine or jail term once caught, youths may perceive these risks and costs
differently than adults. First, youths may be less risk-averse than adults and therefore attach a
lower cost to a given probability of being caught. Second, youths may discount the future costs
and consequences of being arrested at a higher rate than adults. In addition, the consequences of
alcohol use change as youths reach the legal minimum drinking age. Finally, youths ages 12-20
are experimenting with alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana more than adults who patterns of
consumption may be more stable.

        Although the recently proposed $1.10-per-pack cigarette price increase directed at
curbing teen smoking failed to pass Congress, it is likely that other price increases will be
proposed in the future. Even if future legislation does not call for excise tax increases, cigarette
prices were recently (November, 1998) increased by $0.45 per pack in response a $206 billion
global tobacco settlement between 46 states’ attorney generals and the tobacco industry.
Although some have suggested that such price increases may discourage teen cigarette smoking,
only to lead to an increase in marijuana use, these fears appear to be unfounded. A $1.10-per-
pack increase in the price of cigarettes would lead to roughly a 50% increase in the current price
of cigarettes. Based on our models, such an increase would decrease the probability of
marijuana use among youths by roughly 25%. Similarly, alcohol price increases would also
discourage marijuana use among youths. However, adult marijuana use does not appear to be
sensitive to changes in the prices of cigarettes or alcohol.

        Because there is sufficient within-state variation in the prices and policies over time in
our sample, we are able to make important policy conclusions. We find that that marijuana,
alcohol and tobacco are economic complements for youths and that adults use of marijuana is
reduced as police enforcement of marijuana laws is increased. Although these results rely on
cross-sectional data, we feel that the inclusion of state specific effects strengthens our results by
controlling for other factors (e.g., public sentiment, political environment)
