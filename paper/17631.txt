Does Trade Globalization Induce or Inhibit Corporate Transparency? Unbundling the Growth
Potential and Product Market Competition Channels

                                              ABSTRACT

How does increasing globalization affect corporate transparency? Freer trade represents different facets
and in theory has ambiguous effects on corporate transparency. On the one hand, by exposing firms
to more product market competition, it could discourage discretionary disclosure. On the other hand,
by opening up foreign markets and enhancing firms’ growth opportunities, it may promote more transparency.
Rather than simply estimating a net effect, this paper pursues an approach that allows separate estimation
of the two potentially opposing channels. We employ three different measures of corporate transparency
and track their evolutions for 4061 firms in 49 countries during 1992-2005. By using detailed product-level
tariff schedules for these countries, we construct a measure of growth opportunities enabled by foreign
tariff liberalizations at the sector-country-year level, and a second measure of globalization-induced
product market competition based on a country’s own tariff liberalization (again at the sector–country-year
level). We find strong evidence that higher growth opportunities engendered by globalization promotes
corporate transparency, especially in industries that depend heavily on external financing. At the same
time, we find somewhat weaker evidence that greater product market competition engendered by globalization
discourages corporate transparency. The results demonstrate the importance of disentangling the multiple
and potentially conflicting effects of globalization.

       World trade has been growing faster than world GDP during the last three decades. The

strong growth of cross-border trade results from multiple sources. Some of the reductions in

trade barriers come from multi-lateral trade negotiations under the auspices of the World Trade

Organization/GATT. A recent example of them is the termination of import quotas by the United

States, Canada and European Union in 1995 under the Multi-fiber Agreement and Textile and

Clothing agreement. Some trade liberalizations come from regional free trade agreements. Two

prominent examples are the formation of the North America Free Trade Area and the

enlargement of the European Union. But many other countries have formed regional trade blocs

and are in the process of negotiating one. Finally, the world trade also expands as a result of

many unilateral trade reforms. Unilateral tariff cuts by China, Columbia, and India are examples

in the last category. Because the rapid pace of trade globalization has significantly altered the

business landscape that firms operate in, it is useful and important to understand how rising

globalization affects corporate transparency.

       The question would have been trivial if trade globalization has a clearly defined uni-

directional effect. However, in theory, freer trade in goods and services represents multiple facets

and can have potentially conflicting effects on corporate transparency. On one hand, it generates

more product market competition for firms (when home country’s barriers to imports are

reduced). On the other hand, it also generates more growth opportunities (when partner

countries’ trade barriers are reduced).

       The effect of greater product market competition on corporate transparency is itself

ambiguous. For example, the recent theoretical work by Carlin, Davies and Iannaccone (2010)

show that, under fairly general conditions, greater competition in the product market leads to less




                                                 1
discretionary disclosure.1 This view has been shared by a long list of earlier studies, such as

Verrecchia (1983), Clinch and Verrecchia (1997) and Board (2009). But some other studies

reach the opposite conclusion that more product market competition may lead to more disclosure

(e.g. Darrough and Stoughton (1990), Wagenhofer (1990) and Feltham and Xie (1992)). 2 .

Finally, Dye and Sridhar (1995) suggest that product market competition may either increase or

decrease disclosure depending on whether the information the firm receives is firm-specific or

industry-wide.

        Greater trade globalization also enhances firms’ growth opportunities by reducing

barriers to exports to foreign markets. The effect of greater growth opportunities on corporate

transparency is less controversial. The literature generally concludes that the effect is positive

(Khanna, Palepu and Srinivasan, 2004; and many others).

        Rather than estimating a single net effect of trade liberalization on corporate

transparency, we estimate separate effects from greater product market competition (identified

by reductions in home country trade barriers) and those from greater growth opportunities

(identified by reductions in export barriers to foreign markets). On the effects of product market

competition, we show evidence that is consistent with the model of Carlin, Davies and

Iannaccone (2010): more competition leads to less corporate transparency. On the effects of

export growth potential, we show evidence that strongly suggests that more foreign trade

liberalization leads to more firm transparency, especially in industries that depend heavily on


1
  Their argument is that competition frequently resembles a tournament, where CEOs who receive higher public
praise receive positively skewed rewards. However, greater product market competition often translates into lower
likelihood for CEOs to win the tournament. Hence, they may have less incentive to engage in discretionary
disclosure.
2
 Darrough and Stoughton (1990) argue that the competition through the threat of product market entry encourages
voluntary disclosure of the incumbent, particularly when the entry cost for the potential entrant is low.




                                                       2
external financing. These different results suggest that it is important to unbundle the different

channels of globalization.

       We employ three different and complementary measures of corporate transparency and

track their evolutions for 4061 firms in 49 countries during 1992-2005. By using detailed

product-level tariff schedules for these countries, we construct a measure of growth opportunities

enabled by foreign tariff liberalizations at the sector-country-year level, and a second measure of

globalization-induced product market competition based on a country’s own tariff liberalization

(again at the sector–country-year level).

       In empirical work, product market competition is often measured by an industry

concentration ratio, such as by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI). However, because the

concentration ratio is an endogenous outcome variable, its connection with the degree of

competition is ambiguous. As Demsetz (1973) points out, in the absence of barriers to entry,

“concentration of an industry’s output in a few firms could only derive from their superiority in

producing and marketing products.” Baumol (1982) and Schmalensee (1989) hold the same view

that a high concentration ratio does not necessarily reflect a low degree of competition.

Guadalupe and Perez-Gonzalez (2011) point out, “the general merchandise industry is highly

concentrated around industry leaders, such as Wal-Mart and Target, and at the same time

extremely competitive.” The key take-away point is that a direct measure of barriers to entry is

preferred to an indirect measure such as industry concentration ratio.

       In the empirical literature, growth potential is often measured by a market-to-book ratio.

There are two key drawbacks with this measure. First, the ratio is endogenous. It is easy to think

up a story that features reverse causality: a firm may choose to improve its corporate

transparency for reasons unrelated to any change in growth potential, but such improvement




                                                 3
should nonetheless help that firm to obtain more external financing and therefore to realize more

growth. The market-to-book ratio rises as a result. In other words, one may observe a positive

association between the two, but the direction of causality can go from transparency to growth.

Aside from reverse causality, both market-to-book ratio and a firm’s transparency outcome could

also be driven by a common third factor.

        Khanna, Palepu and Srinivasan (2004), Cahan, Rahman and Perera (2005) recognized

that growth potential (or a firm’s investment opportunities) may be endogenous and used lagged

sales or similar measures to mitigate the endogeneity concerns. They recognized that the lagged

variables can still be endogenous and the procedure does not fully establish the direction of

causality. Durnev and Kim (2005) went one step further and attempted to correct the endogeneity

concerns with a three-stage least squared regression. The primary excluded regressors in the

equation for growth potential (or “valuation”) are industry fixed effects, which are still not ideal.

It is not clear that the industry fixed effects satisfy the exclusion criteria in this context. They are

very frank about the limitations of their approach and warned readers accordingly “identifying

truly exogenous parameters is difficult; therefore the results presented below must be interpreted

with caution” (Durnev and Kim, 2005, p1484). Second, even at a conceptual level, the link

between a firm’s market-to-book ratio and its growth opportunity is weak (Erickson and Whited,

2000; and Alti, 2003). As an important implication of the second drawback, what we need is not

merely an instrumental variable for market-to-book ratio, but a separate measure that can

reasonably be linked to growth potential and is exogenous with regard to corporate transparency.

        One of the contributions of this paper is to develop a methodology that (a) identifies an

exogenous source of variation in firms’ growth potential, namely, changes in foreign trade

barriers (due to changes in foreign government policies), and (b) interacts this shock with a




                                                   4
particular dimension of firm heterogeneity in terms of their intrinsic dependence on external

finance. This framework sharpens our ability to identify the causal effect of growth opportunity

on corporate transparency. Foreign trade liberalization represents an unambiguously favorable

shock to a firm because it raises the firm’s future profitability, but is exogenous to a firm’s

disclosure behavior. For example, a Philippine garment company is unlikely to be able to

influence the tariff schedules or their changes in other countries3. By focusing on this exogenous

source of growth potential, and examining possibly differential effects of this shock on firms

with different degrees of reliance on external finance, we can sort out the causal effect of growth

potential on firms’ corporate transparency.

        Foreign trade liberalization can be an important source of improving growth potential for

firms around the world. Trade globalization has been taking place at a rapid speed during the last

three decades, through three channels. First, many developing countries have experienced a

change of attitude towards trade openness, and have undertaken unilateral liberalization by

cutting tariffs and non-tariff trade barriers. China and India are among the most prominent

examples in this area, but are by no means the only ones. Firms located in countries that trade

heavily with China and India have benefited from improved market access. Second, regional

trade agreements have spread like wildfire over the last ten years. NAFTA, ASEAN Free Trade

Area, the widening European Union to include many former Communist countries, and the

Singapore-US Free Trade Area are all examples. Third, multilateral trade liberalization under the

umbrella of the GATT and the WTO is also making progress, although it may be less significant

3
  To increase our confidence that foreign tariff schedules are exogenous, we exclude from our sample those
exporting firms from the United States, Japan, and the United Kingdom which might be successful in lobbying for
tariff changes abroad. As a further robustness check, we also exclude firms from two largest emerging markets,
China and India, from the regression sample. This is probably more conservative than necessary as the literature on
the determination of national tariffs focuses almost exclusively on countries’ internal political economy.




                                                        5
compared with unilateral liberalization or regional trade agreements. The conclusion of the

Uruguay Round in the mid-1990s was the last major success on the multilateral front. Another

benefit of using foreign tariff schedules to construct a measure of trade potential is that tariff

rates are available at a highly disaggregated level. There are over 5,000 products by the

Harmonious System 6-digit classification. Even after some aggregation to match other variables,

this sector classification is still much finer than is typical in the empirical finance or

macroeconomic literature, and is standardized across all countries.

       Corporate transparency conceptually refers to availability of firm-specific information to

outside investors. Following Bushman, Piotroski and Smith (2004), it includes the effects of

“corporate reporting, private information acquisition and information dissemination.” In order to

capture this broad concept, we do not rely on any single indicator and instead employ three

different measures that hopefully complement each other.

       The first is an outcome-based metric, namely, the average accuracy of earnings forecasts

by stock analysts (conditional on other factors such as firm size that may also affect forecasting

accuracy). The basic idea is that, other things equal, better corporate transparency should allow

analysts to make accurate forecast. The same variable has been used in the earlier literature to

gauge corporate transparency (e.g., Lang, Lins and Miller (2003) and Lang and Maffett (2011)).

As Lang and Maffett (2011) put it: “The accuracy of their (analyst) forecasts is likely also a

function of the transparency of the firm’s information environment, including both the effects of

their private information acquisition as well as firms’ disclosure policies”. Since a key to the

validity of this measure is to hold other things equal, we control for variables that could directly

affect accuracy of earnings forecasts such as firm size, ADR listing, and earnings volatility. Our

second and third measures are the degree of earnings management and the number of disclosed




                                                 6
accounting items, respectively. These two measures look at the “input” side of transparency, or

actions taken by the firms, and serve as useful complements to earnings forecast accuracy. For

example, this can alleviate concerns that an improved earnings forecast might be the result of

greater earnings management instead of a true improvement in the quality of transparency. As it

turns out, trade globalization both reduces earnings management and increases the number of

disclosed accounting items, especially by those firms that are dependent on external financing.



I. Putting the Paper in the Context of the Literature

       A number of other channels have been identified in the literature to affect corporate

transparency, and corporate governance more generally. They include country level differences

in investor protection, financial development and regulation on financial accounting (See, for

example, Leuz et al., 2003; De Nicolo et al., 2008; Aggarwal et al., 2009). We control them in

two ways. First, we add these channels and their interactions with a sector-level dependence on

external finance as control variables. Second, we control them in a more general way by

including time-varying country fixed effects (i.e., country-year pair dummies). The time-varying

country fixed effects allow us to absorb not only typical instruments for creditor or shareholder

rights protection such as legal origins, but also changes in government policies with regard to

mandatory disclosure, the adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, domestic

financial liberalization and international financial integration.

       The literature has also suggested that those firms that are cross-listed in a major foreign

stock exchange, or otherwise need to tap into the international capital market may exhibit better

disclosure. To control for this, we include a firm-level time-varying indicator variable for firm-

years that cross-list in the United States. In addition, we control for time-invariant firm features




                                                  7
with firm fixed effects. We find that while cross-listing in the U.S. is associated more corporate

transparency, which is consistent with the findings of Lang et al (2003), this effect disappears

when cross listing is considered together trade opportunity, firm size and other factors.

Reassuringly, the effect trade globalization on corporate transparency is not affected by the

inclusion of ADR listings. (As our trade liberalization measure is at the sector-country-year

level, and we identify the impact of trade liberalization on corporate transparency through cross-

sector cross-time heterogeneity within a country.

       Our key finding is that trade globalization has caused firms to undertake steps to become

more transparent. This can be seen most clearly in terms of an increase in the number of

disclosed items and in a reduction in earnings management, especially in sectors in which firms

have a greater intrinsic need for external financing. This effect is also reflected in improved

earnings forecast accuracy by analysts.

       Our findings are consistent with the notion that more corporate transparency reduces

capital cost (Gebhardt, Lee and Swaminathan, 2001; and Francis, Nanda and Olsson, 2008).

They are also consistent with the earlier finding that firms tend to improve the quality of

financial reporting before issuing equities or debts (see Lang and Lundholm (1993)). Our

contribution is to be able to pin down the direction of causality.

       Our paper is also related to the literature on firm-level choice of corporate governance

versus country-level regulation on corporate governance. The question arises as whether

companies will choose their governance above their country’s regulatory requirements, and

whether the choice matters for corporate valuation, and/or the ability to raise external finance




                                                  8
(Immordino and Pagano, 2008; and Tong (2008)).4 An important question still needed to be

addressed is whether a desire to raise external financing, such as that may arise from a positive

shock to a firm’s growth potential, could motivate the firm to improve internal governance

provisions. This paper is a contribution to this literature as well.

         Our paper also connects with the literature on globalization and corporate governance.

There has been a relatively large literature on financial globalization and corporate governance

(see Kose et al. (2009) for a survey). But the literature linking trade globalization with corporate

governance is still scarce, although there are more studies associating trade globalization with

economic growth and stock valuation.5 One exception is Khanna, Kogan and Palepu (2006), who

find that bilateral trade linkage between two countries promotes convergence of their de jure

corporate governance. But Khanna et al. (2006) have not addressed the mechanism underlying

the convergence. In this paper, we aim to fill the gap in the literature by examining a specific

channel through which trade globalization could affect corporate governance. That is, trade

globalization, as a source of growth opportunity, could affect the demand for external finance

and hence corporate transparency.




4
  Actual firm-level internal governance has been linked positively with valuation, after controlling for country-level
standards, according to Gompers, Ishii, and Metrick (2003), and Aggarwal et al. (2007). Moreover, these effects are
more pronounced for firms that depend on external financing (Bruno and Claessens (2007)).
5
  For example, Sachs and Warner’s (1995) find that trade liberalization is closely tied to future growth, and Henry
(2000) finds that trade liberalization increases equity price.



                                                          9
II. Methodology and Data

       We now explain both the econometric specification and the construction of the key

variables.



II.A. Econometric Model

       We employ the following basic specification:

(1)

Transparencyijt
 1TradeOpportunityijt   2TradeOpportunityijt * ExternalFinancingDemand i
    OwnTariff ijt   OtherControlVariablesijt  FirmFixedEffectsi  YearFixedEffectst   ijt


where i, j and t stand for stock i in country j at time t. The firm fixed effects are more general

than either sector or country fixed effects, since the latter two are linear combinations of the firm

fixed effects. For example, country-level differences in the protection of shareholder or creditor

rights or financial development are controlled for by these fixed effects. Year fixed effects are

meant to capture trends and cyclical factors that are common to all firms. In some robustness

checks, we will also include time-varying country fixed effects to absorb factors such as

changing government policies toward international financial integration or domestic financial

liberalization. We will explain “Trade Opportunity” and “Trade Opportunity*External

Financing Demand” in more detail in the following subsections. We note here that the measure

of intrinsic demand for external finance is sector-specific but time-invariant. As such, it is part of

the firm fixed effects. In other words, the regression is run as if the demand for external finance




                                                 10
is included as a regressor. Other control variables include firm size (year-end market

capitalization in US dollars) which will be listed and defined below.

       The coefficient on the interaction between “Trade Opportunity*External Financing

Demand” captures the effect of greater growth opportunity. Under the hypothesis that a positive

growth shock leads to an improvement in transparency for firms with a high dependence on

external finance, we expect coefficient β2>0. The interaction term between foreign trade

opportunity and firms’ intrinsic demand for external financing is crucial for our story. Otherwise,

we cannot rule out the possibility of a direct connection between exports and forecasting

accuracy without involving voluntary reforms on corporate transparency. The sign of this direct

connection, β1, is ambiguous, however. On one hand, if foreign demand is more stable than

domestic demand, greater foreign trade could lead to a reduction in forecasting error (β1>0). On

the other hand, greater reliance on foreign trade also increases a firm' exposure to foreign factors

such as exchange rate volatility, foreign political risk, regulatory intervention, and civil strife.

They may increase a firm’s earnings volatility and reduce the forecast accuracy (β1<0). Indeed,

Goldberg and Heflin (1995) and Duru and Reeb (2002) provide some evidence suggesting

greater international sales could raise earnings volatility. In this paper, in addition to examining

any direct connection between foreign trade opportunity and corporate transparency, we explore

differences between firms that rely more or less on external financing. This provides a stronger

check on the hypothesis that at least some of the improvement in corporate transparency is

motivated by firms’ desire to raise more external financing in order to take advantage of new

trading opportunities.

       The coefficient on “OwnTariff” directly measures the effect of greater product market

competition. In particular, a lower domestic tariff rate in the sector that a firm operates represents




                                                 11
more competition from foreign firms in the same sector. If more product market competition

(e.g., lower own tariffs) leads to less transparency, λ would be positive. If more product

competition encourages transparency, λ would be negative.



II.B. Using changes in tariff rates to measure trade globalization

        To measure the two different aspects of globalization, we use foreign tariff reductions as

an exogenous measure of expanding growth opportunity, and reductions in domestic tariff (in the

sector that a firm operates) as a measure of changes in product market competition.

        We first retrieve MFN tariff data for Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) 4-digit

products from the Trade Analysis and Information System (TRAINS) database, maintained by

the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). If tariff data is missing

for a particular importing country in a particular year, we use the most recent values (i.e, values

at t-1, t1, t-2, t+2, …) on the ground that major tariff changes take place infrequently in any

given country). In a small number of cases where the tariff rate for a SIC 4-digit sector is not

available, we use the tariff for the corresponding 3-digit sector instead. We control for the major

free-trade agreements: the European Union and the North American Free Trade Area, where

bilateral tariffs typically fell to zero after the agreements took effect.

        We identify the main business line (at the SIC 4-digit level) of a listed company based

primarily on the information given in the WORLDSCOPE dataset but supplemented by

information in the COMPUSTAT Global dataset if the first source is not available.

        Figure 1 plots the histogram of the average tariffs for all manufacturing sectors in sample

countries between 1992 and 2005. The tariff data are winsorized at the top 1% of the distribution;

the figure indicates that 1% of the product line/exporting country pairs (represented by the spike




                                                   12
on the far right of the diagram) face a tariff rate of 28% or higher. Figure 2 plots the histogram

for changes in average tariffs for sector-country pairs. As one can see, a majority of firms faced a

decline in both home and foreign tariffs during this period, but some experienced an increase in

tariffs.

           While deciding home country tariff rates is relatively straightforward, computing

weighted average of foreign tariff is more involved. For every business line in every exporting

country i in a given year, we calculate the average tariff across all trading partners, weighted by

each trading partner’s share in country’s i’s exports of that particular sector. This measure of

export potential is thus specific to sector, year, and exporting country. For ease of interpretation,

in subsequent regressions, trade opportunity for a firm in a given year is defined as the negative

value of the average tariff it faces across foreign markets. Thus, a reduction in foreign tariff rates

translates into a positive increase in trade opportunity.

           There is no comprehensive data set on non-tariff barriers across countries and over time,

which is as detailed as the tariff rates. Nonetheless, tariff rates and non-tariff equivalents are

likely to be positively correlated as they are promoted by the same protectionist lobbies. This is

supported by the empirical findings in Lee and Swagel (1997), who found a positive association

between these variables for 27 industries in 41 countries in 1988. Furthermore, they argue that

this pattern – that tariff and non-tariff barriers are complements - is consistent with the political

economy theory of trade protection. As an implication of this idea, a 5% reduction in tariff rates

observed in the data may in fact correspond to a much bigger reduction in overall trade barriers.

           It is useful to note that applied tariff rates can go up as well as down, even for member

countries of the GATT/WTO. This is because GATT/WTO obligations place only an upper

ceiling on tariff rates (i.e. bound rates). In most developing countries, applied tariff rates are




                                                  13
substantially lower than bound rates, leaving plenty of room for maneuver. Indeed, in the data,

we observe many instances in which applied tariff rates were revised upward. Take Mexico as an

example. After it signed the North America Free Trade Agreement with the United States and

Canada in 1994, it raised its tariff rates on products in 150 out of 443 SIC 4-digit sectors on

imports coming from non-NAFTA countries. In 22 of these sectors, tariff hikes were larger than

15%. For instance, the tariffs for men’s coats, footwear cut stock, cheese, cigarettes, and corn

were increased by 15%, 20%, 30%, 47%, and 62%, respectively. Variations in tariff rates across

products, countries, and years are useful for our empirical examination.



II.C. Three Measures of Corporate Transparency

       Because the notion of corporate transparency – or availability of firm specific

information to outside investors – cannot be measured precisely and straightforwardly, we do not

rely on any single measure and employ three measures instead. While we view forecasting

accuracy as a “sufficient statistic” for the quality of transparency, the input-based measures are

useful complements because they are more directly related to actions taken by the firms. On the

other hand, surely some of the information disclosure is not captured by earnings management.

And the number of disclosed accounting items does not capture the quality of disclosed items. In

that sense, an overall outcome-based measure such as earnings forecast accuracy can provide

information not captured by the two input-based measures. In any case, we consider a particular

inference to be more reliable when all three measures give similar answers.

       Our first measure of corporate transparency is accuracy of analysts’ earnings forecast.

This has been used to proxy for financial information environment in the accounting literature,

e.g. Lang and Lundholm (1996), Lang, Lins and Miller (2003), Bailey et al. (2003), and Heflin et




                                               14
al. (2003), and Lang and Maffett (2011). According to Lang, Lins and Miller (2003), their notion

of information environment is similar to the concept of “corporate transparency” in Bushman et

al. (2004), which is also our definition of corporate transparency. Hence we use forecast

accuracy to proxy corporate transparency. The rationale is that more frequent and accurate

disclosure should lead to a more accurate forecast by analysts, as argued in Lang, Lins and Miller

(2003). Note that trade globalization may also affect the volatility of earnings and hence forecast

accuracy. Therefore as in Lang, Lins and Miller (2003), we will explicitly control for earnings

volatility in our analysis, which strengthens forecast accuracy as a proxy of corporate

transparency.

        For a given firm in a given year, we use the most recent earnings forecast by each analyst

before the end of a firm’s accounting year to compute the consensus (mean) forecast, and

compare it with the firm’s realized earnings. More precisely, the earnings’ forecast accuracy for

a given company in a given year is defined by:

                                           Mean forecastit  Actualit
(2)                       Accuracyit  
                                                   Actualit

        The measure of forecast accuracy varies both across firms and over time. The variables

are constructed from the Institutional Brokers Estimates System (IBES) database, which contains

analyst-by-analyst estimates for 18,000 companies in 60 countries. The available information

includes company name, data type indicator (e.g. earnings per share), forecast period indicator,

broker and analyst code, estimate date, estimate value, actual reported value, and so on. The

database compiles information from more than 7,000 financial analysts from over 1,000

institutions.

        This measure by construction is bounded by zero from above. A higher value corresponds

to more forecasting accuracy. For some companies, some analysts provide multiple-horizon


                                                 15
forecasts (e.g., over both 1-year and 2-year horizons). We choose to focus on the one-year

horizon as it has the broadest coverage over firms and years. The mean and standard deviation

are -0.86 and 2.75, respectively. The median value, which is less affected by outliers on the left

tail, is -0.18. Figure 3 plots a histogram of the forecasting accuracy for all firms over all years,

winsorized at both the bottom and the top 1%.

        Our second measure is restraint on earnings management as in Lang and Maffett

(2011). One particular channel through which a corporate financial release becomes less than

fully informative is earnings management – a financial maneuver by a firm to make its reported

earnings look more desirable (less volatile) than it actually is. In particular, a firm may

strategically increase or decrease accruals to conceal the true fluctuations in its profits. Our

second measure of corporate transparency is the extent to which a firm engages in earnings

management. We will investigate if more product market competition and an improved growth

opportunity would induce firms to do more or less earnings management.

        To capture the extent to which a firm engages in the practice of earnings management,

Land and Lang (2002), Leuz, Nanda, and Wysocki. (2003), and Lang, Ready, and Wilson (2006)

use the correlation between cash flows (before any accounting adjustments) and profits (after

accounting adjustments). We follow their methodology. To be precise, accruals (AS) for firm i in

country j at time t are calculated as:



(3)              AS ijt  ( CAijt  Cashijt )  ( CLijt  STDijt )  Depijt

where      denotes changes, CA is current assets, Cash is cash and cash equivalents, CL is current

liabilities, STD is short-term debt and the current portion of long-term debt, and Dep is




                                                    16
depreciation and amortization. Operating cash flow (OCF) is derived by subtracting accruals

from operating income (OI):



(4)               OCFijt  OI ijt  AS ijt

We scale AS and OCF by firm’s total asset (TA), and denote the resulting ratios by OCFA and

ASA, respectively. The accounting literature cited above uses the following equation (or some

variation) to examine the severity of earnings management:



(5)   ASAijt     OCFAijt   ControlVariablesijt   ijt

A more negative β is interpreted as more aggressive earnings management. We build on this and

further specify



(6)     0  1TradeOpportunityijt  2 TradeOpportunityijt * RZi  3 RZi



where RZ is the Rajan-Zingales index for intrinsic demand for external finance. We also expand

the list of control variables in Equation (5) to include change of trade opportunity, its

multiplication with RZ, and a sequence of country-year pair dummies. If a positive growth shock

reduces earnings management for firms that rely relatively heavily on external finance, we would

expect β2>0.

        The correlation between       ASA and  OCFA is negative naturally, resulting from the
accrual accounting. But it will be even more negative if managers make accruals choices to

smooth earnings. For instance, in bad times, managers may pre-book future revenues or delay the

reporting of current costs to conceal poor current performance. But in good times, mangers may


                                                 17
do the reverse so as to create a reserve for the future. Hence accruals buffer cash flow shocks and

generate a negative correlation between changes in accruals and cash flows. The calculation

makes use of balance sheet data, which are retrieved from the Worldscope for the period from

1992-2005. [As noted earlier, US firms are excluded from the sample.] We end up with 5500

firms in 44 countries with 39376 observations in total.

       Our third measure of corporate transparency is a simple count of disclosed accounting

items (out of a list of 221). Our empirical model for the number of disclosed accounting items is



(7)

DisclosedItemsijt  1TradeOpportunity   2TradeOpptijt * RZ i   OwnTariff ijt
                       ControlVariablesijt  FirmFixedEffectsi  YearFixedEffectst   ijt



The list of control variables includes firm size, the number of listed stocks in a country, or

country-year pair dummies.

       During the sample, there has been widespread international voluntary adoption of IFRS

rules that generally mandates a greater number of disclosed account items. In addition, growing

stock market liberalizations, more widespread adoption and better enforcement of insider trading

laws may affect the incentives for firms to disclose information and may also affect the

information environment in other ways that could affect an analyst’s forecasting accuracy. These

could generate trends in the number of disclosed items. The country-year pair dummies capture

country-specific trends (as well as other variations common to a particular country-year

combination).




                                                18
           These accounting items are from a list reported in the COMPUSTAT Global database

related to firms’ balance sheets, incomes and cash flows.6 The number of disclosed items ranges

from 42 to 187 over the sample period, with the mean at 151 and the median at 150. This

measure implicitly assumes that all disclosed items are equally important to investors, which

obviously is not true. At the same time, the errors from this assumption are unlikely to be

correlated with a firm’s growth opportunity. In any case, we regard this measure as an additional

check. Our sample covers around 6200 firms in 49 countries.



II.D. Intrinsic Dependence on External Financing

           Following Rajan and Zingales (1998), we define a firm’s intrinsic demand for external

financing by:



                                                           [capital expenditures - cash flow]
(8)              Dependence on external finance =                                             ,
                                                                  capital expenditures



where Cash flow = cash flow from operations + decreases in inventories + decreases in

receivables + increases in payables. All the numbers are based on US firms, which are judged

least likely to suffer from financing constraint relative to firms in other countries due to a

relatively high level of financial development in the United States. As a result, the measure is

exogenous to non-US firms (and we exclude US firms from our regressions). The original Rajan

and Zingales index (1998) covers only 40 (mainly SIC 2-digit) sectors. Since we work with tariff

data, which uses a substantially more refined sector classification, we expand the number of

6
    There are nominally 225 items in total, but 4 items have never been reported by any firm in the dataset.




                                                           19
sectors to around four hundred 4-digit SIC sectors. (If we exclude non-tradable sectors such as

utilities, we are still left with 234 sectors).

        To calculate the demand for external financing for US firms, we take the following steps:

First, every firm is sorted into one of the 4-digit SIC sectors. Second, for each firm, the median

value of the dependence ratio is computed over the period of 1990-2005. Third, for each SIC 4-

digit sector that contains at least 5 firms, the median value then is chosen to be the index of

demand for external financing in that sector. For a few SIC 4-digit sectors in which there are

fewer than 5 US firms, we pool firms from the United Kingdom, Canada and Japan and then

implement a similar calculation. To minimize the influence of outliers in subsequent analysis, we

winsorize this measure at both the top and bottom 1%.

        The mean value of the indicator of demand for external financing is 0.53, with a standard

deviation of 2.93. A histogram of the indicator is plotted in Figure 4. As our hypothesis stresses

the interaction between foreign trade liberalization and a firm’s dependence on external

financing, a histogram of the interaction of the two variables is presented in Figure 5.



II.E. Other Control Variables

         “Earnings change” is defined as the absolute value of the percentage change in realized

earnings per share (in dollar terms) from the previous year. It is included to account for the

possibility that when earnings variation is large, forecasting is likely to be more difficult. For

example, international expansion increases a firm's exposure to foreign factors (i.e. political risk,

regulatory intervention, and civil strife) that may increase that firm’s earnings volatility and

make it more difficult to forecast its earnings, as its operation becomes more complicated (this is




                                                  20
noted by Goldberg and Heflin, 1995; and Duru and Reeb, 2002). Realized change in earnings

from the previous year is a proxy for such shocks.

       “Negative earnings” is a dummy that equals one when a firm has negative earnings in

the current period and zero, otherwise. This dummy is included to allow for asymmetry in a

firm’s disclosure or earnings management, depending on whether the news is good or bad.

Specifically, with bad news looming, a firm may postpone disclosure (e.g. Kothari, Shu, and

Wysocki 2005), and thereby impair analysts’ ability to make accurate forecasts. For a somewhat

different reason, negative earnings may cause the number of analysts to shrink, especially if bad

news persists. Analysts’ payoffs are often linked to the value of stock traded which could be

lessened by consistently bad earnings news.

       “Analyst number” is the number of analysts covering a firm. When foreign trade

liberalization occurs, domestic firms may become more active in raising capital, which in turn

may attract more analysts to cover the firm. The increased demand for information may generate

a reduction in forecasting errors, which needs to be separated by a reduction in forecasting errors

due to better disclosure by the firm. To control for market demand for information at the firm

level, we use analyst coverage in each accounting year, which is also calculated from the IBES

dataset. In the sample, the mean and median numbers of analysts covering a firm are 8.6 and 6,

respectively (with a standard deviation of 8). A histogram of analyst coverage is presented in

Figure 6.

       The “number of listed stocks” is meant to capture the maturity of a stock market. A

greater number of listed stocks may also imply a stronger competition among firms for external

funding, which may pressure them to improve transparency.




                                                21
       As shown by the histograms, the forecast accuracy, the earnings surprise, the index for

intrinsic demand for external financing, and trade opportunity all have long tails, indicating the

presence of outliers. To reduce the impact of the extreme values, we winsorize all these variables

at the 1% level.



II.F. A Note on Sample Construction

       The underlying sample is all manufacturing firms in the IBES database during the period

of 1992-2005. We exclude firms in service sectors (such as banks) because we do not have the

tariff data required to compute their export potential. As we use firm-level information from the

United States to compute intrinsic demand for external finance, our regression sample must

exclude firms from the United States in order to ensure that the measure for intrinsic demand for

external financing is exogenous with respect to firms included in the regressions. For a small

number of SIC-4 digit manufacturing sectors, there are fewer than five firms per sector even after

we pool data from the four large industrial countries. To ensure that the measure for dependence

on external finance is reliable, we exclude firms in these sectors from the regressions. All in all,

our regression sample consists of 4061 unique manufacturing firms in 49 countries, or a total of

24,146 firm-year observations. Appendix I lists the number of firms in each country.

    Some countries, such as Sri Lanka and Slovenia, have fewer than five manufacturing firms

in our sample. We include them to reflect the broadness of country coverage. All the key results

still carry through when we drop these countries (not reported to save space). A given regression

may have a smaller sample due to missing values in some included regressors. Table 1 reports




                                                22
summary statistics for the key variables.7



III. Statistical Results

III.A Some Preliminaries

        The goal of our statistical analysis is to examine the relationship between a firm’s

transparency and greater trade globalization. Before we conduct this analysis, let us first

document two patterns in the data. First, a firm’s export growth is related to changes in foreign

tariffs on its principal product. Second, a firm’s investment responds to export opportunity.

Neither is surprising, but it is useful to have them confirmed in the data.

        We start with an association between firm-level export growth, and reductions in foreign

tariffs in the SIC 4-digit sector that characterizes the firm’s main line of business. The

Worldscope database has information on export sales, but only for 513 firms in 17 countries.

With these firms, a simple OLS regression is performed, of export growth from 1995 to 2005 on

increase in trade opportunity (or reduction in the weighted average of foreign tariff rates) during

the same period, controlling for country fixed effects. The slope coefficient on increase in trade

opportunity is 0.041 with a standard error of 0.019 and a t-statistic of 2.14. This implies that, on

average, a 10% reduction in the weighted average of foreign tariff rates is associated with a 40%

increase in firms’ export growth, and the relationship is statistically significant at the 1% level.

Figure 7 presents a partial scatter plot of export expansion onto tariff reduction, conditional on

country fixed effects. This confirms the regression result that reductions in foreign tariff rates are

linked to firms’ export expansion.


7
 Due to data availability, we have a larger coverage of firms when we examine earnings management and the
number of disclosed accounting items. The exact coverage is mentioned in the relevant subsections.




                                                   23
        Next, we verify a link between firm-level investment (in percent of physical capital) and

firm-level exports from 1995 to 2005. For 686 firms in 24 countries, the Worldscope database

has data on both variables that span the eleven-year period. A simple OLS regression of change

in investment on change in exports (conditional on country fixed effects) yields a slope

coefficient (on export growth) of 0.296 with a standard error of 0.026 and a t-statistic of 11.3. In

other words, a 10% increase in exports is associated with a 3% increase in the investment rate,

on average, and the relationship is statistically significant at the 1% level. Figure 8 presents a

partial scatter plot of investment rate on export growth, conditional on country fixed effects. The

positive association between the two is visually strong.

        To summarize, falling foreign tariffs tend to promote export expansion; and growth in

exports tends to be associated with an increase in investment rate 8 . Neither relationship is

particularly surprising, but they lay a foundation for our central task of investigating the

connection between changes in foreign tariffs and corporate transparency.



III.B. Benchmark Results

        We now turn to the relationship between a firm’s growth opportunity and the quality of

its information environment. The baseline result is reported in the first column of Table 2.

Standard errors are clustered by country, year and sector.

        The coefficient on trade opportunity is 0.013 and is statistically significant at the 5

percent level. A reduction in the average foreign tariff by 5 percentage points (approximately one

standard deviation of the actual tariff rates in the sample) is associated with an improvement in


8
 We are not able to perform such checks for all firms since the information on exports and investment is missing for
most of them.




                                                        24
forecasting accuracy by 0.065 for firms with low intrinsic demand for external financing. While

this estimate is statistically significant, it is relatively modest in quantitative terms. The

coefficient on the interaction between intrinsic demand for external financing and trade

opportunity is 0.003 and is statistically significant at the 10 percent level. For a sector whose

intrinsic demand for external financing is one standard deviation above the mean (or

2.93+0.53=3.46 according to Table 1), the effect of the same improvement in growth opportunity

leads to an improvement in forecasting accuracy by (0.003x3.46+0.013)*5=0.12. So the effect is

twice as large for firms in a sector with a high intrinsic demand for external financing as in a

sector with a low intrinsic demand for external financing. Evaluated at the median value of

forecasting accuracy (-0.18), this represents a 67% percent improvement. Therefore, the effect of

an increase in growth opportunity on corporate transparency is not only statistically significant,

but also economically important, especially for firms that depend heavily on external financing.

       We now turn to the control variables. Firm size has a negative coefficient. Ex ante, one

would think that firm size could have two opposing effects on forecasting accuracy. On the one

hand, larger firms tend to have more complex operations, which raise the difficulty in forecasting.

On the other hand, larger firms may engage in multiple lines of business, which may have natural

hedging or risk-sharing properties that tend to reduce earnings volatility. The negative coefficient

on firm size suggests that the first effect dominates.

       More analyst coverage can also increase forecast accuracy. When foreign tariffs drop,

firms may become more active in raising capital. Hence more analysts may begin covering them,

which may reduce forecasting errors. This analyst-driven story is different from a voluntary

improvement in the transparency by firms. We hence include analyst coverage directly in the

regression to control for this demand-driven possibility so that we can isolate voluntary




                                                 25
improvement in corporate transparency. The finding that improved trade opportunity increases

forecast accuracy—even after controlling for analyst coverage —suggests that a reduction in

forecasting errors is not just due to firms’ greater visibility.

        Note, however, that the literature sometimes uses analyst coverage directly as a measure

of corporate transparency (e.g. Durnev and Kim, 2005, Lang and Maffett (2011)). In a separate

regression using analyst coverage as the dependent variable (not reported to save space), we find

that an improvement in growth opportunity tends to lead to a rise in analyst coverage, especially

for firms with a large intrinsic demand for external financing. We might think that the overall

effect of trade opportunity on forecast accuracy is the sum of a direct effect (as estimated in

Table 2) and an indirect effect through its impact on analyst coverage. We take the conservative

route of ignoring this indirect channel.

        Other control variables have expected signs. A greater earnings surprise increases

forecasting errors: If earnings change significantly from year to year, they become more difficult

for analysts to forecast. The dummy for negative earnings (loss) produces a negative coefficient:

when a firm is losing money, its management may have an incentive to hide losses, reducing the

accuracy of forecasts. Also, the greater the number of listed stocks on a market, the more

accurate the forecast, potentially due to stronger competition among firms for external financing.

        In Column 2 of Table 2, we add a country’s own tariff protection (MFN tariff rate at the 4

digit sector level) as a regressor. A decline in a country’s own tariff rates weakens the protection

for domestic firms from foreign competition. The effect of product market competition on

corporate transparency is itself ambiguous at least in theory. For example, Carlin et al (2010)

predict that greater competition in the product market leads to less discretionary disclosure, while




                                                   26
Darrough and Stoughton (1990) predict the opposite. 9 In our estimation, the regression in

Column 2 produces a point estimate of 0.008 for Own Tariff, which is significant at the 5% level.

This is consistent with the idea that an improved protection from foreign competition increases

firm transparency, in line with the prediction of Carlin et al (2010). However, when we add an

interaction term between own tariff and the demand for external finance, we do not find a

statistically significant effect (not reported to save space).

        Foreign tariff changes are likely to be a better measure of an exogenous change in a

firm’s growth opportunity than domestic tariffs. For example, domestic tariffs are more likely to

be endogenous as they are subject to domestic firms’ lobbying, and those firms with weak

growth opportunities may lobby particularly hard for a higher domestic tariff protection. For

these firms, a higher domestic tariff could signal weaker growth opportunities elsewhere.

Therefore, we place more importance on inferences drawn from coefficients associated with

foreign tariffs. Reassuringly, the interaction term between growth opportunities as measured by

foreign tariffs and the index for intrinsic demand for external finance remains positive (with a

point estimate of 0.0028) and statistically significant at the 10% level.



III.C. Robustness and Sensitivity Checks

        First, we experiment with a refined measure of intrinsic demand for external financing.

The original formula proposed by Rajan and Zingales (Equation (3)) produces a negative number

whenever a majority of US firms in a sector have greater cash flow than capital expenditure. This


9
  Carlin et al (2010) that greater product market competition often translates into lower likelihood for CEOs to win
the tournament of public praise, and hence reduces CEO’s incentive to engage in disclosure. But Darrough and
Stoughton (1990) argue that the competition through the threat of product market entry encourages voluntary
disclosure of the incumbent, particularly when the entry cost for the potential entrant is low.




                                                        27
is not uncommon in the data, and is true in the original Rajan and Zingales (1998) paper as well.

Nonetheless, one might think that a negative value of demand for external financing may reflect

noise in the data and is not desirable. As a robustness check, we re-assign all negative values of

the index to zero. As a further refinement, we defined a second revised index for external

financing that assigns all negative values to zero, and all values above one to one. By restricting

the index to be between zero and one, it can be interpreted as a measure of the fraction of a

firm’s capital expenditure not financed by internal cash reserve. The revised regression is

reported in the third column of Table 2. The coefficient for growth opportunity (corresponding to

sectors with low intrinsic demand for external financing) becomes smaller and statistically

insignificant. Importantly for our hypothesis, the coefficient on the interaction between growth

opportunity and intrinsic demand for external financing turns out to be much larger than in the

benchmark case. In other words, by introducing the restriction that demand for external financing

ranges between 0 and 1, the contrast between firms with different degrees of dependence on

external financing becomes much starker.

       Second, we control for time-varying country-level channels that may also affect corporate

transparency. In particular, we focus on country’s capital account openness and domestic

financial development and their interaction with a firm’s intrinsic demand for external financing.

When a country increases its capital account openness, two opposing effects are likely to take

place. On one hand, if firms wish to compete for newly available international capital, they may

strive to improve corporate transparency. On the other hand, if capital becomes truly abundant

due to a removal of restrictions on inward foreign investment, firms may be less motivated to

undertake reforms to improve transparency. We adopt the Chinn and Ito (2005) index of capital

account openness, which is the principal component from a set of binary dummy variables that




                                                28
codify restrictions on cross-border financial transactions as reported in the IMF’s Annual Report

on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions. The new regression is reported in the

fourth column of Table 2. Greater capital account openness is found to be weakly associated with

poorer forecast accuracy. This is consistent with the interpretation that increased availability of

capital from abroad makes firms less willing to improve their transparency. More importantly,

the key results on growth opportunity and demand for external financing in our baseline model

are not altered. In Column 5, we further control for domestic financial development and its

interaction with external financing demand. We measure domestic financial development by the

ratio of domestic private credit over GDP as in Rajan and Zingales (1998). The interaction

between a country’s domestic financial development and a firm’s external financing demand is

not significant. Moreover, adding domestic financial development does not alter the results for

trade opportunity and its interaction with a firm’s intrinsic demand for external financing.

           Third, as there might be other changes in a country beyond capital openness, we

introduce time-varying country fixed effects (or country-year pair dummies) to control for

potential omitted time-varying factors at the country level.10 These new fixed effects, however,

are likely to bias down the estimated effect of growth opportunity. The reason is that country-

year pair dummies also capture the overall improvement of a country’s trade opportunity. For

example, when China reduced its tariffs on a broad range of products in preparation for its WTO

accession, many of its trading partners, such as Japan, enjoyed an increase in growth opportunity

across almost all sectors. Because this aspect of the improvement in growth opportunities for

Japanese firms is captured by country-year fixed effects, the coefficient on the growth

opportunity and its interaction with demand for external financing capture only part of the total

10
     Time-invariant country factors have already been captured by firm fixed effects.




                                                           29
effects. In any case, the estimation results with country-year fixed effects are reported in Column

6 of Table 2. The interaction term has a coefficient of 0.03, around 75% of that in Column 3.

Reassuringly, it is still significant at the 5% level.

        Finally, in the last column of Table 2, we allow firms that have an ADR (or cross-listed

in the U.S. stock market) to have different corporate transparency. The idea is that those firms

which choose to tap into international capital market may also choose to be more transparent.

Since there have been an increase in cross-listed stocks, there may be an improvement in

corporate transparency. The correlation with foreign trade liberalization could be incidental. To

control for this, we form a time-varying firm-specific indicator variable for firms-years that have

an ADR based on data from Bank of New York. The indicator is time-varying because different

firms may be listed in different years. If the ADR indicator is entered into the regression on its

own, it is positive and significant (not reported to save space), which is consistent with the

findings in Lang et al (2003). If it is included as an additional regressor (reported in the last

column of Table 2), it is not significantly different from zero. Reassuringly, the result on the

effect of trade opportunity on corporate transparency remains positive and significant.

        Since forecasting accuracy is non-positive by construction, we have also tried a Tobit

specification. A serious drawback of this specification is that we cannot include firm fixed

effects. We implement a Tobit version of the baseline equation (similar to Column 1 in Table 2)

with firm random effects but no fixed effects. The coefficient β2 on the interaction term between

trade opportunity and demand for external finance continues to be positive and statistically

significant (with a coefficient of 0.002 and a standard error of 0.001), thus consistent with the

results in Table 2. A check of the data reveals that less than half of 1% of the observations on

forecasting accuracy are at zero, suggesting that data censoring is not likely a major concern.

III.D. Alternative Measure of Quality of Corporate Transparency and Alternative Samples

         Our measure of forecasting accuracy used so far does not penalize dispersion in forecasts

made by different analysts. To see how important this is, we use an alternative definition of

forecasting accuracy, namely, the average of the square of the percentage deviation of individual

forecasts from the subsequent realized earnings:




                              1 N Forecast p  Actual
                                                                2

(9)               Accuracy   
                              N p 1   Actual



Here N is the number of analysts for a stock and forecast p is the last forecast value by analyst p

before the end of the firm’s accounting year. This measure treats a higher dispersion in forecasts,

all else being equal, as a reflection of lower-quality transparency. We revisit Table 2 with this

new definition of the left-hand-side variable. We redo all the regressions in Table 2 with the new

measure of quality of transparency (not reported to save space).11 The point estimates suggest

that the direct effect of an increase in trade opportunity on firms’ transparency is modest if firms

have a low intrinsic demand for external financing. The effect becomes stronger when firms have

a high demand for external financing.

        We also restrict the sample to where firms have at least five years of coverage by the

IBES. This restriction helps to distinguish between firms that have been covered by an analyst

for a relatively long period of time and those that have been newly added to the analysts’ radar

11
  For example, in the same regression model as in Column 1 of Table 2, while the coefficient on trade opportunity
is 0.022 (with standard error=0.008), that on the interaction between trade opportunity and external finance
dependence is 0.004 (with standard error =0.002).




                                                       31
screen. The restriction reduces the number of firms by around 20% from 4061 to 3255, and the

number of observations by around 5%. Still, we find similar results for our key variables in both

the magnitude and the significance levels. For example, compared with Column 3 of Table 2 (RZ

index between 0 and 1), the restricted sample gives a coefficient of 0.009 (p-value=0.2) for trade

opportunity and a coefficient of 0.04 (p-value=0.006) for trade opportunity interacted with the

Rajan-Zingales index.

       Here we look at different weighting in constructing the trade opportunity. Earlier, we use

the contemporary trade shares by trading partners as the weights to construct the average tariff

for a given sector/country combination. This weighting scheme, although not uncommon (as in

the construction of effective exchange rates), may generate some bias due to the potential

contemporary impact from tariff on trade. To control for this problem, we fix the trade weights

at the beginning of the sample - the year of 1992. Consequently, the trade weights are invariant

to the tariff changes in later years. The regression results are presented in Table 3. There, the

impacts of trade opportunity on forecast accuracy increase significantly compared with those in

Table 2. For example, in the first column, the interaction term of trade opportunity and the index

for demand for external financing has a coefficient of 0.0056 (double that of 0.0029 in Table 2),

while still with a comparable standard error of 0.002. The point estimate of trade opportunity

itself is also much larger at 0.03 (compared with 0.013 in Table 2).

       We perform a long-differencing regression to examine whether and how changes in

forecasting accuracy across firms from 1992 to 2005 are related to changes in trade opportunity

faced by these firms. To reduce noise associated with year to year fluctuations in earnings

forecast, we use the average of the initial three years (1992-1994) as the initial values for all

variables, and the average of the last three years (2003-2005) as the final values. As this requires




                                                32
a firm to be present in the IBES database both at the beginning and at the end of the sample

period, the sample size is reduced (to 497 firms).

       The regression results are reported in Table 4. The coefficient on the growth opportunity

is 0.03, significant at the 5% level. More interestingly, the coefficient on the interaction between

demand for external financing and trade opportunity is 0.04 and also significant at the 5% level

(Column 1). Therefore, our basic story holds in the medium term as well: As a firm’s growth

opportunity improves due to foreign tariff cuts, it tends to improve the quality of transparency,

resulting in a more accurate earnings forecast by analysts. This effect gets stronger for firms that

have a high intrinsic demand for external financing for their growth needs. In column 2, we

apply the alternative definition of forecasting accuracy and find similar (in fact, stronger) results.

       We now turn to an alternative way of implementing the long-differencing regression

specification. We classify all firms into six buckets based on two dimensions. First, three slices

of the firms are cut based on the changes in their trade opportunity: those that have experienced a

decline in trade opportunity, those for which the increase in trade opportunity is between 0 to 3.5

(which is the median value of the positive increase in trade opportunity), and those for which the

increase in trade opportunity is 3.5 or more. Second, for each slice, two buckets are created based

on a firm’s dependence on external finance: those firms with little need for external finance

(whose finance dependence index equals zero or negative), and those that are more dependent on

external finance (whose finance dependence index is positive). Six binary dummies are created

to represent these six buckets of the firms, and are used as regressors in the long-differencing

regression. We plot the coefficients for the six dummies in Figure 9, with the benchmark case

being the bucket of firms that do not rely on external financing for growth and have experienced

a deterioration in trade opportunity (i.e., a rise in foreign tariffs). Two solid lines trace out the




                                                 33
coefficient estimates for the two types of firms based on their dependence on external financing.

For each, two thin broken lines trace out the 90% confidence band. The results are revealing. For

those firms that are more heavily dependent on external financing, a large positive shock to trade

opportunity leads to a statistically significant improvement in the accuracy of earnings forecast,

whereas a large negative shock to trade opportunity leads to a deterioration in forecast accuracy.

In contrast, for those firms with little need for external financing, the effect of a change in trade

opportunity – be it negative, small positive, or large positive – has no impact on their

transparency as the relevant coefficient estimates are statistically the same as zero. This picture is

consistent with the idea that a combination of a positive growth shock and a need for external

financing motivates firms to improve their financial transparency.

       To bolster our confidence that foreign trade liberalization is truly exogenous to the firms

in our sample, we have already excluded the firms from the United States which might be able to

influence foreign tariffs through the US government. As a further robustness check, we drop

from the regression sample all firms from the remaining G-7 countries (United Kingdom,

Canada, France, Germany, Japan, and Itay) plus the two largest emerging market economies,

China and India. The new results are reported in Table 5. The first column reports the benchmark

case (where the index for intrinsic demand for external finance is between 0 and 1), and the

second column adds country-year fixed effects. The interaction of trade opportunity and external

finance dependence still has a positive coefficient, significantly different from zero at the 5%

level (column 1). With the country-year fixed effects included (Column 2), the interaction term is

still significant at the 10% level. In both cases, the point estimates are somewhat larger than the

corresponding column in Table 2. Finally, when we exclude countries with fewer than five

manufacturing firms in our sample, all the key results still carry through.




                                                 34
III.E. Earnings Management

        The regression results on earnings management are presented in Table 6. Column 1

reports the baseline case (where the index for dependence on external finance is winsorized at

the 1% level). The average correlation between the change in accruals and the change in cash

flow is -0.77 (column 1), consistent with the concept of accruals accounting. The average effect

of improved trade opportunity on the correlation is insignificant at 0.0001(=-0.0017+0.003*0.61,

where 0.61 is the average external finance dependence). But for industries with large external

finance dependence, improved trade opportunity significantly reduces the correlation between

accrual and cash flow. For instance, with an external finance dependence of 5.4 (the top 90%

threshold) and a tariff reduction of 5%, the correlation between accrual and cash flow becomes

weaker [which changes to -0.70 (= -0.77 + (-0.0017+0.003*5.4)*5)].

        In Column 2, we further include the change in own tariff, and its interaction with the

change in operational cash flow. The interaction term has a positive coefficient with a p-value of

0.11. Hence there is some weak evidence that higher own tariff is associated with less earnings

management, consistent with the prediction of Carlin et al (2010) that less competition may

improve corporate transparency.12

        In Column 3, we repeat the same exercise as in Column 1, but lagging the change in trade

opportunity by one period. Reassuringly, β2 – the coefficient on the triple interaction term of

cash flow change, trade opportunity change and external finance dependence – is still

significantly positive with a similar magnitude. In Column 4, we further filter out noise in the


12
  As a robustness check, we also include a triple interaction term of the change in own tariff, the change of
operational cash flow, and external financing demand. This triple interaction term turns out to be insignificant.




                                                       35
index for external finance dependence by winsorizing it between 0 and 1. This results in a much

stronger effect of a positive trade shock in reducing earnings management, as the estimate for β2

jumps from 0.0028 to 0.02. Hence we find robust evidence that better growth opportunity

induces less earnings management for those firms that depend heavily on external financing.

       In Columns 5 and 6, we control for other channels that may also affect earnings

management, particularly capital openness and domestic financial development. We add their

interaction with    OCFA and external financing demand. The triple interaction involving capital
openness, OCFAijt * CapitalOpennessijt * RZi , is not significant. The triple term involving

domestic financial development, OCFAijt * DomesticFinDevijt * RZi , has a significantly positive

coefficient of 0.99. That is, as domestic financial market becomes more developed, firms engage

in less earnings management, particularly for firms that have large intrinsic dependence on

external finance. Reassuringly, our earlier results for trade opportunity stay almost the same even

after we control for capital openness and domestic financial development. In Column 7, we

allow the coefficient on    OCFA (i.e., 0 ) to vary across countries, as different countries may
have different accounting rules and hence different degrees of earnings management to start

with. We use the index for dependence on external finance as in Column 4. The impact of

OCFAijt * TradeOpptijt * RZi is smaller than in Column 4, but still positive and significant at the

5% level.

       These results help to alleviate a concern about the first measure of corporate transparency

by forecast accuracy. Forecast errors may artificially decline if managers manipulate earnings to

match analyst forecast rather than truly improving the disclosure. Since firms tend to reduce

earnings management in response to better growth opportunity, our finding of an improvement in

earnings forecast is unlikely to result from more earnings management.

                                                 36
III.F. Number of Accounting Items Disclosed

         The results on the number of accounting items disclosed are presented in Table 7.13 In

Column 1, we find that trade opportunity is associated with more disclosed items for firms with a

large intrinsic demand for external finance. The interaction term between trade opportunity and

finance dependence has a coefficient of 0.23 (with a standard error of 0.08). Hence, for a firm

whose index of intrinsic demand for external finance is one, a reduction of tariff by 5 percentage

points will increase the number of disclosed items by 1.53 (=(0.076+0.23*1)*5). To put the

estimate in perspective, the mean change in the number of reported accounting items per firm-

year is 0.54. With that comparison in mind, the effect of trade opportunity is not trivial.

         In Column 2, we add domestic tariff as another regressor. A higher domestic tariff (which

protects domestic firms from foreign competition) is associated with more disclosed items, in

line with the theoretical prediction of Carlin et al (2010). The effect of (external) trade

opportunity is similar to those in Column 1. In Column 3, we add country-year pair dummies.

This helps to control for changes in a country’s accounting requirements, such as a conversion to

the International Accounting Standards. Now the interaction term between trade opportunity and

external finance dependence becomes smaller (with a coefficient of 0.13), but still significant at

the 10% level. In Column 4, we lag the change in trade opportunity by one year, and find that the

coefficient on the interaction term becomes moderately bigger (and significant at the 1% level).

In Column 5, we again allow for country-year pair dummies and find the interaction term still

significant at the 5% level.


13
  We winsorize the number of disclosed items at the 1% level, and restrict the index for external finance
dependence to be between 0 and 1.




                                                         37
       To summarize, this exercise provides some direct evidence that corporate transparency of

a firm responds to changing growth opportunities if the firm depends on external finance for

growth. It also shows that a firm’s response to greater product market competition engendered by

globalization is different from its response to greater growth opportunities engendered by

globalization.



IV. Conclusion

       In this paper, we explore whether trade globalization induces or inhibits corporate

transparency. Trade globalization in theory has conflicting effects on corporate transparency. On

the one hand, by exposing firms to more product market competition, it could discourage

corporate disclosure. On the other hand, by opening up foreign markets and enhancing firms’

growth opportunities, it may promote more transparency. Since these channels can have very

different effects, it is important to unbundle them in an empirical strategy. This paper proposes

an approach that disentangles these different channels of trade globalization by making use of

very detailed tariff schedules at the country-product-year level.

       We find strong evidence that higher growth opportunities engendered by trade

globalization promote corporate transparency, especially in industries that depend heavily on

external financing. Since our measure of growth potential is exogenous to a given firm, we are

reasonably confident that the correlation we observe reflects a causal effect from growth

potential to corporate transparency.

       While a reduction in foreign tariffs represents an improvement in growth potential, a

reduction in a country’s own tariff represents increased competition from foreign firms. We find




                                                38
some evidence that greater product market competition engendered by globalization discourages

corporate transparency.

       We hence identify concrete channels through which corporate transparency might be both

promoted and inhibited in response to market forces. While this paper focuses on corporate

transparency, firms may voluntarily improve other aspects of corporate governance. The relevant

empirical literature faces similar challenges: to identify an appropriately exogenous source of

shock to growth potential, and to unbundle the multiple and potentially conflicting effects of

globalization. The methodology proposed in this paper can shed light on these questions as well.

We leave these topics for future research.

Note: Forecast accuracy, analyst number, and earnings are constructed from the Institutional Brokers Estimates
System (IBES) database, for 4061 firms in 49 countries from 1992 to 2005. Forecast accuracy is defined as the
negative value of the absolute difference between average earnings forecast and actual earnings, normalized by actual
earnings. Analyst number is the number of analysts covering a firm. Firm size is the year-end market capitalization in
US dollars. “Earnings change” is the absolute value of the percentage change in realized earnings per share (in dollar
terms) from the previous year. Negative earnings is a dummy that equals one when a firm has negative earnings in the
current period and zero, otherwise. The number of disclosed items is constructed from COMPUSTAT Global
database, for 6200 firms in 49 countries from 1992 to 2005. It counts the number of accounting items reported in the
COMPUSTAT Global database related to firms’ balance sheets, incomes and cash flows, for a total of 225 items.
Tariff data is the Most-Favored-Nation tariff for SIC 4-digit products in each country, retrieved from the Trade
Analysis and Information System (TRAINS) database. Trade opportunity for a sector-country-year is defined as the
negative value of the average tariff it faces across foreign markets. Own tariff is the tariff for a given sector in the
country where the firm belongs to. External financing demand is industry’s intrinsic dependence on external finance
for investment based on Rajan and Zingales (1998), measured at the 4-digit US SIC level.
