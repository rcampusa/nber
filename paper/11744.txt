“The War for the Fare”: How Driver Compensation Affects Bus System Performance
Ryan M. Johnson, David H. Reiley, and Juan Carlos Muñoz
NBER Working Paper No. 11744

JEL No. D0, J3, L9

                                            ABSTRACT

Two systems of bus driver compensation exist in Santiago, Chile. Most drivers are paid per
passenger transported, while a second system compensates other drivers with a fixed wage.
Compared with fixed-wage drivers, per-passenger drivers have incentives to engage in “La Guerra
por el Boleto” (“The War for the Fare”), in which drivers change their driving patterns to compete
for passengers. This paper takes advantage of a natural experiment provided by the coexistence of
these two compensation schemes on similar routes in the same city. Using data on intervals between
bus arrivals, we find that the fixed-wage contract leads to more bunching of buses, and hence longer
average passenger wait times. The per-passenger drivers are assisted by a group of independent
information intermediaries called "sapos" who earn their living by standing at bus stops, recording
arrival times, and selling the information to subsequent drivers who drive past. We find that a typical
bus passenger in Santiago waits roughly 10% longer for a bus on a fixed-wage route relative to an
incentive-contract route. However, the incentives also lead drivers to drive noticeably more
aggressively, causing approximately 67% more accidents per kilometer driven. Our results have
implications for the design of incentives in public transportation systems.

  Literally, “frogs;;” to our knowledge there is no formal documentation of how the name started. The term sapo
is a derogatory term in Chile. In Peru, they are known, perhaps more appropriately, as dateros (data men). so
named because they jump on and off buses all day.

  At the time of the study, the fare cost 310 Chilean pesos, or roughly 50 cents American. Drivers earn 10-20%
of this fare under their incentive compensation.

  Krbálek and Seba (2000) have previously noted the existence of sapos and of strategic interaction between
drivers on a bus route in Cuernavaca, Mexico, for which they recorded 3500 bus arrivals to estimate the

consumer welfare effects, but rather on demonstrating consistency of the data with a quantum chaotic model of
a one-dimensional gas.

 Time spent collecting fares is an especially important consideration in Santiago, since drivers are in charge of
collecting them, and usually paying the exact fare requires many coins.

  Some routes traveled over parts of the city that we couldn't measure, so we decided to isolate the sector where
we had measuring points and treated our first observation point as the dispatch pointFor some routes we
couldn’t measure the variance over the entire length of the city. Instead, we isolated the sector where we had
measuring points and treated our first observation point as the dispatch point.

   Because of the sheer number of routes that sapos often cover, they cannot accurately mark every bus. For
example, when three buses of the same route all arrive within a minute of each other, the sapo might not write
down all three arrival times because the following bus will only need to know the time in minutes since that
group passed. Also, sapos will sometimes fabricate a number to drivers. For instance, in order to still be paid, a
sapo will sometimes signal a number to a driver even though he didn’t have the interval information. Because
of the varying quality of sapo data, we only used data for sapos whom we were able to audit carefully. In the

end only about 10% of our usable data came from sapos.
11
   The GPS data came from Cantares de Chile, S.A., and Lokal Traffik, S.A. (one route each). They use GPS for
driver accountability, not to actively manage spacing. RedBus, S.A. collected one day’s worth of data on three
of its routes.
12
   The vast majority of the time, the route-points were measured on the same days. For about a third of the
routes, we added additional measuring days when we noticed that we wanted more reliable data.

For simplicity of notation, we let A and B equal the first two noncentral sample moments of

the bus arrival data, and note that our dependent variable Y is a simple nonlinear function of

A and B:

   This implies that the heteroskedasticity is due to basing our aggregates on different sample sizes. Other
sources of heteroskedasticity are possible: for example, one of our workers might record arrival times with
greater accuracy than another. They performed a difficult task, picking out specific buses in heavy traffic for up
to eight hours at a time, so even though we did our best to audit their work for accuracy, these samples likely
contain small, differing amounts of measurement error.

  Because our initial data didn’t contain hour-of-day information (data purchased from sapos indicate only the
minute of the hour), this was possible to do for only 12 of the 32 routes. We define the peak period to be from 6
a.m. to 10 a.m and off-peak to be from 10 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. We then create two observations (peak, off-peak)
for each of the 12 routes and redo the regression with a total of 44 “routes”.

   This is the official figure used by SECTRA (Government Ministry of Transportation Planning), the
transportation research branch of the Chilean government. However, we have reason to believe, based on our

   This figure is the figure the Chilean government uses for project evaluation (Precios 2004).

   Mohring et al.(1987) calculated the disutility of time spent waiting at three times the disutility of time spent
traveling on a bus.

   Based upon 4,457,238 passenger trips per day (Encuesta, 2001).

  Based upon 27,077,232 km traveled by fixed-salary buses per year, 773,668,768 km traveled per year by per
passenger buses. This chart compares the two systems over a 6-month (January to July, 2004) sample of
accidents, during which time fixed-salary buses caused 39 accidents and per-passenger buses caused 1,941
accidents. Assumes all buses had one accident per 347,144 km, and that accidents would produce injuries at the
same rate as before. Data comes from SIEC2, the transportation statistics division of the Carabineros, the
Chilean police.

   The productivity benefits of incentive based contracts are not unique to bus drivers. A study by Shearer
(2005) of two different compensation systems in the timber industry found that workers paid piecewise (per unit
of work) were 20% more productive than workers paid a fixed wage.

   Note that even if he preferred fixed-wage compensation, it would be imprudent for an individual bus owner to
switch from per-passenger to fixed-wage compensation. Santiago has always had a highly fragmented

organization of bus owners. For the 8,000 buses, there are as many as 3,000 owners (Transantiago website
2005). These owners group together to form “paper companies” of 20 to 30 owners per route. These paper
companies serve several purposes. First of all, they allow individuals owners to use their collective power to
buy from the government the right to operate routes (which are auctioned off). They also allow owners to share
overhead, such as inspectors, depots, maintenance facilities, and office space. However, these associations
neither coordinate route operation nor share revenues. Owners get their revenue directly from the drivers, and
drivers are paid directly by the owners. (Revenue sharing would create free-rider problems among owners.) If
one owner of a single bus suddenly decides to pay his driver a fixed wage, that driver could be taken advantage
of by per-passenger drivers who have incentives to aggressively seek passengers, causing revenue loss for the
owner.
