Reconciling Asymmetric Information
and Divergent Expectations Theories of Litigation
Joel Waldfogel
NBER Working Paper No. 6409
February 1998


                                             ABSTRACT


        Both asymmetric information (AI) and divergent expectations (DE) theories offer possible

explanations of the litigation puzzle. Under DE, cases proceed to trial when, by chance, the plaintiff

is more optimistic than the defendant. As the fraction of cases tried (T) declines, this leads to a

tendency toward 50 percent plaintiff win rates at trial (P), regardless of the fraction of plaintiff

winners in the filed population. Under AI, by contrast, informed parties proceed to trial only when

they expect to win. Hence, as the fraction of cases tried declines, plaintiff win rates at trial tend

toward either 0 or 1. We present evidence that the relationship between T and P generated by the

litigation process is consistent with DE and not AI. We also offer evidence of the presence of AI

early in litigation in the form of one-sided plaintiff win rates in cases adjudicated prior to trial. We

reconcile these two findings with evidence that pretrial adjudication and settlement culls both likely

plaintiff winners and likely plaintiff losers from the filed pool, causing a tendency toward central

rather than extreme plaintiff win rates at trial.
