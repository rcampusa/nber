                                            ABSTRACT

FTA bilateral and regional negotiations in Asia have developed quickly in the past decade moving
Asia ever closer to an economic union. Unlike Europe with the EU and the 1997 treaty of Rome and
the 1993 NAFTA in North American, Asian economic integration does not involve a comprehensive
trade treaty, but an accelerating process of building one bilateral agreement on another. For countries
in Asia there is negotiation of a China-Japan-Korea agreement, a China-India agreement, a Trans-Pacific
Partnership (TPP) agreement, and a Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). This
paper uses a fifteen-country global general equilibrium model with trade costs to numerically calculate
Debreu distance measures between the present situation and potential full Asia integration in the form
of a trade bloc. Our results reveal that these large Asia economies can be close to full integration if
they act timely in agreements through negotiation. All Asia countries will gain from Asia trade bloc
arrangements except when the Asia FTA can only eliminate tariffs. These countries’ gain will increase
as bilateral non-tariff elimination deepens. Larger countries will gain more than small countries. Asia
FTA, Asia Union and RCEP will benefit member countries more than ASEAN+3. Global free trade
will benefit all countries the most.

1. Introduction

    In Asia formal FTA arrangements have developed more slowly than in North

American and Europe. Until now, there is no fully comprehensive FTA in Asia, but

instead a number of lesser arrangements. At present, some important negotiations are

in progress, including the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP),

the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the ASEAN Plus Three (APT), an

China-Japan-South Korea FTA, and others. In the future, Asia may thus probably

move to some form of comprehensive trade bloc. Under these circumstances, it is

helpful to numerically explore how close Asia is already to being a trade bloc as well

as what will be the effects of potential Asian blocs like arrangements on individual

economies.

    Here we utilize the Debreu (1951, Econometrica) coefficient as a measure of

closeness to being a formal trading bloc. Little research has used this measure in

application, and there are only a few papers in which this measure plays a role in the

theoretical structure, including Raa (2008), Ahlheim et al (1988), Anderson and Neary

(1996), Brown and Srinivasan (2007). Riezman, Whalley and Zhang (2006) also

construct distance measures to estimate distance of economies from free trade, but do

not use Debreu’s distance coefficient.

    Computational general equilibrium methodology has been widely used to explore

free trade agreement (FTA) effects. The Hicks (1943) welfare variation measures are

the most common index used for analyzing FTA effects. This paper thus injects the

Debreu distance into exploring FTA effects.
                                          3
    Literature on Asia trade blocs is sparse and mostly analytical, such as Shiino

(2012), Fukunaga and Isono (2013), Williams (2012), Lewis (2011), Ezell and

Atkinson (2011), and Stubbs (2002). Some earlier research numerically explores the

effects of regional free trade agreements (see the survey by Lloyd and MacLaren

(2004)), but few papers try to capture the potential effects of recent FTA

developments in Asia. Petri et al (2011), Itakura and Lee (2012), Kawai and

Wignaraja (2008) are the exceptions. Our paper departs from these in using a Debreu

distance indicator to explore the closeness of Asia trade arrangements to being formal

trade blocs. We also use Hicks (1943) compensation and equivalent variation

measures to compare these results in sensitivity analysis.

    Our global general equilibrium model has 15 countries, which are China, the US,

the EU, Japan, South Korea, Canada, Mexico, India, AN (Australia and New Zealand),

CP (Chile and Peru), BMSV (Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam), CILMPT

(Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, Philippine, and Thailand), ODDC (other

developed countries), ODC (other developing countries), and the Rest of World

(ROW).     Each    country   produces     two   goods    (Manufaturing    goods    and

non-Manufacturing goods) with two factors of production (Capital and Labour). The

model uses an exogenous trade imbalance structure and includes trade costs as trade

barriers. We use a trade cost calculation method that recognizes limitations of data by

utilizing an estimation method that follows Wong (2012) and Novy (2008).

    Our calculation results show that the distances of present situation to Asia FTA,

Asia Union, RCEP are nearly the same, but the distance to ASEAN+3 is nearer, which

                                           4
means ASEAN+3 will benefit involved countries less than other Asia FTAs. Distances

to global free trade are farther than all regional Asia FTAs, which means that the

global free trade agreement will gain all countries more than regional free trade

arrangements. All countries in Asia trade bloc will gain from FTA arrangements when

tariff and non-tariff can both been eliminated. But if the FTA arrangements can only

remove tariff, some of big countries will be hurt. All countries’ gain will increase

when non-tariff barriers remove more. In the meanwhile, large countries will gain less

than small countries.

2. Asia FTAs and Their Developments

        Asia has not formed comprehensive free trade agreement, but multicounty Asian

FTAs have been the subject of discussion particularly after the 2008 global financial

crisis. These include ASEAN+3, ASEAN+6 and RCEP (Regional Comprehensive

Economic Partnership). A comprehensive Asia FTA may come into being in the future,

and result in a formal Asian bloc like NAFTA (North America Free Trade Agreement)

and EU (Europe Union), but for now, Asian trade integration rests on the

accommodation of overlapping sub Asian FTAs rather than blocs in Europe and North

American, which reflect the design of an overachieving arrangement in the absence of

prior agreements.

        In contrast to Africa, the Americas and Western Europe, before 1992 Asia had no

regional or bilateral free trade agreements (FTAs). In January 1993, the ASEAN Free

Trade Area (AFTA) came into force over the last decade; Asia has seen a rapid

increase in FTAs. According to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) FTA statistics as

of 2013, there are 257 FTAs in the Asia Pacific Area (compared with just 50 in

2000), with 132 concluded, 75 under negotiation and 50 proposed. Within these, 189

are bilateral, and 68 are plurilateral. The leading countries involved in Asia FTAs are

Singapore (37), India (34), Korea (32), China (27), Pakistan (27), Thailand (26),

Japan (26) and Malaysia (26)1.

        Among Asia FTAs, larger agreements such as ASEAN act as a hub. For example:

ASEAN’s own FTA is complemented by FTAs between ASEAN and other economies

(China, India, Japan, Korea); FTAs between individual ASEAN countries and other

countries and comprehensive economic partnership agreements for East Asia. In Asia

area, there are about 30 major FTAs in effect2 (see Table 1).

       Among FTAs still under negotiation in Asia region, the most prominent

arrangements are ASEAN Plus Three (APT) and the Regional Comprehensive

Economic Partnership (RCEP). The proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) also

involves the Asia Pacific region, although we do not include it in the analysis of this

paper since it exclusively includes non-Asian countries.

       The ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) is a trade agreement involving the

Association of Southeast Asian Nations signed in January 1992 in Singapore. When

the AFTA was originally signed, ASEAN had six members, namely Brunei, Indonesia,

Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. Vietnam jointed in 1995, Laos and

Myanmar in 1997 and Cambodia in 1999. AFTA now comprises ten countries of

ASEAN.

    ASEAN Plus Three (APT) coordinates cooperation between ASEAN and the

three East Asian nations of China, Japan, and South Korea. The APT is the latest

example of East Asian regional cooperation. It reflects earlier proposals for an Asian

Free Trade Bloc, such as Korea’s call for an Asian Common Market in 1970 and

Japan’s 1988 suggestion for an Asian Network. The first APT’s leaders meeting was

held in 1996, until now it has 13 summits; the latest one in October 2010.

    The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) members include

the 10 ASEAN countries and prospective 6 FTA partners: Australia, China, India,

Japan, Korea and New Zealand. The RCEP negotiation aims to conclude by the end of

2015 and cover more than 3 billion people. The area has a combined GDP of about

$17 trillion, and accounts for about 40% of world trade.

    The idea of such a new trade treaty was first mooted at the 19th ASEAN Summit

in November 2011, when leaders of the ten ASEAN member states adopted general

principles for broadening and deepening ASEAN’s engagement with its FTA Partners,

and signaled ASEAN’s commitment to play a central role in the emerging regional

economic architecture.

    RCEP’s first round ministerial meeting was held in Brunei in August 2013, and

the second round of RCEP negotiations was conducted on September 23-27 2013 in

Brisbane, Australia. The 16 economic ministers of Asean+6 have agreed to finalize

the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership by 2015, when the ASEAN

                                           8
Economic Community takes full effect3.

     The aim of this paper is to numerically calculate how close Asia is already

surrogate trade bloc, prior to the conclusion of a RCEP negotiation. FTA development

in Asia area has received considerable attention. But the Asian area includes a lot of

large countries and still does not have a high standard FTA. In the meanwhile, Asia

countries all seem eager to form a FTA to promote regional integration after the global

financial crisis in 2008. The issue of an Asia trade bloc may well become the most

important FTA development in the near future and how close the Asian economies are

already towards this goal is a key element in the debate.

3. Debreu’s Coefficient and Distance Measures

    To measure the remaining distance for the Asian closeness to a comprehensive FTA we

use a calibrated numerical general equilibrium model in which we incorporate a modified

form of Debreu the resource utilization coefficient of inefficiency.

    3.1 The Debreu Coefficient of Resource Utilization

    Debreu (1951) proposes a measure of the inefficiency of the allocation of resources in an

economy by calculating how much less resources could attain the same level of satisfaction to

consumers. The ratio of how much less resources can show the inefficiency level of the

allocation and we take this as the measure of distance between a multi-country equilibrium

under a potential Asian trade arrangements and what a comprehensive agreement would

permit.

    To exposit the Debreu measure, consider an economy which comprises m consumers

with preference relationships  and observed consumption vectors X i0  R l (i=1,…, m) ,
                                    i


where l is the number of commodities. Y  R l is the set of possible input vectors (net

quantities of commodities consumed by the whole production sector), including the observed

one y 0 . A combination of consumption vectors and an input vector is feasible if the total

sum (the economy-wide net consumption), does not exceed the vector of utilizable physical

resources, Z 0  R l . Z 0 is assumed to be at least equal to the sum of the observed

consumption and input vectors, ensuring the feasibility of the latter.

    The set of net consumption vectors that are at least as good as the observed ones is

         X | X 
               i   i   i
                             0
                                           
                           X i , i  1,  , m  Y                                          (1)


where B stands for the ‘better’ set. The minimal resources required to attain the same levels

                                                    10
of satisfaction that come with X i0 belong to B min , the South-western edge or subset of

elements z that are minimal with respect to  . Assume that preferences are convex and

continuous, and that production possibilities form a convex and closed set, then a supporting

price vector p( z )  0 exists such that Z '  B and which implies

      p( z ) z '  p( z ) z                                                                                          (2)

Where p  0 implies all components are positive.

      The Debreu coefficient of resource utilization is defined by

        max z  p( z ) z / p( z ) z 0 | z  B min                                                                 (3)

      and the coefficient  measures the distance from the set of minimally required

physical resources, z  B min , to the utilizable physical resources, z 0 , in the metric of the

supporting prices. Debreu shows that the distance or the max in equation (2) is attained by

      z   z 0  B min                                                                                               (4)

      In words, the Debreu coefficient of resource utilization is the smallest fraction of the

actually available resources that would permit the achievement of the levels of satisfaction

that come with X i0 . Coefficient  is a number between zero and one, the latter indicating

full efficiency4 (Raa, 2008).

     3.2 Debreu Distance Measures Used in Simulation

     In this paper we use the Debreu’s distance coefficient to calculate the distance from

present trade agreement in Asia to an Asia trade bloc. Distance in our paper is measured by

the shrinkage in the endowment of Asia such that a full trade bloc scenario could be attained.

     We use a numerical global general equilibrium model to calculate the distance for

Preferences”. Journal of Productivity Analysis, 30, pp.191-199.

                                                            11
present FTAs to a possible comprehensive Asian trade bloc. We compute two kinds of

distance, one is individual country distance, and the other is whole Asia bloc distance.

     If we assume an N country world, each countries denoted as i (1, …, m). In the base

case (present status), a global general equilibrium has a consumption set (C1* , , CN* ) , utility

set (U1* , , U N* ) , endowment set ( E1* , , EN* ) , and factor demand set ( K1* , , K N* ) . Under

an Asia bloc scenario, the global general equilibrium has a consumption set denoted as

(C1 ,  , CN ) , utility set (U1 ,  , U N ) , endowment set ( E1 ,  , EN ) , and factor demand set

( K1 , , K N ) .

     For the distance we know to an Asia bloc, we denote the distance measure as  . Under

the Debreu’s resource utilization concept, we define as

     min 
     s.t. (1)GE ,
                                                                                                  (5)
          (2)i, Ki   Ei , ( i  country in the bloc)
          (3)i, U i  U i* , ( i  country in the bloc)

where  is the distance of the present situation to that under an Asia bloc. The utility of all

countries in the bloc will be not less than in their base case situation. Figure 1(II) shows this

concept of distance a single country. In the base case, the equilibrium consumption point is B;

in the Asia bloc scenario, the utility possibility frontier is UPF 1. If we keep the utility in the

new scenario as not less than in base case, the utility possibility frontier can shrink to UPF 2,

and  is the ratio between UPF 1 and UPF 2.

     For the distance of an individual country to Asia bloc, we can again denote the distance

measure as i , and define as




                                                    12
     min i
     s.t. (1)GE ,
                                                                                                                  (6)
          (2) K i  i Ei ,
          (3)U i  U i*

where i is the distance of country i from the present RTA situation to an Asia RTA bloc.

It shows the minimum endowment ratio that keeps the utility of country i in the bloc not

less than in the base case. Figure 1(I) shows the distance measured for individual countries.

We keep the foreign country’s consumption fixed, and own country consumption moves from

point B to point A in utility space, and the own country’s utility possibility frontier changes

from UPF 1 to UPF 2, the ratio i is the distance measure for country i .

     If the distance measure is larger than 1, it implies that the trade bloc arrangement cannot

improve welfare of the whole trade bloc of countries and not for individual countries, which

means the trade bloc has negative effects. If the distance measure is smaller than 1, it implies

that the trade bloc arrangement decreases welfares for the whole trade bloc and for individual

countries. The nearer the distance measure to 1, then the distance between present situation

and an Asia trade bloc is nearer. A small distance value means the trade bloc effects are

significant and the present situation to trade bloc is large.

    We thus use a revised Debreu distance indicator, which equals

      D  (1   )  100
                                                                                        (7)
      Di  (1  i )  100

where D or Di are separately the Debreu distance indicators for the whole FTA groups

and individual countries. When D or Di are positive, it means that FTA arrangements

have positive effects for the whole group or individual countries and they can keep their

original welfare level by decreasing D or Di percent of their endowment; When D or

Di are negative, this means FTA arrangements have negative effects for the whole group and

for individual countries. If they want to keep their original welfare level they must increase

D or Di percent of their endowment.

4. Model Structure and Trade Cost Calculation

     We use a global general equilibrium model with an exogenous trade imbalance and trade

barriers based on trade costs to calculate Debreu distance measures to assess how far close is

already to a surrogate trade bloc.

     4.1 An Exogenous Trade Imbalance GE Model with Trade Costs


     Our single period global general equilibrium model has fifteen countries and each

country produces two goods with two factors. These fifteen countries are China, the US, the

EU, Japan, Korea, Canada, Mexico, India, AN (Australia and New Zealand), CP (Chile and

Peru), BMSV (Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore, and Vietnam ), CILMPT (Cambodia, Indonesia,

Laos, Myanmar, Philippine, and Thailand), ODDC (other developed countries, including

Switzerland, Norway, Israel, and Iceland), ODC (other developing countries, including Brazil,

Russian, Egypt, Argentina, and South Africa), and ROW (the rest of the world). The two

goods are manufactured goods and non-manufactured goods. We use agricultural and service

sectors as producers of non-manufactured goods and assume these cannot be traded between

countries. The two factors in each country are labor and capital, which are treated as

intersectorally mobile but internationally immobile. We include trade imbalances in the

model, with the trade imbalance for each country assumed to be fixed and exogenously

determined.


    On the production side of the model, we assume CES technology for production of each

good in each country

    We introduce trade costs for pairwise trade between countries (Anderson and Wincoop,

2003). Trade costs include not only import tariffs but also other non-tariff barriers such as

transportation costs, language barriers, and institutional barriers. We divide trade costs into

two parts in our model; import tariffs and non-tariff trade costs. We denote the import tariff in


                                                            18
country i as ti , and non-tariff trade costs as Nij (ad volume tariff-equivalent non-tariff

trade costs for country i imported from country j ). This yields the following relation

between consumption prices and production prices in country i for country j ' s exports.


     pcijM  (1  ti  N ij ) p Mj                                                     (21)


    We assume that trade costs are covered by importing country. Import tariffs generate

revenues Ri , which are given by

    Ri    p
           j ,i  j
                      M

Non-tariff trade barriers generate no revenue, and importers need to use real resources to

cover the costs involved. In the model, we assume that these resource costs are denominated

in terms of domestic non-manufacturing goods. We incorporate this resource using feature

through use of non-manufacturing goods equal in value terms to the cost of barriers. We

assume reduced non-tariff trade costs (including transportation cost) will thus occur under

trade liberalization as an increase in non-manufacturing goods consumption NRi by the

representative consumer in importing countries. The representative consumer’s income in

country i is given by


    wiK K i  wiL Li  Ri  I i                                                            (23)

    The Asia bloc thus reduces both import tariffs and non-tariff trade costs between member

countries which will influence trade in the whole world.


    We assume an exogenously determined fixed trade imbalance, denoted as Si , which will

be positive when in trade surplus and negative when in trade deficit. Trade equilibrium will

influence individual country’s budget constraint. In the equilibrium, we have


     I i  Ei  Si                                                                       (26)


which means that one country’s total income equals its total consumption expenditure plus its

surplus (trade imbalance), if one country has trade surplus then its income will more than

consumption expenditure, but if one country has trade deficit than its income will be less than

consumption expenditure.


     4.2 Trade Cost Calculation Methodology


     Trade costs capture not only policy barriers (Tariffs and Non-tariff barriers) but also

transportation costs (freight and time costs) as well as communication and other information

costs, enforcement costs, foreign exchange costs, legal and regulatory costs and local

distribution costs. Figure 3 reports the structure of representative trade costs used by

Anderson and Wincoop (2004) to illustrate conceptually what is involved.


    We calculate trade costs following the approaches in Novy (2008) and Wong (2012).

Their method is to take the ratio of bilateral trade flows over local trade, scaled to some

parameter values, and then use a measure that capture all barriers. Some have argued that this



                                              20
measure is consistent with the gravity equation and robust across a variety of trade models

(Novy, 2008; Wong, 2012).

    The measure of trade barrier used here is based on the gravity equation derived from

Chaney’s (2008) model of heterogeneous firms with bilateral fixed costs of exporting. Trade

barriers can take two forms in the model, a variable trade barrier  ir and a fixed cost of

exporting Fir . The variable trade barrier  ir is an iceberg cost. In order to deliver one unit

of good to i from r ,  ir  1 unit of good has to be delivered. The gravity equation

supported by this model is:


              Yi  Yr wr ir   ( 11)
     X ir           (      ) Fir                                                                               (27)
                 Y     i

Where X ir is import of country i from country r . Yi , Yr and Y are the economic sizes

of both countries and the total world, wr is labor costs,  ir is variable trade costs and Fir

is the fixed cost of exporting. The Pareto parameter  governs the distribution of firm

productivities.  is the elasticity of substitution in preferences. i is a remoteness measure


                                                               21
for the importing country which captures trade diversion effects. The mechanism is that the

further away i is from the rest of the world, the more likely that r could export more to i

due to less competition from third party countries in the importer country. This has a similar

interpretation to the multilateral resistance term in Anderson and Wincoop (2003).


    We relate data on trade flows to unobservable trade barriers by taking ratios of bilateral

trade flows of two regions over local purchases of each of two countries:


     X ir X ri               F F  (  1)
                ( ri ir )  ( ri ir )  1                                                     (28)
     X ii X rr     ii rr     Fii Frr


This equation reveals the relationship between observable trade data and unobservable trade

barriers and eliminates the need to worry about the omission of unspecified or unobserved

trade barriers. If the fixed costs of exporting are not bilaterally differentiated ( Fri  Fr ) or are

constant across locations ( Fri  F ), fixed costs drop out of this measure and measured trade

costs are interpreted as variable trade costs, as in models without fixed export costs such as

Eaton and Kortum (2002), Anderson and Wincoop (2003).


    For simplicity, we normalize own trade costs to 1, i.e.  ii  1 and Fii  1 . Defining the

geometric average of trade costs between the country pair i and r as

                            1
            X X 
     tir  ( ir ri ) 2                                                                         (29)
            X ii X rr


     We then get a measure of the average bilateral trade barrier between country i and r :

                        1             1            1   1   1
            X X                                      (     )
     tir  ( ii rr ) 2  ( ir ri ) 2 ( Fri Fir ) 2  1                                     (30)
            X ir X ri


    Data for this equation are relatively easy to obtain, and so we have a comprehensive

                                                                22
measure of trade barriers, and the ad valorem tariff-equivalent bilateral average trade cost

between country i and r can be written as

                                    1
                            X ii X rr 2
    t ir  tir  1  (                ) 1                                               (31)
                            X ir X ri


    Using the trade costs equation above, we can calculate actual trade costs between

bilateral country pairs in our general equilibrium model. In the calculation, X ir and X ri are

separately exports and imports between countries i and r . Due to market clearing,

intranational trade X ii or X rr can be rewritten as total income minus total exports (see

equation (8) in Anderson and Wincoop(2003)),


     X ii  yi  X i                                                                      (32)


Where X i is the total exports, defined as the sum of all exports from country i , which is

     Xi    X
            r ,i  r
                       ir                                                                  (33)



     In the trade cost calculation, all trade data are from the UN Comtrade database. For yi ,

GDP data are not suitable because they are based on value added, whereas the trade data are

reported as gross shipments. In addition, GDP data include services that are not covered by

the trade data (Novy, 2008). It is hard to get this income data according to such a definition,

so here we use GDP data minus total service value added. We get GDP data from the World

Bank database, and the service share of GDP data from World Development Indicators (WDI)

of World Bank database, we then calculate results for GDP minus services. We take the value

of  to be 8.3 as in Eaton and Kortum (2002). We only use trade cost data for 2011 in our

numerical general equilibrium model, calculation results are shown in Table 2.

5. Data and Parameters Calibration

     We use 2011 as our base year in building a global benchmark general

equilibrium dataset for use in calibration and simulation following the methods set out

in Shoven and Whalley (1992). There are fifteen countries in our model, and country

group data is obtained by adding individual country data together. ROW data is

obtained from total world values minus values for the other fourteen countries. For the

two goods, we assume secondary industry (manufacturing) reflects manufactured

goods, and primary and tertiary industries (agriculture, extractive industries, and

services) yield non-manufactured goods. For the two factor inputs, capital and labor,

we use total labor income (wage) to denote labor values for inputs by sector. All data

are in billion US dollars. We adjust some of the data for mutual consistency for

calibration purposes.

    All data except for the EU are from the World Bank database (World

Development Indicate). We use agriculture and service share of GDP data and GDP

data to yield production data of manufacturing goods and non-manufacturing goods,

and use capital/GDP ratios to yield capital and labor input in production. The EU data

are from EU statistics, the currency unit is Euro, and we use annual average exchange

rates to change them into US dollar currency units. These data are listed in Table 3.


    Trade data between each pair of countries are from the UN Comtrade database.

We use individual country total export and import values to indirectly yield exports to

and imports from the ROW, and add individual country trade data to yield country


                                           25
group’s trade data. Using production and trade data, we can then calculate each

country’s consumption values. The trade data we use are listed in Table 4.

    There are no available estimates of elasticities for individual countries on the

demand and production sides of the model. Many of the estimates of domestic and

import goods substitution elasticity are around 2 (Betina et al, 2006), so we set all

these elasticities in our model to 2 (Whalley and Wang, 2010). We perform sensitivity

analysis around these elasticities.


    With these data, we calibrate the model parameters. When used in model solution

these regenerate the benchmark data as an equilibrium for the model. Then, using

these parameters we can form a numerical global general equilibrium system, and can

use this system to calculate Debreu distance measures for Asia trade arrangements.

6. Simulation Results

    We use our 15-country global general equilibrium model to numerically calculate

Debreu distances of present arrangements from various forms of an Asia trade bloc.

We calculate distances for individual countries that are involved in the trade bloc and

also distances for whole trade bloc of countries. From these distances, we can assess

how close Asia is already to a surrogate trade bloc, and analyze the effects of different

Asia trade bloc arrangements.

    The main large countries in the Asia region include China, Japan, Korea, India,

and ASEAN; and they are near each other in geography. Therefore, a typical Asia bloc

should include these four countries and one country group. In the meanwhile, an Asia

trade bloc may have two different types. One is like NAFTA, and in this all member

countries do not have tariffs between each other but each has different tariff levels for

outside countries. We call this type as an Asia FTA. The other is like the EU, all

member countries do not have tariff between each other but they also have the same

tariff level to outside countries. We call this type as Asia Union. ASEAN Plus Three

(APT) and RCEP are presently important FTA arrangement negotiations and they may

develop to an Asia FTA, we also take account of these two trade blocs. We are also

interested in the distance to global free trade. Therefore, the paper will analyze five

different scenarios: Asia FTA, Asia Union, ASEAN Plus Three, RCEP, and global free

trade.

    We use trade costs in our global general equilibrium model, to include both tariff

and non-tariff barriers. We assume that all these Asia FTA arrangements will remove
                                           29
the whole of tariffs and partial non-tariff barriers. For non-tariff barrier removal, we

use five different assumptions, which are 0% non-tariff barrier elimination (tariff

only), 20% non-tariff barrier elimination, 40% non-tariff barrier elimination, 60%

non-tariff barrier elimination, and 80% non-tariff barrier elimination. We separately

calculate Debreu distances under this five different alternatives.

    For the distance value, it shows how much less resources under Asia trade bloc

scenario are needed to attain the same level of utility satisfaction as under the present

scenario. The distance indicator is the shrinkage percent for the total endowment. If

the distance indicator is negative, this means an increased percent ratio of total

endowment are needed to keep the original welfare level, so that FTA arrangements

have negative effects.

     6.1 Distance Measures to An Asia FTA

    Asia FTA is the scenario that China, Japan, South Korea, India, and ASEAN form

a trade bloc. ASEAN has 10 countries; we separate them into two country groups of

BMSV and CILMPT in our numerical general equilibrium model. We calculate

distances for the present situation to an Asia FTA. Table 6, Figure 4 and Figure 5 list

these results.

    We find that nearly all the results are positive except the whole and China under

only tariff elimination case. This reveals that almost all FTA member countries will

gain. But if Asia FTA only remove tariff between countries and has no effect to

non-tariff removal, China will be hurt. The reason is that China’s import tariff is

comparatively high, and Asian countries are not China’s main trade partner, under

                                           30
such circumstance, when only tariffs removed between members, trade condition

effects will make China lose.

                  As the non-tariff barriers are removed more, the distance value becomes bigger,

which means that all individual countries will gain more as non-tariff barriers

eliminate more. For individual countries, BMSV will gain the most, then CILMPT,

                                                                          31
India, Korea, Japan, and the least is China. China’s low benefit is also because of

China’s high import tariff and Asia counties are not China’s main trade partner.

    For the specific values, we take T+80%NT elimination case as an example. The

Asia FTA countries as a whole can shrink 1.6% of their endowment to obtain utilities

for each country in the trade bloc not less than their former level.

     6.2 Distances to Asia Union

     Asia Union is the scenario of China, Japan, South Korea, and ASEAN forming a

free trade area and they have the same tariff level to outside countries in the

meanwhile. The Asia Union’s same outside tariff can choose different levels, we

assume it to separately choose China tariff level, Japan tariff level and India tariff

level. Table 7 and Figure 6 show all distance calculation results.

     We find the results are nearly the same as Asia FTA, when Asia Union only

eliminate tariffs, China will be hurt under China tariff level and Japan tariff level. All

of other member countries in all other situations will gain from the Asia Union

arrangement. In the meanwhile, the more non-tariffs are removed the more the gain of

member countries. Comparatively, ASEAN countries gain the most, and then India,

Korea, Japan and China. These show that comparatively larger countries gain less

from FTAs.

       Compared with Asia FTA arrangement, we find that most countries will gain

more in Asia Union than in Asia FTA under China tariff level case and India tariff

level case. But if the Asia Union takes the Japan tariff level as their outside tariff

       6.3 Distances to ASEAN+3

      ASEAN Plus Three (APT) is the scenario of China, Japan and South Korea

forming a free trade area. Although the present “ASEAN+3” is just a forum, but it is

possible to form an FTA, so we include this scenario for analysis. Table 8 and Figure

7 show the distance calculation results.

     Compared with other Asia trade bloc arrangements, ASEAN Plus Three will

benefit member countries less than Asia FTA and Asia Union. In specific distance

values, the whole trade bloc countries can shrink 1.1% of their endowment to obtain

utilities not less than their present level.

     6.4 Distances to RCEP

     RCEP involves countries of China, Japan, Korea, India, Australia and New

Zealand. RCEP is aiming to reach an agreement by the end of 2015; it may become an

important FTA in Asia. Table 9 and Figure 8 show all distance calculation results.

     The effects are nearly the same as Asia FTA. When RCEP just eliminates tariff

between member countries, China and the trade bloc as a whole will be hurt which

means RCEP cannot benefit China and all countries in the bloc as a whole. Under all


                                                        35
other situations, all countries will gain, so RCEP should negotiate mainly on non-tariff

barriers. As non-tariff barriers remove more, all member countries will benefit more

from it. Comparing distances of individual countries, China is the nearest country, and

ASEAN is the most far country group, which means that China will gain the least and

ASEAN the most.

on member countries is nearly the same as Asia FTA and Asia Union, and the effects

      Distances to global free trade (GFT) is an interesting topic, and we can compare

Asia trade bloc effects with global free trade effects. We calculate distances of each

individual county in our model and distances of all countries as a whole. Table 10 and

      All countries in all situations except only tariff elimination case will gain from

global free trade. When the global free trade is just tariff elimination, the US, the EU,

China, Japan, Mexico, CILMPT and other developing countries (ODC) will lose, this

may be caused by trade condition effects. This proves that global trade liberalization

in the future should mainly focus on non-tariff elimination. Another implication of the

                                                               37

     We compare the effects of global free trade with Asia trade bloc arrangements,

and find that global free trade will benefit involved countries much more than Asia

trade bloc, the distances of present situation to the global free trade are much longer

than to the Asia trade bloc.

     6.6 Sensitivity Analysis

     We perform sensitivity analysis in this part with two methods. The first is

changing the values of elasticities in the production and consumption to seperately

equal 1.5, 2 and 2.5, and compare their different results to check the sensitivity to

elasticities. We perform sensitivity analysis for the Whole country distance; the results

are listed in Table 11. We can see that all results are nearly the same, and as

elasticities increase, the positive effects of FTAs and global free trade will increase.

This suggests that our simulation results are reliable.

     The second method is using Hicks (1943) welfare variation measures to calculate

and show these Asia trade bloc effects to individual countries. We use equivalent

variation (EV) and compensation variation (CV) to evaluate the effects of Asia trade

blocs. Compensating variation refers to the amount of additional money an agent

would need to reach its initial utility after a change in prices, or a change in product

quality, or the introduction of new products. Compensating variation can be used to

find the effect of a price change on an agent's net welfare. CV reflects new prices and

the old utility level. Equivalent variation (EV) is a closely related measure that uses

old prices and the new utility level. It measures the amount of money a consumer

would pay to avoid a price change, before it happens. They have the following

equations

      EV  e( p 0 , v( p1 , m1 ))  e( p 0 , v( p 0 , m 0 ))  e( p 0 , v( p1 , m1 ))  m0

       These results show that all Asia trade bloc member countries will gain, but most

non-member countries will loss. Comparatively, small countries will gain more from

FTA and large countries gain less. All CV results and EV results are nearly the same,

and the Asia trade bloc effects to countries are the same with distance calculation

results. These prove that our simulation results are reliable.




                                                                41
7. Conclusions

    This paper numerically calculates the Debreu coefficient, and introduces Debreu

distance measures into FTA effects measurement. We use a fifteen-country global

general equilibrium model with exogenous trade imbalance and trade cost to explore

the distance to potential Asia trade blocs. We use a Debreu coefficient distance

indicator to evaluate how far Asia is already surrogate trade bloc, which indicator is

new in literature and provide another angle to show FTA effects from endownment

shrink ratio side. Although Debreu coefficient is an old notion, little research has

calculated it numerically.

    We have set six scenarios to calculate distances of present situation to Asia trade

bloc and explore the potential effects. These six scenarios are: Asia FTA, Asia Union,

ASEAN Plus Three, RCEP, global free trade and sensitivity analysis.

    Our simulation results show that all trade bloc member countries will gain when

the FTA arrangements will eliminate both tariff and non-tariff barriers. But when Asia

trade bloc can only eliminate tariff, some of big countries may lose. As non-tariff

barriers remove more, the gains of trade bloc member countries will increase.

Compared with different country type, larger countries will generally benefit less and

small countries will benefit more. For different Asia trade bloc arrangements,

distances from present situation to Asia FTA, Asia Union and RCEP are nearly the

same and larger than ASEAN Plus Three, which means the ASEAN Plus Three will

benefit member countries less than other trade bloc arrangements. Distances to the

global free trade are the largest.
