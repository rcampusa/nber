     Financial Innovation and the Control of Monetary Aggregates:

                        Some Evidence from Canada


                               ABSTRACT


     This paper presents an empirical test of the proposition that

control of a monetary aggregate will generate a rise in its velocity.

The test is carried out utilizing the Canadian experience of controlling

Ml growth from 1975:3 to 1982:3. Section One of the paper presents

evidence of the instability of the Canadian demand from Ml money since

1975:3. Section Two develops a specific form of the proposition which

emphasizes the role of asset substitution between classes of chartered

bank deposits. A relative asset demand equation is derived from a

wealth   maximization model subject to a technological transactions
constraint and this equation is   estimated from 1961 through 1982.

The results lend support to the proposition that central bank control

of Ml generated a rise in Ml velocity.

Introduction

    Over the past nine years there has been extensive documentation of instabil—

ity in the U.S. Ml demand for money function. Since this instability implies

less predictability between money and nominal flCoflE, it raises serious doubts

about the ability of the monetary authorities to control nominal income through

a policy of targeting the growth rates of monetary aggregates.

    The evidence on the instability of the money demand function has been re-

viewed recently by Judd and Scadding [1982] and they note that it has spawned

two distinct research agendas. First, it is argued that financial innovation

has changed the meaning of the monetary aggregates which the authorities are

attempting to control. The solutions implied by this argument are either

to redefine the aggregates to include the new instruments which are substituting

for Ml money in the payments mechanism, as the Federal Reserve has done re-

cently, or to attempt to model the process of innovation thereby restoring pre-

dictability to the relationship between money and nominal income.

    The second line of research has followed the suggestion that the perceived

stability of the demand for money prior to 1973 was in fact a misconception.

The reality, it is maintained, was that a number of issues regarding the appro-

priate specification of money demand were swept under the rug because the data

could not generate a resolution of them.' Consequently the pre—1973 debate has

been reopened in the hope of generating a more robust specification of the

demand for money.

    In this paper I focus on the first approach and attempt to shed some light

on the process of innovation utilizing Canadian data. The basic framework is

that of Silber [1975, 1982] who suggests that innovation results from the at—
                                         —2—


 tempt of banks to circumvent constraints imposed upon the banking industry or

 its customers. These constraints can arise either through centralized policy of

the government or through the normal functioning of markets. Regardless of the

source, however, this framework suggests that if changing conditions increase

the shadow price of adhering to a constraint firms will have an incentive to

undertake or intensify the search for new financial instruments.

       One application of this constraint—induced innovation hypothesis has been

carried out by Simpson and Porter [1980] who concentrate on the effects of high

interest rates on the interest elasticity of Ml demand. Given higher oppor-

tunity    costs of holding money, individuals will impute a higher rate of return
to    investment in new techniques of money management. In addition, the restric-

tion on the payment of interest on demand deposits will induce banks to innovate

in this area. This twofold effect, it is alleged, results in new instruments

such as lock boxes or ATS accounts which lower the demand for Ml.    Furthermore,
should interest rates subsequently decline the process will not reverse itself

because the resource costs of the new techniques and instruments have been in-

curred. Simpson and Porter attempt to capture this effect through an interest

rate ratchet variable which allows for a lag between peaks in interest rates and

subsequent innovations. Their results, however, do not suggest that this tech-

nique is sufficient to restore confidence in the Ml function.

      A more fundamental interpretation of circumventive innovation is suggested

by the Kaldor hypothesis [1970] that an attempt by the authorities to control

the   growth rate of a monetary aggregate will result in a rise in the velocity of
that money   as private agents substitute to another payments mechanism.2       -
                                        —3—



    The choice of interpretation is of more than passing interest because of the

profoundly different policy implications. The former suggests either a respeci—

fication of Ml demand or the choice of a broader aggregate to internalize any

substitution which might occur. While it is recognized that during a period of

rapid innovation it may be difficult to achieve desired stability and predict-

ability   in the money demand function, the basic thrust of this interpretation
does not appear to undermine the case for control of a particular monetary
aggregate. The latter interpretation, in contrast, does appear to question
the basic policy. Bluntly put, any single—minded pursuit of a particular mone-
tary target is destined to fail because private agents will innovate to escape
the cutting edge of the control.
    An attempt to provide empirical evidence for or against the latter hypothe-

sis is hampered by the fact that the experience of the Federal Reserve with

targeting on monetary growth rates has coincided with an environment of high

market rates of interest and restrictions on the payment of interest on depo-

sits. As argued above, this combination could be the trigger for innovation.

In addition, the move to deregulation has spawned new instruments such as the

NOW account and the new money market account; innovations which a priori should

lead to a reduction in Ml demand. As a result, it does not appear possible to

separate the effect, if any, of the Kaldor hypothesis from the forces mentioned

above.

    The Canadian experience with controlling monetary aggregates appears to be

appropriate for an empirical test of the Kaldor hypothesis for the following

reasons. First, the stated policy of the Bank of Canada from the fourth quarter
                                           —4—



 of   1975 until the fourth quarter of 1982 was a gradual reduction in the rate of

growth    of   Ml and, of equal importance, this policy was effected to a consider-

able degree.3 Second, during this period there was no restriction on the pay-

ment of interest on deposits nor was there any     substantial   change in the

regulatory environment facing the banking industry. Third, over the period in

question there has been substantial financial innovation and, unlike the U.S.

experience, this has occurred within the chartered banking system. Finally,

during this same period there has been a significant rise in Ml velocity after

accounting for both trend and the rapid rise in interest rates.

       Indeed, for the above reasons one could argue that the Canadian environment

of    l97'5 through 1982 will closely resemble that of the United States in the
decade ahead     and should therefore be able to provide clues as to what difficul-

ties await the Federal Reserve.5

      In what follows, Section I discusses the nature of financial innovation in

Canada and presents some evidence relating to the instability of the money demand

function. Section II models the Kaldor hypothesis in the context of circumven—

tive innovation and presents a test of the hypothesis. Section III summarizes

the main conclusions of the paper.


Section I

A. Financial Innovation in Canada6

      The financial innovations of the past eight years which have influenced the

demand for Ml have occurred both in the corporate and household sectors. In

the former category, the first major innovations occurred in the mid—seventies
                                           —5—


and they took the form of new cash management techniques which allowed corpora-

tions to minimize daily working balances. One     of   the more important of these

is the centralized concentration account which allows for consolidation of

several, perhaps geographically dispersed, accounts. A report is issued to the

corporate treasurer the morning following deposits and he may allocate these

funds as he sees   fit.   In addition, this period witnessed the introduction of

regional lock boxes and preauthorized account withdrawals which reinforced the

tendency   to minimize working balances.
    In   the past tio years, banks began  to accept standing orders on how to
employ surplus funds overnight. Two     of the options offered are interest—bearing
notice deposits (which are not included in the definition of Ml) or the auto-

matic paydown of outstanding demand loans. Either of these options would tend

to reduce the demand for Ml balances.

    On the household side, the major innovations have been the introduction of

daily interest savings accounts and daily interest chequable savings accounts.

Prior to the third quarter of 1979, chartered banks calculated interest on

savings accounts based on the minimum monthly balance. Consequently, funds

received during the month such as salary payments were deposited typically in

personal chequing accounts. With the advent of daily interest accounts in

August and September, 1979, individuals would have a much greater incentive to

economize on demand deposits within the month.

     The second innovation occurred in the latter half of 1981 with the introduc-

tion of daily interest chequable savings accounts. Prior to this change savings

accounts could not as a rule be used for transactions purposes. The new
                                                 —6—


accounts are actually hybrids of saving and demand in that interest is paid

above a minimum balance and withdrawals, while subject to a fee, are not

restricted. Since this is technically a notice deposit, it is not included in

the definition of Ml and the spread of this account would tend to reduce Ml

balances.7

      The combined effect of these innovations has had a significant effect on

the Ml demand function and the next section presents some evidence of this

effect.


B. Stability of the Demand for Money

      Landy [1980] presents some evidence on the stability of the Canadian Ml

demand function since 1915. Utilizing the technique of out—of—sample dynamic

forecasting, she identifies a break (downshift) about the second quarter of

1976. Hem [19801 has noted that dynamic forecasting tends to exaggerate the

duration of any shift since it captures the lags in adjustment of money to the

new level of demand. He argues that static forecasts will present a more ac-
curate picture of any shift in the demand function. Consequently, it seems
appropriate to reconsider the evidence.
      The conventional money demand function is given by                equation (1).8

           ln(M/P)t =     + ctiln(M/P)t      1

                                                                     x3ln(y)

and

          DUMI, i =   1,   2 ;   dummy variables to control for the effect of the

                      interruption of the payments mechanism due to postal

                      strikes.

      The addition of dumnr variables is necessitated by the apparent

willingness of the Bank of Canada to accommodate the teorary increase in

demand for liquidity which occurs during a postal strike. A strike tends to

delay households' payments to firms but it does not interrupt some of

firms' financial obligations such as payrolls. Consequently, an uncorrected

money demand function will tend to underestimate money at the time of a

strike.

      Gregory and MacKinnon [19801 argue that the partial adjustment model

which underlies equation (1) requires the addition of a lagged dunury whenever

a dummy is included. The coefficient of the lagged dummy mist be constrained

to equal the negative of the product of the coefficient of the lagged depen-

dent variable and the contemporaneous duinny. This procedure was followed in

the estimation of equation Ci).

      Since the nature and duration of postal strikes has differed signifi—

cant],y, separate dummies were added for each strike. The coefficients for

the strikes of 1965:3, 1968:3, 1970:2, 1915:1, 1980:3 and 1981:3 are insigni-

ficant are the ten percent level and are not included in the final

regression. The coefficients for the strikes of 19714:2 and 1975:4 are signi—
                                         —8—


ficant at the five percent level and are essentially identical. In the final

regression they are constrained to be equal. The coefficient for the strike

of l978:4 is significant at the ten percent level.9

     Table 1 presents estimates of equation Ci)      for   the 1956:1 — 1976:1 and the

1956:1 — 1982:3 saiile periods. The choice of sample period follows that of

Landy. While the differences between the samples are not as pronounced as that

for the U.S. equation, the general pattern is maintained. The coefficient on

the lagged dependent variable rises from 0.736 to 0.900. This implies that the

mean adjustment lag increases from 3.8 to 10 quarters which suggests an

implausible lag. The impact elasticity for real income is halved and the long—

run interest elasticity rises from 0.20 to 0.55. The standard error of the

equation also increases by 25 percent.

    A standard F test for structural stability allows one to reject the hypothe-

sis of stable coefficients across the hypothesized break point of 1976:1. The

calculated F statistic of 5.09 exceeds the one percent critical value of 3.51.

    Further evidence of the instability of the function is demonstrated by an

analysis of the equation's forecasting ability. Post—sample static forecasts of

equation (i), based on the coefficient estimates from the 1956:1 — 1976:1

regression, are presented in Table 2. In every quarter the equation over—

predicts Ml demand. The root mean square error is more than three times the

standard error of the in—sample equation and   the   fraction of error attributed to

bias (one—sided prediction) is 58%.

    While    the   above evidence would tend to support a claim that the demand for

money  has altered over the past seven years, it does not provide any clues
as to the nature of the breakdown. If the function simply experienced a one-
time   change in intercept without a change in slope coefficients, then one could

still retain confidence in the underlying economic relationships. However, if

the instability were due to the omission of variables or to fundamental changes

in relationships, then the implications for control of monetary aggregates are

much more serious.

    In order to gain a better understanding of the nature of the instability one

can utilize the Breusch and Pa,n [1979] test for random coefficient variation.

The test statistic is one half the R2 times the sample size of a regression

of the squared residuals from equation (1) on the squared values of the
                          10                       2
explanatory variables.         This statistic is x with degrees of freedom equal

to the number of explanatory variables. The calculated statistic of 13.82

exceeds the one percent critical value of 1l.3L Therefore, we can reject

the null hypothesis of zero coefficient variation over this period.

    Since the post 1976:1 sample has been characterized by substantially higher

interest rates on average, a log—linear form which constrains the interest elas-

ticity to be constant might be expected to perform more poorly than a semilog

form. Equation (i) was reestimated using the natural value rather than the log

of the interest rate and was subjected to the same tests as outlined above.

The F test statistic of 4.22 supports a rejection of the null hypothesis of

structural   stability at the one percent level. The out—of—sample predictions
show less bias than those of equation 1     but there is a tendency to overpredict
                                      —12—


from 1976:2 to 1980:3 (sixteen out of eighteen quarters) and underpredict after

1980:3 (six out of eight quarters). In addition the Breusch and Pagan test

statistic of 14.42 supports a rejection of the hypothesis of zero coefficient

variation again at the one percent level. We conclude that the money demand

function cannot be rehabilitated simply by a change in functional form.

    Since the hypothesis under investigation deals with the velocity of Ml, we

have investigated this variable directly. Table 3 presents the results of a

regression of the log of Ml velocity on a constant term, the log of the three—

month treasury bill rate, and time for four subperiods between 1954 and 1982.

The niest striking feature of the results is that the estimated quarterly growth

rate in Ml velocity averages 0.47 percent from 1954:4 to 1975:3 and 1.1 percent

since the advent of targeting of Ml in 1975:3. Also, the interest rate variable

for the last period is not significant. The F test statistic supports a rejec-

tion of the hypothesis of structural stability about 1975:3 at the one percent

level of significance.

    In anticipation of the discussion of Section II, Table 4   presents   the re—

suits of an analysis of the velocities of currency, demand deposits and time

deposits. This data demonstrates that the rapid acceleration in Ml velocity

over the past seven years can be attributed primarily to the increase in demand

deposit velocity. This result together with the fact that the time deposit velo-

city growth rate increases in absolute value by 150 percent over this same period

indicates that significant deposit substitution has occurred since the targeting of

Ml began.

Section II

    The maintained hypothesis under investigation is that the rise in Ml velo-

city above trend over the past eight years is a result of the attempt by private

agents to circumvent Bank of Canada policy of a gradual reduction in Ml growth.

The rationalization for this attempt at circumvention is straightforward. An

announced policy of a reduction in the growth rate of a particular monetary

aggregate should generate a reduction in expectations of future inflation,

assuming that these expectations are formed in a rational manner, and sub-

sequently, to a decline in nominal interest rates. If, however, the stance of

fiscal policy in inconsistent with this announced policy (as it was in Canada

over the period in question) then rational individuals may find the monetary

policy lacking in credibility and they may not revise their expectations of

inflation.11 As a. result, the ensuing reduction in liquidity will raise

interest rates.

     As individuals perceive higher opportunity costs of holding money balan-

ces they may attempt to substitute towards interest—bearing deposits.

Substitution will be constrained by the fact that interest—bearing deposits

are a less efficient payments mechanism than Ml money and individuals may

look outside the banking system for alternatives.

     Chartered banks have two options open to them to prevent competitors

from attracting their deposits. They can pay interest on checking accounts

or they can enhance the efficiency of other types of deposits as mediums of

exchange through innovation. The tradeoff banks face in choosing between

these alternatives is the eight percent differential in reserve requirements
                                             —15-.


 between     demand and time deposits and the cost of innovation. Presumably some

 combination     of the two options will be optimal which suggests that innova-

tions 'will generate greater substitution from Ml to time deposits than in

previous periods.

        The above argwnent suggests that the rise in Ml velocity is linked

directly to deposit substitution. It follows, therefore, that to test the

proposition that Ml velocity is a function of the degree of control of Ml one

requires a model of the decision process by which private agents determine

the relative holdings of various monies.

        Following Chetty [1969] and Moroney and Wilbratte [1976]    ,   we assume that

households maximize financial wealth subject to a monetary transaction

constraint.-2 Formally, define financial 'wealth in period t as



                M(t) +
      w(t)
                         X1(t)[l+r.(t)],                                           (2)


where M(t)         nominal Ml money balances;

        x.(t)      nominal holdings of the 1th class of interest—bearing assets;

and     r.(t)      nominal interest rate of the i     asset.
      We assume the technolor by which households combine money and interest—

bearing financial assets is given by equation (3).




      T3(t) =    I8(t)M(t)    +
                                  1(t)x1(t)],                                      (3)



where         TS(t)      volume of transactions services undertaken in period t;

                         technical coefficients on money and interest—bearing assets
                       respectively;

and        p, p.       substitution parameters of money and interest—bearing assets

                       respectively.

      As Moroney and Wilbratte note, the above formulation assumes that the deci-

sions affecting the relative portfolio holdings of money and assets X1 are inde—

pendent of the yields on physical and human capital; an assumption which

Bisignani [19151 tests and accepts using U.S. data. If, in addition, we assume

that p =
              p=p    for all i and j (an assumption which Moroney and Wilbratte

could not reject) then we can approximate equation (3) by its CES form.

      Maximizing equation (2) subject to the CES form of equation (3) yields the

following first—order condition.


                                                                                (1)
      m1(t)


where m(t) the optimal ratio of Ml to X;
                               the relative technolor coefficient of the th asset;

               E   i/(1±),   the elasticity of substitution between Ml and

and g(t)           1/(1+r1(t)).

      Finally, we note that there is no reason to assume that        remains constant

over time especially given our knowledge of the trend rate of increase in Ml

velocity. As a working hypothesis we assume that           is a function of per-

manent income as specified in equation (5).



                                                                              (5)
      t) = 0Y1(t),

where Y(t)         permanent income
                                                —17—


and                the difference between the coefficients on                and   respectively.

      The justification for equation (5) is twofold. First, the inventory approach

to modelling money demand suggests that there are economies of scale asso-

ciated with the level of income. We assume that these scale economies may be

approximated by a rise in            which is the relative technolor coefficient of

the th asset. Second, permanent income is a trend—demoninated variable and

as such it may be expected to capture the effects over time of changes in the

transactions demand for Ml money which are unrelated to the control of Ml.

          Substituting equation (5)    into   equation (n),     taking     logs and adding a

duruiiy    variable   and an error term yields the equation to be estimated.

                                                                      c,                   (6)

      We can utilize equation (6) to test directly whether banks pursued a policy

of deposit substitution as a result of central bank control of Ml. If the

hypothesis is correct, some form of structural instability of equation (6)

should appear about the breakpoint of 1975:14 and with the addition of a suitable

proxy variable we should be able to model this instability.

          Defining M3—Ml as the interest—bearing asset and the chartered bank

three—month deposit rate as the relevant interest rate, we estimated equation
                                         —18—


(6) using quarterly data from 1961:1 to 1982:3. Y(t) and g(t) were estimated

in distributed lag form since the estimation results of equation (i) suggests

a mean lag in adjustment of actual to desired money balances of close to four

quarters prior to 1915:3. The lags were estimated with a second degree poly—

nomial. We imposed an endpoint restriction of zero for the seventh and

fourth lags for Y(t) and g(t) respectively.

    The initial estimate by ordinary least squares yielded a D.W. statistic

which indicated positive autocorrelated disturbances and hence a specification

error. Two possible sources of error are the assumption that the transactions

technolor is of a CES type and that the portfolio relationship between Ml money

and time deposits of chartered banks is independent of the yield on physical or

human capital.

    Utilizing equation (3) which implies a more general techno1or, we derived

an equation corresponding to equation (6) and estimated it over the same sample

period with M2—M1 and M3-Ml as the relevant alternative assets. Again, the D.W.

statistic indicated positive autocorrelation and the correlation correction

yielded estimates of rho which were not significantly different from that of

equation (6). Therefore we conclude that the assumption of a CES technolor is

not a source of error in equation (6).

    If the assets in the transactions constraint are not separable from physical

or human capital, then the m.(t) which we estimated would not be invariant to

changes in the   yields   on these assets. In order to test for this type of rela—

tionship, we included an inflationary expectations proxy in equation (6). The

proxy variable is that of Riddell and Smith [19821 who generate forecasts from
                                       —19—


 an ARIMA model estimated from a moving sample of 38)4   monthly observations
 beginning in 1921. The method of moving sample insures that agents form expec-

 tations on previous experience only rather than on the basis of experience

 over the entire sanle.13 Again the estimation yielded an estimate of rho not

 significantly different from that of equation (6). We conclude that, to the

 extent that our proxy accurately measures inflationary expectations, the

assumption of separability of physical capital from financial assets in the

transactions technolor is not the cause of the specification error.

     Accordingly, equation (6) was reestimated using the Cochrane—Orcutt

method of correction for autocorrelation. Prior to the presentation of the

regression results let us review the a priori restrictions on the coef-

ficients. First, since the sum of the c coefficients is the elasticity of

substitution between Ml and time deposits, it should be positive. Second,

given our knowledge of the trend rates of growth of Ml and time deposit

velocities, the sum of the b coefficients is expected to be negative

Third,    is the initial estimate of the technical coefficient of time

deposits relative to Ml money in the transactions technolor and as such we

expect it to lie in the unit interval. Since the elasticity of substitution

is positive, the restriction on    can be restated as a restriction that the

constant is nonnegative.

     Consider the first row of Table 5 which presents the results of the
regression of equation (6) over the sample period 1962:14—1975:)4. The
constant is positive and highly significant. The coefficients on current and

lagged permanent income are significant and their sum is negative as expected

but the first two coefficients are positive. This result tends to support

 the view that individuals view Ml money, among    other   things, as a temporary

 abode of purchasing power until it can be allocated in an optimal fashion

 among all assets.

      The coefficents on current and lagged interest rates are significant and

 possess the correct sign. The sum of these coefficients which represents the

 elasticity of substitution between Ml and tine deposits is 2.91. This com-

 pares to an elasticity of 6.09 between Ml and chartered bank personal savings

 deposits obtained by Short and Villanueva 119771 using annual Canadian data

 over the period 1951—1973. The calculated initial value of        is 0.26 which
 satisfies the a priori restiction.

    Since rho is insignificant from one at the 5 percent level, the equation was

reestjmated in first difference form. The individual lag coefficients and the

mean lags are statistically identical as is the elasticity of substitution. We

conclude that equation (6) is a robust specification of the relative asset

demand of Ml and M3—M1 over the sample period in spite of the restrictive assump-

tions used in its derivation.

    Row two of Table 5 presents the results of the regression over the post—

policy—change sample.     The results indicate significant structural instability.

The constant is of the wrong sign and together with the elasticity of substitu-

tion of      implies    an initial value of 8 of 1.67. Also, the sum   of   the b

coefficients is positive counter to a prior expectations. The calculated F sta-

tistic of 11.01 exceeds the one percent critical value of 4.ii, a result which

supports a rejection of the null hypothesis of structural stability.

    Perhaps the most striking result of this regression is the fact that the

coefficient of serial correlation turns negative and is insignificant for the

post—T5:14 sample. Given the difficulty in eliminating autocorrelation in the

sample 1962:14 —     19T5:,   this is indeed surprising. Since the total sample still

exhibits autocorrelation, one might be tempted to explain the disappearance

of   autocorrelation with technical arguments such as problems with the number of
degrees of freedom. However we are unable to find any other twenty quarter
sample which does not possess autocorrelation. Consequently we       interpret the

disappearance    of autocorrelation as evidence of a fundamental change in the
actions   of private agents resulting from the policy change of the Bank of

innovations in the underlying transactions technolor is valid, then it

should be possible to model these innovations with an additional variable

which reflects the degree of control. In other words, equation (6) is

incompletely specified for the post—control sample and we require another

variable     which   measures the degree of central bank control of Ml.

       The   hypothesis   suggests that chartered banks will have an incentive to

utilize costly resources to effect deposit substitution when they perceive a

reduction in the rate of growth of money relative to some average of past

rates. There are marrj reasons for believing that this relationship may      be

subject to significant lags. Banks will wish to insure that current down-

turns reflect a permanent reduction in the rate of growth of money before

undertaking expenditures for innovations. There may be delays before

research and development efforts culminate in innovations. Also, bringing

the new technolor on line may involve significant lags. Consequently it
                                                       —23—


 seems appropriate to model these effects with a variable which provides

 flexibility in the relationship between the rate of growth of money and inno-

 vations.

        With the above in mind, we propose a variable defined as the difference

 between two moving averages of the rate of growth of Mi.15                  Formally, let jj
 denote the quarterly growth rate of Ml. We define S(t) by16


                          i=t
        S(t) = —                       1
                                  1. — —                      m >   n.                      (1)
                      i=t—m+l               jt—n+l


Since m exceeds n, a positive S reflects a sustained reduction in the rate of

growth of Ml which, by hypothesis, should result in deposit substitution from

Ml to time deposits.

    The evidence in Table 5                indicates   that the structural change in the relative
asset demand equation is centered primarily about the constant term and by
implication    Accordingly, we propose as a working hypothesis that      is                     a
function of S as well as permanent income. Formally, we assume that

                =
                      .
                    '0Y   1(t)e

where       >   0.

That is, a rise in S will generate innovations which, by assumption, impact

on the relative technolor coefficient of time deposits. Substituting

equation (8) into equation (4),               taking   logs, and adding a dumnr variable and

error term yields

where d.   —y±•

     A priori, we expect d to be zero for the period 1962:4 — 1975:4 and nega-

tive for the period 1977:3 — 1982:3.


     Equation (9) was estimated for the periods in question and the results are

presented in Table 6. For the period 1962:1 — 19T5:4, the coefficient on S is

insignificant as hypothesized. The constant term standard error declines but

there is no appreciable change in the lag structure or sum of lags on permanent

income. The last two lags on the interest rate turn insignificant. The stan-

dard error of the regression shows little change.

    For the period 1977:3 — 1982:3, the coefficient on S possess the correct

sign and is highly significant. The constant term turns positive and is highly

significant. The estimate of 80 accordingly declines to 0.31 from 1.67. The

standard errors of the b coefficients decline appreciably and the sum of these

coefficients is now negative. The standard error of the equation declines by 55

percent. The addition of S also induces negative serial correlation.

    Since the results in Table 6 indicate that the innovation prow performs

as hypothesized, we reestimated equation (9) with the restriction that d = 0

for the period 1962:1 through 1971:11-. The results of these regressions are pre.-

sented in Table 7.

    A comparison of rows one and two reveals surprising similarity in the

underlying parameters of the transactions services technolor. The elasticity

of substitution is 2.91 in the first sample and 3.14 in the second sample. The

standard errors are 0.68 and 0.141 respectively. The initial values of 8 are of

 the   correct magnitude and are very close. The sum   of   the b coefficients should
 be considered identical.

       Given the rather large differences in technolor between the two samples

 implied by Table 5, we consider the conformity achieved by the addition
                                                                         of S to
 be quite remarkable. Recall that we
                                       assumed innovations impact on the rela-
 tive technolor coefficient rather than on the elasticity of substitution.

Also, our proxy variable for innovations could be considered crude at best.

 Yet, inspite of these restrictive assumptions we are able to achieve a high

degree of conformity in parameters over the two samples. We conclude that this

evidence supports the hypothesis that the rise in the velocity of Ml above trend

over the past eight years can be linked causally to the decision of the Bank of

Canada to target on the growth rate of Ml.


III Conclusions

     Theexperience of Canada with a central bank policy of targeting Ml growth
suggests that there may be a fundamental difficulty in controlling the rate of
inflation through a policy of targeting on this variables. The evidence pre-
sented in this paper indicates that the degree of control of Ml growth does have
a significant role to play in explaining the rise in the velocity of Ml and, as a

consequence, the inflation rate has taken much longer to respond to restrictive

monetary policy than nest observers would have predicted prior to the policy

inactnient.

    It would appear that the noninterest—bearing characteristic of Ml plays an

important role in explaining this causal link since it may, on occasion, provide
                                      —28.-



chartered banks with an incentive to increase the monetary effectiveness of

other classes of deposits. However, this interpretation is not necessarily

warranted. Recall that Canada is free from restrictions on the payment of

interest on any type of deposit. Accordingly, chartered banks could have ini-

tiated interest payments on demand deposits in the face of sharply higher market

rates of interest. We argued that the differential reserve requirerxnt probably

influenced the decision to innovate rather than pay interest. Yet, as long as

the option of innovation is open to the private sector, there will always be the

possibility of nonprice competition through the enhancement of the transactions

efficiency of deposits.

    The characteristic which appears to be critical in explaining the rise in Ml

velocity is the scope of the targeted aggregate. A narrow definition insures a

wide selection for deposit substitution through innovation. Therefore, the

case for control of a narrow aggregate would appear to be weakened considerably

by the evidence presented in this paper.

 8.7, 10.2, 7.9, 4.6, 4.3, and     0.1 percent respectively. This compares to an

     5. On this note, it should be pointed out that in November of 1982 the

Bank of Canada publicly abandoned its policy of targeting on Ml growth because

of the instability    of   the demand function and attendant diffjcultjes.

     9.     It is surprising that the strike of 1981:3 which lasted 143 days does

not generate the hypothesized underprediction of money. Could it be that the

general public is adapting to the frequent interruptions of postal service in

Canada?


    10. The regression was run over the period 1972:14 to 1982:3. While the

sample contains observations prior to the hypothesized break about 1976:1, it

was necessitated by the minimum test requirement of forty observations.

Sargent and Wallace [1981].


    12. This interpretation is due to Moroney and Wilbratte [1976]. In the

original article Chetty assumed a CES utility function and maximized utility

subject to a wealth constraint. The difficulty with this interpretation is that

it assumes the only motive for holding assets is to facilitate transactions ser-

vices.

approach.

estimates of equation (6) for the U.S. using governnnt debt and corporate debt

as well as time deposits of commercial banks. Nor are they able to explain the

cause of the specification error.

                                                               innovation have
been incurred it will be maintained
                                   even if the forces leading to its adoption
are mitigated. However we found that the use of this type of variable
                                                                      results
in insignificant b coefficients.
                                 We interpret this result as evidence of multi—

collinearity between permanent income and the
                                                ratchet variable, as might be
expected, since both variables are dominated
                                               by trend. Consequently, we
followed the approach described in the text.

                              n were determined by the data. The best results
were obtained with m equal to 20 and n equal to 5.
