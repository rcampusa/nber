                                         ABSTRACT

Using General William Sherman’s 1864–65 military march through Georgia, South Carolina, and
North Carolina during the American Civil War, this paper studies the effect of capital destruction
on medium and long-run local economic activity, and the role of financial markets in the recovery
process. We match an 1865 US War Department map of Sherman’s march to county-level
demographic, agricultural, and manufacturing data from the 1850-1920 US Censuses. We show
that the capital destruction induced by the March led to a large contraction in agricultural
investment, farming asset prices, and manufacturing activity. Elements of the decline in
agriculture persisted through 1920. Using information on local banks and access to credit, we
argue that the underdevelopment of financial markets played a role in weakening the recovery.

1   Introduction

Conflict and other disasters have caused destruction and economic mayhem throughout human

history, but the study of their effects on growth remains limited (Skidmore and Toya 2002). Fur-

thermore, little work has examined the economic factors that may affect the recovery process,

specifically the role of credit markets. In a standard neoclassical growth model, a temporary shock

to capital should be followed by rapid growth, bringing the economy back to the original steady

state quickly, with no consequences in the medium run. Evidence in this direction has been pre-

sented by several papers, all examining the effects of wartime destruction in the twentieth century

(Ikle 1952; Davis and Weinstein 2002; Miguel and Roland 2011). In this paper, we study the long-

and medium-run effects of capital destruction on local economies using General William Sherman’s

1864-65 military march during the American Civil War as a shock to local capital. We estimate that

capital destruction had large negative effects on both the agricultural and manufacturing sectors,

with some agricultural effects persisting until 1920 because of changes to agricultural institutions.

More, we also find evidence that the underdevelopment of credit markets in the postbellum period

played a key role in weakening the recovery process.

    Writing to Commander Henry Halleck on Christmas Eve 1864 from freshly conquered Savannah,

Georgia, Union General William Sherman documented how he and his men were fighting “not only

... armies, but a hostile people” (US War Department 1901). Their effort required “mak[ing] old and

young, rich and poor, feel the hard hand of war,” particularly in a region of the South that had not

hosted any major fighting (Carr 2015, p. 134). For more than a month, Sherman marched his men

300 miles through the heart of the Confederacy to “enforce devastation” on the seceded states of

Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. His military “destroy[ed] mills, houses, cotton-gins,

& c.,” burned railroads and telegraph lines, and confiscated over 5,000 horses, 4,000 mules, 13,000

cattle, 10.5 million pounds of corn, and 9.5 million pounds of fodder (US War Department 1901;

Lee 1995). They were “aveng[ing] the national wrong [Southerners had committed by] dragging [the]

country into civil war” (US War Department 1901).

    How realistic was Sherman’s postwar boast that his march inflicted large damage—$100 million

in postbellumm dollars, he claimed—to economic infrastructure (Trudeau 2008, p. 539)? And how

long did the damage persist? To credibly identify Sherman’s effect, we exploit his path through



                                                 1
the South. We georeference an 1865 US War Department map of Sherman’s march and match

it to detailed county-level demographic, agricultural, and manufacturing data from US censuses,

1850--1920. As one Georgia planter put it: “I had the misfortune to be in the line of Sherman’s

march, and lost everything—Devon cows, Merino sheep, Chester hogs, Shanghai chickens, and in

fact everything but my land, my wife and children and the clothing we had at that time” (Fite

1984, p. 1). Our strategy is to compare outcomes in misfortunate counties with geographically

close and economically and demographically similar counties in the same states outside the path of

destruction, before and after the Civil War.1 This allows us to difference out the overall effects of

the war as well as the shifts in economic conditions across states.2 We show that Sherman counties

look relatively similar to non-Sherman counties in the same state among several dimensions before

the Civil War, limiting concerns of pretreatment differences or heterogeneity between affected and

unaffected counties. Further, we show throughout that that controlling non-parametrically for a

variety of 1860 county-characteristics has a limited impact on the results.

    We show that Sherman effectively devastated these counties’ postwar economies. In the agri-

cultural sector, we observe a large decline in farming economic activity, measured by farming asset

values. These results are significant both statistically and economically. For instance, by 1870, the

value of march-county farms was 20% lower than the value of non-march-county farms.3 Consistent

with this result, we also found that investments in farm land—measured by improved land—declined

following the march. Nor were these relative economic declines confined to agriculture—at least in

the medium-term. The 1860–1870 growth rates of manufacturing output, capital, employment, and

number of firms were also lower in march counties than in non-march counties. This confirms that

local entrepreneurial activity and investments were highly affected by capital destruction.

    Our results pass a series of robustness tests, strengthening our causal interpretation. We show
   1
     Throughout the paper, we refer to march and non-march counties. We define march counties as those within 5
miles on either side of Sherman’s march lines, that is, within a 10-mile buffer of the march lines. Non-march counties
are those outside of this 10-mile area but within 100 miles of the march lines. Because our specification includes
state-by-year fixed-effects, we exclude the few counties outside the three march states of Georgia, North Carolina,
and South Carolina that are within the non-march zone, including counties in Alabama, Tennessee, and Virginia. We
show that our results are robust to alternative buffer distances. We also exclude the vertex cities on the march from
our analysis: Atlanta (captured September 2, 1864), Savannah, GA (December 10, 1864), Columbia, SC (February
17, 1865), and Goldsboro, NC (March 23, 1865).
   2
     Examples of these aggregate shocks include the changes in global cotton demand and the postwar reduction in
labor supply among newly freed African Americans. Wright (1986) discusses the postwar reduction in world cotton
demand. Ransom and Sutch (2001) investigate the reduction in labor supply among newly freed African Americans.
   3
     Our findings echo diaries from along Sherman’s path. According to Rubin (2014, p. 20), one Sandersville, GA
resident lamented that people “struggled with deprivation, coping with the lack of livestock and supplies” for years.


                                                          2
that these results are not driven by differential trends across treatment in the prewar period. We

also implement an instrumental variable estimator to tackle the potential endogeneity of Sherman’s

path. Lastly, we estimate a placebo test using plausible alternative march routes not taken.4 Our

robustness results are discussed in detail in Section 5.

       Postwar underdevelopment in credit markets played an important role in explaining the extent

of the relative effects and the delay in recovery. Credit from the banking sector completely dried up

after the Civil War: we document that nearly every bank and branch in Georgia, North Carolina,

and South Carolina shut down right after the war. This lack of credit may have interfered with the

recovery process, particularly in counties hit by Sherman. We provide three main pieces of evidence

in favor of this hypothesis, using demographic data, information on local infrastructure (such as

railroads), and newly digitized data on local bank and Southern credit-market conditions. First, we

show that potential alternative mechanisms—a demographic shift or the lack of infrastructure—do

not explain the large effects of the march, even in the decade after the Civil War. Contrary to some

common beliefs about the effects of Sherman’s destruction, we find that the march did not signifi-

cantly affect the demographic patterns in affected counties. Neither whites nor African Americans

fled march counties at faster rates than they left non-march counties. In addition, infrastructure

access and investment, as measured by the number of county railroad miles in each decade from

1850–1920, was not differential across march and non-march counties.5

       Second, we find that the lack of provision of credit made the immediate recovery more difficult

in the manufacturing sector. In particular, counties that were more dependent on credit before the

war experienced slower postwar manufacturing recovery following the march. Since formal credit

markets were deeply impaired by the war, we measure dependence by looking at those counties

where companies could have more easily accessed financing in the prewar period. Specifically, we

look at counties located closer to a bank branch or where lending markets were particularly active,

proxied with the number of firms tracked in the county by Dun, Boyd, & Company, a credit-ratings

agency (Brennecke 2016; González, Marshall, and Naidu 2017). For these counties, we find much
   4
     Our baseline specification already controls for county fixed effects—which control flexibly for time-invariant
county characteristics—and state-by-year fixed effects, absorbing any time-varying shocks common to all counties
within a state. We also augment this specification with a series of pre-shock controls interacted with time dummies,
which condition our parameters to heterogeneity in observables across treatment in the prewar period.
   5
     Our results suggest that while Sherman was very successful at destroying railroads and telegraph lines along the
path of the march, that destruction was short lived. As we describe later in the paper, railroads were mostly rebuilt
by 1870 and telegraph service had been restored before the end of the war.


                                                         3
larger effects of Sherman on manufacturing activity, suggesting that credit drying up exacerbated

the recovery for businesses that were more dependent on it.6 We also show that the negative

effects of the march were much larger for industries more dependent on external finance (Rajan and

Zingales 1998). This set of results underscores the importance of finance in the recovery process

from a capital shock in the manufacturing sector.

    Third, we also provide evidence on the importance of credit-market frictions in the recovery of

the agricultural sector. As is well known, the antebellum banking sector did not serve rural and

agricultural needs, especially in the South (Fite 1984; Jaremski and Rousseau 2013; Koudijs and

Salisbury 2016; Nier 2007). Instead, many small farmers relied on country stores (Atherton 1949;

McCurry 1997; Sparks 1932; Bremer 2011) and local wealthy elites for financing between harvests

(Rajan and Ramcharan 2011; Jaremski and Fishback 2018; Martin 2016; McCurry 1997). Consistent

with this narrative, we find smaller effects of Sherman’s march in counties with a larger share of

wealthy individuals. At the same time, we also find smaller effects in counties in which country

stores—an important source of financing for small and poorer farmers—were located before the war.

    Before we conclude, we examine the persistence of the effects of the march. Overall, we find

that the contraction for manufacturing was short-lived: as soon as 1880, we see no effect on man-

ufacturing. The story for agriculture is quite different as we observe that some elements of the

decline persisted at least until 1920. While the value of farms and livestock activity recovered

within twenty years from the march, improved land remained lower in Sherman counties until 1920.

We draw two main conclusions from these mixed results. First, while the initial shock may have

been similar across sectors, recovery may depend on the context or external conditions. In our case,

the faster recovery of manufacturing may be related to the overall booming in the manufacturing

sector experienced in the United States during the post-war period. Second, even after a recovery

in prices—the value of farms and of livestock— the response to the shock may cause changes in

the institutions or organization of economic activity that persist even longer. In the case of post-

bellum Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina, that new institution was sharecropping and

tenant farming. In particular, we document that the areas affected by the shock saw a shift in the
   6
     While this credit mechanism does not require a direct negative effect of Sherman’s march on banks, it would be
reinforced by one. As we discuss later in the paper, we suspect that Sherman’s march did have a negative effect on
the banking sector. However, we consider this to be part of the overall treatment. We test the credit mechanism
using only potential treatment intensity, based on preexisting bank or credit access rather than the post-treatment
declines. However, we show results are similar when using the change in banks as treatment.

size of farms that is consistent with a rise in tenancy in response to capital destruction. While

tenancy and sharecropping—land and labor institutions that addressed the financing problems of

credit-constrained Southern landowners and newly freed labor—were common throughout our study

states (Fite 1984; Ransom and Sutch 2001; Alston and Higgs 1982), our evidence suggests that the

capital destruction may have accelerated the shift toward tenancy, and more tenancy explains the

more permanent changes in agricultural investment and land allocation in these regions, as predicted

by Jaynes (1986, p. 50).

       With this paper, we contribute to three related literatures. The first examines the effects of

capital and infrastructure destruction on economic local activity.7 Ikle (1952) studied this in the

context of the Allied bombing of German cities during World War II and found that bombed cities

rebuilt fairly quickly after the war. Davis and Weinstein (2002) similarly showed rapid postwar

reconstruction of Japanese cities destroyed during WWII. Miguel and Roland (2011) found that

Vietnamese districts severely damaged by American bombing in the late 1960s and early 1970s also

rebuilt shortly after fighting ceased. We contribute to the literature in several ways. We are the

first among these papers to examine how capital destruction affects business development across

different sectors.8 Many of the previous papers focus on population and other general demographic

variables, which may fail to capture important economic dimensions of the costs of capital destruc-

tion. Consistent with this hypothesis, our paper finds essentially no effect on population, but very

large negative effects in both the agricultural and manufacturing sector after the crisis. Further, our

analysis on the longer-run effects of the shock also provides two novel insights. First, we highlight

the importance of the economic context to assess the actual effect of a shock. As we show, the

reversal was quicker in manufacturing, an economic area that—unlike postbellum agriculture—was

experiencing high growth overall. Second, we discuss the importance of understanding how capital

shocks can change the way economic activity is organized. As we show in the paper, this institutional

shift may persist over the long-run and, consistent with the literature on the role of institutions on

growth (Dell 2010; Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson 2001), have long-run effects on growth and
   7
      In examining the effects of a large, destructive capital shock, this paper is also relevant to the literature on the
effectiveness of post-shock reconstruction plans. Recent examples in this area include the impact of the Marshall Plan
in Italy after WWII (Bianchi and Giorcelli 2018; Giorcelli 2018) and post-Katrina rebuilding plans (e.g. Gregory
2017).
    8
      In a recent working paper, Bianchi and Giorcelli (2018) study the effects of Allied bombing in Italy and also
separate effects across sectors, showing variation within agriculture depending on crop perishability.

development.

       Second, our paper provides novel evidence on the importance of finance for growth by showing

that the underdevelopment in financial markets may significantly affect the way an economy recovers

from a large shock to capital. Across manufacturing and agriculture, we find that the lack of

financing appeared to have detrimental effects on the ability to recover quickly from the shock.

Given the frequency of disasters around the world, understanding the factors that influence the

recovery process is crucial (Skidmore and Toya 2002). Previous research has shown that there

is a strong relationship between local economic activity and the condition of the financial sector

(e.g. Rajan and Zingales 1998, Petersen and Rajan 2002, Guiso, Sapienza, and Zingales 2004, Gilje

2017, and more recently in a historical context Carlson, Correia, and Luck 2019, Ziebarth 2013 and

Lee and Mezzanotti 2014). We provide direct evidence on how the condition of financial markets

may also shape the recovery from a shock. On the connection between finance and destruction,

the closest paper to us is Cortés and Strahan (2017), studying the role of multi-market banks in

reallocating credit towards affected area after Hurricane Katrina.9

       Finally, our study provides evidence of the importance of capital destruction as a new channel to

understand the effects of the Civil War on the postbellum South, a classic and long-debated question

in economic history. Goldin and Lewis (1975) estimated that the former Confederate states had a

lower per capita income than other states and that income in the South fell after the war.10 Wages

fell in the South relative to the North after the war (Margo 2002), as did output per worker in

manufacturing, driven in large part by declines in relative capital intensity (Hutchinson and Margo

2006). Goldin (1979) argues that there were three main reasons for the decline in Southern per

capita income after the War—loss of economies of scale, decline in relative demand for southern

cotton, and a decrease in ex-slave labor force participation—generally dismissing capital destruction

as a factor.11 If capital destruction played any role in the stagnation of the postbellum Southern
   9
      Both our credit channel mechanisms and our long run effect of Sherman’s March through agricultural institu-
tional change, also complement more recent work in economic history, that studies how emancipation affected the
Southern financial system. Slave wealth was a frequent source of collateral (Martin 2010, 2016) and emancipation
both eliminated slaves as an asset and made any lending-management practices backed by slave finance obsolete.
González, Marshall, and Naidu (2017) found that slave owners were more likely than wealthy non-slave owners to
start businesses before emancipation but not afterward.
   10
      In 1860, prior to the start of the war, the Confederate states produced 38% of total US agricultural output and 8%
of national manufacturing output. By 1870, however, even after four years of postwar recovery, Southern agricultural
output remained below its prewar level in absolute terms and made up only 28% of the US total. Similarly, Southern
manufacturing lagged behind the rest of the nation, making up only 5% of national output in 1870.
   11
      On the decrease in labor force participation, Ransom and Sutch (2001) argued this decline was driven by a


                                                           6
economy, then it would most likely arise in the areas Sherman destroyed. Not only does our research

design, focusing on local economic activity during and after the Civil War by comparing neighboring

counties, enable us to difference out many of the confounding effects in prior work and, in turn,

isolate the costs of destruction during war. But more, our findings suggest that capital destruction

was a clear cost of the war in the South and mattered to weak postbellum economic development.

Finally, our study provides novel evidence on the development of sharecropping and farm tenancy

in the postbellum South (Shlomowitz 1979; Alston and Higgs 1982; Ransom and Sutch 2001; Fite

1984), suggesting an important role for wartime capital destruction—combined with the general

scarcity of capital in the postbellum South—in the adoption of the practice.12

      The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 reviews the history of Sherman’s

March. Section 3 describes the historical data we draw on, including the march map, census of pop-

ulation and manufactures data, and two measures of local credit markets in the postbellum South.

Section 4 details our identification strategy. Section 5 presents results. Section 6 examines mecha-

nisms, focusing on the role of credit markets in the recovery. Section 7 examines the persistence of

results. Section 8 concludes.

2     Sherman’s March and Reconstruction

2.1     The March: Historical Background

As the American Civil War progressed into 1864 and Union General Ulysses S. Grant plotted the

destruction of Confederate armies in Virginia, his colleague, General William Sherman, trained

his sights on the destruction of the Confederate economy and infrastructure (Trudeau 2008, p.

40). Sherman had just finished the successful Atlanta Campaign, a collection of skirmishes from
reduction in labor supply among newly freed African Americans, while Margo (2002) suggested the participation
rate decline was also due to a decrease in labor demand, not an independent shift in supply. Wright (1986), on
the other hand, claimed that a postwar reduction in world cotton demand—the South’s staple cash crop—hurt the
Southern economy most. Temin (1976) attempted to reconcile these explanations in light of the finding by Fogel and
Engerman (1974) that plantation agriculture was more productive, making the loss of economies of scale argument.
More recently, Khan (2015) showed that the misallocation of resources during the war due to declining geographic
mobility and increasing payoffs to military technologies was short-lived and did not inhibit the long-term capacity of
technological progress.
   12
      Related to our work, two recent papers study the effects of emancipation as a wealth shock and trace the effects
on intergenerational mobility from the antebellum to postbellum South (Ager, Boustan, and Eriksson 2019; Dupont
and Rosenbloom 2016). Ager, Boustan, and Eriksson (2019) argue that while emancipation reduced the wealth of the
richest slaveholders in 1870, their sons recovered their wealth and occupational status by 1880. Using the Sherman’s
March geographic data we collected for this paper, Ager, Boustan, and Eriksson (2019) also show that the negative
effects on wealth in 1870 are significantly larger for wealthy household heads in Sherman’s path compared to similar
household heads in Georgia counties outside Sherman’s path, with differences in wealth in 1870 as large as 40 log
points.

Chattanooga, TN through northwest Georgia during the late spring and summer of 1864, which

culminated in Atlanta’s capture on September 2, 1864. In Chattanooga he had fought with Confed-

erate armies led by Joseph E. Johnston and later John B. Hood. Though bloody—with 4,423 Union

dead and 3,044 Confederate dead—the Atlanta Campaign was a conventional operation for its time

with the two armies fighting one another in large and small battles. For his next act, Sherman had

something else in mind: he planned to “enforce devastation” on the Southern states by “destroy[ing]

mills, houses, cotton-gins, &c.,” burning railroads and telegraph lines, and confiscating livestock

and crops.13 He wrote to Grant specifically of plans to “break roads and do irreparable damage” to

the Southern transportation network (Carr 2015, p. 55).

    According to Civil War historians, Sherman used the prewar 1860 US Census of Agriculture to

carry out this mission (Trudeau 2008; Rubin 2014). He mapped out a march path that traversed the

agriculturally richest counties in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina while still following

Grant’s orders to capture the important Southern cities of Atlanta and Savannah, Georgia, and

Columbia, South Carolina. Writing in December 1864, Sherman recalled how he “had the [1860]

census statistics showing the produce of every county through which [he] desired to pass” and that

he would destroy those counties most abundant in agriculture. “No military expedition was ever

based on sounder or surer data,” he remarked (Trudeau 2008, p. 538).

    Based on our analysis of the 1860 Census of Agriculture, Sherman hit counties with a lot of

railroad infrastructure to destroy and with large plantations, though differences in agricultural

production fade when we compare within the three states. Figure 1 details the routes each of

Sherman’s forces traveled. The Union Army started in Atlanta and moved southeast to Savannah

after several feints toward Macon and Augusta. Following the capture of Savannah, Sherman’s forces

marched north, through inland South Carolina to Columbia. The final drive took the army northeast

before defeating the only Confederate army remaining in the Carolinas near Goldsboro, North

Carolina.14 In Table 1, we see that in 1860, the counties in Sherman’s path—those counties inside

     Goldsboro was a minor railroad connection that Sherman targeted once his army began marching through North
Carolina (Angley, Cross, and Hill 1995, p. 35). From March 19 to 21, 1865, the final fights of the campaign took
place in Bentonville, 20 miles from Goldsboro. Sherman arrived in Goldsboro on March 23, 1865. From that point
on, his army was supplied by rail from the north, ending the most destructive aspects of the campaign. Grant wrote
to Sherman on April 8, telling him that “the confederate armies were the only strategic points at which to strike.”
(Barrett 1956, p. 198-199).

a ten-mile band of the main route shown in Figure 1—were more intensively active in agriculture.

Demographically, the counties Sherman hit were more populous, but not denser or more urban,

and even the raw population differences fade when we include state fixed effects (column 4). We

find that the Sherman counties produced more agricultural output and included farms that were

relatively more valuable, though again these differences fade with state fixed effects. At the same

time, consistent with the historical evidence, we do not find any difference in terms of manufacturing

activity, which overall was low across this whole region. Overall, while Sherman counties do not

appear to be identical to non-Sherman counties, these results show that accounting for across-

state variation, the differences in observable characteristics are relatively modest. In Section 4, we

discuss how our research design accounts for underlying differences in the march and non-march

counties, including the use of flexible controls and with a differences-in-differences strategy, as well

as instrumenting for Sherman’s final path.

                                             [Figure 1 about here.]

                                              [Table 1 about here.]


       Based on his planning, Sherman undertook his march and wreaked substantial destruction. He

officially assigned more than 3,000 infantrymen each day to “foraging.” Another 3,000 likely joined

in on many occasions, placing the true number closer to 6,000.15 The men destroyed hundreds of

businesses, homes, farms, railroad lines, and telegraph lines, and expropriated over 5,000 horses,

4,000 mules, 13,000 cattle, 10.5 million pounds of corn, and 9.5 million pounds of fodder.16

       Sherman’s men were not the only ones causing damage along the march path. Confederate

General Joseph Wheeler and his cavalry corps—the main Confederate opposition to Sherman in

Georgia and the Carolinas—were also under strict orders from their superiors to “destroy everything

from which the enemy might derive sustenance” (Trudeau 2008, p. 85) and “felled trees [and] burned

bridges” (Barrett 1956, p. 50). In addition, Wheeler’s cavalry requisitioned mules and horses and
  15
     Sherman issued orders regulating the destruction of property and foraging, but likely understood that not all of
the regulations would be followed. For example, while many of the fires he ordered were managed by the Union Army
Corp of Engineers, the controlled blazes often inspired infantrymen to set their own fires, which frequently grew out
of hand and engulfed whole sections of towns (Trudeau 2008, p. 128, 543). In addition, while soldiers often offered to
pay for their takings, the payments were frequently made in Confederate greybacks, which were not highly valuable
by 1864 due to the Confederate government’s large-scale printing efforts, and by war’s end were of no value.

“burn[ed] up all the corn and fodder” (Glass Campbell 2006, p. 10). So severe was Wheeler in

carrying out the orders that one Confederate officer remarked that “the whole of Georgia is full of

bitter complaints of Wheeler’s cavalry” (Bearss 1991, p. 127). Confederate General Beauregard too

ordered his Georgia forces to “obstruct and destroy all roads in Sherman’s front, flank, and rear...”

(Trudeau 2008, p. 128).

       This destruction along the march path marked the first time the war had meaningfully visited

Georgia and the Carolinas (Carr 2015, p. 134). Previously, the only military actions seen in those

states were the few shots fired at Fort Sumter, South Carolina, to start the war, a union blockade of

the ports, and some minor skirmishes in North Carolina. The larger battles, city sieges, and troop

movements had taken place farther north or west.17 Noticing the relatively untouched countryside

in the area prior to the 1864 march, one Minnesota soldier among Sherman’s infantrymen wrote that

“this part of Georgia [had] never realized what war was until we came through on this expedition”

(Trudeau 2008, p. 526). A Hillsboro, Georgia native remarked similarly that only when Sherman

marched had the “beloved [Georgia] country [been left] to desolation and ruin” (Trudeau 2008, p.

175). Even foreign observers remarked on the novelty of war to the region: writing a travelogue

through the postbellum South, an English Member of Parliament recalled that Sherman marched

“through States which had never had the war brought home to them, or even seen the blue uniform

of their Yankee foes” (Kennaway 1867, p. 26). Sherman’s destruction extended even to paperwork:

in a study of bankruptcy cases in postbellum South Carolina, Thompson (2004) describes several

claimants blaming Sherman for destroying their records and complicating the unwinding of debt

obligations.

2.2      Reconstruction

Even before the end of the Civil War, planning for the reconstruction and reintegration of the

South into the Union was underway. Reconstruction, dated by historians as from 1863 to 1877, was

overseen by Presidents Lincoln, Johnson, and Grant, as well as the Republican Congress.

       While rebuilding of the national railroad infrastructure was a postbellum priority, few other

Reconstruction policies were focused on physical reconstruction. No attempts were made to pay back
  17
    Before Sherman’s army departed Atlanta on November 15, 1864, there had only been 36 fighting events in Georgia,
North Carolina, or South Carolina, compared to 294 in all other states. Moreover, only 8 of the battles had had more
than 500 total casualties. The median total casualties for Civil War fighting events in all states was 513.




                                                        10
private property owners whose capital had been destroyed during the war.18 Nor was compensation

offered to former slave owners of the Confederacy, as had been common in past emancipation

of slaves elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere (Goldin 1973). Though cotton factors and other

Southern interest groups proposed congressional aid and loan packages and corresponded about

large-scale financing with some Northern and European firms and individuals, nothing came of

these efforts. “[B]y and large the federal government offered little financial aid...” and “[n]either

government aid nor large-scale, long-term private loans on the pattern envisioned by the Cotton

Planters’ Association were forthcoming, despite the obvious need and repeated pleas by Southern

leaders. . . ” (Woodman 1999, p. 251, 253).

    Instead, Reconstruction focused on the reintegration of the South into the nation and the legal

revolution that ultimately granted citizenship and de jure rights to the formerly enslaved African-

American population.19 Along with constitutional amendments abolishing slavery, guaranteeing

citizenship, and granting the right to vote, Congress enacted several statutes enabling Reconstruc-

tion. The creation of the Freedmen’s Bureau, the federal agency tasked by Congress with transi-

tioning former slaves into freedom, involved starting schools for both children and adults, as well as

provision of food and medical care to newly freed African Americans. The Freedman’s Saving and

Trust Company, also known as the Freedman’s Savings Bank, was chartered in 1865. It made loans

to African-American veterans and newly freed slaves (Stein and Yannelis 2019). Directly relevant

to our identification strategy is that we have not found any qualitative historical evidence of Recon-

struction varying in implementation or focus—from the location of Freedmen’s Bureau schools or

Freedman’s banks, to the protection or enforcement of constitutional amendments—across Sherman

march and non-march counties.20
  18
     Even Thaddeus Stevens, the powerful Radical Republican congressman from Pennsylvania, could not extract
repayment for destruction. An iron foundry he owned near Caledonia, PA was destroyed by a raid led by Confederate
General Jubal Early, an uncompensated loss Stevens later estimated at $50,000 (Egerton 2014, p. 212–213).
  19
     Logan (2018) estimates the effects of black politicians elected during Reconstruction on taxation and public
spending. The new rights of the formerly enslaved were largely stripped at the end of the Reconstruction period
when the planter class regained power in the South (Naidu 2010).
  20
     Bolder plans for a more radical Reconstruction, such as Thaddeus Stevens’ call to confiscate the landholdings
of the 70,000 largest Southern landowners and use the proceeds to give land to the formerly enslaved, pay veterans’
pensions, and pay off the national debt, were not enacted (Jaynes 1986, p. 10).

3        Historical Data

To investigate the economic effects of the war on march counties relative to non-march counties, we

gather historical data from several sources.

         To start, we classify counties’ march status using the 1865 War Department map of Sherman’s

troop movements, shown in Figure 1. In the map, each line indicates the center of march lines for

each of five Sherman military units: the Right Wing (the 13th and 17th Army Corps), the Left

Wing (the 19th and 20th Army Corps), and the Cavalry. We digitally trace each of these lines

and consider as “march” counties all counties within five miles on either side of a line. Non-march

counties are those outside this 10-mile-wide band, but within 100 miles of the lines and located in

Georgia, North Carolina, or South Carolina. Figure 2 shows the march and non-march counties in

our sample. We select five miles as our primary march bandwidth based on historical accounts that

the marching soldiers and foragers did not stray far from the main body of the army (Trudeau 2008,

p. 234). Our results are robust to alternative march-distance definitions, as shown in Appendix

Section A.21

                                            [Figure 2 about here.]

         Second, we gather economic and demographic county-level data before and after the march from

the US censuses of 1850-1920. Haines (2010) provides decadal, county-level, agricultural production

and asset value data, as well as demographic information for each county, from the Census of

Population, the Census of Agriculture, and the Census of Manufactures. Newly digitized versions

of the Census of Manufactures report manufacturing data at the county-by-industry level in 1860,

1870, and 1880 (Lee 2015b). From both sources, we extract data pertaining to the counties in the

states of Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. County-level data are standardized to 1860

county borders, using the county-intersection procedure described in Hornbeck (2010).

         Because the 1870 census data were collected in a South that was still recovering from the

Civil War, one might worry about data quality. In particular, it would be problematic if under-

enumeration in march counties were more severe than in non-march counties.22 Heterogeneity in
    21
     Given the high variation in quality of contemporary maps, the troops assigned to forage may have occasionally
done so farther than 5 miles from the main line of the army. In the Appendix, we also show robustness to various
definitions of the control county set.
  22
     See Steckel (1991) and King and Magnuson (1995) on under-enumeration in historical census data generally. Reid



                                                        12
data quality across treatment could potentially bias our results in an unknown direction, affecting

the reliability of our estimates.

    We use data on contemporary marriage records to show that data quality does not seem to be

different across treatment and control counties in the census. Specifically, we test whether men

who appear in county marriage records in Georgia and North Carolina, two of our sample states,

between 1868 and 1872 are differentially likely to also appear in the 1870 census based on whether

the men were married in a march county or a non-march county.23 Table A.1 shows the match rates

for each state and county type, finding no difference across treatment. This suggests that there was

not differential under-enumeration across march and non-march counties and allays our concerns

about comparing census outcomes across the two groups of counties.

    To investigate the mechanisms behind any march and non-march differences, we augment the

Haines (2010) demographic information with three other data sets. The first are infrastructure

data from Donaldson and Hornbeck (2016) based on Atack, Bateman, Haines, and Margo (2010):

decadal railroad maps that indicate the exact location of all railroad lines from 1850 through 1920.

We intersect these railroad lines with 1860 US county boundaries to calculate the number of railroad-

track miles in each county in each decade.

    The second two data sources used to consider the mechanisms driving our results are local credit

data from a pair of newly digitized sources. We hand-collect bank-level entries in two Merchants

& Bankers Registers, 1859 and 1864, and firm-level records from Dun, Boyd, & Company’s The

Mercantile Agency’s 1860 Reference Book.24 The bank registries provide the name, capitalization

amount, and county of location for the approximately 1,800 state- and nationally-chartered US

banks in 1859 and 1864.25 The Dun, Boyd, & Company book lists all firms tracked by this credit-

rating firm based in New York as of 1860. For each firm, the book lists the name, city, and three

credit ratings. In various formats, historical DB data have recently been used by several papers in
(1995) documents under-enumeration in the 1870 census in North Carolina of African Americas, particularly union
veterans.
   23
      The 1868–1872 county marriage records were digitized by the genealogical website FamilySearch.org. The mar-
riage records are collected locally by state and county governments, which contrasts with the census data collected
by federal agents. Marriage records from South Carolina have not been digitized; Koudijs and Salisbury (2016) face
similar data restrictions. The name matching procedure follows the machine learning approach to record linkage
developed in Feigenbaum (2016).
   24
      The bank registries were scanned by the University of Wisconsin. We digitized them into a machine-readable,
manipulable format.
   25
      The banks in 1859 were only state-chartered, as national-charter banks were not authorized until after the
National Banking Act of 1863 (Jaremski 2013).


                                                        13
economic history and finance (Brennecke 2016; González, Marshall, and Naidu 2017).26 We match

the city of each firm to an 1860 county and calculate the number of credit-tracked firms in each

county. The bank and DB data proxy for different types of local credit availability before the march,

allowing us to shed light on the importance of credit in driving our results. Following the historical

arguments about the important role of country stores and local merchants in antebellum Southern

credit markets in Koudijs and Salisbury (2016), we also collect census data on country stores from

the 1840 census.

4        Identification Strategy

Sherman’s objective was to “enforce devastation” on the South; our objective is to measure how effec-

tive and persistent Sherman’s devastation was, estimating the direct effect of the capital destruction

caused by Sherman’s march on the local economy. We begin our analysis by comparing agricultural

and manufacturing outcomes before and after the march, across march and non-march counties.

Depending on the outcome type, this differences-in-differences fixed effect approach produces our

two primary estimating equations.

         We start by looking at the agricultural sector using county level data. Initially, we focus on the

medium-run impact of the shock (1850-1890), but in our final section, we test for the presence of

longer-term effects using data through 1920. We focus on two sets of variables. First, we look at the

effect of the march on the economic value of farming activities, measured by the value of the farms

and the value of livestock. Second, we examine the role of the march in affecting the investment in

farming land. In line with previous work (e.g. Hornbeck 2010), we proxy investment with the share

of land improved for farming.27 We estimate the following specification:



                                  Ycst = βt 1[Sherman]c +δc +δst +Xc θt +cst                                      (1)
    26
     Brennecke (2016) provides a very detailed explanation of the data, the way they were collected, and the general
business model of Dun, Boyd, & Company around this period.
  27
     The Census of Agriculture defines improved acres of farmland as land in farms cleared for tillage, grazing, grass,
or lying fallow; unimproved areas are defined as uncultivated land connected to farms, including both fertile and waste
acres. This measure is consistently employed across the 1850–1920 US Censuses of Agriculture. For an extensive
discussion on the role and determinants of improved land in the South around the Civil War, see the work by Majewski
and Tchakerian (2007). We define share of land improved for farming as the acres improved in census year t scaled
by the farmland area in the county in 1860. We scale improved acreage so that the units are easy to understand
and in accord with Table 1 but fix the denominator as farmland 1860 so that the denominator is not determined
by Sherman’s March. In practice, the county fixed effects make scaling irrelevant in the regressions and results are
numerically identical to using unscaled improved land.




                                                          14
where Ycst is agricultural outcome Y in county c and state s at time t, 1[Sherman]c is an indicator

equal to 1 if county c is within five miles of any Sherman’s march line, δc are county fixed effects,

δst are state-by-year fixed effects, Xc are non-parametric controls for 1860 county characteristics in-

teracted with year indicators, and cst is the error term. We interact the Sherman’s march indicator

with a full set of year-indicator variables—excluding 1860—to estimate the difference in the out-

comes between the march and non-march counties in each year, relative to the year 1860 difference.

Our sample includes all counties within 100 miles of any march line.28 Negative estimates of βt

for t > 1860 indicate lower agricultural outcomes in march counties relative to non-march counties

following the war. Standard errors are always clustered at county-level.

       There are three important elements of this specification. First, the county fixed effects controls

flexibly for time-invariant county characteristics such as the quality of soil, climate, or latitude and

longitude. Second, the state-by-year fixed effects absorb any time-varying shocks common to all

counties within a state such as changes in the demand for cotton, state-specific business cycles, or

changes in state policy. Third, on top of our baseline results, we augment this main specification

with a set of control variables that account for the heterogeneity in county characteristics in 1860.

We use these controls to absorb the cross-county variation across treatment that was presented

in Section 2 based on Sherman’s planning of the path. In particular, we control for size of the

county, measured in square miles; population; size of the agricultural output; and intensity in cotton

production (Bleakley and Lin 2012, Donaldson and Hornbeck 2016), share of plantation farms,

share of manufacturing employment, slave intensity, and railroads per squared acres in 1860.29 To

avoid imposing a specific parametric relationship between the 1860 county characteristics and the

changes in economic activity, we control for each of these characteristics by dividing the sample in

four quartiles and interacting these quartile indicators with year-dummies.30 As we discuss in the

results section, our findings generally suggest that the addition of these controls has little effect on
  28
      Our sample only includes counties in the three states where Sherman marched because, with state-by-time fixed
effects, we need within-state variation in the treatment to estimate Sherman effects.
   29
      In the main analyses, this means the set of counties that are 100 miles from the march and are in North Carolina,
South Carolina, and Georgia. We define the intensity in cotton production as the dollar value of ginned cotton
production per total farming acres; a plantation farm as a farm with more than one hundred slaves in 1860; and slave
intensity as the average number of slave per farm. More discussion on the variable construction is provided in the
data section.
   30
      The only exception to this procedure is the variable measuring railroads, which is highly skewed, with many
zero, and therefore for which constructing four quartiles would not be possible. For this variable, we simply split the
sample at the first quartile.



                                                          15
our estimates, in particular in the medium-run.31

       For manufacturing, our production, capital, revenue, and employment data are more detailed

and we observe outcomes at the industry, county, and year levels in the decennial censuses of

1860, 1870, and 1880. To take advantage of this rich industry-level data, we also consider an

alternative empirical specification. We estimate a collapsed difference-in-difference model, where

we compare the 1860-1870 growth rate of manufacturing outcomes at industry level across march

and non-march counties. Using the data at industry-county level allows us to control for time-

varying industry shocks in the South, as well as the level of county development in manufacturing.

Furthermore, collapsing the outcome makes it easier to accommodate the different data structure

and therefore avoid a large number of missing values that the previous log-level specification would

entail, particularly in the postbellum period. The specification is:



                           ∆Ycg(i)s,1870−1860 = βM 1[Sherman]c +δg(i) +δs +Xc +c                                      (2)

       where Ycg(i)s is the percentage change between 1870–1860 in manufacturing outcome Y in county

c, industry group g(i), where i denotes industry, and state s, 1[Sherman]c is an indicator equal to 1

if county c is within five miles of any Sherman’s march line, and c is the error term.32 Furthermore,

we augment this specification with industry-group fixed effects δg(i) and state fixed effects δs .33

The industry-group fixed effects control flexibly for industry-group characteristics such as demand.

The state fixed effects absorb any shocks common to all counties within a state such as changes in

the state-specific business cycles or state policy changes. Exactly like in the previous specification,

we also control for county-specific 1860 characteristics. The sample is again all counties within

100 miles of any march line. Negative estimates of βM indicate lower manufacturing growth rates

in march counties relative to non-march counties from 1860 to 1870. Standard errors are always

clustered at county-level.
  31
      As presented in previous versions of the paper, the results are similar if we control for 1860 county characteristics
using continuous controls.
   32
      Growth rates are winsorized at 1% at each tail.
   33
      The industry group is generated using the industry groupings introduced in the Census of Manufactures in 1900.
These groupings were precursors to the Standard Industrial Classification 2-digit groupings, which were introduced
in the Census of Manufactures in 1939. To apply these year 1900 groupings to the 1860 to 1880 data, we convert all
1860 to 1880 industry classifications into year 1900 industry classifications. The procedure we use for the conversion
is based on Lee (2015a). We also run these regressions excluding the pre-march, 1860 county controls, Xc . The
results are robust to the more parsimonious specification.



                                                            16
5        Sherman and Economic Activity

Using the empirical setting discussed in the previous section, we demonstrate how the destruction

unleashed on Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina by Sherman’s March harmed both

agriculture and manufacturing in the medium-run, including large decreases in values in 1870. We

also show the robustness of these results, employing an instrument for the march path, estimating

null effects on placebo marches, and varying our treatment and control bandwidths.

5.1        Main Analyses

Comparing march to non-march counties using our differences-in-differences specification, we find

economically large and statistically significant post-march differences among agricultural outcomes.

Table 2 shows the results. After the march, the value of farming activities and investment in

agriculture declined substantially. Our results show that the value of farms and livestock declined

by 20% and 14% respectively. We also find that march counties experienced a significant drop in

the amount of improved land, which in 1870 declined almost 15% more in affected counties relative

to the control group. These findings are similar across the specifications with and without controls.

Overall, this analysis shows that the capital destruction caused by Sherman’s march substantially

affected the local agricultural economy, with the effects still visible in 1870, six years later.34


                                             [Table 2 about here.]


         Importantly, these results are not driven by differential trends across treatment before the march.

In each specification, we also estimate the “effect” on agricultural outcomes in 1850 relative to the

base year 1860. Across the outcomes, we find that the 1850 effect is both non-significant and small

in economic magnitude. These results provide reassuring evidence on the quality of our empirical

model. In the post-1870 period, our results suggest some persistence of the march’s effects. However,

this evidence is statistically weaker and varies across outcome measures. We will investigate the

long-run persistence of the shock in the second half of the paper; for now, we focus on the evidence

in Table 2 that Sherman had a large medium-run effect on agriculture activity.
    34
    These negative results are consistent with the historical record. In the immediate antebellum period, farming
was done with “Sherman horses,” the old, “sore-backed” and “abused” animals the Union Army had swapped for fresh
rides along the path of the march (Rubin 2014, p. 50-51).




                                                       17
      Turning to data on postbellum manufacturing, we gauge how the march also reduced manufac-

turing activity. As a first step, we analyze county manufacturing aggregates in Table 3, using the

same exact methodology that we employed for agriculture. While we are constrained slightly by

the limited nature of the 1850 Census of Manufactures, we observe declines in employment, capital,

manufacturing establishments, and production in the Sherman counties after the war, echoing our

agricultural findings.35 However, while these results are all relatively large, they are quite imprecise.

We find a highly significant effect of the march only when looking at capital, which declined 30%

more than in non-Sherman counties. The magnitude of the effects are similar across other outcomes,

but the estimates tend to be statistically non-significant.

      We believe that this lack of statistical precision can be explained by three key facets of the county-

aggregated manufacturing data. First, in the 19th century there was a great deal of heterogeneity

in manufacturing specialization across counties. In our data, very few counties specialized in the

same set of industries. Second, the period around the Civil War was characterized by a lot of

transformation in the manufacturing sector (Engerman 1966). Third, demand dynamics may also

have played an important role, as the war itself led to an increase in demand for certain industries

while impairing others. This heterogeneity across industries—even if unrelated to the location of

Sherman’s march—may increase the noise in the data and could therefore make it harder to detect

march effects in aggregate data.


                                               [Table 3 about here.]


      To overcome these limitations, we have collected county-by-industry data at the decade level for

1860, 1870, and 1880 that enable us to account for any such county and industry heterogeneity, in-

cluding time-varying industry shocks or variation across counties in manufacturing specialization.36

Using these county-by-industry data, we examine the differential growth rates from 1860 to 1870

along four manufacturing outcomes for march and non-march counties in Table 4. Overall, we find

that the number of establishments grew substantially more slowly in march counties than in non-

march counties following the war, as did value added, employment and capital. These results are

large in magnitude: for instance, in the baseline specification, Sherman counties experienced about
 35
      Establishment data are not available for 1850.
 36
      The growth rates are winsorized at 1% to reduce the impact of outliers in our analysis.



                                                          18
a 50% lower establishment and employment growth relative to non-Sherman counties. While this

effect is large in absolute terms, the magnitude should be considered within the context of the South-

ern manufacturing sector between 1860 and 1880, decades characterized by large transformations

and, in some counties, rapid growth. The addition of county-level controls does not qualitatively

impact our results. Moreover, as with the agricultural results, these differences in manufacturing

growth rates were not simply the result of pre-march trends, as we find no difference in aggregate

manufacturing growth.37


                                             [Table 4 about here.]


      We also see substantial declines in the lumber industry in Sherman counties, a geographically

common industry explicitly targeted by Sherman’s troops because of its importance to the war

effort. We are able to measure these lumber industry effects because our data is at the county by

industry level. Prior to the march, 75% of the counties in the sample had at least one sawmill

or lumber establishment, making the industry the most geographically prevalent manufacturing

industry in the data. We find suggestive evidence of relative declines in lumber, even with far fewer

observations than in our county-by-industry growth-rate analysis.38 Table A.2 indicates that both

capital and the number of establishments among lumber mills in march counties grew 50% more

slowly than it did in non-march counties between 1860 and 1870. Value added and employment

also grew more slowly, but the coefficients on these effects are less precisely estimated.

      Overall, the capital destruction following General Sherman’s march led to a strong contraction

in land values, agricultural investments, and manufacturing output. These effects are not driven by

differential trends in economic outcomes across march and non-march counties. Sherman succeeded

in bringing destruction to the parts of the South through which he marched, and the economic

effects of the march were still evident more than five years afterwards.

5.2     Robustness

In this section, we provide three main robustness tests to our results. First, we employ an in-

strumental variable estimator to address the potential endogeneity of the march path. Second, we
  37
     We do not have data at the industry level prior to 1860; therefore this pre-trend test can only be performed at
the aggregate manufacturing sector level and not by industry-group.
  38
     Sherman also targeted the pine forests and resin pits in the Carolinas, the main inputs for the large South
Carolina turpentine and tar industries (Carr 2015, p. 91).


                                                        19
create placebo marches, connecting other large cities in the South to ensure that our results are not

driven by a county’s geographic position relative to urban areas. In both cases, the robustness tests

support our argument: the instrumental variables estimates largely confirm our main results and

the placebo marches show no effects. Third, we show that the results are similar across different

definitions of treatment and control groups.

5.2.1      Robustness: Instrumental Variables Estimator

Sherman’s path was not a random walk. As historians have documented—and as we confirmed—the

course was plotted based on available economic data from the 1860 census. Even if the selection we

have documented would likely work against our findings, we are still concerned about endogeneity.

One worry would be that some unmeasured, time-varying county characteristic was correlated with

the path Sherman took and explains our results. Our inclusion in the main specification of both

county fixed effects and state-by-decade fixed effects, as well as flexible controls based on variables

measured in 1860, makes this unlikely, but it cannot rule this possibility out.

       To assuage these concerns, we instrument for Sherman’s march path with the straight-line path

between the vertices of the actual march. To replicate the approximate width of the march, we

define as treated any county within 15 miles of the straight line between the march vertices.39

Sherman was specifically targeting the main cities—Atlanta, Savannah, and Columbia—but many

of the counties between these cities were likely hit only because they happened to be on the way.40

This instrument is likely to satisfy the standard exclusion restrictions: counties between these cities

should not be expected to have grown less quickly but for Sherman destroying many of them during

the war. The F-stat on the first stage is 126.4, suggesting that although Sherman took deviations

from the straight line, particularly when approaching the coastal area, the path of the march can

roughly be approximated by a straight line between the main cities.

       Overall, this straight-line IV analysis bolsters the findings of our main estimates: Sherman’s

march had large, negative economic effects on both agriculture and manufacturing. The results,
  39
      In the main results, we defined as treated any counties within five miles on either side of one of Sherman’s units’
march lines. However, because the march was undertaken by five units (the 13th and 17th Army Corps in the Right
Wing, the 19th and 20th Army Corps in the Left Wing, and Kilpartick’s Cavalry), to replicate the effective width of
the true treatment with the straight-line instrument, we expand the treatment radius to be 15 miles on either side of
the line.
   40
      Exactly because of our endogeneity concerns about the cities, these three cities are dropped from all analyses, as
is Goldsboro, the town where the march ended after the Confederate opposition surrendered. These exclusions do
not affect the results.


                                                           20
which are shown in Tables A.3 for agriculture and A.4 for manufacturing, are similar in sign and

magnitude to the OLS results in Tables 2 and 4, though they are less precise. This analysis confirms

our main result.

5.2.2      Robustness: Placebo March

As a second robustness test, we develop placebo march lines to show that differences in postbel-

lum economic responses across counties lying between cities and counties not between cities cannot

explain our results. While the straight-line instrument addresses the concern that an unmeasured,

time-varying county characteristics correlated with the path Sherman chose could explain the dif-

ferential postwar agricultural and manufacturing outcomes, this placebo test exploits inevitable

variation across counties that are located between the major cities compared with the rest of the

sample. This is problematic if these counties are exposed to different shocks in the postbellum

economy because of their special location between major economic hubs.

       To implement this robustness test, we construct all possible comparable march paths in the

Confederacy outside Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina.41 The straight-line distance

from Atlanta to Savannah is 270 miles; Savannah to Columbia is 164 miles. In this spirit, we create

all possible connections of three Confederate cities—defined as counties with more than 2000 urban

residents in 1860—where each line segment is between 100 and 300 miles. Excluding paths through

the three Sherman states, there are 852 paths, many in Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi, and

others in Virginia. We then define treatment and control indicators in the usual way for straight-

line marches—treatment for counties within 15 miles of the paths, controls counties within 100

miles—and estimate separate regressions for each placebo path, echoing the form of equation (1).

       We plot the distribution of t-statistics from the effect of these placebo marches in 1870 against

the Sherman t-statistics from Table 2 in Figure 3. In all six specifications, the Sherman t-statistic is

smaller (more negative) than 95% of the placebo marches; in five of the six it is smaller than 97.7% of

the placebos.42 No placebo march has more negative t-statistics than we found for Sherman’s march
  41
      We avoid placebo paths through the three Sherman states to preclude historically destroyed counties and their
neighbors from being in the placebo sample at all.
   42
      In a corresponding analysis for the manufacturing results in Table 3, we find fewer than 2% of placebo marches
yield t-statistics as negative as those of Sherman’s effect on capital in columns 3 and 4. For employment, establish-
ments, and the value of production, in five of six specifications fewer than 15% of placebo marches yield as negative
t-statistics as the real Sherman’s march but because we do not find a statistically significant effect of Sherman on
these outcomes in this specification, it is not surprising that the placebo march analyses for those outcomes are less
compelling.


                                                         21
in all six specifications and only ten placebo marches are smaller in three or more specifications.

                                        [Figure 3 about here.]

5.2.3   Robustness: Different Treatment Definitions

Lastly, we also show that our results are not driven by the specific definition of treatment and

control counties that we use in our main results. As discussed before, our main results consider as

treated the counties within 5 miles of Sherman’s march and as a control those within 100 miles.

The treatment bandwidth is based on the historical record: Sherman’s troops could only “forage”

so far away from the relative safety of the main army. We chose the 100-mile control bandwidth

as a reasonable tradeoff between including more counties from Georgia, North Carolina, and South

Carolina and not including counties in those states that were very different from the counties

Sherman laid to waste. In Figure 4a, we test the robustness of our bandwidth choices by presenting

estimates of the 1870 effect of the march across different treatment definitions—5, 10, 15, 20, and 25

miles—keeping the control group constant. We find that these alternative definitions of treatment

provide very similar results, both statistically and economically. For instance, the estimates using 10

miles are always indistinguishable from the 5-mile results across all the main agricultural outcomes.

However, as we use a broader definition of treatment, we tend to find smaller and less significant

results. In fact, this finding is reassuring about our identification: as we increase the bandwidth

for the treatment, we are bundling together both counties that were struck by Sherman with areas

that were most likely unaffected.

   We also show that our control-bandwidth choice is not driving our findings in Figure 4b. We

repeat the same procedure as above, but keeping the treatment definition as constant (at 5 miles)

and changing the control. Specifically, we consider bandwidths of 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, and 150 miles

as potential control groups. Again, we find similar results: the point estimates of our 1870 Sherman

effects are extremely stable across specifications. The effects are generally less precisely estimated

when we employ a very tight control group—25 or 50 miles—reflecting both the small sample size

and the possible contamination of treatment into the control counties.

                                        [Figure 4 about here.]

   Overall, these robustness tests increase our confidence that the relative declines we detect in

Sherman counties were indeed due to the destructive path of Sherman’s march. In the Appendix,

                                                  22
we also show that the results on manufacturing, presented originally in Table 4, are robust to

alternative treatment and control bandwidth definitions (Figure A.2), though the estimates are a

bit more stable when varying control distance rather than treatment definitions.

6   The Role of Credit Markets in the Extent of Capital Devastation

The capital destruction caused by Sherman’s march had strong negative effects: the march led to

a contraction in investments and asset prices in the agricultural sector and a reduction in manu-

facturing growth in the decade after the war. At least in part, economic activity appeared to have

recovered by 1880 or 1890—within twenty or thirty years from the march. Overall, these results

confirm that the effects of capital destruction may generate large medium-run costs for an economy.

    The previous literature in this area has devoted little attention to understanding factors that

might make capital destruction more or less devastating to a local economy in the short- or medium-

run, or to how such underlying heterogeneity might affect the recovery process (Skidmore and Toya

2002). This decision is partially motivated by the fact that—in line with the predictions of standard

neoclassical growth models—previous work has found that the negative effect of capital shocks tend

to dissipate very fast. For instance, the seminal work by Ikle (1952) found that the negative effects

of Allied bombing of German cities during World War II disappeared within a couple of years after

the war. Similar results were found in the context of the Japanese WWII reconstruction (Davis and

Weinstein 2002), and the Vietnam War (Miguel and Roland 2011). At the extreme, some papers

find essentially no effect of large natural disasters, even in the very short run (Porcelli and Trezzi

2019).

    In light of our results, we believe that studying the variation in the costs of destruction in

the medium-run is crucial to fully understand these negative events. First, our analyses show

that capital destruction can have a large impact in economic activity, even several years after the

negative events. Therefore, understanding the factors that may cause a larger downturn from the

same destructive shock or impede a faster and more efficient recovery process may provide important

insights in how to reduce these intermediary welfare costs. Second, even if the level of economic

activity may return to the pre-shock level, capital destruction may affect resource allocation, which

directly can have important implications for economic growth.

    In this paper, we argue that the lack of developed financial markets played an important role



                                                 23
in the reconstruction after the Civil War. One of the key implicit assumption of the standard

neoclassical growth model is the presence of perfect financial markets.43 If this assumption fails,

the economy will experience a slower recovery from a temporary shock to the stock of capital and,

potentially, it may never achieve full convergence to the pre-shock equilibrium. In fact, if agents are

financially constrained, reconstruction efforts are limited by their financial slack, rather than driven

by investment opportunities only. More broadly, the presence of imperfections in financial markets

should affect the overall path to recovery. In our setting, this might affect which counties are more

or less severely shocked as soon as 1870, only a few years after Sherman’s destruction.

       The weakness of credit markets after the Civil War suggests that financing considerations may

have played an important role in the weak immediate postbellum recovery. Woodman (1999, p.

300-301) notes that in contrast to antebellum cotton farmers, “the postwar grower seldom delayed

the sale of his crop... Growers usually sold their cotton quickly, ordinarily to the nearest buyer

[because] [t]hey lacked the financial independence as well as the ability to secure the credit required

to delay a sale.” In general, the US banking sector was not particularly developed even before the

war (Jaremski 2013), and this underdevelopment was more acute in the South (Ransom and Sutch

2001). Bensel (1991) argues that the South was capital-starved, and this was particularly true in

the rural and agrarian parts of the region. Indeed, the 1859 Merchants & Bankers Register data

reveal that both North Carolina and South Carolina had only 2.9 banks for every 100,000 people,

and Georgia had 6.2 banks per 100,000, compared with the national average of 7.1 per 100,000.

       Formal credit markets were not particularly developed during this period, but the banking

sector in the South was also deeply impaired by the war and slow to recover to even these meager

antebellum levels (James 1981). The bank registries indicate that as of 1864, no state- or nationally-

chartered bank existed in Georgia, North Carolina, or South Carolina.44 Banks started to re-enter

these states only in 1866 and even by 1870 only a handful of banks were operating.45 As Atack and

Passell (1994) note, this modest “growth in the number of banks after the war masks a sharp reduc-

tion in total bank assets from prewar levels.” Figure 5 provides suggestive evidence that access to
  43
     An alternative to developed financial markets is to have a planned economy where the government can optimally
reallocate resources to foster recovery, as discussed by Miguel and Roland 2011 in the case of Vietnam.
  44
     The Comptroller of the Currency’s 1864 Report to the US Treasury documents the same fact. At the same time,
the Southern banking sector collapsed as a whole during the war: according to Jaremski (2013), 170 of 223 banks
closed in 1863 and 1864.
  45
     By 1870, Georgia still had only 9 banks; North Carolina 6; and South Carolina a mere 3.



                                                       24
formal credit was negatively impacted by the Sherman’s march. There are two other important fac-

tors to consider to interpret this period. First, unlike the other destruction settings previously cited,

this underdeveloped financial sector was not compensated by large public programs to help private

reconstruction. Second, the overall weakness in credit was exacerbated by emancipation—which

removed one important source of collateral for landowners (González, Marshall, and Naidu 2017;

Martin 2010, 2016; Jaynes 1986, p. 31)—and the default of the Confederate States on their debt

obligations.

       Furthermore, the supply of formal credit from banks did not serve rural and agricultural needs

during this period, especially in the South (Fite 1984; Jaremski and Rousseau 2013; Koudijs and

Salisbury 2016; Nier 2007).46 As we will discuss more in detail later, most of the funding in the

agricultural sector was coming from local country stores (Atherton 1949; McCurry 1997; Sparks

1932) or from wealthier landowners providing credit for other farmers during bad times or between

harvests (Jaremski and Fishback 2018; McCurry 1997; Rajan and Ramcharan 2008, 2011).47 To

some extent, this different financing model for the agricultural sector could have reduced frictions

that specifically characterized credit in the agricultural sector. Because these institutions were still

important in the postbellum period for agriculture, in our analyses we will exploit directly the

differences between agricultural and manufacturing sectors.

       The Southern financial sector was weak after the war, but did financing issues play an important

role in exacerbating the Sherman shock and retarding the recovery process? The remainder of

this section provides three pieces of empirical evidence that are consistent with this hypothesis.

First, we show that the two leading alternative channels affecting the slow relative recovery—a

demographic shift after the war and the destruction of public infrastructure—are not supported in

the data. Second, using both cross-industry and cross-location variation, we provide direct evidence

of the importance of the banking sector to explain the lower growth in manufacturing after the

capital shock. Third, we show that in the agricultural sector, too, frictions in the credit market

are relevant in explaining the extent of the decline in 1870. Since the banking sector played little
  46
     According to Fite (1984, p. 27), the Southern banking system in this period “was entirely inadequate to meet
rural needs.”
  47
     For instance, Rajan and Ramcharan (2011) argue that before the Great Depression, local landowning elites
actively tried to restrict the development of a local banking sector to maintain monopoly power in the provision of
credit to small farmers. While Jaremski and Fishback (2018) disagree in part with some of the conclusions in Rajan
and Ramcharan (2011), both papers highlight the importance of local landowning elites in the provision of credit for
farmers.


                                                        25
role in financing agriculture in this period in the South, our evidence will be based on a different

identification strategy. Consistent with the history of agricultural finance in the antebellum and

postbellum South, we show that counties with more pre-war high-wealth individuals recovered from

the march faster. In the same direction, the presence of antebellum country stores—often run and

financed by local wealthy elites—also had a significant positive impact on the recovery.

6.1     Alternative Channels: Demographic Shifts and Infrastructure

The effects of capital destruction may be magnified if the shock also affected the demographic

structure of the population; in the postbellum South, that could mean reducing the labor supply

of whites or newly freed blacks. Ransom and Sutch (2001) argue that changes in labor supply

help explain the postbellum decline in economic activity in the South as a whole compared with

the North. For the enslaved populations of Georgia and the Carolinas, the arrival of Union troops

signaled freedom. Catton (1988, vol. 3, p. 415-416) estimates that more than 10,000 slaves were

freed during the march. Moreover, Sherman not only freed the slaves in his path, but he also

signed Field Order No. 15, which allowed the freed slaves to settle outside the march path in

abandoned coastal plantations (Trudeau 2008, p. 521). Ransom and Sutch (2001) estimate high

rates of out-migration among freed people throughout the South, but we will investigate whether

that out-migration differed between march counties and non-march counties.

      In addition to potentially divergent postwar demographic patterns, the rebuilding and devel-

opment of new public infrastructure in the postbellum period could have been different between

march and non-march counties. We know that wartime destruction of infrastructure varied between

the march and non-march counties because Sherman explicitly targeted the railroads and telegraph

lines in his path. Prior to the march, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina had more than

2,700 miles of railroad track. Sherman laid siege to this track by assigning a large share of his

men to the specific job of destroying the tracks and nearby depots, warehouses, station buildings,

and bridges (Carr 2015, p. 69). His soldiers sent home vivid letters describing how they would lift

up track in concert, soften the steel with bonfires, wrap the track around trees, and bend it into

bows known as “Sherman’s neckties” (Carr 2015, p. 70).48 Between Atlanta and Savannah alone,

Sherman claimed to have destroyed 310 miles of track (Trudeau 2008, p. 533). These claims may
  48
     Barrett (1956) describes in detail the Union army process of destroying a railroad, including the need to bend
the wrap into a twisted doughnut shape known as a “Lincoln gimlet” (Barrett 1956, p. 51).


                                                        26
be exaggerations, as much of the destruction was incomplete and his men concentrated more on

pulling up rails and breaking ties than on fully destroying rail paths and grounds. Postwar re-laying

of track came fairly quickly (Trudeau 2008, p. 92). Nevertheless, the potential for differential infras-

tructure across march and non-march counties following Sherman’s march could also help explain

the observed economic differences.

      Using county-level data on demographic structure and infrastructure, we find that neither chan-

nel is particularly useful in explaining our results in either the medium term or the long term.

Table 5 shows the results of estimating equation 1 on the demographic and infrastructure outcomes.

Columns 1 and 2 indicate that there were not systematically different postwar in- or out-migration

rates overall; columns 3 and 4 indicate no differences for migration of newly freed African Americans

across the march and non-march counties.49 Demographics do not appear to explain much of the

economic effects of the march. Looking across both total population and share of African American,

we find effects that are very small in size and highly insignificant. Our results echo many histories

of the postbellum South: if newly freed slaves “showed a reluctance to leave the places where they

had lived and worked” (Glass Campbell 2006, p. 49), that reluctance was not differential across

counties decimated by Sherman and not.

      Similarly, the last two columns show that differences in infrastructure, as measured by county

railroad miles, were also small. This is consistent with the historical record: Atack and Passell

(1994, p. 378-379) note that while rail and telegraph lines were “destroyed with great vigor by the

Union,” the “repairs were immediate.” According to Rubin (2014, p. 154), many travelers remarked

on the speed with which the Georgia Central Railroad was rebuilt in the few years after the war.

The telegraph repair was even more rapid: as soon as December 13, 1864, while Sherman was still

sieging Savannah, the Southern Telegraph Company had already repaired many of the cut wires,

quickly reestablishing communication between Macon and Augusta. Given these rapid repairs and

the exaggerated reports of railroad destruction by Sherman, it is perhaps unsurprising that postwar

infrastructure was not different across march and non-march counties.


                                               [Table 5 about here.]


      These results suggest that differences in either demographic composition or infrastructure cannot
 49
      We find similar results on a battery of other demographic outcomes such as sex ratio.


                                                          27
explain the Sherman effects. Importantly, this is true both in the long and medium-run, since we

do not find any significant effects on these outcomes even in 1870, six years after the starting of the

events.

6.2     Credit in the Manufacturing Recovery

The previous analyses suggest that shifts in demographics and public investments do not appear to

explain the economic distress in 1870. For the rest of this section, we provide some direct evidence

on the importance of the financial channel in explaining the relative downturns from the Sherman

destruction. Using both county and industry variation, we begin by exploring the role of credit in

the near-term manufacturing recovery.

      Jaremski (2014) documents the importance of a formal banking sector in encouraging the growth

of manufacturing during this period. Banks and credit were both scarce in the postbellum period.

However, for some areas of the South, this scarcity was not a new phenomenon: banking coverage

throughout Georgia and the Carolinas was quite variable in the antebellum period as well. Therefore,

if a weak banking sector made the recovery more difficult, we would expect to find larger negative

effects in counties where banks were active before the war. The intuition for this test is that the

location of a bank can be used as a proxy for places where the manufacturing sector is characterized

by high demand for bank lending. Since all banks disappeared after the war, businesses that

located closer to banks should have—all else equal—suffered more than businesses that were already

unbanked before 1860 if financial constraint was a key driver of the recovery. Given the nature of the

decline in bank activity, this test is equivalent to testing whether the shock was larger in counties

where banks declined the most by the end of the war. Indeed, in Table A.7, we show that results

are similar if we measure the banking shock directly as change in banks between 1859 and 1870.50

      To test this hypothesis, we collect county-level data on the number of banks in 1859 and we

define as more dependent on credit markets those counties that are located closer to a bank in

1859 (Figure A.1). This sorting identifies places where credit markets were more active before the

war, and therefore, since all 1859 banks were destroyed by 1864 (Figure 5), where the contraction
  50
     To do this, we calculate the growth rate of banks from 1859 to 1870 and split the sample at the median growth
rate. This measure captures more directly the heterogeneity across counties in the banking decline after the war.
However, as also suggested by Figure 5, this measure may be endogenous to the march itself as post-1864 banking
recovery could be a function of the recovery in manufacturing. Therefore, we prefer the main specification based only
on the pre-treatment distribution of 1859 banks, not the growth rate of banks.




                                                         28
of credit caused by the march was more costly. If access to credit helps explain the postbellum

manufacturing recovery, we expect that counties more dependent on credit should suffer more for a

given level of destruction. Importantly, in these specifications we control for industry fixed-effects

to control for the fact that the type of business located closer to banks may have been operating in

a different industry.

       We find that the negative effect caused by the march is much stronger for those counties that

were ex ante more dependent on finance (Table 6, top panel). Formally, we first divide the sample

into counties that were above or below the median distance to a bank in 1859. We consider counties

below the median distance as counties that experienced significant wartime credit disruption.51 We

then estimate manufacturing change regression from equation 2, interacting the march treatment

with the indicator of finance access. We find that Sherman’s damage on manufacturing was stronger

in counties that also experienced the disappearance of a local banking network.

                                             [Figure 5 about here.]

       To bolster our mechanism, we present two additional results. First, we use data on the number of

firms receiving a credit rating from Dun, Boyd, & Company in 1860 as an alternative way to measure

locations in which credit services were frequent. We define as more dependent on credit markets

those counties that have firms which appear to have had credit extended according to the 1860 Dun

report (Figure A.1). March counties with Dun-tracked firms in 1860 were more adversely affected

by the march than march counties without Dun-tracked firms, as shown in the middle panel of Table

6. This regression also demonstrates that when places with more credit relationships external to

the firm were damaged, recovery was slower. Hence, the credit channel played an important role

in the postbellum rebuilding and can help explain the divergent economic results across march and

non-march counties.

       Second, we find that the negative effects were much larger when looking at industries generally

more dependent on external finance. Following the seminal work by Rajan and Zingales (1998),

finance research has documented—across different countries and periods—that industries that de-
  51
     In 1859, 51 of the 248 counties in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina contained a bank. The median
county centroid distance to an 1859 bank was 23.35 miles. Counties with a bank are considered 0 miles from a bank.
Atack and Passell (1994, p. 392) suggest that trips to banks out of county or farther, taking two days, could have
been prohibitively costly for small farmers who had “neither the time nor the skills” to negotiate with bankers out
of town. Further, these bankers would know little of the small farmers’ credit risk or land and might be hesitant to
lend.


                                                        29
pend more on external financing to fund investments tend to be more responsive to shock to credit.

To overcome the lack of data in our period, we measure dependence on external finance at industry-

level using data collected in the 1920s for public and private firms by Nanda and Nicholas (2014).52

Then, we use this measure to identify the group of industries that are more dependent on external

finance, and we test whether the effects of capital destruction were stronger in the set of more

dependent industries. In the bottom panel of Table 6, we present our results. When looking at

capital, employment, and number of establishments, we find that industries more dependent on

external finance experienced a larger decline in affected counties. In economic magnitude, the effect

for the high-dependent group is on average double than for the low-dependent group across all the

specifications.


                                              [Table 6 about here.]


    Our investigation of the mechanisms driving our differential economic results across march and

non-march counties indicates that access to credit played an important role, while demographic

and infrastructure differences were less crucial. In particular, counties that were more dependent

on financing before the war experienced a more difficult recovery, as the war also led to a severe

disruption in credit markets. These findings are consistent with the historical literature showing the

rapid rebuilding of infrastructure in the postwar period (Atack and Passell 1994) and the importance

of credit for manufacturing growth later in American history (Nanda and Nicholas 2014; Ziebarth

2013; Lee and Mezzanotti 2014). Similarly, growth of industries more dependent on external finance

was more affected, even five years after the end of the war.53 Overall, these different tests seem to

highlight how financing considerations affected the recovery process in the manufacturing sector.

However, the postbellum Southern economy was more agrarian than industrial and banks had a

limited role in the agricultural sector. Instead, credit for farmers often came from local large
  52
     The data is presented in Table A.4 of the published version of Nanda and Nicholas (2014). Since our industry
composition is not coded exactly like the one in their study, we hand-match the two data sets based on industry
names and description.
  53
     To the extent that Sherman’s march directly impaired financial intermediaries, our main estimates may partially
capture the negative degree of this direct effect. However, when we examine heterogeneity in Sherman’s effects, our
results do not rely on an assumption that Sherman had a differential effect on the banking sector because we use
antebellum access to banking and credit as our measure of treatment intensity. While it may be the case that banks
in Sherman counties recovered slower, as Figure 5 shows, any differential recovery in banking activity across Sherman
and non-Sherman counties is second-order compared with the overall drop in banking activity in the South during
and after the Civil War, a decline experienced similarly across all counties in our sample.

landowners or local stores. In the next section, we investigate this type of credit in the recovery

from Sherman’s March.

6.3     Agricultural Recovery and Credit

To provide evidence of the importance of credit-market imperfection for the agricultural sector, we

present two results that exploit the institutional characteristics of this sector around the Civil War.

      As previously discussed, the agricultural sector was not particularly dependent on banks during

this period (Fite 1984; Jaremski and Rousseau 2013; Koudijs and Salisbury 2016; Nier 2007). The

consensus among historians is that “banks chose not to provide service to rural areas,” and therefore

concluded that there was no evidence that “rural banks provided (...) credit to small farmers”

(Nier 2007, p. 152). Instead, funding for farmers in the antebellum period came mostly from two

alternative sources. First, country stores and local merchants played an important role in providing

credit to farmers (Atherton 1949; McCurry 1997; Sparks 1932). The importance of country stores

and furnishing merchants did not diminish after the war (Woodman 1999, p. 303-307). In their

review of the historical evidence on this subject, Koudijs and Salisbury (2016) document that country

stores provided loans to farmers in the form of open accounts that ran for 12 to 15 months. Second, a

large part of the funding to medium and small farmers came from local wealthy individuals operating

in the agricultural sector (Rajan and Ramcharan 2011; Jaremski and Fishback 2018; Koudijs and

Salisbury 2016). Local wealthy elites, like country stores, advanced poorer farmers money on their

future crops (McCurry 1997) and, in some cases, also directly loaned money to smaller farmers who

wanted to purchase land or improve it (Martin 2010). In the postbellum period, the cotton factor

system that supplied many rich landowners with their own loans “whether a novice or a practiced

businessman, initially functioned much as he had during the prewar period” (Woodman 1999, p.

254).

      Building on these institutional details, we test the importance of financing consideration in

explaining the recovery period in two ways, examining the effects of antebellum local wealth and

country stores on the recovery process.

      First, we test whether the presence of wealthy individuals affected the recovery process. As

previously discussed, a high density of wealthy individuals and households should have generated

positive externalities by providing smaller farmers with an alternative source of funding in the



                                                  31
absence of formal financial institutions. At the same time, local wealthy individuals were less likely

to be financially constrained, which in aggregate may also reduce local financing needs. Though very

wealthy planters did occasionally go bankrupt—future South Carolina Governor Wade Hampton is

one notable example—small farmers and merchants were much more likely to appear at bankruptcy

court (Thompson 2004, p. 73-74). One concern with this approach is that the Civil War may

have been particularly costly for the wealthiest Southerners, making pre-war level of wealth in a

county not informative about the presence of wealth after the march. However, recent work by

Ager, Boustan, and Eriksson (2019) suggests that this is unlikely, with a finding that families who

were very wealthy in the South before the war tended to still be high-wealth afterward, with little

of the emancipation or war shock transmitted intergenerationally to the sons of the planter elite.

Importantly for us, they show that this result holds both generally across the South and specifically

in counties directly affected by Sherman.

    Therefore, either directly or by providing funding to others, the presence of wealthy individuals

could facilitate the funding of reconstruction and reduce the costs related to the lack of external

credit in the local area. We start by drawing from the 1850 census, which reports individual level

data on wealth, to measure the density of very wealthy individuals in a county. The 1850 census

is the only antebellum census for which data on wealth is digitized for the complete population.54

Using this data, we identify in each county the number of individuals who have wealth in the

top 5% of the overall distribution. Then, we defined as counties with high density of wealthy

individuals those that are in the top quartile in terms of share of individuals in the top 5% of wealth

distribution relative to total number of individuals reporting some wealth. We later discuss several

alternatives to this approach. Based on the previous discussion, our hypothesis is that, if financial

frictions mattered in the recovery, places with a high share of large landowners should enjoy a better

recovery after the large shock to capital of Sherman’s march. To test this idea, we augment our

standard regression model interacting our treatment dummy and time dummy with the high-wealth
  54
     The federal census only asked about wealth only in three decades: 1850, 1860, and 1870. However, the complete
count including the wealth questions of neither 1860 nor 1870 have been fully digitized yet. One limitation of the
1850 census is that wealth is defined as only real-estate wealth rather than total wealth. Since we need data only
to measure the relative level of wealth concentration across counties, we think this data limitation is unlikely to be
important. High land wealth tends to correspond to high non-land wealth. For instance, in 1870 individuals in the
top 10% of real estate wealth have a 68% chance of being in the top 10% in personal wealth as well. The overlap
between the top of the real estate and personal wealth distributions is similar for other thresholds of wealth, including
top 5% or 1%. We construct these numbers using the IPUMS 1% sample of the 1870 census for white men in GA,
NC, and SC.


                                                           32
variable. Since the main coefficients of interest will be on a triple interaction, we simplify the time

dummies to before and after the march indicators, reporting in the main result in the top panel of

Table 7 only the average effect after the march.55

       In line with our hypothesis, we find that counties in Sherman’s path with a large share of wealthy

individuals experienced a lower decline in land prices and farm values following the destruction.

The same holds for agricultural investments, but in this case the effect is weaker statistically.

Furthermore, when looking at the effect by decades, it is clear that this effect is not driven by any

differential trend in this group of high-wealth counties within Sherman, but it is the response of

these counties to the economic shock (Appendix Table A.5). These differences are also relatively

large in magnitude, suggesting that this mechanism can explain a large part of the variation in

Sherman’s effects. These results are robust to the alternative measures of wealth at county level.56

       We show that the effects of country stores are similar (bottom panel of Table 7). Country stores

were an important source of funding for agriculture. Measuring country stores during this period is

difficult because—unlike banks—there is no external data with systematically collected information

about them. However, the 1840 census has data on the number of country stores by county (Koudijs

and Salisbury 2016). To the extent that their distribution persisted over time, this data can be used

to analyze the differential recovery of agriculture across areas that are located inside or outside the

country store network. Following the previous set of analyses, we identified counties in which small

farmers had significant access to country stores by looking at those counties on the top quartile of

the distribution of country stores in the data. Then, we test whether these counties experienced a

lower decline in economic activity caused by Sherman’s march and capital destruction. Across the

different outcomes, we find that counties with more country stores experienced a smaller decline

in agricultural activity and land investment than places with fewer. The magnitude suggests that

essentially all the negative effects of capital destruction were concentrated in counties with a smaller

supply of country stores measured in 1840. Since country stores were crucial to providing working

capital financing to agriculture, this evidence is consistent with the view that lack of financing
  55
     Since we are collapsing the time dimension to only pre vs. post, this model is estimated only using 1850–1890.
The results are similar with the full sample, as the results by decade in Table A.5 suggest.
  56
     In particular, we find that using a more extreme definition of wealthy individual—top 2%—provides very similar
results in the top panel of Table A.6. In the bottom panel of Table A.6, we show that the results are qualitatively
identical if we define wealth density relative to the overall white population rather than only individuals with some
wealth in the census.



                                                         33
played an important role in the recovery process. Our results echo an 1880 census report on cotton

production that found “the importance of the country stores in financing and marketing the cotton

crop... With few exceptions, the furnishing merchant system prevailed in the cotton areas of every

Southern state” (Woodman 1999, p. 307).


                                         [Table 7 about here.]


    Overall, this section has provided evidence for the importance of a lack of financing to explain the

initial severity of capital destruction and its immediate recovery. In principle, this is a reasonable

hypothesis given that financial markets were not well developed in the South in the nineteenth

century and they deteriorated further after the Civil War. This section has provided three tests

that highlight the importance of financing considerations to explain the recovery from the shock.

First, we have shown that alternative leading explanations for a lack of recovery in the medium

and long term—a demographic shift or lack of infrastructure—do not appear to be confirmed by

data. Second, we have provided direct evidence of the importance of credit for variation in the

manufacturing downturn. In particular, we have shown that growth in manufacturing was especially

affected by Sherman’s march in places where credit was more extensive prior to the Civil War and in

industries more dependent on external finance. Lastly, we have shown that the agricultural downturn

was much more severe in counties without a high density of wealthy individuals or country stores,

two important sources of external capital for the agricultural sector in the South at this time. While

none of these tests are perfect, combined these analyses provide convincing evidence that credit-

market imperfections are responsible for part of the severe devastation in the medium-run following

the march.

7   Persistent Effects of Sherman’s March

Our results suggest that the capital shock caused by the march led to a significant medium-run

contraction in both the manufacturing and agricultural sector. Did these effects persist over the

long run? In this section, we extend the time dimension of our main analyses.

    Within the agricultural sector, we find that the county-level shock is associated with negative

effects. However, these effects are more precisely estimated and larger in magnitude for our measure

of investment in agricultural land. In particular, the initial decline of about 15% in the share of


                                                  34
improved land remains extremely stable in magnitude and in statistical significance at least until

1920 (Figure 6). For the other agricultural outcomes, while we find that the negative effect of the

march significantly declines between 1870 and 1880, our estimated coefficients remain negative and

still sizable in magnitude—at least without controls—but generally non-significant.

                                            [Figure 6 about here.]

       At the same time, we find no evidence of persistence in the manufacturing sector. As we show

in the second panel of Table 4, differences between affected counties declined dramatically by 1880.

This result suggests that while manufacturing contracted in the medium-run, over a longer horizon

the effect of the march on manufacturing was small.

       Taking our agricultural and manufacturing results together, these differences in persistence

suggest two main takeaways. First, even when the overall economy suffers in the short- or medium-

run, different sectors may experience different long-term responses. In this case, while some elements

of the shock persisted for agriculture, there is no evidence of the same persistence for manufacturing.

In part, these differences may stem from the different stage of development across sectors. While

the agricultural sector was a mature industry at the time, manufacturing was still at a more infant

stage in the South. Manufacturing grew dramatically in the postbellum period; after declining from

$71M in 1860 to $57M in 1870, Southern manufacturing and mining output grew to $100M in 1880

(Engerman 1966).

       Second, even when economic activity recovers, some elements of the shock may still be evident

years later. Within the agricultural sector, asset prices appear to have completely recovered at some

point between 1880 and 1900.57 At the same time, improved land remained significantly lower at

least until 1920. One hypothesis that may rationalize these results is that the recovery from the

shock led to a change in the organization of agriculture. This change in agricultural institutions

could then influence the way inputs are used, both in the short run and—to the extent that changes

in institutions tend to be sticky over time—the long run, even if the underlying economic damage

of the march was mostly in the short run.

       In particular, we focus on the rise of farm tenancy and sharecropping during the postbellum

period. After the Civil War and emancipation, the organization of southern agriculture was in
  57
    The magnitude of the estimates becomes smaller and smaller as we arrive at the turn of the century, suggesting
a complete recovery.


                                                       35
flux. New labor arrangements used in the late 1860s through 1880 included gang labor, squad

labor, and family-based labor, as well as cash tenancy, share tenancy, and sharecropping (Ransom

and Sutch 2001; Shlomowitz 1979; Alston and Higgs 1982; Bloome and Muller 2015; Wright 1986).

Eventually, though not uniformly throughout the South, a system of tenancy emerged as the main

labor and land market in the postbellum South (Shlomowitz 1979; Fite 1984).58 Our argument is

that the capital destruction caused by the shock may have magnified the shift of agriculture toward

sharecropping and tenant farming and away from owner-managed land.

       How does tenancy fit with the main takeaways above? First, as we have emphasized earlier,

the recovery from the march was hindered by a general scarcity of capital. With capital scarce,

new land and labor institutions like sharecropping and tenancy could be optimal for land-owners

trying to overcome financial constraints in the postbellum period.59 Ransom and Sutch (2001),

Woodman (1977), Alston and Higgs (1982), and other historians and economic historians of the

postbellum South have all pointed to financial constraints as one explanation for the rise of tenancy

and sharecropping in this period.60 Jaynes (1986, p. 50) puts it clearly:

         What we would expect is that regions facing the most severe credit constraints would

         have a high incidence of share payments. Planters not especially constrained by credit

         rationing would therefore never adopt fully deferred money wage contracts ... This thesis

         strongly implies that the incidence of full postharvest and specifically share payments
  58
     Sharecropping and tenancy were not brand-new in the postbellum period (Reid 1976) but they were rare before
emancipation. Tolnay (1999) describes three main forms of tenants: cash tenants rented land by paying in cash, share
tenants rented land and paid with a share of crop yield, and sharecroppers rented land, farm equipment, and animals
and paid with a larger share of crop yield. Following recent work on tenancy and sharecropping, we consider cash
tenancy, share tenancy, and sharecropping as one broader category of labor and land arrangement. We do this for
three reasons. First, as Alston and Kauffman (1997) note, in some years enumerators at the Census of Agriculture
seem to have confused their own definitions and misclassified farms between categories. Second, rates of tenancy and
sharecropping are correlated at the county-level and the effects of tenancy on other outcomes are similar; for example,
see Bloome and Muller (2015); Bloome, Feigenbaum, and Muller (2017) on the effects of tenancy on marriage. Third,
and most important, while each arrangement varied, all had the same structure of land owners outsourcing the
management of parts of their land to farm tenants and being paid only at harvest, in contrast to a wage labor system
with overseers or owner-managers.
  59
     Tenancy may have been an optimal solution for financially constrained land-owners, in either the short or long
run, but it may have, overall, increased constraints on the postbellum Southern agricultural economy. According to
Shlomowitz (1979), even landowners paying wages were sometimes forced to write contracts with uneven payment
schedules, waiting until after harvest to settle accounts for workers who were supposed to be paid a regular wage.
  60
     Shlomowitz (1979) and others argue that sharecropping developed and evolved according to postbellum market
forces as landowners, planters, freed African Americans, and other southern laborers negotiated the post-emancipation
agricultural economy. Beyond financial constraints, there are other arguments for the rise of sharecropping in this
era. Share contracts may ensure full-year farm labor for planters in a way that (breakable) wage contracts would not.
In addition, sharecropping contracts shift risk—though the shift is likely to be away from landowners and towards
croppers. Finally, Shlomowitz (1979) emphasizes monitoring advantages of sharecropping and tenancy compared to
wage farming.


                                                          36
         should have been highest in regions where the devastation of property was greatest.

Second, the reallocation of land from owner-managed farms to tenants may explain the larger share

of land left unimproved in these counties. Both owners and tenants may be less likely to invest in

improvements, either because tenants had only a temporary claim on the land and were generally

poor or because monitoring the upkeep or depreciation of costly improvements would be expensive

for owners not actively managing the farm.

       As first step, we document that tenancy was mostly concentrated in smaller farms. According

to the 1880 Census of Agriculture, which is the first census to record information on tenancy, farms

under 50 acres were much more likely to be operated by a sharecropper or tenant farmer—rather than

by the land owner—in Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina (Figure 7).61 Approximately

75% of all small (under 50 acres) farms were sharecropped or tenant farmed in the Sherman states.

Above this size threshold, the vast majority of farms were owner managed.62

                                             [Figure 7 about here.]

       If Sherman’s March led to relatively higher adoption of tenancy, we would expect to find a large

increase in the number and share of farms that were smaller than 50 acres in Sherman counties after

the Civil War. To examine this question, we return to our main empirical specification, looking at

changes in the number of farms of different sizes.63 We consider both the log number of farms of

each size and the share of farms of each size. Results are reported in Figure 8.

       Overall, we find that Sherman’s March increased the number of farms of less than 50 acres, at the

same time reducing the presence of larger farms. This change in the distribution of farms is driven in

part by changes in farm organization around the center of the size-distribution. The largest increase

is of farms between 10 and 49 acres. On the other side, the contraction was particularly large among

farms between 100 and 499 acres. These patterns are consistent with the distribution of tenancy
  61
     In this subsection, we make use of data from the Census of Agriculture on farm sizes. The data collected by the
census indicate the size of farms as operated not as owned. That is, if a land owner with 1000 acres rents the land
out in 10-acre farms to 100 tenant farmers, the census will record this as 100 10-acre farms. For more detail, see
Virts (1987). Specifically, this makes the farm size distribution data an excellent resource for understanding the use
of the land in each census year but it does not allow us to assess inequality in land ownership or wealth with much
confidence.
  62
     In 1890, we find a similar distribution of size across tenant and owner-managed land. However, 1880 and 1890
are the only years in which the Census of Agriculture collected data on the distribution of farm sizes according to
ownership or tenancy status.
  63
     We are slightly limited by the data in assessing the pre-treatment period: the Census of Agriculture collected
information on the farm size distribution starting in 1860, not in 1850 as with our other analyses.


                                                         37
shown in Figure 7. Overall, we see in Figure 8 that the distribution of farm sizes shifted toward

the commonly tenant-farmed or sharecropped sizes. These relative changes in farm size in Sherman

and non-Sherman counties were occurring in the context of changes in farm sizes throughout the

South (Reid 1973).

       The changes in farm size are consistent with our argument that the destruction from Sherman’s

March led to more sharecropping and tenancy. However, this analysis cannot be used to directly

quantify the extent to which capital destruction may have contributed to the rise in tenancy. The key

issue is that the Census of Agriculture only began collecting counts of farms or acres in tenancy or

sharecropping in 1880. This is not surprising: sharecropping and tenant farming were exceedingly

rare in the antebellum period, though they did exist in some areas (Reid 1976). Therefore, a

specification that directly estimated the impact of the march on tenancy cannot be estimated under

similar assumptions. Despite this limitation, the evidence in this section confirms that the shock

was followed by a change in the way agriculture was organized, which may have persisted in the

long run.

                                              [Figure 8 about here.]

       As a last step, we examine whether this shift in farm size distribution led to any significant

shift in land inequality. This analysis is useful for two reasons. First, understanding the overall

effect on inequality in land can provide useful information to evaluate the welfare impact of this

change. Second, as we discuss more in detail below, this analysis can be used to provide indirect

evidence that our previous evidence was not driven by differential trends in farm concentration

across counties. To measure land inequality, we construct an index of farm size inequality as in

Nunn (2008). This index is a Gini coefficient based on the distribution of farm size by acreage.64

                                              [Table 8 about here.]

       Using the usual specification, we find that farm size inequality increased substantially after

Sherman’s march in march counties relative to non-march counties (Table 8). Compared with the

1860 difference in inequality across march and non-march counties, the 1870–1890 differences were
  64
    Farm size is categorized in seven bins. The farm size bins are, in acres, 0 to 9, 10 to 19, 20 to 49, 50 to 99, 100
to 499, 500 to 999, and over 1,000. We construct two Gini coefficients based on these data, one setting each farm to
the median of each bin and another setting each farm to the minimum of each bin. For the largest bin size, we use
1000 in both cases.


                                                          38
between 5% and 19% larger. Farm sizes became economically significantly more concentrated and

unequal in response to the Civil War’s capital destruction. This evidence is consistent with the

previous evidence on farm-size distribution, which has shown that the shift in farm size was mostly

concentrated in the middle of the distribution, leaving almost unaffected both very large and very

small farms, therefore increasing inequality.

    This analysis allows us to provide some indirect evidence on the lack of pre-trend before 1860.

Though we do not have information on farm sizes in 1850, we are able to construct a different

proxy for inequality in the prebellum period and show that there are no differential pre-trends

across Sherman and non-Sherman counties. We construct a slave-holding Gini index, which should

still capture variation in wealth that is related to concentration, from data collected in both 1850

and 1860. Consistent with this claim, the residualized (for population, latitude and longitude,

county size, and state fixed effects) correlation between the two measures in 1860, the only year

in which both exist, is 0.34, which suggests that the latter is a reasonable proxy measure of the

former in 1850.65 In the fifth and sixth columns of Table 8, we show that the slave-holding measure

indicates that inequality was not trending differentially prior to Sherman across march and non-

march counties. This effect is both small in magnitude and statistically non-significant. This

evidence suggests that the changes in farm distribution that are discussed in this section are not

likely to stem from differential trends in farm-size before the war.

8    Conclusion

When General William Sherman began his march in Atlanta in August 1864, he sought to “make

significant economic damage on parts of the Confederacy. Nor did this damage end at the conclusion

of the war. Both agricultural and manufacturing outcomes fell significantly in march counties

relative to nearby non-march counties in 1870. In this context, we argue that the lack of credit in

the postwar American South explains part of the slow recovery following the war. Furthermore,

we show that agricultural investment remained persistently lower in counties destroyed by Sherman

for more than a half-century and changes to the organization of agriculture and the distribution of

land persisted as well. Our results suggest that large capital shocks may persistently shift the way

economic activity is organized even after overall agriculture activity recovers.

   Capital destruction caused by war or natural disaster is a frequent event in human history.

It is important to understand its consequences—in both the short and long run—and the factors

that affect the recovery. This paper has shown that the economic costs of large property and

infrastructure destruction can be substantial and persistent. Furthermore, we have highlighted the

importance of a developed financial sector to reduce such effects. Examining whether these effects

are confined to total war or to infrastructure-focused campaigns like Sherman’s March, or could

be the consequence of more traditional military-centered battles, is an area for future research.

Similarly, it may be that the non-economic long-term effect of total war campaigns—on outcomes

like political beliefs or trust—is large and persistent. Lastly, future research can explore various

policies that can be put in place to create a more effective and efficient reconstruction.

Notes: Columns 1 and 2 report unconditional means of county characteristics in march and non-march counties, with stan-
 dard deviations in parentheses below. Columns 3 and 4 report the difference between the means, unconditionally in Column
 3 and conditional on state fixed effects in Column 4, with standard errors in parentheses below. The Agricultural data from
 the US Census of Agriculture, 1860. Manufacturing data from the US Census of Manufactures, 1860. Demographic data
 are from the US Census of Population, 1860. All agricultural data are measured per square mile in each county. A plan-
 tation county is a county that is in the top quartile in share of farms with more than 100 slaves. Percent Improved Farm
 Land is the share of farm land that is improved. Cotton Intensity is the amount of cotton output in 1860 per 100 acres of
 total farm land. County close to canal or river are counties that are closer than the median distance in our sample to either
 a canal or river. More information is provided throughout the draft about these variables when used.

 Each column is a separate county-year level regression of the indicated agricultural outcome on an
   indicator equal to one if the county is within five miles of Sherman’s march, interacted with the dis-
   played decade indicators, plus the noted fixed effects and controls. The 1860 county controls include
   size of the county, measured in squared miles; population; size of the agricultural output; and in-
   tensity in cotton production; average slave ownership per farm; share of manufacturing employment;
   plantation county; and railroad miles. In general, to flexibly control for these characteristics of the
   county in 1860, we divide the sample in four quartiles along each of these characteristics and then
   add them in the regression interacted with time dummies. More info on variables are in the text
   where we discuss the main specification. The sample is all counties within 100 miles of the march
   and all decades, 1850-1920. Standard errors are clustered at the county level.

Each column is a separate county-industry level regression of the percentage change between 1860 and 1870 in the column
  indicated manufacturing outcome on an indicator equal to one if the county is within five miles of Sherman’s march plus
  the noted fixed effects and controls. The 1860 county controls include size of the county, measured in squared miles; pop-
  ulation; size of the agricultural output; and intensity in cotton production; average slave ownership per farm; share of
  manufacturing employment; plantation county; and railroad miles. In general, to flexibly control for these characteristics
  of the county in 1860, we divide the sample in four quartiles along each of these characteristics and then add them in the
  regression interacted with time dummies. More info on variables are in the text where we discuss the main specification.
  The sample is all reported industries in all counties within 100 miles of the march. The sample is unbalanced because not
  all industries are present in all counties. Standard errors are clustered at the county level.

 Each column is a separate county-year level regression of the indicated agricultural outcome on an indicator equal to one
   if the county is within five miles of Sherman’s march, interacted with an indicators for post 1860 decades and a dummy
   for high density of High Wealth Individuals in 1850, plus the noted fixed effects and controls. The 1860 county controls
   include size of the county, measured in squared miles; population; size of the agricultural output; and intensity in cotton
   production; average slave ownership per farm; share of manufacturing employment; plantation county; and railroad miles.
   In general, to flexibly control for these characteristics of the county in 1860, we divide the sample in four quartiles along
   each of these characteristics and then add them in the regression interacted with time dummies. More info on variables
   are in the text where we discuss the main specification. The sample is all counties within 100 miles of the march and all
   decades, 1850-1890, as discussed in the paper. The dummy for High Wealth is equal to one for those counties that are in
   the top quarter in terms of share individuals in the top 5% of the overall wealth distribution in 1850. Standard errors are
   clustered at the county level.

Each column is a separate county-year level regression of the indicated inequality measure on an indicator equal to one if the
  county is within five miles of Sherman’s march interacted with decadal indicators, plus the noted fixed effects and controls.
  The sample is all counties within 100 miles of the march. The gini measure in columns 1 to 4 is constructed following Nunn
  (2008) and uses farm size data from the Census of Agriculture, 1850-1920. The gini measure in columns 5 and 6 is con-
  structed using the same procedure, except using slaveholdings rather than farm size. The 1860 county controls include size
  of the county, measured in squared miles; population; size of the agricultural output; and intensity in cotton production;
  average slave ownership per farm; share of manufacturing employment; plantation county; and railroad miles. In general,
  to flexibly control for these characteristics of the county in 1860, we divide the sample in four quartiles along each of these
  characteristics and then add them in the regression interacted with time dummies. More info on variables are in the text
  where we discuss the main specification. Standard errors are clustered at the county level.

Figure 3: Estimated effects of 852 placebo march paths between triples of Southern cities on 1870
outcomes. The t-statistics from Sherman’s March are indicated with the dashed vertical line. Fewer
than 5% of the t-statistics from the placebo marches are as negative as the estimated Sherman
effects. Placebo marches are build by connecting three Southern cities (defined as counties with
more than 2000 urban residents in 1860) by paths between 100 and 300 miles, mimicking the sizes
and distances between Atlanta, Savannah, and Columbia where Sherman actually marched. The
t-statistics presented are from a regression replicating Equation 1 for each placebo march.

Figure 8: Sherman’s March changed the distribution of effective farm sizes in the counties Sherman
destroyed. Counties treated by Sherman had more small farms in the years after the Civil War,
with growth in the share and number of farms under 50 acres. We plot coefficients from separate
regressions with the log number of farms (a) and the share of farms (b) of each size as the outcomes
as in equation 1. We observe the distribution of farms in 1860, 1870, 1880, and 1890. The coeffi-
cient plotted is Sherman × P ost. All specifications include county fixed effects and state by year
fixed effects. The estimates from the models with controls include the same controls as the main
specification in the paper. Standard errors are clustered at county-level.

                       Notes: Lists of the names of grooms in Georgia and North Carolina
                        were collected from state marriage records between 1868 and 1872.
                        The grooms were then matched by first and last name to the com-
                        plete 1870 census schedule. The link rate reports the share of grooms
                        successfully matched using a variant of the automated linking proce-
                        dure described in Feigenbaum (2016). Match rates are comparable to
                        other linking projects using census data in this era. The Georgia and
                        North Carolina Marriage Records are from FamilySearch.org.

 Each column is a separate county level regression of the percentage change between 1860 and 1870 in the column indicated
   lumber manufacturing outcome on an indicator equal to one if the county is within five miles of Sherman’s march plus the
   noted fixed effects and controls. The 1860 county controls include size of the county, measured in squared miles; population;
   size of the agricultural output; and intensity in cotton production; average slave ownership per farm; share of manufactur-
   ing employment; plantation county; and railroad miles. More info on variables are in the text where we discuss the main

Each column is a separate county-year level regression of the indicated agricultural outcome on an indicator equal to one
  if the county is within five miles of Sherman’s march interacted with decadal indicators, plus the noted fixed effects and
  controls, where the Sherman’s march indicator is instrumented with an indicator for within 15 miles of a straight-line path
  between the four march vertices: Atlanta, GA, Savannah, GA, Columbia, SC, and Goldsboro, NC. The 1860 county controls
  include size of the county, measured in squared miles; population; size of the agricultural output; and intensity in cotton
  production; average slave ownership per farm; share of manufacturing employment; plantation county; and railroad miles.
  In general, to flexibly control for these characteristics of the county in 1860, we divide the sample in four quartiles along
  each of these characteristics and then add them in the regression interacted with time dummies. More info on variables are
  in the text where we discuss the main specification. The sample is all counties within 100 miles of the march. Standard
  errors are clustered at the county level.

 Each column is a separate county-industry level regression of the indicated manufacturing outcome on an indicator equal
   to one if the county is within five miles of Sherman’s march plus the noted fixed effects, where the Sherman’s march indi-
   cator is instrumented with an indicator for within 15 miles of a straight-line path between four march vertices: Atlanta,
   GA, Savannah, GA, Columbia, SC, and Goldsboro, NC. The 1860 county controls include size of the county, measured in
   squared miles; population; size of the agricultural output; and intensity in cotton production; average slave ownership per
   farm; share of manufacturing employment; plantation county; and railroad miles. In general, to flexibly control for these
   characteristics of the county in 1860, we divide the sample in four quartiles along each of these characteristics and then add
   them in the regression interacted with time dummies. More info on variables are in the text where we discuss the main
   specification. The sample is all counties within 100 miles of the march. Standard errors are clustered at the county level.

 Each column is a separate county-year level regression of the indicated agricultural outcome on an indicator equal to one if
   the county is within five miles of Sherman’s march, interacted with decades dummy and a dummy for high density of High
   Wealth Individuals in 1850, plus the noted fixed effects and controls. The 1860 county controls include size of the county,
   measured in squared miles; population; size of the agricultural output; and intensity in cotton production; average slave
   ownership per farm; share of manufacturing employment; plantation county; and railroad miles. In general, to flexibly con-
   trol for these characteristics of the county in 1860, we divide the sample in four quartiles along each of these characteristics
   and then add them in the regression interacted with time dummies. More info on variables are in the text where we discuss
   the main specification. The sample is all counties within 100 miles of the march and all decades, 1850-1920, as discussed
   in the paper. The dummy for High Wealth is equal to one for those counties that are in the top quarter in terms of share
   individuals in the top 5% of the overall wealth distribution in 1850. The standard errors are clustered at the county level.

 Each column is a separate county-year level regression of the indicated agricultural outcome on an indicator equal to one
   if the county is within five miles of Sherman’s march, interacted with an indicators for post 1860 decades and a dummy
   for high density of High Wealth Individuals in 1850, plus the noted fixed effects and controls. The 1860 county controls
   include size of the county, measured in squared miles; population; size of the agricultural output; and intensity in cotton
   production; average slave ownership per farm; share of manufacturing employment; plantation county; and railroad miles.
   In general, to flexibly control for these characteristics of the county in 1860, we divide the sample in four quartiles along

 Each column is a separate county-industry-year level regression of the change from 1860 to 1870 in the indicated manufac-
   turing outcome on the displayed interaction terms, fixed effects, and controls. The 1860 county controls include size of the
   county, measured in squared miles; population; size of the agricultural output; and intensity in cotton production; aver-
   age slave ownership per farm; share of manufacturing employment; plantation county; and railroad miles. More info on
   variables are in the text where we discuss the main specification. High Bank Drop is a dummy which is equal to one for
   counties in the bottom half in terms of bank growth over 1859-1870. The sample is all counties within 100 miles of the
   march. Standard errors are clustered at the county level.
