Productivity Growth and R&D Expenditure in Taiwan’s Manufacturing Firms

JEL No. L6

                                        ABSTRACT

    This study sets out to estimate the impact of R&D on productivity within the private

sector, with further analysis of the different impacts of R&D in high-tech and conventional

firms. The study also aims to estimate the rates of return on R&D investment and total factor

productivity at firm level. Based on a sample of 136 large manufacturing firms listed on the

Taiwan Stock Exchange over the period 1994-2000, our findings suggest that Taiwan’s R&D

investment had a significant impact on firm productivity growth, with output elasticity

standing at around 0.18. When the sample is divided into high-tech and conventional firms,

the R&D output elasticity in high-tech firms is significantly greater than that of conventional

firms. In addition, the average rate of return in high-tech firms is much larger than that

estimated in other industries. Our empirical findings further show that although there was a

dramatic decline in TFP in 1998 for all selected industries, this nevertheless started to climb

again in 1999.

        INTRODUCTION

        Ever since the 1960s, research and development (R&D) investment has been regarded as

an important factor in the improvement of productivity levels. The rationale is that knowledge,

which can be created and accumulated through the R&D efforts of a firm or industry, will

subsequently become available to product innovations or to the production process (Mansfield,

1965; 1969), and as a result, nationwide economic development is promoted; indeed, the

advanced countries have invested significant expenditure on R&D activities based upon this

rationale.1

        Two notable issues have been explored, the first of which is the extent to which R&D

influences productivity, whilst the second is concerned with the rates of return provided by

R&D. Numerous studies have attempted to estimate the marginal product of R&D capital, or

the rates of return on R&D investment (see for example Griliches, 1980; 1994; Scherer,

1983; 1993; Griliches and Lichtenberg, 1984; Goto and Suzuki, 1989). Based upon several

different levels of data aggregation, or different types of estimation model, these studies

demonstrate that the output elasticity of R&D lies between 0.06 and 0.14, whilst the rates of

return on privately financed R&D investment are between 20 per cent and 50 per cent.

However, these studies have continually failed to produce consistent results, with some even

failing to determine the contribution of R&D to productivity growth (Link, 1983; Griliches

and Lichtenberg, 1984).

        A substantial amount of R&D expenditure is invested annually in Taiwan’s

manufacturing sector. According to data reported by the National Science Council (NSC)

(2001), the average share of R&D expenditure within the manufacturing sector accounts

for over 95 per cent of domestic R&D expenditure; however, the resultant growth in TFP,




    1
      For example, the average annual rates of R&D expenditure in the US and Japan, relative to GDP, are
around 2.64 per cent and 3.04 per cent, respectively (NSC, 2001).

                                                     2
the impact of R&D on productivity growth, and the rate of return on R&D expenditure

have seldom been seriously examined at firm level. This study sets out, therefore, to

estimate firm productivity growth based upon panel data for a sample of 136 firms for the

period 1994-2000. The aims of the study are to determine to what degree R&D

influences productivity, to further estimate the rates of return on R&D investment within

manufacturing firms, and to analyze the differences in productivity growth and the rates

of return on R&D investment between industries. Finally, we will test the famous

Schumpeterian hypothesis, that the returns on R&D are an increasing function of firm

size.

        Following on from this introduction, the remainder of this paper is organized as

follows. In the next section we undertake a review of previous studies in this area,

followed by an introduction to the methodology adopted in this study, including both the

model and the data resources employed in the estimations. Some basic statistics and the

results of our estimations and tests are presented and interpreted in the penultimate

section. We conclude with some remarks on our findings in the final section, where we

also offer some suggestions for further research.


        LITERATURE REVIEW

        In any general examination of previous studies, there are two main considerations;

the first is the level of data aggregation, and the second is the type of estimation model

used. At firm level, Griliches and Mairesse (1984; 1990) and Cuneo and Mairesse (1984)

used time series data to estimate the contribution of R&D based on the production function

model. They found that the approximate output elasticity of R&D capital lies between 0.06

and 0.10. In a cross-sectional study, Griliches (1995) further demonstrated that the output

elasticity of R&D stock was around 0.09-0.14. Adopting the model of R&D intensity, Clark

and Griliches (1984), Griliches (1986) and Lichtenberg and Siegel (1989) showed that in US


                                               3
manufacturing firms, the rates of return on R&D were between 10 per cent and 39 per cent.

Goto & Suzuki (1989) further concluded that the rates of return on R&D investment in

Japanese manufacturing industries tended to be around 40 per cent, and Wakelin (2001)

demonstrated that the rates of return on R&D capital were around 27 per cent in UK

manufacturing firms. However, in an earlier study, Link (1983) found that the R&D

coefficient in US manufacturing industries in the 1970s failed to achieve statistical

significance.

     At industry level, most researchers adopt an R&D intensity model. Terleckyj (1974),

Griliches and Lichtenberg (1984), Scherer (1993) and Griliches (1994) each found that

the rates of return on privately financed R&D investment were between 20 per cent and

50 per cent in US manufacturing industries, whilst Goto and Suzuki (1989) showed that

the estimated R&D rates of return in Japanese manufacturing industries were around 26

per cent. Furthermore, van Meijl (1997), Vuori (1997) and Hanel (2000) found that the

rates of return on R&D investment within manufacturing industries in France, Finland

and Canada were around 19 per cent, 14 per cent and 34 per cent, respectively. It should

be noted, however, that Scherer (1983) concluded that the impact of R&D on productivity

was insignificant.

     There are two points worth noting from any examination of the previous studies. First

of all, most of the empirical findings demonstrate that R&D investment does have a

significant effect on productivity growth or value added; but we should also keep in mind

that such a general summary of prior empirical studies may be overoptimistic because of

the ‘file drawer’ problem, i.e., the likelihood of studies supporting the null hypothesis (no

significant results) being rejected and therefore buried away in file drawers (Rosenthal,

1979; Begg and Berlin, 1988).




                                                4
         Secondly, estimations with the R&D intensity model often neglect the obsolescence

of R&D. Most of the previous studies have substituted R&D expenditure for increments

in R&D capital in order to avoid the difficult task of measuring R&D capital; however,

such a substitution not only neglects the reduction in the effective appropriation of

knowledge but also overestimates the net rates of return on R&D (see for example

Wakelin, 2001; Hanel, 2000; Lichtenberg and Siegel, 1991; Griliches and Lichtenberg,

1984).


         METHODOLOGY

         The Model

         In common with most analyses of the contribution to productivity growth from

R&D (see for example, Griliches, 1986; Goto and Suzuki, 1989; Lichtenberg and Siegel,

1991; Hanel, 2000; Wakelin, 2001), the model adopted for this study is the extended

Cobb-Douglas production function model:2


                                              Qit = Αeλt Lαit K it1−α Ritγ eε it                          (1)


         where Q, L, K and R respectively represent value added (or sales), labor, physical

capital and R&D capital. R&D capital is a measurement of the stock of knowledge

possessed by a firm at a given point in time; λ is the rate of disembodied technical change;

A is a constant; and constant returns to scale have been assumed with respect to the

conventional factors (L and K). The parameters, α and γ, are the output elasticity of labor

and R&D capital.

         By taking logarithms of the variables, equation (1) can be expressed in log form:3



     2
       One could of course consider more complicated functional forms, such as the Trans-log or CES
functions, but we use the C-D function based on most empirical studies and on some exploratory
computations.
     3
       By taking logs differentiated with respect to time, and imposing the equality of rates of return on R&D

                                                           5
                                       (q − k )it = a + λt + α (l − k )it + γrit + ν it               (2)

     where the variables in lower case (q, l, k, and r) are the respective logarithms of value

added, labor, physical and R&D capital, and νit is the error term in the equation. Equation (2)

is the model employed to estimate the impact of R&D on productivity growth. Based upon

the estimate of γ in equation (2) and the definition of R&D output elasticity, the rates of

return on R&D investment can be easily estimated across firms and over periods.

Furthermore, to test the Schumpeterian hypothesis, another equation as follows is

considered:

                            ( q − k ) it = a + λt + a (l − k ) it + γrit + γ s s + eit              (3)


     where the variable s is the logarithm of the product of R&D capital by assets, γs is the

coefficient linking the relationship between the firm size and the impact of R&D on

productivity, and eit is the error term in the equation (3).

      Two points are worth noting relating to the disturbance terms, νit and eit. Firstly, in

addition to the inputs listed in the model, some unobservable factors, such as managerial

capabilities, also have considerable impacts on the creation of a firm’s value added

(Wernerfelt, 1984; Barney, 1991; Deteraf, 1993). These factors will vary across firms,

thus, the variances of νit and eit are heteroskedastic. In other words, the variance derived

from some unobservable factors is viewed as an error component of νit and eit.

      Secondly, within our data set, each firm is observed at several points during each




across firms, or over periods, we can rewrite equation (1) as a linear function of R&D intensity:
(dQ/Q-dK/K)it = λ + α(dL/L-dK/K)it + ρ(dR/Q)it + eit, where ρ = dQ/dR, representing the increment in value
added generated by a unit increase in R&D resource θ years earlier. With the newly-expressed model, we
would obviously estimate ρ directly; however, we have not pursued such an alternative model here since
this model presupposes that the rate of obsolescence of R&D capital is zero and assumes that the rates of
return on R&D investment are equal across firms and over periods.

                                                        6
year, and some factors omitted from equation (2) and (3) may be correlated across

periods. After accounting for this possibility, it seems reasonable to model the data as

having serial correlation. Since the empirical literature is overwhelmingly dominated by

the auto-regression with first order serial correlation (AR (1)) model (Greene, 1993), the

disturbance process with an AR (1) form is assumed in our model. To summarize, these

two problems will be considered in the estimations since they could result in biased or

inefficient estimates.

        The Data and Variables

        The examination of related issues is based on a longitudinal data set which includes

a sample of 156 large firms stratified from the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TSE). As a result

of a number of missing observations on R&D expenditure, and questionable data on

other variables, we have limited the sample to 136 firms. These samples are fully

balanced over the seven-year period, 1994-2000.

        The sample covers most R&D performing manufacturing industries, including food

(11 firms), textiles (31 firms), chemicals (30 firms), metals (9 firms), machinery (12

firms) and electronic equipment (43 firms).4 Since the number of firms within each of

these industries is too small to work with separately, we classify the sample into two

groups, high-tech firms within the electronic equipment industry (32 per cent), and other

industrial firms (68 per cent). 5 Through this method of classification, in addition to

alleviating the problem of heterogeneity, the difference in R&D effect on productivity

growth between the high-tech sector and other manufacturing firms can also be explored.

        Table 1 provides some general information on the samples and variables, in the

     5
       Here we divide the sample into two because R&D expenditure is the indicator most widely used in
identifying high-tech organizations or industries (Baruch, 1997).

      Based on the figures provided in Table 1, there are a number of interesting

observations to be made. First of all, the growth rates of labor and physical capital in the

electronic equipment industry are, to a great extent, higher than in other industries.

Secondly, the average growth rate of R&D to sales ratio is much more rapid in

‘high-tech’ firms than in other firms. Moreover, the R&D intensity in high-tech firms is

much higher than in other firms; for example, in 2000, the average ratio of R&D to sales

in electronic equipment was around two to five times that of other firms. Thirdly, there is

much more rapid growth in both R&D intensity and value added in high-tech firms. In

summary, the statistics provided in Table 1 suggest substantially noticeable development

of the electronic equipment industry in Taiwan.

      Whilst noting the descriptive statistics provided in Table 1, it is worth keeping in

mind that although our sample firms are so-called large manufacturing firms, firm size

differs significantly. During the observed periods, for all industries, all of the variation


                                                             8
coefficients of the variables are large; for example, in 2000, the respective variation

coefficients of labor and fixed assets in the electronic equipment industry were around

137 per cent and 60 per cent. These figures show that to a large degree, the dispersion of

firm size is high.

         In addition to output (value added), labor and physical capital, another major variable

in the estimation model is R&D capital, which has been viewed as a measurement of the

current state of technical knowledge, determined, in part, by current and past R&D

expenditure (Griliches, 1979). In other words, an increase in R&D capital in period t

reflects not only the R&D expenditure of period t but also previous R&D expenditure

which bears fruit during the period. There is some sort of distributed lag structure that

connects past R&D expenditure to a current increase in technical knowledge, and ideally,

one would like to estimate the lag structure from the data. Unfortunately, it is difficult to

obtain the information required to determine the lag structure, thus, we simply use the

average lag.

         With the simplification of R&D impact lag structure (average lag), the measurement

of firm R&D capital is often expressed as: Rt = Et-θ + (1-δ)Rt-1 (following Griliches, 1980;

Goto and Suzuki, 1989; and Odagiri and Kinukawa, 1997), where E is a deflated

measure of R&D, θ is the average lag and δ is the rate of obsolescence of R&D capital.6

The equation leads to R&D expenditure in period t-θ becoming R&D capital in period t.

Assuming that the growth rate of R&D capital is equal to the growth rate of E, the R&D

capital of the original period is obtained as: R0 = E1-θ/(g+δ), where g is the growth rate of

E.




     6
       Other forms of lag structure, such as geometrically declining weights, could be assumed; however,
various constructed lag measures and different initial conditions make little difference to the results
(Griliches and Mairesse, 1984).



                                                     9
      Following on from the approach of Goto and Suzuki (1989), we use the average lag

θ, based on simplifying evidence. Patents are a good indicator of benefit creation (Bound,

et. al., 1984; Pakes and Griliches, 1984; Griliches, 1998), and according to Lin and Lee

(1996) and Tsai (1997), R&D investment has a significant impact on patents two years

later. Moreover, a simulation study indicated that the lag length of the effect of R&D

expenditure on productivity growth lies between one to three years (Xu, et al., 1998).

These findings suggest that the average lag in Taiwan is around two years. Pakes and

Schankerman (1984) also demonstrated that the R&D lag for the chemicals, machinery

and electronics industries is around two years; therefore, we set the average lag length as

2 (θ = 2) to measure R&D capital.7

      The depreciation rate (δ) reflects the replacement of old knowledge with new

knowledge, or the reduction in the effective appropriation of knowledge. As suggested

by Goto and Suzuki (1989), we examine the length of time taken by firms’ patents to

generate revenue in order to estimate the rate of obsolescence of R&D capital. We use the

inverse of the length of time to measure the rate of obsolescence of R&D capital with the

firms investigated being the sample used in our analysis. Amongst these firms, the

average rates of obsolescence were around 14.5 per cent in general machinery, 6.2 per

cent in food, 12.4 per cent in chemicals, 7.2 per cent in textiles, 6.5 per cent in metals and

20.4 per cent in electronic equipment.8




     7
       Lagged R&D expenditure is used in many studies but there is no general agreement on the correct
lag length. Hall and Mairesse (1995) pointed to the stability of firm R&D expenditure in the US and
Germany, and the insensitivity of the results to the choice of lag.
     8
       Odagiri and Kinukawa (1997) estimated the rate of obsolescence of R&D capital in four Japanese
industries, electrical machinery, transportation machinery, general machinery and chemicals. The
respective rates of obsolescence were 13.9 per cent, 11.3 per cent, 7.2 per cent, and 9.2 per cent. Goto and
Suzuki (1989) also demonstrated that the respective rates of obsolescence of R&D capital in seven
Japanese industries were: 24.6 per cent (precision machinery), 14.5 per cent (communications equipment),
14.2 per cent (transportation equipment), 6 per cent (food), 7.2 per cent (general machinery), 7.2 per cent
(stone, clay and glass) and 7.5 per cent (non-ferrous metals).

                                                       10
        As suggested in Griliches and Mairesse (1984), and undertaken by Goto and Suzuki

(1989), we measure output (Q) by value added, deflated by the wholesale price index,

rather than by sales. Another consideration is that one element of the observations on

non-energy intermediate materials or energy input is unavailable. Labor (L) is measured

simply by the total number of employees because there is no available information on the

labor working hours of firms. Note that R&D manpower is deducted from labor since

R&D manpower is evaluated as R&D expenditure. Our measure of physical capital (K)

is total fixed gross assets; however, fixed gross assets in firms’ financial statements are

measured by nominal value (book value). We use the gross fixed capital price index from

The Trends in Multi-factor Productivity, published by the Directorate-General of Budget,

Accounting and Statistics, to deflate total fixed gross assets.

        Not only is the composition of R&D expenditure little known, but the available data

concerning real R&D expenditure is also bedeviled by the lack of a suitable price index

for R&D inputs. In view of the inherent difficulties, most of the previous studies have

adopted the same means used by US government officials, i.e., the use of the gross

domestic product index to deflate R&D expenditure. However, based on the GDP

deflator, the rate of increase of R&D expenditure is usually overestimated. Here we

construct the deflator index to deflate R&D expenditure as in Mansfield et al. (1983).9


        THE RESULTS

        Since the analyzed sample is a panel data set, a random effects model is assumed in

our analysis.10 A number of different models based upon equation (2) are estimated using



    9
       Although we used the GDP deflator of each industry to deflate R&D expenditure and then
constructed R&D capital, such an alternative construction makes little difference to the estimates.
     10
        Equation (2) can be treated as a fixed or random effects panel model. Since the chi-square
tests, suggested by Hausman (1978), come from different models based upon equation (2) show
that the exploratory variables are most likely uncorrelated with the individual effects, a random
effects panel model is assumed in this study.

the estimates of the product term of R&D capital by assets for all firms, as well as

separately for high-tech and other firms. The estimates, denoted by γs, of the product of

R&D stock by assets are used to test the Schumpeterian hypothesis.

        Before estimating the model, in order to test the assumption of constant returns to scale with respect
to the conventional factors, we rewrite the equation (2) as: (q-k)I = a + λt + α(l-k)it+ ωkit+ γrit+ νit , where ω
= α+β-1. If ω is significantly different to zero, the constant returns to scale for labor and physical capital
can then be rejected. Here the estimate of ω is approximately 0.021 (t=0.96, P>0.05), which indicates that
the assumption is not rejected at the 5 per cent significance level.

      The comparisons of Table 2 and Table 3 clearly show that using year dummy

variables instead of a linear trend makes little difference to the estimates of the whole

sample. The estimate of R&D capital elasticity (γ), lying between 0.18 and 0.20, is

significant at the 1 per cent level, with the results showing that R&D has a significant

impact on productivity growth.

      Since the sample comprised of firms engaging in R&D in rather diverse industries,

it was also of interest to investigate the differences between sectors. When the sample is

split into two categories, the estimates for the two groups are indeed rather distinct.12 The

estimate of R&D capital elasticity, at around 0.30 for high-tech firms, is much larger than

for other firms. Note that the estimate of R&D output elasticity for other firms is around

only 0.06, which is even insignificant in the model without year dummies. In addition,

although the difference in the estimated time-trend coefficients (the rate of technical




     12
        Dividing the sample into two allows for much of the heterogeneity, bringing down the sum of the
square of errors (SSE) by around 12 per cent (corresponding to a high F ratio of 16.05, p<0.01).

                                                             13
progress λ) between high-tech firms and other firms is rather significant, the estimates of

λ are significant in the high-tech firms (λ=0.125, p<0.01) but insignificant for other

firms.

     Given estimates of γ, the estimates of dQ/dR are calculated by multiplying the

estimates of γ multiplied by the ratio of value added to the stock of R&D. The estimated

average rates of return on R&D investment for the whole sample during the periods

1996-2000 were around 23 to 25 per cent. Compared to the findings of previous studies –

that the analytical unit is at firm level – our results are consistent with the similar

estimates of 21 per cent for the US (Lichtenberg and Siegel, 1991) and 27 per cent for the

UK (Wakelin, 2001), but considerably lower than the 40 per cent found in Japan (Goto

and Suzuki, 1989). Furthermore, the estimated rates of return on investment in R&D for

each industry, for the years 1996 to 2000, are listed in Table 4. The estimates in Table 4

suggest that the average rates of return on R&D capital for the high-tech industry, at

around 35 per cent, are much larger than in other industries, at around 8 to 10 per cent.

     The Schumpeterian hypothesis (1950) supported the belief of a greater likelihood of

large firms both undertaking research activities, and achieving a measure of success.


                                                             14
However, although Link (1981) found evidence of a systematic relationship between

firm size and the impact of R&D on productivity, the empirical results of Lichtenberg

and Siegel (1991) did not provide support for the Schumpeterian hypothesis. In our

investigation, using total assets as a proxy for firm size, the estimates are positive for all

firms, irrespective of whether or not the model contains year dummy variables, but

insignificant at the 5 per cent level.

      When the sample is divided into two categories (high-tech firms and other firms),

the γs estimates (the parameter of the product term of R&D capital by total assets) are still

insignificant. Obviously, with respect to R&D impact on productivity, we are unable to

determine from these findings whether different size ‘regimes’ exist. Aside from total

fixed assets, we also use sales as a proxy variable for firm size. At the 5 per cent

significance level, the tests of the estimates of γs still do not demonstrate that the impact

of R&D on productivity growth is an increasing function of firm size.13

      In addition, the estimates listed in Tables 2 and 3 also show that the labor share (α)

in high-tech firms is small. One possible explanation is that the value added in high-tech

firms is created mainly through their R&D efforts, such as new product development,

represented by the amount of R&D expenditure, and the input of R&D manpower is

deducted from the total numbers of employees. Since the contribution from ordinary

labor (the remaining employees of totality) to value added is always lower, the estimates

here seem to be reasonable. The results are also consistent with the finding of 0.27 by

Griliches and Mairesse (1984) in scientific firms (N=77).

      Based on the estimates of α for each of the two categories, and the conventional




     13
        One attribution of the statistical insignificance is that all of our sample firms are ‘large’ firms.
However, firm size amongst these so-called large firms differs significantly. For example, in 2000, the
average amount of total fixed assets in high-tech firms was NT$15,187,200, and the standard deviation was
NT$8,760,197. The coefficient of variation (the ratio of standard deviation to mean) exceeds 50 per cent.

definition of TFP (TFP=Q/LαK1-α), we can further calculate the annual TFP growth rates

for each industry. These estimated are listed in Table 5, which shows that there was a

dramatic decline in TFP growth rates in 1998, which nevertheless started to rise again

after 1999.14 The results show that the TFP growth in these industries seems to depend

upon short-term fluctuations, and one obvious and possible explanation for this is the

severe impact on the Taiwanese economy from the Asian financial crises between the

fourth quarter of 1997 and the first quarter of 1999.

     CONCLUSIONS

     In this study, we have analyzed the relationship existing between output (value

added), employment, physical capital and R&D capital, based upon a complete sample of

136 large firms listed in the TSE over the period 1994-2000. Our findings suggest that

R&D investment was a significant determinant of firm productivity growth during the

second half of the 1990s. For the whole sample, R&D output elasticity was around 0.18;

however, when the sample is divided into two categories, high-tech and other firms, we



    13
     This trend is consistent with the calculation reported in The Trend in Multi-factor Productivity
(DGBAS, 2001). However, the figures listed in Table 5 cannot be compared with overall estimates of total



                                                          16
observe a statistically significant difference in R&D elasticity between the two samples.

The R&D elasticity for high-tech firms is around 0.3, but only 0.07 for other firms. In

addition, we find that the average rate of return on investment in high-tech firms, at

around 35 per cent, is larger than that estimated in other firms, at around 9 per cent. Our

study also demonstrates that TFP growth declined across all the selected industries in

1998, but then started to pick up again after 1999. We speculate that the slump in TFP

growth rates in 1998 can be attributed, to a large extent, to the Asian financial crisis.

Moreover, our empirical results do not support the Schumpterian hypothesis, which

states that the impact of R&D on productivity is an increasing function of firm size.

      Nevertheless, a couple of related points need to be discussed further. Firstly, the

impact on productivity from these different types of R&D may differ markedly. In

general terms, R&D work can be classified into three types, basic research, applied

research and technical development. A number of studies have found that the

contribution from basic research is greater than that of either applied research or

technical development (see for example, Griliches and Siegel, 1991; Martin, 1998; Salter

and Martin, 2001). However, since the proportion of R&D expenditure spent on basic

research in Taiwanese manufacturing firms has been rather small, our estimations should

still be valid, even though we do not take into consideration the distinction between these

different types of R&D.

      Secondly, the double counting of capital and R&D capital may bias the estimated

effects of R&D. The estimate of R&D intensity or R&D capital is not particularly

accurate when certain types of expenditure are accounted for in both R&D capital and

ordinary capital (Schankerman, 1981). R&D expenditure in Taiwan has been clearly




factor productivity since the estimates in Taiwan are always calculated at industry level.

maintenance, and the acquisition of equipment for R&D purpose (NSC, 2001). In

accordance with the ‘Statute for Industrial Upgrading’, the R&D expenditure of any

firms in Taiwan applying for R&D tax credits is closely scrutinized by the tax authorities,

therefore, the purchase of equipment for R&D projects has to be recorded in R&D

expenses, but not necessarily in fixed assets. Thus, potential double counting of capital

should have little impact on the estimated effects of R&D.

      Thirdly, capital utilization rates should be considered in this analysis.15 In this study

we have assumed that the short-term fluctuations in TFP came as a result of the Asian

financial crisis. According to the findings of Wang et al. (1999), the Asian financial crisis

damaged the exports of Taiwan’s manufacturing industries and further reduced the

utilization rates of manufacturing equipment. Thus, in order to exclude the demand

shock from the Asian financial crisis, capital utilization rates should be regarded as an

exploratory variable in the empirical model. Unfortunately, the capital utilization rates of

the sample firms cannot be determined, and the variable cannot be constructed from

other variables in the current data-set.

      Fourthly, we have tried to separate the effects arising from inter-industry differences.

Our analysis covers several industries, and in order to reduce the estimated bias of R&D

effects on the characteristic differences across these industries, we include industry

dummies in the estimated model. However, the use of industry dummy variables brings

down the sum of the square of errors (SSE) by only around 0.62 percent, corresponding

to a low F ratio of 0.69 (p>0.05), and since the omnibus test (F-test) is not significant at




     14
         We appreciate the insightful suggestions provided by Professor Tsutomu Miyagawa and Jungho
Yoo, and have tried to use industrial utilization rates of manufacturing equipment as a proxy for firms’
capacity utilization rates. Although the estimates are not significant at the 5 per cent level, we consider that
this insignificance is most likely the result of the use of a proxy.

                                                         18
the 5 percent significant level, we ignore the impact of the industry dummy variable on

the estimation.

     Fifthly, one may doubt that the lager R&D estimate in the high tech firms is coming

spuriously at the expense of the labor coefficient. To address this concern, alpha is fixed

to labor’s share in the model. This restriction does not make the estimates significant

difference compared to the findings in Tables 2 and 3. This robustness check confirms

our finding that the R&D output elasticity in high tech firms is significantly greater than

that of other firms.

     Finally, the sample period which we have observed, from 1994 to 2000, coincides

with the IT boom; therefore, the potential exists for the IT bubble to have causes a

disturbance to TFP growth trends during our study period. Throughout the IT bubble

period, telecommunications and the Internet formed the backbone of IT investment, and

although Taiwanese firms were involved in the IT boom, their Internet business was still

at a rather embryonic stage and the telecommunications industry remained small, thus

limiting the impact of the IT bubble.

     Our study does of course have its limitations. First of all, as in the standard approach,

we aggregate R&D expenditure linearly into R&D stock, ignoring the possibility that

knowledge production depends non-linearly, not only on current efforts, but also on

previously accumulated outcomes. Secondly, the results cannot explain the

time-dimensional differences of R&D performance across firms, since the time period is

not yet long enough; our estimation also fails to reveal how the impacts of R&D on

productivity growth are actually realized. Thirdly, it may be worth trying to include in the

estimation model a skills variable, such as the number of engineers and technicians;

however, we cannot separate the effects of a skills variable because most of the firms in

the sample omit many of the observations on these related variables. Fourthly, we do not



                                               19
discuss the more general topic of simultaneous R&D decisions (simultaneity), which has

recently entered into the discussion. If R&D is chosen on the basis of economic

incentives, it is unlikely to be completely independent of the errors which affect the

production relations that we attempt to estimate in this study. Finally, although our

sample does cover 136 large manufacturing firms belonging to six industries, it clearly

cannot represent all manufacturing firms; therefore, the interpretation of the findings in

our study should remain conservative.
