Interracial Workplace Cooperation: Evidence from the NBA

                                             ABSTRACT

Using data from the National Basketball Association (NBA), we examine whether patterns of workplace
cooperation occur disproportionately among workers of the same race. We find that, holding constant
the composition of teammates on the floor, basketball players are no more likely to complete an assist
to a player of the same race than a player of a different race. Our confidence interval allows us to
reject even small amounts of same-race bias in passing patterns. Our findings suggest that high levels
of interracial cooperation can occur in a setting where workers are operating in a highly visible setting
with strong incentives to behave efficiently.

Introduction

       Recent research shows that when individuals are forced to make quick decisions,

they often exhibit same-race preferences, even if they are unwilling to admit to biased

racial attitudes. For example, Price and Wolfers (2007) show that NBA referees are more

likely to call fouls against players of a different race than players of their own race and

Parsons et al. (2008) find that umpires are more likely to call strikes for pitchers of their

own race. Similarly, Antonovics and Knight (2005) find that police are less likely to

search the vehicle of someone of their own race and Donohue and Levitt (2001) find that

an increase in the number of police of a certain race is associated with an increase in

arrests of people of the other race.

       This same-race bias could play an important role in collaboration among

colleagues in a workplace. For example, managers might be more likely to give

favorable assignments to same-race employees. Alternatively, colleagues may depend

disproportionately on same-race colleagues for advice or help. Collectively, such

decisions may reduce the workplace productivity and satisfaction of employees of a

minority race. These decisions may play a role in explaining the extent of workplace

segregation (Hellerstein and Neumark 2008). Furthermore, this bias would undermine

the argument that productivity is higher in groups that are ethnically diverse (Page 2007).

       In this paper, we examine the effects of group heterogeneity on teamwork by

studying specific and measurable actions within teams. In traditional firm-level data, it is

often difficult to obtain measures of cooperation. As a result, we use play-by-play data

from the National Basketball Association (NBA). These data allow us to determine for

each basket completed who passed the ball and which other players were on the court at




                                                                                                1
the time. We develop a simple model which allows the optimal pass to depend on the

particular combination of teammates on the floor. We then test whether the pattern of

observed assists demonstrates evidence of same-race bias.

       We find no evidence that, conditional on the set of teammates on the court,

players are more likely to pass to a teammates of their same race. Our baseline empirical

strategy controls non-parametrically for the joint distribution of shot quality for all

teammates on the floor. In other words, we account for differences in ability across

teammates. Furthermore, the shooting opportunities of one teammate are allowed to

depend arbitrarily on the set of other teammates on the floor. Robustness checks, in

which we reduce the flexibility of our empirical specification to increase statistical

precision, yield the same substantive results. Our evidence suggests that in workplaces

where employees have common goals and extensive experience working with each other,

cross-race cooperation may not be a problem.



Similarity and Cooperation

       There is considerable research, both empirical and theoretical, indicating that

diversity can lead to improved economic outcomes (Alesina and La Ferrera 2005; Hong

and Page 2004; Alesina, Spolaore, and Wacziarg 2000). These gains from diversity

depend on the various groups being willing to cooperate. This may explain why other

studies have found that increased racial diversity is associated with lower group

performance (Kurtulus 2008; Timmerman 2000). In this paper, we expand the literature

on the effects of group heterogeneity on outcomes by studying specific and measurable

actions within teams.




                                                                                          2
       Our analysis of cooperation is one form of own-race bias that has been

documented in other types of interaction including referee-player (Price and Wolfers

2007; Parsons et al. 2008), employer-employee (Stoll, Raphael, and Holzer 2004) and

officer-offender (Antonovics and Knight 2004, Donohue and Levitt 2001). What

distinguishes cooperation from these other settings is that players are working together

towards a common objective, while these other settings involve a more adversarial

relationship. In addition, there is research showing that the racial composition of one’s

group affects decisions similar to cooperation, such as willingness to provide a public

good (Martinez-Vazquez, Rider, and Walker 1997), form a coalition (Brasington 1999),

or increase welfare spending (Luttmer 2001).



NBA Data

       Our analysis draws on play-by-play data that we collected from espn.com for all

regular season and playoff games during October 2002-June 2008. The data includes an

entry for every occurrence during the game that might be important for compiling game-

level statistics. For each shot that is completed on the court, the data provide the name of

the person who shot the basket and the person who was awarded with an assist, if the shot

was assisted (58.9% are). Using times of substitutions in the data, we apply recursive

methods to determine the ten players on court at any given time.

       Thus, for each assisted shot we know who the passer was and the set of four

players would have been available to receive the pass. For each of these players we

merge in information about their race, position, and other characteristics. The player’s

race information comes from data collected by Kahn and Shah (2005), Price and Wolfers




                                                                                            3
(2007) and our own coding from more recent online photos of the players. Our racial

coding is based on a simple measure of “black” or “not-black.”

         Table 1 shows summary statistics from our sample. White players completed

36.7 percent of the shots and 20.3 percent of the passes in our sample. 1 Separating the

probability that the shooter is white based on the race of the passer (as done in columns 2

and 3) provides an initial estimate of racial gaps in passing. A white passer is 3.89

percentage points more likely to complete an assist to a white shooter than is a black

passer (the t-statistic for this difference is 12.4). This simple estimate fails to capture any

clumping of white players on the same team (or on the court together) or differences in

the positions they play.

         As additional controls for our analysis, we include information about the passer’s

position, how many years he has been on the current team, whether or not the pass occur

during the fourth quarter of a game in which one of the teams is ahead by more than 15

points at the start of the fourth quarter (a blowout game), and whether or not the pass

occurs at a time in the fourth quarter when in which one of the teams is ahead by no more

than 4 points (a close game).

         As part of our empirical strategy, we construct identifiers for each unique group

of four players available to receive a pass on a particular play. We limit our analysis to

passing opportunities in which there was at least one player of each race available to

receive the pass. This eliminates about 48.1% of our observations for situations in which

the four players available to receive the pass are black and another 4.36% of our


1
  These are an overestimate of the actual fraction of passes and shots made by white players because our
sample is limited to observations in which there was at least one player of each race available to receive the
pass. Without this restriction, white players would make 21.2% of the shots which is roughly in line with
their representative in the NBA.


                                                                                                            4
observations when those four players are white. Including these observations in our

sample would bias our estimates of own-race discrimination towards zero, since the

passer in these situations has no choice regarding the race of the player he can pass to.



Model and Empirical Strategy

       Before progressing to our empirical specification and findings, it is helpful to

outline a simple economic model of cooperation. Basketball involves complex offensive

and defensive strategies. For this reason, we define a simpler game that will highlight the

intuition involved and suggest an empirical strategy for identifying possible same-race

bias in passing patterns.

       Consider a game with five players. One of the five players is initially endowed

with the ball. The player then passes the ball to one of the four remaining players with

the best shot at the basket. We define S as the set of four players available for the pass.

Player i ∈ S has an opportunity for shot, the quality of which is given by μi . Player

j ∈ S is another player in the passer’s choice set with shot quality μ j . We do not

assume that μi and μ j are independent or identically distributed. We do, however,

assume that both are independent of the player passing the ball. We assume that the

player with the ball passes to his teammate with the highest quality shot. Given these




                                                                                              5
assumptions, the probability that the player with the ball passes to player i given the set

of available passing options, S, can be written θ i ,S = prob ( μi > μ j ∀j ≠ i ∈ S ) . 2

             This simple model suggests a tractable empirical specification to test the role of

race in on-the-job cooperation. We can estimate the following linear probability model:

(1)          1scorer
              S,p
                     =white
                            = θ w,S + β1assister
                                        S,p
                                                 =white
                                                        +εp ,

               = white
Where 1Sscorer
          ,p           is an indicator variable that takes on a value of 1 if the player scoring

the basket is white, given the set of available scorers S, during possession p. θ w,S is

estimated by a set of dummy variables for every combination of four players available to

receive the assist. This controls non-parametrically for the probability that a white player

has the best shot, taking into account the joint distribution of shot quality among all

players eligible for a pass. Thus, θ w,S accounts both for the talent of every player

available for a pass, as well as how the players interact while on the floor together.

          = white
1assister
 S,p              takes one a value of 1 if the player making the assist is white and ε p is the

residual.

             Identification arises from the fact that both a white and a black player choose

among the same set of teammates when passing the ball. If white and black passers are

solving the same optimization problem with the same constraints, β should be

statistically insignificant from zero. A non-zero coefficient suggests that the race of the

    As an example of this, consider the case where             μi = μi + ε i , where μi    represents fixed player ability
and    εi   is distributed according to a Type 1 extreme value distribution. In this case, the probability that the

                                                                                 ∑ exp ( μ )

                                                                                            j

                                                                                                                             6
passer and potential scorers affects the pattern of assists and hence on-the-job

cooperation.

       The disadvantage of our preferred approach is that it consumes literally tens of

thousands of degrees of freedom since we include separate fixed effects for sets of

players that differ only by a single role-player. In doing so, we discard large amounts of

potentially useful information. To the extent that we can approximate θ w,S without the

inclusion of so many dummy variables, we will increase the precision of the estimated

same-race bias.

       To do so, we calculate the fraction of assisted baskets scored by a player while on

the floor, excluding baskets in which that player made the assist. This is calculated

separately for each season. For player i, we denote this probability πˆi . One potential

proxy for θ w,S is given by:

(2)     θˆwproxy
            ,S
                 1
                   =    ∑
                       i∈W ∩ S
                                 πˆi ,


where W is the set of white players and S is the set of potential pass recipients on the

court. While this measure is simple, it fails to take into account any interactions between

players on the court. A symptom of this is that even if all potential pass recipients were

white, the measure would almost certainly be above or below one.

       For this reason, we construct a second proxy by normalizing this measure by the

propensity of all players in the choice set to score off an assist. Our second proxy is

given by:

                        ∑ πˆ          i
(3)     θˆwproxy 2
                   =   i∈W ∩S
                                          .
                        ∑ πˆ
            ,S
                                  j
                         j∈S




                                                                                             7
This has the advantage that if all potential pass recipients were white, the measure is

constrained to equal one. It also takes into account that a player’s probability of scoring

depends on the skill of the other teammates on the floor. It fails to take into account,

however, all of the possible idiosyncratic interactions between teammates the way our

preferred approach does.

          Using the second of these two proxies, we supplement our primary findings by

estimating linear probability models of the following form 3 .

(4)       1scorer
           S, p
                  = white
                          = α 0 + α1θ wproxy
                                        ,S
                                             2
                                               + β1assister
                                                   S, p
                                                            = white
                                                                    +εp

If our proxy performs well, we would expect our estimate of α1 to be close to one.

Under the null hypothesis of no same-race bias, we would still expect β to be close to

zero. 4

          One concern with all specifications is that we have data on only completed assists.

Thus, we cannot determine passes that were made that did not lead to shots and potential

assists that were not converted. While these possibilities could affect the apparent

magnitude of same-race bias, they do not affect the sign of the coefficient. Suppose a

player systematically passes to teammates of his own race, even though they have worse

shots than teammates of another race. In this case, assists between players of the same

race will be relatively more common than assists between players of differing races. This

difference in assists will be less than the difference in attempted assists, however,

because passes made for race-based reasons will be less likely to lead to converted


3
  We also estimate all of regressions using logit (table 3) and conditional logit (table 2) regressions. The
marginal effects and standard errors are nearly identical to those using linear probabilitiy models.
4
  In all specifications, we cluster correct the standard errors at the team level. This takes into account that
passing decisions may not be independent across assist opportunities. For example, a particular player may
consistently look to pass to a certain teammate for reasons independent of the race of the two players.


                                                                                                             8
baskets. When players choose to score alone or make a pass to a teammate out of

position to score instead of assisting to a teammate of a differing race, this also increases

the relative frequency of same-race assists. Thus data limitations may affect the

magnitude of the observed same-race bias, but our procedure still provides a valid test for

the existence of same-race passing preferences.



Findings

         Table 2 shows the results from our empirical examination using our baseline

method. The first column shows our baseline specification with fixed effects for each of

the four player combinations but no additional covariates. We find that the probability

that the shooter is white increases by 0.97 percentage points relative to a baseline

probability of 36.7 percentage points (or a 2.6% increase) and is not statistically

significant. Even at the upper end of the 95% confidence interval, a white passer is only

2.5 percentage points more likely to pass to a white teammate than a black passer. 5

         In the second column, we include additional controls for the position of the

passer. This addresses the concern that differences in the position mix between black and

white players may lead to differences in passing patterns that are unrelated to preferences.

The resulting coefficients are virtually identical to the baseline estimates.

         In the third column, we interact the race of the passer with a dummy variable

indicating whether or not the passer is in his first year on the team. This tests the


5
  While we find no effect of same-race bias in passing patterns, an apparent effect would not necessarily
indicate on-court animus. Instead, a high incidence of within race passing might indicate familiarity
between players of the same race. In other words, a white player might be happy to make a pass to a black
player in position to score but instead passes to a white teammate because he knows better where that
teammate will be on the floor. In this case, race-based social investments off the court translate into low
levels of cross-racial cooperation off the court. While the proximate cause of the racial bias differs, the
ultimate consequence is the same.


                                                                                                          9
hypothesis that as a passer becomes more familiar with his teammates, he will show less

same-race bias. The coefficient on the interaction between race and the first year on team

dummy is extremely small (-1.5 percentage points) and is not statistically significant.

       In the fourth column, we examine a set of possessions in which one team is more

than fifteen points ahead of another in the fourth quarter. In such cases, because the

outcome of the game is already determined, players may be more willing to make

inefficient passes to same-race teammates. When we estimate our model with such a

specification, we find that the coefficient becomes about nine times as large but much

less precisely estimated. The coefficient indicates that, in these settings, white passers are

about 9.1 percentage points more likely to pass to a white shooter. This estimate is not

statistically significant and given the large standard errors, we cannot reject that this

coefficient is the same for the full sample. However, the results suggest that racial bias

may occur when the outcome of a particular task is no longer dependent on the worker’s

decisions.

       We also perform a similar analysis on shots made during fourth quarter when the

score is within four points. In contrast to blowout games, players in such situations may

be willing to put aside racial bias in order to win the game. Indeed, we find that the

coefficient is one-third as large as in our baseline specification, although much less

precisely estimated.

       Table 3 shows estimates of alternative specifications in which we approximate

θ w,S as shown in equation (3). As expected, we find that our estimate of θ w,S is close to

one, indicating that our constructed measure is a good proxy for the probability that the

assist recipient is white. Our test of own-race bias is based on whether deviations from

of a preference by players to pass to players of their own race. Our estimate in the first

column indicates that the probability that a white player receives an assist is only 0.09

percentage points higher when the passer is white than when the passer is black. This

difference is even smaller when we control for the position of the passer.

       In the third column, we test whether this measure of same-race bias changes as

players are with the same team longer. There is little evidence that this occurs. In the

fourth column, we look at the blowout games and find a very small negative coefficient

(the opposite of same-race bias) that is imprecisely estimated. Finally, in the fifth column,

we examine close games and discover a large positive coefficient that is also imprecisely

estimated.



Interpretation and Conclusion

       Assist patterns in the NBA exhibit very little evidence of same-race bias. More

specifically, given a particular set of players on the court, a white passer is no more likely

to pass to a white teammate than a black passer. While this result is interesting, it is

important to note why the high degree of interracial cooperation may be specific to the

NBA.

       Our model can be thought of as the final node in a more complex game in which

players are matched to teams and coaches decide which players are on the floor and

which plays are run. To the extent that some players exhibit strong same race

preferences, they may be matched to teams with a high frequency of same-race

teammates. Conditional upon the team roster, coaches may choose personnel




                                                                                             11
combinations in which efficient passing choices occur. Such optimizing behavior does

not affect the consistency of our results. It does imply, however, that our results only

reflect the level of same-race bias in situations that occur in equilibrium. The average

level of same race bias may be higher.

       In many workplace environments, the effect of same-race bias in may not be

immediately apparent or have little impact on the actors involved. The NBA differs from

such instances in that player behavior is closely observed by coaches, owners, and many

thousands of fans and the result of poor interracial cooperation may have an immediate

effect on the outcome of the game. Also, to the extent that players derive utility from

winning, they have an immediate incentive to engage in interracial cooperation.

       Ultimately, our findings do not imply that efficient interracial cooperation occurs

throughout the economy. They do imply, however, that interracial cooperation can occur

in equilibrium when incentives are well aligned for efficient cooperation. Firms may

want to consider how they can alter incentives to promote efficient cooperation among a

diverse workforce.
