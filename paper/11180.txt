This paper augments the neoclassical growth model to study the macroeconomic effects of

idiosyncratic investment risk. The general equilibrium is solved in closed form under standard

assumptions for preferences and technologies. A simple condition is identified for incomplete

markets to result in both a lower interest rate and a lower capital stock in the steady state: the

elasticity of intertemporal substitution must be higher than the income share of capital. For plausible

calibrations of the model, the reduction in the steady-state levels of aggregate savings and income

relative to complete markets is quantitatively significant. Finally, cyclical variation in private

investment risks is shown to amplify the transitional dynamics.

1        Introduction
Following Bewley (1977), Aiyagari (1994) and Krusell and Smith (1998), an extensive literature
has examined the macroeconomic implications of idiosyncratic labor-income risk, but has largely
neglected idiosyncratic risks in private production and capital returns.1 In contrast, the typical
investor in the US economy — and presumably even more so in less developed economies — appears
to be exposed to large idiosyncratic risks in capital returns: privately-held businesses account for
almost half of aggregate production, employment, and capital in the United States.2
        This paper provides a tractable benchmark for examining the macroeconomic eﬀects of idio-
syncratic investment risk within the context of the neoclassical growth model. It then makes a first
attempt at quantifying these eﬀects.
        I introduce uninsured idiosyncratic investment risk in an otherwise standard neoclassical growth
economy. Households supply labor in a competitive labor market, but invest capital in privately-
held firms. Firms, in turn, operate a neoclassical technology subject to firm-specific productivity
shocks, which translate to idiosyncratic capital-income risk for the households. Households have
isoelastic (CRRA/CEIS) preferences. They can freely borrow and lend in a riskless bond, but they
can not diversify their capital-income risk.
        A key property of the neoclassical growth model is not aﬀected by the introduction of idio-
syncratic investment risk: capital accumulation exhibits diminishing returns at the aggregate level,
but linear returns at the individual level. For given sequence of prices, the households’ decision
problem is homothetic and the optimal decision rules are therefore linear in individual wealth. As
a result, the aggregate dynamics do not depend on the wealth distribution, which avoids the “curse
of dimensionality” and permits closed-form solution of the general-equilibrium recursion.
        I next focus on the steady state. Incomplete markets introduce a risk premium on private
investment, which reduces the demand for capital. This eﬀect would unambiguously lead to a
lower capital stock if the interest rate were exogenous. However, the interest rate is lower than
the discount rate, because of the Aiyagari-like precautionary-savings eﬀect. The lower interest
rate in turn tends to stimulate investment. As a result, the general-equilibrium eﬀect on capital
accumulation is ambiguous in general. Nevertheless, a simple necessary and suﬃcient condition
is identified for the risk premium to dominate the reduction in the interest rate when risks are
small: incomplete markets lead to a lower capital stock if and only if the elasticity of intertemporal
substitution exceeds a threshold which is lower than the income share of capital.

        Quadrini (1999), Gentry and Hubbard (2000) and Carrol (2001) document the importance of private equity for
savings and wealth concentration. Moskowitz and Vissing-Jørgensen (2002) further document the dramatic lack of
diversification in the private-equity holdings and the overall portfolio of private investors, and the high cross-section
variation in the return to private equity. Finally, idiosyncratic investment risks need not be limited to private equity
if individuals do not diversify their public-equity holdings, housing, and other forms of savings.


                                                           1
      Since the income share of capital is much lower than most empirical estimates of the elasticity
of intertemporal substitution, a negative eﬀect on aggregate savings and income appears to be the
most likely scenario. Indeed, for plausible calibrations of the model, steady-state level of income
under incomplete markets is about 10% less than what under complete markets.
      These findings contrast sharply with the over-accumulation of capital predicted by Bewley-type
models where idiosyncratic risk is only in endowment or labor income (e.g., Aiyagari, 1994). They
also qualify the insights delivered by AK models such as Obstfeld (1994) and Jones, Manuelli, and
Stacchetti (2000). In these models, investment risk is known to have a positive eﬀect on savings and
growth when the elasticity of intertemporal substitution is less than one, but this is only because
the income share of capital is one.3
      In the benchmark model, the entire capital stock is held in private firms. I next extend the
model so that a fraction of aggregate savings is in “public equity”, where idiosyncratic risks are
pooled. Because the low risk-free rate stimulates investment in public equity, the negative impact
of incomplete markets on aggregate savings is significantly mitigated. Nevertheless, incomplete
markets now also reduce aggregate total factor productivity by shifting resources away from the
more risky but also more productive private equity. As a result, the impact on aggregate output
remains quantitatively important.
      In overall, although the lack of good estimates of the level of idiosyncratic investment risk does
not permit a precise calibration of the model, large quantitative eﬀects on savings and income are
consistent with small idiosyncratic risks and low excess returns in private equity: when I calibrate
the model so that the risk premium on private equity is as low as 1%, the reduction in the steady-
state level of income remains in the order of 10%.
      Turning to the transitional dynamics, I show that cyclical variation in private risk premia may
lead to amplification. Cyclical variation in private premia in turn originates in two separate sources:
cyclical variation in the level of uninsured investment risk; and the equilibrium interaction of wealth
and risk taking, namely the fact that, under incomplete markets, individual investment depends
on the present value of future income, which in turn depends on current aggregate investment.
This interaction indeed introduces a novel macroeconomic complementarity, a short of “Keynesian
accelerator”.
      In plausible calibrations, the complementarity alone turns out to have a rather modest eﬀect,
because it is oﬀset by the endogenous reaction of interest rates. In contrast, cyclical variation in
the level of idiosyncratic risk is found to have strong eﬀects: a “flight to quality” towards less risky
public equity during recessions generates endogenous cyclicality in the Solow residual and thereby
amplifies the transitional dynamics.

      The risk is idiosyncratic in Obstfeld (1994), whereas it is aggregate in Jones et. al. (2000). This makes little
diﬀerence, however, with a linear AK technology.

      Related Literature. The paper contributes to the Bewley literature (e.g., Aiyagari, 1994;
Huggett, 1993, 1997; Krusell and Smith, 1998) by examining the macroeconomic impact of idiosyn-
cratic investment risks. These risks are shown to have very diﬀerent steady-state and business-cycle
implications than labor-income risks.
      In this respect, the paper complements my work in Angeletos and Calvet (2003, 2004), which
also considered entrepreneurial risks, but assumed constant absolute risk aversion, thus killing
altogether the eﬀect of wealth on precautionary savings, risk taking, and investment. Here, instead,
I allow wealth eﬀects by assuming standard CRRA/CEIS preferences. I also introduce a competitive
labor market and a public-equity sector.
      Unlike the Bewley literature,4 however, the paper does contribute to the analysis of the wealth
distribution. It also takes the lack of insurance as exogenous. Meh and Quadrini (2004), instead,
examine an economy where the limits in the entrepreneurs’ ability to diversify idiosyncratic pro-
duction risks originate in lack of commitment.
      Also related is the literature on credit constraints and entrepreneurial activity (e.g., Bernanke
and Gertler, 1989, 1990; Banerjee and Newman, 1993; Kiyotaki and Moore, 1997; Caggeti and De
Nardi, 2003; Buera, 2004). Whereas this literature focuses on how wealth may aﬀect the ability to
invest when agents face credit constraints, this paper shows how wealth may aﬀect the willingness
to invest even in the absence of borrowing constraints. This distinction is important for at least
two reasons. First, although credit constraints and uninsurable risks share the prediction that
investment is sensitive to wealth, the welfare and policy implications may be quite diﬀerent. For
example, redistributing from the rich to the poor has no impact on aggregate productivity in the
model of this paper. Second, the impact of investment risk, unlike that of credit constraints,
need not vanish as agents get wealthier. This may help explain the diﬀerence with Kocherlakota
(2000), who finds the quantitative importance of credit constraints in baseline calibrations of the
neoclassical growth model to be limited.
      Finally, the paper extends and qualifies the literature that studies the role of rate-of-return
risk in linear growth models (e.g., Obstfeld, 1994; Jones, Manuelli, and Stacchetti, 2000; Krebs,
2003). As mentioned above, the results of this literature rely critically on the assumption that
agents do not have any fixed source of income beyond their capital. Moreover, this literature
obtains tractability only by eliminating transitional dynamics and therefore does not examine the
business-cycle implications of incomplete markets.

      The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the basic model. Section 3
characterizes the general equilibrium and Section 4 analyzes the steady state. Section 5 introduces
public equity and Section 6 examines the transitional dynamics. Section 7 concludes. All proofs
are in the Appendix.

2    The Model

Time is discrete, indexed by t ∈ {0, 1, ..., ∞}. The economy is populated by a continuum of infinitely-
lived households, indexed by i and distributed uniformly over [0, 1]. All firms in the economy are
privately held, and each household owns a single firm, so that firm i is identified as the firm
owned by household i. Firms employ labor in a competitive labor market but use the capital
stock accumulated by their respective household-owner. Households, on the other hand, are each
endowed with one unit of labor, which they supply inelasticly in the competitive labor market; they
can invest capital in the firm they own, but in no other firm; and they can freely trade a riskless
bond, but can not diversify the idiosyncratic risk in their capital income.

    Preferences. I assume a Kreps-Porteus/Epstein-Zin (KPEZ) specification with constant elas-
ticity of intertemporal substitution (CEIS) and constant relative risk aversion (CRRA). A stochastic
consumption stream {cit }∞                                           i ∞
                         t=0 generates a stochastic utility stream {ut }t=0 according to the recursion

                                                     ©                   ª
                               uit = U (cit ) + β · U CEt [U −1 (uit+1 )] ,                        (1)

where CEt (uit+1 ) ≡ Υ−1 [Et Υ(uit+1 )]. The utility functions U and Υ aggregate consumption across
dates and states, respectively, and are given by

                                          c1−1/θ                             c1−γ
                               U (c) =               and         Υ(c) =           ,                (2)
                                         1 − 1/θ                             1−γ

where θ > 0 is the elasticity of intertemporal substitution and γ > 0 is the coeﬃcient of relative
risk aversion. The quantity CEt (ut+1 ) represents the certainty equivalent of ut+1 conditional on
period-t information.
    None of the results of the paper relies on the KPEZ preference specification. Standard expected
utility is nested by letting θ = 1/γ, in which case (1) reduces to
                                                   ∞
                                                   X          (ct+s )1−γ
                                         ut = Et         βs              .
                                                   s=0
                                                                1−γ

I nevertheless find it useful to allow θ 6= 1/γ for two reasons: first, to clarify that the sign of the
steady-state eﬀect of incomplete markets depends on the elasticity of intertemporal substitution,
not the degree of risk aversion; and second, to explore in more detail the quantitative properties of
the model.

    Budgets. Let ωt denote the wage rate in period t and Rt the gross risk-free rate between
periods t − 1 and t. The budget constraint of household i in period t is given by

                                 cit + kt+1
                                        i
                                            + bit+1 = π it + Rt bit + ω t ,                        (3)

                                                         4
where cit denotes consumption, kt+1
                                i   investment in physical capital, bit+1 savings in the risk-free
bond, and π it capital income (or the value of firm i, to be specified below).5 Naturally, consumption
and physical capital can not be negative: cit ≥ 0 and kt+1
                                                       i   ≥ 0. Finally, households can freely
borrow in the riskless bond up to the “natural” solvency constraint that debt is low enough to be
paid out even under the worst realization of idiosyncratic uncertainty.6

       Technology and idiosyncratic risk. The capital income of household i is given by the
earnings of firm i net of labor costs:
                                                    π it = yti − ω t nit ,                                          (4)

where nit denotes the amount of labor firm i hires in period t and yti the gross output it produces
in the same period. Output in turn is given by
                                                         ¡               ¢
                                                  yti = F kti , nit , Ait ,

where F : R3+ → R+ is a neoclassical production technology — that is, F exhibits constant returns to
scale (CRS) with respect to K and L, has positive and strictly diminishing marginal products, and
satisfies the familiar Inada conditions — and Ait represents an exogenous production shock specific
to firm i.
       The shock Ait is realized in the beginning of every period t, after capital kti has been installed
but before employment nit is chosen. It is independently and identically distributed across i and t,
with continuous p.d.f. ψ : R+ → R+ . In order to interpret a higher Ait as higher productivity (or
higher profitability), I impose FA > 0, FKA > 0, and FLA > 0. I finally let F (K, L, 0) = 0, meaning
                                                                              R
that the worst idiosyncratic event leads to zero output, and normalize Ā ≡ Aψ (A) dA = 1.

       Equilibrium. Households choose plans {cit , nit , kt+1
                                                          i , bi }∞ contingent on the history of their

idiosyncratic shocks so as to maximize their life-time utility. Idiosyncratic uncertainty, however,
washes out at the aggregate. I thus define an equilibrium as a deterministic sequence of prices
{ω t , Rt }∞                                                       ∞

                    i , bi }∞ , i ∈ [0, 1], such that the following conditions hold:7
plans {cit , nit , kt+1  t+1 t=0

                                         i , bi }∞ maximizes ui for every i
                                               t+1 t=0              0
                                             R i
         (ii) Labor-market clearing:             nt =  1 in all t
                                              Ri i
         (iii) Bond-market clearing:             bt = 0 in all t
                                        R i i        R            R
         (iv) Aggregation: Ct = i ct , Yt = i yti , Kt = i kti in all t
   5
       Note that the budget constraint is expressed in terms of stock variables: Rt equals 1 plus the net risk free rate
and πit includes the value of the beginning-of-period non-depreciated capital stock installed in firm i.
   6
     As shown in Aiyagari (1994), given the non-negativity of consumption, this constraint is equivalent to imposing
a non-Ponzi game condition.

The idiosyncratic state of agent i in period t is summarized by kti , bit , Ait and therefore the value
function, for given price sequence, can be denoted by V (k, b, A; t). Since, by the assumption that

When θ = 1/γ, the above reduces to the more familiar Bellman equation, V (·; t) = max{U (·) +
βEt V (·; t + 1)}.
      This problem is next solved in two steps: first, for the optimal labor demand of firm i; then,
for the optimal consumption, savings and investment of household i.

      Labor demand and capital income. Labor demand nit aﬀects only earnings π it in period
t and is chosen after the capital stock kti has been installed and the contemporaneous shock Ait
has been observed. It follows that the optimal nit maximizes π it state by state. Moreover, by CRS,
the optimal nit and the maximal π it are linear in kti : the individual firm can always adjust its
employment in proportion to its capital stock, implying that the individual household faces linear
returns in his investment.

Lemma 1 Given (ω t , Ait , kti ), labor demand and capital income are linear in kti , decreasing in ωt ,
and increasing in Ait :
                             nit = n(Ait , ω t )kti           and       π it = r(Ait , ωt )kti ,    (7)

where r(A, ω) ≡ maxL [F (1, L, A) − ωL] and n(A, ω) ≡ arg maxL [F (1, L, A) − ωL] .

      Savings and investment. Let wti ≡ π it + Rt bit + ω t denote the financial (or “non-human”)
wealth of household i in period t. The budget constraint reduces to cit + kt+1
                                                                           i   + bit+1 = wti . Moreover,
by Lemma 1,
                                              wti = r(Ait , ωt )kti + Rt bit + ω t .                (8)

                                                                6
Finally, note that conditioning on (kti , bit , Ait ) is useful only for evaluating the optimal nit and the
associated wti in (8). It follows that the household’s savings problem reduces to

    This problem is formally similar to the classic portfolio problem studied by Samuelson (1969)
and Merton (1969): preferences are homothetic (by assumption) and wealth is linear in all assets
(by Lemma 1). That the risky asset is physical investment in a privately-held business rather than
a financial security, that the payoﬀ of this asset depends on the wage rate and thereby on the
aggregate capital stock, or that the risk is idiosyncratic, are important for the general equilibrium
of the economy, but do not aﬀect the mathematical properties of the individual’s decision problem.

Lemma 2 Given prices, optimal consumption, investment and bond holdings are linear in wealth:

                                        cit = (1 − st )(wti + ht )                                            (10)

                                         ϕ∈[0,1]

    To interpret the above conditions, note that the sum wti + ht represents the “eﬀective” wealth
of household i, st is the saving rate out of eﬀective wealth, φt is the fraction of savings allocated
to capital, and ρt is the risk-adjusted return to savings (a.k.a. the certainty equivalent of the
overall portfolio return). Condition (13) follows from the Euler condition and gives the saving
rate as a function of current and future risk-adjusted returns. Because of the familiar income and
substitution eﬀects, this is an increasing function if θ > 1, a decreasing one if θ < 1, and reduces to
a constant, st = β, if θ = 1. Conditions (15) and (14), on the other hand, mean that the allocation
of savings between private equity and bonds maximizes the risk-adjusted return to savings.
    To gain more intuition behind (15) and (14), we can follow Campbell and Viceira (2002) in
approximating the optimal φt and ρt by
                                                                        (                            )
                    ln r̄t+1 − ln Rt+1                                      (ln r̄t+1 − ln Rt+1 )2
               φt ≈                              and    ρt ≈ Rt+1 exp                                    ,    (16)
                           γσ 2t+1                                                  2γσ 2t+1

                                                          7
where r̄t+1 ≡ Et [r(At+1 , ωt+1 )] and σ t+1 ≡ Vart [ln r(At+1 , ω t+1 )] .8 Hence, both the optimal share
of savings allocated to private capital and the resulting risk-adjusted return decrease with either
the idiosyncratic volatility σ t+1 or the anticipated wage rate ωt+1 . On the other hand, an increase
in the risk free rate Rt+1 lowers φt but raises ρt . The eﬀects of σ t+1 and Rt+1 are obvious; the eﬀect
of ω t+1 reflects the fact that an increase in the wage rate reduces firm earnings and capital returns
for every realization of the productivity shock.


3.2      General equilibrium

By Lemma 1 and the fact that there is a continuum of agents and the shocks are i.i.d. across them,
                                                              R                            R
aggregate employment and capital income are given by Nt = i nit = n̄(ωt )Kt and Πt = i π it =
                         R                            R
r̄(ωt )Kt , where n̄(ω) ≡ n(A, ω)ψ(A)dA and r̄(ω) ≡ r(A, ω)ψ(A)dA. It follows that the labor
market clears in period t if and only if ω t = ω (Kt ) , where ω (K) ≡ n̄−1 (1/K). Similarly, aggregate
                                                                       R
gross output — including non-depreciated capital — is given by Yt = i yti = Πt + ωt = f (Kt ), where
f (K) ≡ r̄(ω(K))K + ω(K). Lemma 2, in turn, consumption, bond holdings, and private investment
are linear in individual wealth and therefore the corresponding aggregates are not aﬀected by wealth
inequality. Using these properties and aggregating across agents, we conclude to the following
closed-form recursive characterization of the general equilibrium.

Proposition 1 (General Equilibrium) In equilibrium, the aggregate dynamics satisfy

                                             Ct + Kt+1 = Yt = f (Kt )                                (17)
                                            Ct = (1 − st ) [f (Kt ) + Ht ]                           (18)
                                      (1 − st )−1 = 1 + β θ ρθ−1
                                                             t+1 (1 − st+1 )
                                                                            −1
                                                                                                     (19)
                                             Kt+1 = φt st [f (Kt ) + Ht ]                            (20)
                                                    n̄(ωt )Kt = 1                                    (21)
                                                        ω t+1 + Ht+1
                                                 Ht =                                                (22)
                                                            Rt+1
where φt = φ (ωt+1 , Rt+1 ) and ρt = ρ (ω t+1 , Rt+1 ).

      The interpretation of these conditions is straightforward. (17) is the resource constraint. (18)
and (19) give aggregate consumption and the associated Euler condition. (20) gives the aggregate
capital stock and (21) the clearing condition for the labor market. (22) is the present value of
aggregate labor income in recursive form.
      Finally, to see more clearly that the system is recursive, use (17), (21) and (22) to eliminate Ct ,
ω t , and Rt+1 . The equilibrium dynamics then reduce to a three-dimension, first-order, diﬀerence-
equation system in (Kt , Ht , st ). This is a dramatic gain in tractability as compared to most other
  8
      See the Appendix for the derivation of condition (16).

incomplete-markets models, in which the equilibrium dynamics are characterized by a recursion
over the entire wealth distribution — an infinitely-dimensional object. The simple structure of the
equilibrium recursion is further exploited in Section 6.2, when I analyze the transitional dynamics.


4        Steady State

4.1        Characterization

A steady state is a fixed point of the dynamic system (17)-(21).9 Since the general equilibrium was
characterized in closed form for any kind of idiosyncratic risk, so does the steady state as well. For
expositional simplicity, however, it is most useful to consider the case that the productivity shock
is augmented to capital and lognormally distributed. I thus henceforth assume

Assumption A1. F (K, L, A) = F (AK, L, 1) and ln A ∼ N (−σ 2 /2, σ 2 ).

The standard deviation σ then parsimoniously parameterizes the amount of uninsured idiosyncratic
risk in private production and investment.10

Proposition 2 (Steady State) In steady state, the capital stock K and the interest rate R solve
                                                 £                   ¤
                                         β θ ρθ−1 φf 0 (K) + (1 − φ)R = 1                                        (23)

                                             f (K) − f 0 (K)K   1−φ
                                                              =                                                  (24)
                                                (R − 1) K        φ
where φ = φ (ω (K) , R) and ρ = ρ (ω (K) , R) .

        Condition (23) follows from combining the resource constraint with the Euler condition and
has a simple interpretation. The first term in the left-hand side of (23), s = β θ ρθ−1 , is the steady-
state value of the saving rate; this is increasing (respectively, decreasing) in the risk-adjusted
return ρ if and only if θ > 1 (θ < 1) and reduces to s = β when θ = 1. The second term,
φf 0 (K) + (1 − φ)R, represents the aggregate return to savings; this is a weighted average of the
marginal product of capital and the risk-free rate. The product of these two terms gives the growth
rate of aggregate eﬀective wealth. In the steady state, aggregate wealth must be constant, which
gives (23). Condition (24), on the other hand, follows from clearing the bond market and requires
    9
        Although aggregates are well defined at the steady state, individual wealth is a martingale and there is no
stationary wealth distribution. This is not uncommon in incomplete-market models, but here it can easily be fixed
with the following modification: in every period, let a mass λ ∈ (0, 1) of randomly selected households die and
be replaced with an equal mass of new-born households; and let the assets of the dead households be distributed
uniformly among the new-born households.
  10
     A1 implies that f (K) = F (K, 1, 1) and r̄ (ω (K)) = FK (K, 1, 1) = f 0 (K) , for every σ ≥ 0 and every K > 0, so
that an increase in σ is indeed equivalent to a mean-preserving spread in individual returns.


                                                          9
that the ratio of the present value of labor income to the capital stock is consistent with the
individuals’ optimal allocation of savings between private equity and the riskless bond.
       When markets are complete, the optimality condition for φ reduces to the familiar arbitrage
condition f 0 (K) = R. Condition (23) then reduces to R = 1/β and finally (24) pins down φ. When,
instead, markets are incomplete, (23) pins a unique K for any given R. Condition (24) then can be
solved for R. Clearly, it must be that R < 1/β, or otherwise aggregate consumption would explode
to infinity and a steady state would not exist. Most importantly, it must be that f 0 (K) > R, or
otherwise agents would hold no capital in equilibrium and a steady state would again not exist. In
other words, the precautionary motive implies a reduction in the interest rate (R < 1/β), but the
investment risk introduces a premium on capital (f 0 (K) > R), thus leaving open the possibility
that either f 0 (K) < 1/β or f 0 (K) > 1/β. That is, the overall eﬀect of idiosyncratic investment
risk on the capital stock is ambiguous. In contrast, in Bewley models like Aiyagari (1994), only
the precautionary motive is present, the steady state satisfies f 0 (K) = R < 1/β, and the impact of
incomplete markets on savings is unambiguously positive.
       To understand the steady-state eﬀect of investment risk, it is useful to assume for a moment that
R is exogenously fixed, which would have been the case if the economy were open to an international
market for the riskless bond. We can then show (see Appendix) that, for any R ∈ (1, 1/β), the
steady-state capital stock is approximately given by
                                                  r
                                                               2γθ
                                     ln f 0 (K) ≈ ln R + σ         [− ln(βR)]                                  (25)
                                                               1+θ
The above, of course, reduces to f 0 (K) = R when σ = 0. When σ > 0, K decreases with σ for two
reasons. First, there is a direct decision-theoretic eﬀect in that an increase in risk discourages private
investment for any level of wealth. Second, there is an indirect general-equilibrium eﬀect in that, as
all agents cut back in their investments, aggregate income and wealth fall in equilibrium, which in
turn further discourages risk taking and private investment. This eﬀect is present only because risk
taking is sensitive to individual wealth and introduces a “multiplier” (a complementarity), which
helps explain the relatively large quantitative eﬀects reported later on.11
       In a closed economy, however, the interest rate adjusts to any change in the level of idiosyncratic
risks so as to ensure that the aggregate excess demand for the riskless bond is zero, which is what
condition (24) imposes. An increase in σ now implies also a reduction in R, which counteracts with
the increase in the risk premium on private investment and makes the overall eﬀect of incomplete
markets on the capital stock ambiguous in general. Since the sensitivity of savings to the interest
  11
       In an open economy, the steady-state levels of aggregate wealth and consumption are also uniquely determined,
for any R < 1/β. This is unlike complete markets, where the steady-state levels of aggregate wealth and consumption
move one-to-one with their corresponding initial levels. A multi-country extension of the model could thus gen-
erate a stationary wealth distribution for the world economy, with cross-country diﬀerences in capital, wealth and
consumption being explained by cross-country diﬀerences in the degree of domestic risk sharing.

rate is determined by the elasticity of intertemporal substitution, one may expect that the eﬀect
of a higher risk dominates the eﬀect of a lower interest rate unless the elasticity of intertemporal
substitution is suﬃciently small. This intuition is verified in the following.

Proposition 3 There exists θ < 1 such that the steady-state levels of capital, output, wages, and
consumption are lower under incomplete markets if and only if θ > θ. For small σ,
                                                 R−1
                                        θ≈                ≤ α,                                        (26)
                                             f (K) /K − 1
where α is the income share of capital.

      In linear-growth (AK) models, idiosyncratic investment risk reduces steady-state savings if
and only if θ > 1. This is not inconsistent with the result stated above. In an AK economy,
capital income exhausts all income in the economy, so that R = f (K)/K and θ = α = 1. In a
neoclassical economy, instead, capital income is only a fraction of total income, so that θ ≤ α < 1.
In other words, it is the existence of labor income (or other sources of wealth) that explains why the
critical threshold for the elasticity of intertemporal substitution is lower in the neoclassical growth
paradigm than in the AK paradigm.
      The above result is not only of theoretical interest. Given that most empirical estimates of
the elasticity of intertemporal substitution suggest a value between 0.5 and 1, the AK paradigm
predicted that financial innovation in the form of better risk sharing is likely to reduce aggregate
savings. Proposition 3 reverts this prediction: in the context of the neoclassical growth model,
better risk sharing in investment is likely to boost capital accumulation.
      Indeed, for most plausible parameter values, θ is well below most estimates of the elasticity
of intertemporal substitution. For example, when the discount rate is 5%, the ratio of capital to
output is 3, and the depreciation rate is 5%, (26) gives θ = (.05)/ (.33 − .05) = 0.17; with 5% to
10% discount and depreciation rates, θ remains in the neighborhood of 0.2 even when the income
share of capital is as high as 60% or 70%. In what follows, I focus on calibrated versions of the
model and make a first attempt at quantifying the impact of idiosyncratic investment risk.


4.2     Numerical results

Thanks to the tractability of the model, the numerical solution of the steady state is trivial: substi-
tuting φ = φ (ω (K) , R) and ρ = ρ (ω (K) , R) into (23)-(24) gives a simple system of two equations
in two unknowns, the steady-state levels of K and R.
      With a Cobb-Douglas technology and a lognormal productivity, the economy is fully parame-
terized by (β, γ, θ, α, δ, σ). The calibration of preferences and technologies (β, γ, θ, α, δ) is standard:
for my benchmark calibration, I let the time period be one year, the discount rate 1 − β −1 = 5%,
the coeﬃcient of relative risk aversion γ = 2, the elasticity of intertemporal substitution θ = 1, the

                                                    11
income share of capital α = 40%, and the depreciation rate δ = 5%. What is diﬃcult to measure is
σ, the standard deviation of the individual return in private equity.12
       There are many indications that idiosyncratic investment risks are quantitatively large. The
estimated value of private equity in the United States is about as high as the value of public equity
today — it was about twice as large in the 70’s and 80’s. More than 75% of aggregate private equity
is owned by households for whom private equity constitutes at least half of their total net worth.
The median rich household (“rich” being defined as the top 1-5% of the wealth distribution) holds
almost 60% of its non-housing wealth in private equity; and more than 70% of that is invested in a
single company in which the household has an active management interest. The probability that a
privately-held firm survives over the first 5 years of its life is only 37 percent; and the variation in
private investment returns is very large even conditional on survival. For further details on these
facts, see Carrol (2001) and Moskowitz and Vissing-Jørgensen (2002).
       Despite these indications, unfortunately there are no available estimates of the level of idio-
syncratic investment risk.          For example, Moskowitz and Vissing-Jørgensen (2002) and Bitler,
Moskowitz, and Vissing-Jørgensen (2005) explore the cross-section of private-equity investors in
the Survey of Consumer Finances, but are unable to provide a reliable measure for the standard
deviation of individual returns because of the lack of enough time-series variation in the data. For
their numerical exercises, they instead proxy σ with the standard deviation of the annual return to
an individual publicly-traded stock. In lack of a better alternative, I also follow the same strategy.
       Campbell et al. (2001) report that the standard deviation of the annual return to a publicly-
traded stock is around 50%. One possibility is that privately-held firms, being on average younger
and smaller than publicly-held firms, face even higher risks. Another possibility, however, is that
publicly-held firms are willing to engage in more risky projects than privately-held firms. One may
thus argue that 50% is an upper bound for σ. On the other hand, the overall stock-market volatility,
which pools all idiosyncratic risk and is about 17%, provides a lower bound for σ. On the basis of
these facts, I consider 20% to 40% as a plausible range for σ.
       The results are presented in Table 1. The first raw of the table corresponds to σ = 40% and
the second to σ = 20%. The rest of the Table does a series of robustness checks for diﬀerent values
of γ, θ, β, α, and δ.13



  12
       To see that σ is the standard deviation of investment returns, note that, under A1, ln r(A, ω) = ln A + ln r(ω)
and therefore Vart [ln r(At+1 , ωt+1 )]1/2 = σ. Alternatively, one can interpret At+1 as an idiosyncratic shock in the
depreciation of capital, in which case δ is the mean and σ the standard deviation of the rate of depreciation.
  13
     For all the quantitative results, aggregate income is measured by GDPt ≡ f (Kt ) − (1 − δ) Kt = Ktα ; the risk-free
rate and the mean excess return on private equity by Rt −1 and r̄t −Rt , respectively; and the saving rate by It /GDPt ,
where It = Kt+1 − (1 − δ) Kt .

Table 1: The steady-state eﬀects of idiosyncratic investment risk. ∆(Saving Rate) is the change
in the aggregate saving rate between complete and incomplete markets, and ∆(GDP ) the corre-
sponding percentage change in the aggregate level of income; interest rate is the rate of return on
the riskless bond under incomplete markets; and private premium is the mean excess return on
private equity.


    Under the benchmark calibration, the reduction in the steady-state saving rate varies between
2.4 and 6 percentage points as σ varies between 20% and 40%. The steady-state capital stock falls
by 19% − 45% and the steady-state level of income by 8% − 21%. The risk-free rate falls from 5%
under complete markets to 4.6% when σ = 20% and 4.2% when σ = 40%. Finally, the associated
risk premium on private equity is 1.7% when σ = 20% and 4.9% when σ = 40%.
    As shown in Table 1, the large negative eﬀect of idiosyncratic risk on aggregate savings and
output appears robust to other plausible calibrations of the model. As expected, increasing (de-
creasing) the degree of risk aversion raises (reduces) the losses in capital and output. Perhaps more
surprisingly, letting the elasticity of intertemporal substitution be either as high as 2 or as low as
1/2 has little eﬀect on the magnitude of capital and output losses. Indeed, θ would have to fall
well below α for the eﬀects to flip sign. Finally, the discount rate and the depreciation rate have
modest eﬀects, whereas quite strong is the impact of a broader definition of capital (a higher α).

5         Two Sectors: Private and Public Equity
The analysis so far has assumed that all investment is subject to idiosyncratic risk. This is not
necessarily a bad benchmark for less developed economies, in which production is dominated by
privately-held firms. Nevertheless, it is important to understand the robustness of the results to
the availability of a safe asset that is in positive net supply.14 I thus introduce a second sector
of production, to be called “public equity”, in which ownership of capital is freely traded across
agents and therefore all idiosyncratic risks are fully diversified.

5.1         General equilibrium

Let Xt and Lt denote the total capital and labor allocated to the public-equity sector in period t.
Total output for this sector is given by G (Xt , Lt ) , where G is a neoclassical production function.
Since public equity is risk-free, simple arbitrage implies that its return must equal the return to the
riskless bond. Moreover, by profit maximization, ωt = GL (Xt , Lt ) and Rt = GX (Xt , Lt ). The rest
of the equilibrium characterization is like in the benchmark model. Lemma 1 remains unaﬀected,
whereas Lemma 2 extends with a minor modification, namely replacing bond holdings with the
sum of bond and public-equity holdings. We can thus show the following.

Proposition 4 (General Equilibrium) In an equilibrium in which both sectors are active, the
aggregate dynamics satisfy

                                Ct + Kt+1 + Xt+1 = Yt = F (Kt , Nt , 1) + G(Xt , Lt )                              (27)
                                                 Ct = (1 − st ) (Yt + Ht )                                         (28)
                                         (1 − st )−1 = 1 + β θ ρθ−1
                                                                t   (1 − st+1 )−1                                  (29)
                                      Rt = GX (Xt , Lt )           ω t = GL (Xt , Lt )                             (30)
                                    Kt+1 = φt st (Yt + Ht )        Nt = n̄(ωt )Kt                                  (31)
                                                      Nt + Lt = 1                                                  (32)
                                               Ht = (ω t+1 + Ht+1 ) /Rt+1                                          (33)

where ρt = ρ (ω t+1 , Rt+1 ) and φt = φ (ω t+1 , Rt+1 ) .

         The above conditions have a simple interpretation. (27) is the resource constraint of the
economy. (28) and (29) give the equilibrium consumption and the associated Euler condition. (30)
are the familiar conditions characterizing the equilibrium capital and employment in public equity,
whereas (31) are the analogues for private equity. Finally, (32) is the clearing condition for the
labor market and (33) the present value of aggregate labor income in recursive form.
    14
         In the benchmark model, the net supply of the riskless bond was zero. Nevertheless, agents had an implicit safe
asset in positive supply: the present value of their labor income.


                                                             14
5.2     Steady state

A steady state in which both sectors are active is a fixed point of the dynamic system (27)-(33).
To simplify the analysis, it is useful to assume that the capital intensity of the technology used by
public-equity firms is identical to the one in privately-held firms, in which case the productivity
diﬀerence between two sectors can be parameterized by a single scalar.

Assumption A2. G(X, L) = F (X, L, 1/µ) for some µ > 1.

If µ were less than 1, public equity would dominate private equity and the model would reduce to
a standard complete-markets Ramsey economy, which explains why I restrict µ > 1. On the other
hand, if idiosyncratic risks were too low, all production would take place in the privately-held firms
and the model would reduce to the one-sector benchmark analyzed before. Hence, in what follows,
I consider the case that both sectors are active in equilibrium.
      Let R(ω) ≡ maxl [G(1, l) − ωl] and l(ω) ≡ arg maxl [G(1, l) − ωl] and note that (30) holds if and
only if Rt = R (ω t ) and Lt = l (ω t ) Xt . Moreover, under A1 and A2, r̄ (ωt ) = µRt , meaning that µ
pins down the premium on private equity. By implication, ρ (ω, R) = R and φ (ω, R) = ϕ, where
                                     nR                            o 1           2

                       ≡    max                                         ≈ µ1/(2γσ )                 (34)
                           φ∈[0,1]
                                           nR                           o 1
                                                (φA + 1 − φ)1−γ ψ (A) dA
                                                                         1−γ
                   ϕ ≡ arg max                                               ≈ ln µ/(γσ 2 )         (35)
                                 φ∈[0,1]

Thus,     and ϕ are pinned down by the exogenous parameters µ and σ alone. We can then show
the following.

Proposition 5 (Steady State) In a steady state in which both sectors are active:
      (i) The interest rate is

                                   R = β −1       1/θ−1
                                                          (ϕµ + 1 − ϕ)−1/θ < 1/β                    (36)

where ϕ and       are given by (34)-(35); the wage rate is then given by R(ω) = R and the capital
stocks by
                                 1/l(ω) + ω/(R − 1)
                           K=                                     and   X = 1/l(ω) − µK.            (37)
                                     µ + 1/φ − 1
      (ii) There exists θ < 1 such that θ > θ suﬃces for an increase in σ to raise the interest rate and
reduce the investment in private equity, total factor productivity, aggregate output, and aggregate
consumption.

      As compared to the benchmark model, public equity introduces three novel eﬀects.
      First, incomplete markets reduce the demand for private equity but increase the demand for
public equity. Indeed, since the risk-free rate is necessarily lower than the discount rate, the capital-
labor in publicly-traded firms is unambiguously higher than under complete markets. As a result,

                                                             15
the impact of incomplete markets on aggregate savings may be ambiguous even for relatively high
elasticities of intertemporal substitution.
      Second, an increase in idiosyncratic risk triggers a reallocation of resources (both capital and
labor) from the more risky but more productive sector (private equity) to the less risky but less
productive one (public equity), thus causing a reduction in aggregate total factor productivity. As
a result, aggregate output may fall even if aggregate capital does not.
      Third, even though the risk-free rate is always below the discount rate, an increase in risk may
locally increase the risk-free rate when both private and public equity are held. This is unlike either
the Bewley class of models or the one-sector model of the previous section, where more risk tends
to decrease the risk-free rate. The reason for this new eﬀect is that the technology in the public
equity sector imposes a negative relation between the wage rate and the interest rate, namely the
relation implied by the equation of the ratio of the two prices with the marginal rate of technical
substitution between capital and labor. When an increase in idiosyncratic investment risk causes
a reallocation of resources from private to public equity, thus reducing aggregate productivity and
wages, the reduction in wages is necessarily associated with an increase in interest rates. In the
Bewley class of models, the same negative relation between wages and interest rates is present,
since all capital is public, but it works the other way round: higher labor-income risk leads to
a lower interest rate and thereby to a higher capital-labor ratio and a higher wage rate. In the
one-sector model of the previous sections, on the other hand, the negative relation between wages
and interest rates was broken, because the interest rate is not equated to the marginal product of
capital in private equity.


5.3     Numerical results

The new parameter that needs to be calibrated is µ. Other things equal, µ determines the cross-
sectoral allocation of resources. As mentioned earlier, private and public equity each claim roughly
half of aggregate production, employment, and wealth in the United States. Hence, for any given
set of values for (σ, β, γ, θ, α, δ), I calibrate µ so that the implied steady-state shares of private and
public equity in the aggregate capital stock are 50% each. The results are reported in Table 2.
Calibrating µ to the shares of employment or output yields similar quantitative results.
      In the benchmark calibration (first two rows of Table 2), the reduction in the saving rate is
now 1.1 − 3.5 percentage points as compared to 2.4 − 6.1 percentage points without public equity.
Similarly, the reduction in the capital stock is now 12% − 33% as compared to 19% − 45% without
public equity. On the other hand, the reduction in the steady-state level of income is 7% − 19%
as compared to 9% − 21% in the benchmark model. Hence, the impact of incomplete markets on
aggregate savings is almost halved by the introduction of public equity, but the mitigating eﬀect
on aggregate income is only moderate.

                 Table 2: The steady-state eﬀects in the presence of public equity.



    The reason the impact on output remains strong is that incomplete markets now distort also
aggregate total factor productivity (the Solow residual). Indeed, private equity must have a higher
mean return than public equity in order to compensate for the uninsured idiosyncratic risk. It
follows that a high level of private risk reduces aggregate productivity by shifting resources away
from private equity.
    The rest of Table 2 performs a series of robustness checks like Table 1. Once again, the impact
of incomplete markets is increased by a higher risk aversion, is little aﬀected by the elasticity of
intertemporal substitution, and remains significant across all specifications.
    Finally, note that the equilibrium premium on private equity is significantly lower than what
in the absence of public equity. In the benchmark calibration, for example, the private premium is
3% when σ = 40% (compared to 4.9% without public equity) and as low as 0.9% when σ = 20%
(compared to 1.7%). This is because the excess return required to compensate for the risk in private
equity is significantly lower when only half of aggregate savings rather than the entire capital stock
is in private equity. The model thus predicts that large eﬀects on savings and income are consistent
with small investment risks and low excess returns in private equity.

6         Transitional Dynamics and Amplification

Since aggregate uncertainty is not allowed, I can not examine literally the business-cycle properties
of the model. We can nevertheless get some guidance by studying the transitional dynamics.
         To capture cyclical variation in aggregate productivity and the level of idiosyncratic risk, I
modify the model as follows. Let Zt denote the aggregate labor productivity in period t; with
a Cobb-Douglas production function, a change in Zt is, of course, isomorphic to a change in the
total factor productivity of both sectors. I assume that Zt follows the deterministic analogue of an
AR(1) process:
                                                      ln Zt+1 = ρ ln Zt ,                                           (38)

where ρ ∈ [0, 1) measures the persistence of productivity. I also allow for the level of idiosyncratic
risk to vary with the state of the economy:
                                                  ¡         ¢1/2
                                        σ t ≡ Vart ln Ait+1      = σ [1 − η ln Zt ] ,                               (39)

where σ ≥ 0 and η ≥ 0 parameterize, respectively, the steady-state level and the cyclical elasticity of
idiosyncratic risk. I can then mimic a “recession” with an once-and-for-all reduction in Z0 starting
from the steady state.
         Thanks to the simple closed-form recursive structure of the general equilibrium, it is easy to
compute the response of the economy to such a shock — or, more generally, the transitional dynamics
from any given initial conditions. Assuming θ = 1 (benchmark calibration) further simplifies the
equilibrium recursion by implying st = β.15

Lemma 3 Suppose θ = 1 and (Zt , σ t ) satisfy (38)-(39). There is a unique mapping Ω : R4 → R8
such that, for all t ≥ 0,

                        ((Zt+1 , Kt+1 , Xt+1 , Ht ) , (Ct , Yt , ω t , Rt )) = Ω (Zt , Kt , Xt , Ht−1 ) .

         For any given (Z0 , K0 , X0 , H−1 ), the whole path is computed simply by iterating Ω. Since
(Z0 , K0 , X0 ) are historically given, one only needs to find the equilibrium value for H−1 . Starting
with an arbitrary guess for H−1 , iterating Ω to compute the implied {ωt , Rt }Tt=0 for T large enough,
              0 =
                   PT                                                       0
and letting H−1      t=1 ω t / (R1 ...Rt−1 ) , gives a mapping from H−1 to H−1 . Iterating this mapping
      0 ≈H
till H−1                            16
          −1 gives the equilibrium.

         In the rest of this section, I first discuss how idiosyncratic investment risk may introduce a novel
amplification mechanism. I then use the above algorithm to simulate the transitional dynamics and
quantify the amplification.
    15
         If, instead, θ 6= 1, the “state vector” (Zt+1 , Kt+1 , Xt+1 , Ht ) must be expanded to include st .
    16
         Although this is not a contraction mapping, I obtained a fixed point for all the simulations reported below.


                                                               18
6.1       Some partial insights

The amplification originates in two distinct, yet complementary sources. First, cyclical variation
in the level of uninsurable idiosyncratic risk generates cyclical variation in investment demand
and aggregate productivity. Second, the dependence of risk taking on future income introduces a
dynamic macroeconomic complementarity. I explain the two amplification channels below.
       First, consider the role of exogenous cyclical variation in σ t . As the economy enters a recession
(that is, after a negative shock in Z0 ), the level σ t of uninsurable investment risk increases, implying
a reduction in the willingness to invest in private equity. That is, the demand for investment is low
during a recession, not only because interest rates are high — the standard reason in the complete-
markets neoclassical model — but also because private risk premia are high. Moreover, as resources
are diverted away from private equity towards public equity, an endogenous reduction in aggregate
productivity takes place. In other words, the Solow residual itself is amplified.
       Second, consider the role of the endogenous cyclical variation in the willingness to take risk. To
gain some insight, ignore for a moment the presence of public equity and the equilibrium variation
in R, s, or φ. Conditions (19) and (20) then reduce to

                                         Kt+1 = sφ [f (Kt ) + Ht ] ,                                            (40)
                                                X∞
                                           Ht =     R−j ω(Kt+j ).                                               (41)
                                                      j=1

On one hand, (40) implies that, other things equal, Kt+1 increases with either Kt or Ht and therefore
the path of capital {Kt+1 , Kt+2 , ...} increases with the path of human wealth {Ht , Ht+1 , ...}. This
eﬀect reflects a decision-theoretic property: the dependence of individual risk taking on wealth. On
the other hand, (41) implies that {Ht+1 , Ht+2 , ...} increases with {Kt+1 , Kt+2 , ...}. This feedback
reflects a general-equilibrium eﬀect: the dependence of individual labor income and wealth on
aggregate capital. The combination of these two eﬀects gives rise to a dynamic macroeconomic
complementarity: the anticipation of low income tomorrow leads every agent to invest less today,
which in turn implies lower aggregate income tomorrow.17
       Three remarks are worth making about this complementarity. First, it introduces a short of
“Keynesian accelerator” in an RBC economy: investment demand depends directly on income and
wealth. Second, it derives from two simple ingredients: that private investment is subject to unin-
sured idiosyncratic risk and that risk taking is sensitive to anticipated income.18 Third, and most
  17
       The paper thus also contributes to the literature on macroeconomic complementarities (e.g., Benhabib and
Farmer, 1994; Cooper, 2000).
  18
     This also explains why this complementarity is novel in the literature: the first ingredient is absent in Bewley
models (e.g., Aiyagari, 1994, Krusell and Smith, 1998), whereas the second one in abscent in AK models, such as
Obstfeld (1994) and Krebs (2003), or credit models with risk-neutral entrepreneurs, such as Bernanke and Gertler
(1989) and Kiyotaki and Moore (1997), as well as the CARA-normal economy of Angeletos and Calvet (2003, 2004).


                                                         19
importantly, this is only part of the story: although this complementarity contributes to amplifying
the transitional dynamics, there may be other counteracting eﬀects in general equilibrium.
       To obtain a more complete picture and make a first pass at the quantitative potential of the am-
plification eﬀects discussed above, I next simulate the response of the economy to an unanticipated
shock in aggregate productivity Z0 .


6.2       A numerical example

As mentioned earlier, reliable measures of idiosyncratic investment risk are not available. There
are various indications that the these risks are highly cyclical — proxies such as bankruptcy rates,
firm-exit rates, and firm-specific volatility in publicly traded firms vary a lot over the business cycle
— but there is no hard evidence on which I could base the calibration of η, the cyclical sensitivity
of idiosyncratic investment risk. In lack of a better alternative, I make a plausible, yet random,
guess: I calibrate η so that a 2% reduction in output below its steady-state value is associated with
a 5% increase in the standard deviation of investment returns. For the rest of the parameters, I
use the benchmark calibration (γ = 2, θ = 1, 1 − β −1 = 5%, α = 40%, δ = 5%), with σ = 20% and
µ such that 50% of capital is private equity, and finally with ρ = 95%, which roughly matches the
autocorrelation of the Solow residual in U.S. data.
       Figure 1 illustrates the response of the economy to a negative productivity shock. The initial
values are ln Z0 = −1%/(1 − α), K0 = K∞ and X0 = X∞ , meaning a 1% exogenous reduction in
total factor productivity starting from the steady state. The solid lines represent the response of
the economy under incomplete markets, whereas the dashes lines correspond to complete markets
(that is, to the standard neoclassical growth model). The amplification eﬀect is quite strong: the
impact of the exogenous shock on aggregate output, consumption, and investment is, respectively,
63%, 92%, and 53% higher than the impact of the shock under complete markets.19 Importantly,
note how the amplification shows up in aggregate productivity: the reallocation of resources away
from private equity contributes 42% of the overall reduction in the Solow residual.
       These results, however, do not distinguish whether the main source of amplification is the
cyclical variation in risk or the macroeconomic complementarity discussed earlier. To isolate the role
of the complementarity, Figure 2 repeats the same exercise as Figure 1 setting η = 0. The impact of
the shock on all macroeconomic variables under incomplete markets is now only slightly larger than
that under complete markets.20 The reason the amplification eﬀect of the complementarity is weak
  19
       For each variable X, I compute the “multiplier” of incomplete markets by taking the maximal value of the ratio
X̂tinco /X̂tcom   over the first 4 periods, where X̂tinco = (Xt − X∞ ) /X∞ denotes the period-t percentage change relative
to the steady-state value under incomplete markets, and X̂tcom the corresponding change under complete markets.
(Taking the average instead of the maximal ratio gives similar results.) The numbers reported in the text are the
corresponding multipliers minus 1.

     For brevity, only the responses of output and the Solow residual are depicted in Figure 2; the amplification of

is the presence of another oﬀsetting general-equilibrium eﬀect which the earlier intuitive discussion
overlooked: the reduction in real interest rates during the recession counteracts the reduction in
expected future wage rates and thereby mitigates the reduction in the demand for private equity.
In other words, the “Keynesian accelerator” is here oﬀset by a “neoclassical” price eﬀect.21

     To recap, the complementarity may be of theoretical interest on its own — for it is likely to
extend to a larger class of models where agents face idiosyncratic investment risk — but it fails to
generate strong amplification in the context of the present model. In contrast, cyclical variation in
idiosyncratic risk appears to have a more significant quantitative potential.


7     Concluding Remarks
This paper made a first attempt in characterizing and quantifying the macroeconomic eﬀects of
idiosyncratic investment risks. The merit but also the limitation of the analysis was its proximity to
the standard neoclassical growth model: the only modification was the introduction of uninsurable
risks in private investment.
     An important result in the Ramsey literature is that the optimal tax on capital is typically zero
under complete markets (Chamley, 1986; Judd, 1985; Atkeson, Chari and Kehoe, 1999) and positive
in Bewley economies (Aiyagari, 1995). A natural question is whether idiosyncratic investment risks,
by leading to low savings, also raise the possibility that an investment subsidy is optimal in some
cases. Another question is the properties of optimal taxes along the transitional dynamics: does
other macroeconomic variables is similarly small.
  21
     Note, however, that this oﬀsetting eﬀect would be abscent in an open-economy version of the model where the
risk-free rate is exogenously fixed. Indeed, in that case domestic investment simply tracks aggregate productivity in
the absence of idiosyncratic investment risks, whereas it also depends on domestic wealth under incomplete markets.


                                                         22
the amplification discussed above open the door to a stabilization role for policy? The tractability
of the model may prove useful in answering these questions.22
       Tractability, however, did not come for free. I assumed away aggregate uncertainty, occu-
pational choice, labor supply, and labor-income risk. I also ignored the endogeneity of financial
contracts, which may be important for both the positive and the normative implications of the
analysis. Furthermore, the model lacked any mean-reverting force in individual wealth dynam-
ics, such as the one introduced by labor-income risk (e.g., Aiyagari, 1994) or diminishing returns
in privately-held businesses (e.g., Banerjee and Newman, 1993; Caggeti and De Nardi, 2003), and
therefore had no interesting implications for the wealth distribution. Extending the analysis in these
directions is essential for a better quantitative assessment of the macroeconomic eﬀects of private
equity and idiosyncratic investment risk — this paper hopes to have provided a useful benchmark.




Appendix: Proofs
Proof of Lemma 1. By the linear homogeneity of F (K, L, A) in (K, L),
                                       µ          ¶
                              π it         nit i         nit
                                   = F  1,    , A   − ω t i.                                                       (42)
                              kti          kti t         kt

Since kti and Ait are known when nit is chosen, the optimal nit /kti maximizes (42) for any Ait , which
gives (7). By definition of n (·) and r (·), FL (1, n(A, ω), A) ≡ ω and r(A, ω) ≡ F (1, n(A, ω), A) −
ωn(A, ω). Hence, F (K, L, 0) = 0 implies n(0, ·) = r(0, ·) = 0, whereas n (A, ·) > 0 and r (A, ·) > 0
for A > 0. Applying the implicit function theorem and using FL > 0, FLL < 0, FA > 0, and
FLA > 0, we infer nω < 0 < nA and rω < 0 < rA . Finally, the Inada conditions imply, for any
A > 0, limω→0 n(A, ω) = limω→0 r(A, ω) = ∞ and limω→∞ n(A, ω) = limω→∞ r(A, ω) = 0.

       Proof of Lemma 2.             For notational simplicity, I drop the superscript i and use rt+1 as a
short-cut for r(At+1 , ωt+1 ). I propose the following solution for the value function and the policy
rules:
                             (w + ht )1−1/θ
             V (w; t) = at                  , c(w; t) = (1 − st )(w + ht ), k(w; t) = φt st (w + ht ),             (43)
                                1 − 1/θ
where at , st , and φt are (possibly time-varying but non-stochastic) coeﬃcients to be determined.
From the budget constraint and (43), we then infer b(w; t) = (1 − φt )st (w + ht ) − ht . From (2) and
  22
       The answers to these questions are non-trivial for at least three reasons: unlike Aiyagari (1995), a comparison
of the steady-state level of capital with its first-best value may be misleading; a tax on capital may still be desirable
from an insurance perspective; amplification does not necessarily mean ineﬃciency.


                                                           23

Hence, the first-order conditions with respect to kt+1 and bt+1 give:

Combining the two conditions, and using

we get Et [Rt+1 + φt (rt+1 − Rt+1 )]−γ (rt+1 − Rt+1 ) = 0, or equivalently φt = φ(ω t+1 , Rt+1 ).
                                                                                  1−1/θ
Next, the envelope condition, V 0 (wt ; t) = U 0 (ct ), or equivalently at                (wt + ht )−1/θ = (ct )−1/θ ,
along with ct = (1 − st )(wt + ht ) from (43), implies
                                               1−1/θ
                                              at       = (1 − st )−1/θ .                                            (47)

Multiplying (44) and (45) with φt and (1 − φt ), respectively, summing up, substituting wt+1 in the
resulting relation from (46), and rearranging, gives the saving rate in recursive form:

                                     (1 − st )−1 = 1 + β θ ρθ−1
                                                            t   (1 − st+1 )−1 ,                                     (48)

where ρt = ρ(ω t+1 , Rt+1 ). For any {ω t , Rt }∞
                                                t=0 that is part of an equilibrium, the infinite sum

  s=t  τ =t [β ρτ ] is finite. Forward iteration of (48) thus yields (13), with st ∈ (0, 1). Using (43),
we then verify that ct > 0, kt+1 > 0, and bt+1 > −ht . Finally, we verify that (43) solves the Bellman
equation: substituting (43) into (9) gives
                                                                n    £                     ¤1/(1−γ) o1−1/θ

dividing both sides by (wt + ht )1−1/θ /(1 − 1/θ) and using (46) and (48), the above reduces to
                      h                                  i

    Proof of Condition (16).                                          i
                                           To simplify notation, let rt+1 = r(Ait+1 , ω t+1 ), r̄t+1 = Et rt+1
                                                                                                           i ,

              ln ρt ≈ φt Et [ln rt+1 ] + (1 − φt ) ln Rt+1 + φt (1 − φt )σ 2t+1 −    φt σ t+1 .                     (49)

Since φt maximizes ρt , the above also implies

(These two equations are the analogues of (2.24) and (2.25) in Chapter 2 of Campbell and Vi-

    Proof of Proposition 1.           Note that φt and st are identical across agents. Aggregating the
conditions in Lemma 2 over all i and using the facts that Ait and kti are independent and that
Πt + ω t = r̄(ω t )Kt + ωt = f (Kt ) = Yt , we infer

                                   Wt = Πt + RBt + ω t = f (Kt ) + RBt                              (51)
                                    Ct = (1 − st )(Wt + Ht )                                        (52)
                                 Kt+1 = st φt (Wt + Ht )                                            (53)
                                 Bt+1 = st (1 − φt )(Wt + Ht ) − Ht                                 (54)
               R
where Bt =         bit di. The bond market clears if and only if Bt = 0 and therefore Wt = f (Kt ) = Yt .
Along with (52) and (53), this immediately gives (18) and (19). Next, adding up (52)-(54) gives
the resource constraint (17), whereas (20) follows directly from (5). Finally, the labor market clears
                  R
if and only if 1 = nit = n̄(ω t )Kt , which gives (21).

    Proof of Proposition 2.           Evaluating (51)-(54) [equivalently, (17)-(21)] in the steady state
and combining, we get K + H = s (W + H) = s [r̄(ω)K + RH] = s [φr̄(ω) + (1 − φ)R] (K + H) , or
equivalently
                                         1 = s [φr̄(ω) + (1 − φ)R] ,

which is simply the stationarity condition for aggregate wealth. Substituting s = β θ ρθ−1 into the
above gives condition (23) in the Proposition. Next, by (22), (53), (54), and the property that,
under A1, r̄(ω) = FK (K, 1, 1) = f 0 (K) and ω = f (K) − f 0 (K) K, we have
                            H   1−φ                     ω    f (K) − f 0 (K)K
                              =           and H =          =                  .
                            K    φ                     R−1        R−1
Combining gives condition (24) in the Proposition.

    Proof of Condition (25).           Let µ̂ ≡ ln r̄(ω) − ln R = ln f 0 (K) − ln R. Taking logarithms of
(36) we get
                     θ ln(βR) + (θ − 1)(ln ρ − ln R) + ln(φeµ̂ + 1 − φ) = 0.
                ¡            ¢                        ¡             ¢
Approximating ln φeµ̂ + 1 − φ around µ̂ = 0 gives ln φeµ̂ + 1 − φ ≈ φµ̂ and therefore

                                  θ ln(βR) + (θ − 1)(ln ρ − ln R) + φµ̂ ≈ 0
                    ¡    ¢             £     ¡     ¢¤
Substituting φ ≈ µ̂/ γσ 2 and ρ ≈ R exp µ̂2 / 2γσ 2 into the above, we conclude that µ̂ solves

                                                            θ + 1 µ̂2
                                         0 ≈ θ ln(βR) +               .
                                                              2 γσ 2

                                                       25
Note that the above has two real solutions, but only one is positive, and this one gives the equilib-
rium premium. Substituting this solution into µ̂ = ln f 0 (K) − ln R gives (25).

    Proof of Proposition 3. By (24), φ ∈ (0, 1). For that to be true, it must be that f 0 (K) > R,
or otherwise the bond would dominate private equity. By risk aversion, then, R < ρ < φf 0 (K) +
(1 − φ)R, which together with (23) gives also ρ < 1/β. Combining, we have

                      R < ρ < φf 0 (K) + (1 − φ)R < f 0 (K) and R < ρ < 1/β.                            (55)

Next, taking logarithms of (23) and rearranging gives
                     £        ¤       £                    ¤             £         ¤
                θ log βf 0 (K) = − log φ + (1 − φ)R/f 0 (K) − (θ − 1) log ρ/f 0 (K) .

It follows that βf 0 (K) > 1 if and only if θ > θ where
                                             log [φ + (1 − φ)R/f 0 (K)]
                                    θ =1−                               .                               (56)
                                                    log [ρ/f 0 (K)]
Note that θ above is expressed in terms of endogenous variables, but (55) ensures that θ < 1. Next,
consider the limit as σ → 0. Letting stars indicate the steady-state values under complete markets,
we have that R, ρ, f 0 (K) → R∗ = β −1 , K → K ∗ = f −1 (1/β), and φ → φ∗ , where
                      1 − φ∗   f (K ∗ ) − f 0 (K ∗ )K ∗   f (K ∗ )/K ∗ − R∗
                             =                          =                   ∈ (0, 1).                   (57)
                        φ∗         (R∗ − 1)K ∗                 R∗ − 1
Thus, using L’Hopital’s rule in (56), we have that, as σ → 0,

                                          θ → 1 − (1 − φ∗ ) = φ∗ .

Finally, letting κ and α denote, respectively, the capital-output ratio and the income share of capital
(that is, κ = K ∗ /fˆ (K ∗ ) and α = fˆ0 (K ∗ ) K ∗ /fˆ (K ∗ ) , where fˆ (K) = f (K) − (1 − δ) K = K α ), we
get by (57) that
                                              R∗ − 1           α
                                   φ∗ =                    =        ≤ α,
                                          f (K ∗ )/K ∗ − 1   1 + δκ
which completes the proof.

    Proof of Proposition 4. The budget constraint of household i in period t reduces
                               ¡             ¢                             ¡         ¢

                              + xit+1 + bit+1 ≤ wti = r(Ait , ω t )kti + Rt xit + bit + ωt .

Hence, Lemma 2 continues to apply provided we replace b with x + b; that is,

                                           cit = (1 − st )(wti + ht )
                                            i
                                           kt+1 = st φt (wti + ht )
                                 xit+1 + bit+1 = st (1 − φt )(wti + ht ) − ht


                                                      26
where φt , ρt , and st are defined again as in Lemma 2. Conditions (27), (28), (31), and (33) then
                                                                                       R
follow from aggregating across agents and using the bond market clearing condition, bit+1 = 0,
like in Proposition 1. Finally, (30) follows from profit maximization in the public-equity sector and
(32) from labor market clearing.

    Proof of Proposition 5. We first prove that ρ (ω, R) = R and φ (ω, R) = ϕ, where                  and ϕ
are given by (34)-(35). Under A1, n(A, ω) = An̄(ω), r(A, ω) = Ar̄(ω), and r̄(ω) = FK (1, n̄ (ω) , 1).
It follows that
                                   ½Z                                                      ¾1/(1−γ)
                                                                             1−γ
          φ (ω, R) = arg max            [ϕAFK (1, n̄ (ω) , 1) + (1 − ϕ)R]          ψ (A) dA
                               ϕ
                              ½Z                                                     ¾1/(1−γ)
                                                                       1−γ
          ρ (ω, R) = max           [ϕAFK (1, n̄ (ω) , 1) + (1 − ϕ)R]         ψ (A) dA
                          ϕ

Under A2, on the other hand, R = GK (1, l (ω)) = FK (1, n̄ (ω) , 1) /µ. Combining gives the result.
We now prove the proposition.
    (a) Like in the one-sector case, stationarity of aggregate wealth requires s [ϕr̄(ω) + (1 − ϕ)R] =
1, where s = β θ ρθ−1 . Using R = R(ω) and r̄(ω) = µR(ω), we have ρ = R and [ϕr̄(ω) + (1 − ϕ)R] =
(ϕµ+1−ϕ)R, and therefore the stationarity condition reduces to (36). This together with R = R(ω)
gives a unique R and a unique ω. Next, in steady state, K = ϕs[W +H] and X +H = (1−ϕ)[W +H],
and therefore (X + H) /K = (1 − φ) /φ. On the other hand, the clearing condition for the labor
market gives n̄(ω)K + l(ω)X = 1. Using n̄(ω) = µl(ω), and solving the above two conditions for K
and X, we get
                                ϕ[1 + l(ω)H]                   1 − ϕ − ϕµl(ω)H
                        K=                         and X =
                              (ϕµ + 1 − ϕ)l(ω)                 (ϕµ + 1 − ϕ)l(ω)
or equivalently (37). This completes the characterization of the steady state. Uniqueness is obvious.
As for existence, note that any µ > 1 implies ϕ > 0 and therefore K > 0 necessarily. On the other
hand, X > 0 if and only if ϕ is suﬃciently small, which is the case as long as σ is suﬃciently large.
    (b) Since R0 (ω) < 0, ω decreases with σ if and only if R increases with σ. From condition (36),
                                      ∙                                  ¸
                         d ln R     1     µ − 1 d ln ϕ              d ln
                                =−                        + (θ − 1)        .
                           dσ       θ ϕµ + 1 − ϕ dσ                  dσ
It follows that dR/dσ > 0, and therefore dω/dσ < 0, if and only if θ > θ, where
                                                 µ − 1 d ln ϕ/dσ
                                     θ =1−
                                               ϕµ + 1 − ϕ d ln /dσ
An increase in σ unambiguously lowers ϕ and , which immediately proves θ < 1. Next, since
l0 (ω) < 0 and R0 (ω) < 0, from (37) we infer that K is increasing in ω and decreasing in ϕ, and X
is increasing in ϕ but (possibly) non-monotonic in ω. Since
                                             1/l(ω) + ω/(R − 1)
                  K + X = 1/l(ω) − (µ − 1)                      = 1/l(ω) − (µ − 1)K,
                                                 µ + 1/ϕ − 1

                                                    27
aggregate capital K + X is necessarily increasing in ϕ but non-monotonic in ω and therefore
non-monotonic in σ as well. Finally, aggregate output is Y = F (1, n̄(ω), Ā)K + G(1, l(ω))X.
Using n̄(ω) = µl(ω) and F (K/µ, N, A) = F (K, N, A/µ) = G(K, N ), we have F (1, n̄(ω), 1) =
F (1, µl(ω), 1) = G(1, l(ω))µ and therefore Y = G(1, l(ω))[µK + X], which together with (37) gives
Y = G (1/l(ω), 1) . Output thus increases with ω, reflecting the fact that ω increases if and only
if resources are shifted from less productive public equity to more productive private equity. By
implication, Y /(K + X) and C = Y − (K + X) also increase with ω and decrease with ϕ. We
conclude that θ > θ suﬃces for an increase in σ to raise R and reduce ω, K, Y, Y /(N + L), and
Y /(K + X).


     Proof of Lemma 3. Let ω t denote the wage rate per eﬀective unit of labor and take a given
(Zt , Kt , Xt , Ht−1 ). The labor-market clearing condition, n̄(ωt )Kt + l(ω t )Xt = Zt , gives a unique
ω t . Next, let Rt = R(ω t ), Ht = R(ωt )Ht−1 − ω t Zt , and Yt = f (ω t )Kt + g(ω t )Xt , where f (ω t ) ≡
F (1, n̄(ω t ), 1) and g (ωt ) ≡ G(1, l(ωt )). Next, denote with ψ t (A) the p.d.f. for the lognormal distrib-
                    ¡           ¢                                                         R
ution ln A ∼ N −σ 2t /2, σ 2t , where σ t = σ [1 − η ln Zt ] , and let φt = arg maxϕ { (ϕAµ + 1 − µ)1−γ
                              ¡   ¢
ψ t (A) dA}1/(1−γ) ≈ µ/ γσ 2t . Finally, let Ct = (1 − β) [Yt + Ht ] , Kt+1 = φt β [Yt + Ht ] , Xt+1 =
(1 − φt )β [Yt + Ht ] − Ht , and Zt+1 = Ztρ , which completes the construction of (Zt+1 , Kt+1 , Xt+1 , Ht )
and (Ct , Yt , ω t , Rt ) .
