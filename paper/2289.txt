 Understanding the Real Estate Provisions of Tax Reform: Motivation and Impact




                                   ABSTRACT


      Capital investment tax provisions have been changed numerous times in the
last decade, with depreciation tax lives shortened in 1981 and lengthened ever
since and capital gains taxation reduced in 1978 and 1981 and now increased.
The first part of this paper analyzes these changes and attributes a large part
of them, including the 1986 Tax Act, to changes in inflation: tax depreciation
schedules and capital gains taxation that look reasonable when the tax
depreciation base is being eroded at ten percent a year and an overwhelming
share of capital gains is pure inflation take on a different appearance when
inflation is only four percent.
      The remainder of the paper critiques the typical project model used to
compute impacts of tax changes on real estate and report simulation results
using a modified model.

    The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (ERTA) contained the most

favorable capital investment provisions probably ever enacted: tax

lives for all depreciable property were shortened markedly, and capital

gains tax rates were lowered sharply owing to the cuts in marginal tax

rates. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 more than reverses ERTA: tax

depreciation is less generous than before 1981, capital gains tax

rates are even higher than before 1978, and new passive loss provisions

are being applied to real estate. What brought about this sea change

in tax law, and what impact will the change have on real estate?

    Many explanations for the tax change exist, most relating to

political considerations in one way or another, and we certainly would

not deny politics, in its widest context, a major role. However,

political considerations do not tell the entire story. The rise in

inflation and interest rates in the late 1970s and early 1980s con-

tributed to the investment provisions of ERTA, and the declines since

then influenced the form of the provisions in the 1986 Act. Tax

depreciation schedules and capital gains rates that look reasonable

when inflation is four percent take on a different hue when the tax

depreciation base is being eroded at ten percent a year and an over-

whelming share of capital gains is pure inflation.

    The "inflation matters" thesis is developed and support for it is

provided in the next section. The remainder of the paper discusses

the impact of the 1986 Act on real estate. The second section focuses

on the methodological issues surrounding many simulation analyses of

the effects of tax changes on real estate. The third section dis-

cusses the likely impacts of the new law on rents (up), owner costs
                                   —2—


(down), and home ownership (up); the final section summarizes the main

conclusions of the paper.


      I. The Apparent Rationale for the Real Estate Provisions

    The key real estate provisions in the Tax Reform Act of 1986 are

those pertaining to tax depreciation, capital gains, and passive

losses. Changes in tax depreciation lives and capital gains taxation

over the last decade follow a pattern that partially explains the pro-

visions in the 1986 tax act. The passive loss rules follow as a logi-

cal consequence of not indexing either interest expense or the

depreciable basis.


                            A. Tax Depreciation

    Prior law allowed investors in rental real estate to use the 175

percent declining balance method (with a switch to straight—line in

about year nine) and a useful life of 19 years. The new law specifies

that the straight—line method be used over a useful life of 27.5 years

(31.5 for non—residential structures). This represents the fourth

change in the depreciation schedule in the past five years. The

Economic Recovery and Tax Act of 1981 (ERTA) shortened useful life

from about 30 years to 15. The tax laws of 1984 and 1985 increased

useful life to 18 and then to 19 years. The frequency of these

changes suggests that future changes are likely. We explore the pat-

tern of past changes in order to better anticipate future changes.

   Economists argue that tax depreciation should equal real economic

depreciation at replacement cost. This criterion implies a quite low

constant annual depreciation rate for structures (less than 4 percent
                                 —3—


per year, Hulton and Wykoff, 1981) but applied to a base indexed to

changes in the price level. That is, during inflationary periods, tax

depreciation would be backloaded (increase over time), rather than

frontloaded as it has always been. Indexation of the basis would

result in the present value of tax depreciation being independent of

inflation if the discount rate moved one—for—one with the inflation

rate.

    Legislators have obviously not adopted the economistts explicit

indexation recommendation: during the past 15 years tax depreciation

has never been less than 6 1/2 percent in the initial full year and

has always declined quickly in subsequent years. However, changes in

the useful tax life over the past decade have been negatively

correlated with movements in interest rates and inflation. These

useful—life changes have had the effect of offsetting sharp changes in

the present value of the tax saving from tax depreciation allowances

generated by the interest rate movements. For example, ERTA reduced

useful life to its lowest level at a time when interest rates were at

their peak level, and useful life has increased during the 1980s as

interest rates have declined. It appears that legislators have adopted

an ad hoc strategy of indexation that involves a change in the tax

depreciation schedule in response to changes in the inflation/interest

rate environment • 1

    As evidence of this ad hoc strategy, the present value of the tax

saving from tax depreciation allowances is computed for various years

during the past decade. We start out with the relatively low

inflation/interest rate environment of the middle 1970s and then
                                 —4—


examine the impact of rising inflation (1980—81), the 1981 tax law

response (15 versus 30 year useful life), the decrease in inflation

and interest rates (1983—84), the 1984 response (15 to 18 year tax

life), the further decrease in interest rates/inflation (1986), and

finally the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Altogether, seven different

combinations of tax law and economic environment are examined. The

specific assumptions used to define these tax—economic combinations

are listed in the upper half of Table 1. Tax law changes include

changes in depreciation policy as well as changes in the marginal tax

rate of the marginal investor in real estate. Hendershott, Follain

and Ling (HFL 1987) make the case for the 0.45 tax rate (federal plus

state and local, after deductibility) under pre—1986 law and 0.36

under the 1986 Act.

    The present values of the tax depreciation deductions associated

with each tax—economic regime are reported in the lower half of Table

1. The present values are computed under two assumptions: no trading

and trading at the end of the tax life of the building.2 The higher

of the two values has been ttbracketedt? in the Table. These calcula-

tions indicate that trading was suboptimal prior to ERTA and will be

suboptimal under the new law. In the interim, trading added from 2 to

5 cents to value per dollar of investment.

    Under 1976 law, the tax saving from tax depreciation was 0.267 per

dollar of investment, i.e., the present value of tax depreciation

allowances multiplied by the appropriate tax rate equalled 26.7

percent of the original basis. When increases/decreases in inflation

and interest rates lowered/raised the tax saving relative to 26.7
                                 —5—


percent, the tax depreciation schedule was adjusted to bring the

percentage back into line. However, the ERTA of 1981 and the Tax

Reform Act of 1986 more than compensated for the earlier increase!

decrease in inflation and interest rates. Thus two cycles for tax

depreciation seem to exist, an endogenous response to the

inflation/interest—rate cycle and an exogenous "political" cycle. The

1986 Tax Act reflects both of these cycles; depreciation policy under

new law is less generous than any tax—economic combination of the past

10 years (probably in the last 50).


                   B. The Passive Loss Provisions

    The 1986 Tax Act contains special provisions for income generated

by passive activities, i.e., those in which the taxpayer does not

materially participate and rental real estate. The law states that

income from passive activities may not be used to offset regular or

portfolio income (except, possibly, upon sale of the asset), with

exceptions for small landlords and corporations. Under previous law,

a substantial portion of real estate returns to many investors during

inflationary periods was tax savings generated by using the "paper

losses" from real estate to offset taxable income from other

activities.

    Large passive losses during inflationary periods are a direct

consequence of nonindexation of either interest expense or the

depreciable basis. Most important is the deductibility of nominal,

rather than real, interest expense. Not only is the inflationary

premium in interest rates deductible, but the premium itself is higher
                                 —6—


because of the deductibility (Feldstein 1976). Also significant is

the above—discussed endogenous change in tax depreciation when

inflation accelerates (greater front—loading of allowances). The

imposition of passive loss limits is one way to prevent investors in

tax shelters from reducing taxes on their regular income.

   Figure 1 indicates the amount of losses generated by a particular

real estate project during high and low inflation environments under

both new law and previous law. Each curve plots losses for different

loan—to--value ratios. The lowest two lines indicate the cumulative

losses (summation of losses until the year in which positive cash

flows are realized) as a percent of investment value for different

loan—to—value ratios for the low 1986 inflation/interest—rate environ-

ment under new law (lowest) and under old law. The next line indi-

cates how cumulative losses under old law would rise if the economy

reverted to the 1981 high inflation/interest—rate environment but

Congress did not shorten the tax depreciation schedules (the present

value of tax saving from tax depreciation deductions would decline

from 0.295 to 0.200). The highest line indicates the cumulative

losses under old law for both high nominal interest rates and a

shorter depreciation schedule (ERTA, which raises the present value to

0.291).

    The direct effect of inflation upon the amount of passive losses

under previous law is striking (line 2 vs. line 3), and the impact is

compounded by an endogenous policy response (line 4). Even all equity

projects generated negative cash flow in the early years under this

scenario, and negative cash flow would be generated throughout the tax
                                 —7—


life of a project with 80 percent financing. It is not surprising

that concerns were raised regarding the efficiency and equity implica—

tions of such a system.

    Under the new law, passive losses are not projected to be

substantial in today's moderate inflation environment. Indeed,

passive losses will not be generated for projects with less than 70

percent loan—to—value ratios once rent rises to its equilibrium level

(see below). However, passive losses will be generated, even at lower

loan—to—value ratios, at higher interest (inflation) rates.

    The passive loss limits increase the riskiness of a real estate

investment because the government will not continue to share fully the

losses of an unsuccessful investment. As a result, rental real estate

income earned by proprietors and partnerships will be treated like

corporate income, fully taxable if positive, but only banked for

future deductions if negative. Investors will require higher rents on

real estate investments to compensate for this effective increase in

taxation.


                      C. Capital Gains Taxation

    After a decade of reductions in the statutory capital gains tax

rate (the product of the regular income tax rate and one minus the

exclusion), the new law sharply increases this rate. For our assumed

marginal investor with a regular tax rate of 0.45 (federal and state)

under pre—1986 law and 0.36 under the new law, the gains rate doubles

from 0.18 to 0.36. This contrasts with the declines in 1978, when the
                                 —8—


exclusion rate was increased from 50 to 60 percent, and in 1981, when

regular tax rate cuts lowered the gains rate further to the 0.18 dis-

cussed above.

    The appropriate tax treatment of capital gains is not obvious.

Some would argue that gains should be taxed fully (no exclusion) as

they accrue, not upon realization. Others would argue for a favorable

treatment, although not necessarily for an exclusion (the deferral

advantage of taxation upon realization might be sufficient, at least

for long holding periods). Others would opt for the taxation of real

gains only, usually accompanied by the deduction of only real interest

expense. Our task is not to sort out these issues but only to find a

pattern in past legislative behavior regarding capital gains taxation.

    Changes in the statutory capital gains tax rate over the last

decade are consistent with an effort to maintain a constant tax rate

on inflationary gains over a holding period of roughly five years.

Thus, accelerating inflation in the late l970s and early l980s

triggered a cut in the gains rate, while the subsequent disinflation

induced an increase in the gains rate.3 The calculations in the

lowest row of Table 1 illustrate this point. The present value of the

tax on five years of inflationary gains is computed using the weighted

average cost of capital as the discount rate. In the 1976—77 period,

the tax is 6.7 percent. The increase in inflation to its 1980 level

raises the tax to 8.7 percent, assuming no change in tax rates. The

cut in the gains rate from 0.25 to 0.18 offsets the increase in

inflation. Similarly, the fall in inflation during the l980s cut the
                                    —9—




inflation   tax to 3.1 percent by 1986, and the 1986 increase in the

gains tax rate raises the inflation tax back to 6.2 percent.


             II. The Depreciable Real Estate Project Model

    A tool frequently employed to analyze the impact of tax reform

upon real estate markets is the "typical project model." This model

begins with assumptions regarding the initial loan—to—value ratio, the

debt rate, the tax rate of the marginal investor, and the required rate

of return on equity. The model computes the minimum rent needed in

the first year of operation of the project to equate the net present

value of all after—tax cash flows associated with the project

(including interest and principal payments on an amortizing mortgage),

discounted by the equity rate, to zero. The minimum rent calculation

is made with both old and new tax law parameters, and the percentage

change in initial rent is the key statistic reported. This section

discusses some shortcomings of the project model and our correction of

them.


                  A.   Problems with the Project Model
    The   major problem with the project model is the treatment of debt
and equity. The equity rate is generally based upon what "the
industry"   seems to be requiring. An economist might specify this rate

as the "ten year" tax—exempt rate plus a risk premium. A financial

economist would likely employ an after—tax capital asset pricing model

where the required after—tax return (e) is the after—tax debt rate

[(1—t)i] plus a risk premium depending on the market risk premium

(MRP), the covariance ()    of   the returns on real estate and the market
                                      —10—


portfolio, the loan—to—value ratio (v), and the tax rate applied to

the premium (tn).     When the debt has no default risk (v < 0.75?), the

specification is:


           e =   (l—t)i   + (1—i) ---—MRP.                            (1)


Equation (1) shows a clear dependence of the required return on leverage

(the loan—to—value ratio), tax rates, and the pretax interest rate.4

    The dependency of the equity rate on leverage does not exist in

the project model. Users of the model specifiy an initial v and choose

a constant discount rate e for all future cash flows. Because the

loan is amortizing and the property value is inflating, the loan—to—

value ratio is falling and thus so must be the required return to

equity (Hendershott and Ling, 1986). Setting e at a constant value in

the project model involves an internal inconsistency. Moreover, the

inconsistency leads to another error. With an assumed constant equity

rate, investors are presumed (incorrectly) to be using more and more

expensive equity and less and less cheap debt. Investors "solve" this

problem by trading properties quickly. In fact, there is little or no

need to realign the debt/equity mix      if   the equity yield is computed

correctly. Indeed, even if a need existed, investors could (likely

would) realign the debt/equity ratio by refinancing rather than by

trading.

    The dependency of the equity rate on tax rates and the debt rate

is also generally missing in the project model, i.e., e is presumed to

be invariant with respect to tax law.5
                                        —11—


    In our model, the cost of capital (or capital budgeting) approach

is employed. Debt payments are not included in the cash flows.

Rather, all nondebt payments are discounted by the weighted average

cost of capital,


        WACC       v(l—'r)i + (l—v)e,                                   (2)


to obtain the initial minimum rent substituting (1) into (2) produces


        WACC =     (l—t)i   + (l—r)8.MRP.                               (2')


Note that the weighted average cost of capital is independent of the

loan—to—value ratio. Thus the initial minimum rent in this model is

independent of leverage.6

    Using (2') requires specification of 8'NRP and             nontrivial

tasks. Fortunately, some information is available on t and MRP, and

8 can be chosen so that the computed e is consistent with what the

industry seemed to be requiring under prereform law at the interest

rates then existing. With this specification, e can be recomputed in

an internally consistent manner to reflect the new law. In the cal-

culations below, i =    0.09,   11 =   0.045 and the tax rate on the risk

premium is set equal to one—third the tax rate on ordinary income plus

two—thirds the effective capital gains tax rate. This latter rate

equals one—half the statutory rate, the one—half reflecting the value

of deferral. Finally, we set 8MRP              0.03, a specification that is

consistent with 8 =    0.5   and MRP
                                  —12—


            B. Project Model Versus General Equilibrium Models

    Common practice these days is to criticize the "partial equil-

ibrium" project model in favor of a general equilibrium (GE) analysis

(Gravelle 1986). This practice is badly inisfocused. To see this,

consider the gains and losses associated with the use of a GE model

that are relevant to the impact of tax reform on rents. The gains

from a GE model include the change in the level of debt rates and

possibly other market parameters, such as the market risk premium

affecting the required return on equity. The losses are the failure

to capture the impacts of industry specific tax changes. For depre-

ciable real estate, these include the capitalization of construction

period interest and taxes (rather than the previous 10—year write

off), changes in the gains from trading (both the higher capital gains

tax rate and lengthening of tax depreciation write off s reduce the

gains), and less favorable treatment of interest expense (passive loss

rules, interest limitations, and at—risk rules). Not only is the

latter list longer than the former, but, more importantly, GE re-

sponses can be easily factored into the project model: if GE

considerations led one to think interest rates will decline by a

percentage point, a one point decline could be used in the cal-

culation.

    The practical choice, then, is whether to use the corrected

project model (the cost of capital variant) with GE responses incor-

porated or to use GE models that ignore much interesting nitty gritty.

In our view the former will produce better estimates of tax reform's

impact than the latter; consequently, this procedure is followed here.
                                 —13—


    Actually, the GE models are generally less valuable than the above

discussion indicates. Take the impact of the Tax Act on interest rates.

The Act will certainly lower the level of interest rates because the

Act has a negative direct impact on the demands for all capital goods.

But the extent of the decline depends on the interest elasticity of

domestic and foreign saving, elasticities about which we are highly

uncertain. To accept the GE results from a particular model is to

accept a wide range of assumptions, many of which are quite tenuous

and others of which are not stated.8

    TEn the analysis below, a one percentage point decline in interest

rates is generally assumed, somewhat less than a fixed capital stock

or constant saving model would imply (HFL, 1987). The WACC response

is calculated from (2').


                     TEll. Some Estimated Impacts

    We compute percentage changes in rents, in the annual rental cost

of owner housing, and in the ratio of these rents, the latter being

relevant to the tenure choice decision. Our primary emphasis is on

the rent impact; estimates of the impact on costs of owner housing

were presented in HFL (1987) and are therefore only summarized here.


                     A. Equilibrium Rent Levels

    The equilibrium level of rent under the Tax Act must increase to

replace the reduced tax benefits. Only then will investors in real

estate earn a rate of return comparable to that on other investments

of similar risk. We compute estimates of the likely rent increase for
                                 —14—


residential properties under alternative assumptions regarding both

the tax rate of the marginal investor in real estate and the size of

the interest rate decline.

    With no change in the interest rate and a 45 percent marginal tax

rate for the marginal investor, residential rents will increase by 13

percent; with a 52 percent marginal rate, the rent increase is 21 per-

cent. If a percentage point decline in interest rates is factored

into the analysis, the required residential rent increase is reduced

from 13 percent to 6 percent for the 45 percent tax—rate investor and

from 21 percent to 13 percent for the 52 percent investor.

    Of these estimates, we consider the 6 percent rent increase, or

something only slightly higher, to be most likely. We believe the

marginal investor under old law to have been in the 45 percent tax

bracket (federal plus state and local, with deductibility), and we

think that interest rates have already declined by a percentage point

because of the Tax Act (see HFL 1987 for a discussion of these

points). A slightly higher percentage rent increase, say 10 percent,

might occur for the two reasons discussed above: the importance of

the relatively certain tax depreciation component of the return to

real estate will decline vis—a—vis the less certain net operating

income component and real estate losses will no longer be deductible

against nonpassive income.

    The timing of the increase in rents depends upon the local rental

market. Following our earlier analysis (HFL 1987), a three—year

adjustment is reasonable in fast growing markets, while up to eight
                                 —15—


years is reasonable in slow growing areas with vacancy rates 10 per-

centage points above equilibrium levels. Moreover, the extent of

value declines depends on how much and how long rents are expected to

be below their equilibrium level. For a 10 percent increase in equil-

ibrium rents, the percentage declines in value for our two extreme

rent—adjustment assumptions are one and seven (HFL 1987).

    Gravelle (1986) contends that a negative impact of the 1986 Tax

Act on depreciable real estate is implausible because equipment is

clearly the type of capital hardest hit. We agreed in our earlier

paper that investments losing tax credits (including real estate

historic and rehabilitation projects) would be most adversely affected

(HFL 1987, p. 75)•9 But so what? As noted above, the new law is

anti—investment across the board. Every type of capital good (except

possibly low income housing) suffers a direct negative impact from the

Act. In a world with open capital markets, all types of U.S. capital

goods could contract as capital flows abroad. With closed capital

markets, the negative impact on equipment needs to be offset by a

positive impact elsewhere, but that offset need not be depreciable

real estate. Owner—occupied housing, which is a larger component of

the total capital stock than is equipment, is certainly the most

relatively favored component of capital (see below). Thus, even with

a fixed capital stock, there is room for a negative impact on

depreciable real estate, i.e., a rise in rents.
                                 —16—


            B. Owner—Occupied Housing and Home Ownership

    The 1986 Tax Act does not directly alter any of the favorable tax

provisions granted owner—occupied housing; imputed rents are still not

taxed, capital gains are taxed (if at all) with a long deferral, and

these advantages are still available to debt—financed, as well as

equity—financed, housing (interest remains deductible on two houses).

Nonetheless, the Tax Act affects the after—tax cost of owner housing

through two channels. First, the tax rates at which households deduct

housing costs are reduced. Second, the pretax level of interest rates

will be lower. In addition, the net changes in owner costs in

conjunction with the rise in market rents will probably alter the

aggregate home ownership rate. This section briefly sununarizes our

previously published results regarding these effects.

    As with rental housing, the cost of owner—occupied housing depends

upon the cost of capital, property taxes, real economic depreciation,

expected appreciation, and tax savings. Two measures of this cost are

relevant: the average cost, which influences the tenure choice deci-

sion; and the marginal cost, which affects the quantity demanded by

homeowners. If interest rates are a percentage point lower, as we

contend, then households with incomes below about $30,000 will expe-

rience a 10 percent decrease in marginal housing costs; households

with incomes above about $130,000 will face a 5 percent increase; and

the change for other households will be negligible. Average housing

costs will also decrease slightly for households with incomes below

approximately $60,000; however, households with incomes above about
                                     —17—


$120,000 will experience a 5 percent increase in costs. These calcu-

lations suggest that significant changes in the quantity of owner—

occupied housing demanded, and thus in the value of existing houses,

will be limited to households and houses at the extremes of the income

and value spectrumsJ°

    Another implication pertains to the rent—own decision of house-

holds. The average cost calculations suggest that with an interest

rate decline and no change in rents, ownership is modestly more

attractive for households with incomes below about $60,000 and

slightly less attractive for higher—income households. With a 10 per-

cent rise in rents, all currently renting households will find owner-

ship more attractive than under the old law. The magnitude of the

impact on the aggregate ownership rate is uncertain. With a high

assumed elasticity of ownership with respect to tenure prices, the

rise could eventually be as much as three percentage points. With a

low elasticity, the rise would be less than one point (Haurin,

Hendershott and Ling, 1987).


                               IV.   Summary

    During the past decade changes in tax depreciation allowances and

in the statutory capital gains tax rate have followed a pattern that

provides both a rationale for the major real estate provisions of the

1986 Tax and a basis for anticipating future tax changes. The common

thread through the hypothesized rationale is inflation and how the tax

system is adjusted for it. If the tax system had been fully indexed

(depreciation basis, interest expense, and capital gains), little need
                                 —18--



would have existed for the real estate provisions of the 1986 Tax Act.

The present value of tax savings from depreciation allowances would

not have increased and that of taxes on inflationary capital gains

would not have decreased in response to the declines in inflation and

interest rates since 1981; thus, offsetting legislation would have

been unnecessary (or less necessary). Moreover, the passive loss

rules would be unnecessary with a fully indexed system because

interest expense and depreciation deductions would be far less during

inflationary periods. Finally, this analysis predicts a cut in the

gains tax rate (a return of the exclusion) and a shortening of

depreciation tax lives if inflation should rebound.

    In contrast to the conventional wisdom, the 1986 tax act is

unlikely to discourage real estate activity in the aggregate. Within

the broad aggregate, however, widely different effects are to be

expected. Depreciable real estate will be slightly disfavored; a 6 to

10 percent increase in the equilibrium level of rents is likely.

Historic and regular rehabilitation projects will be more negatively

affected. In contrast, owner—occupied housing, by far the largest

component of real estate, is favored, both directly by an interest

rate decline and indirectly by the increase in rents. Home ownership

should rise somewhat, and the quantity of houses demanded and value of

existing houses should increase slightly, except at the very high end

of the income and house value distributions.

                                 FOOTNOTE S


    1Feldstein and Summers (1979) made a case for cutting taxes on

capital income to offset the increase in inflation.
    2
        The weighted average cost of capital is used as the discount

rate. This average is defined precisely in the text below.

    3Feldstein and Slemrod (1979) make a case for low (or zero) taxa-

tion of inflationary gains.
    4
        Of course, if (l—t)i equals the tax—exempt rate and the risk pre-

mium is measured as the second term in (1), the economist and finan-

cial economist are in full agreement.

    5Another problem with the project model is the high discount rate

(e) applied to tax depreciation allowances which are less risky than

net operating income. Using e as the discount rate will generally

overstate the negative impact (increase in initial rent) of a less

generous tax depreciation schedule because the more distant deductions

are discounted too severely (Hendershott and Ling, 1986).

    6Gravelle's (1986) calculations of initial rent increases that

vary with the leverage ratio are the result of not allowing e to vary

with v and thus do not provide useful information.

    Although initial rents are independent of the leverage used by the

marginal investor, the expected returns to investors in tax brackets

above that of the marginal investor increase with leverage; when

excess returns (expected above required) are available, leverage pays.

    7lnflation is well understood to alter the cost of capital under a

wide variety of tax regimes, including old law and the Tax Reform Act

of 1986 (see Hendershott 1987 and Henderson 1986, for example). More

specifically, inflation favors rental housing, although by less under

new law than under old. To illustrate this point, a number of

simulations were run. An increase in expected inflation from 41/2 to 9

percent would, under old law, eventually lower initial rents by 13 to

24 percent, the smaller figure being based on interest rates rising

more than one—for—one with expected inflation (both calculations

incorporate an "endogenous" shortening of tax depreciation lives to

hold the present value of the depreciation tax saving constant).

Under the 1986 Tax Act, the percentage decreases are about halved.
    8
        This is not meant as a criticism of GE models or modelers, but

rather of the uncritical acceptance of their simulation results.

    9mis point is widely understood (see Henderson 1986 and

Hendershott 1987, for example).

    10All the calculations are for "typical" married couples with two

dependents. Because tax rates of "other" household heads are reduced

relatively more, the increase in their costs of owner housing is

somewhat greater.
