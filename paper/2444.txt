                        Nutrition and Infant Health in Japan



                                     ABSTRACT


The model presented in this paper emphasizes the importance of
the mother's nutritional intake as                a determinant of infant
health. Using cross-sectional market averages for 1980 and 1981
in Japan, we fInd that the nutrient intake of the mother during
pregnancy is     a potential determinant of neonatal and infant
mortality in Japan, with increased consumption of calcium and
iron leading to improved birth outcomes.                   Using the results
obtained from the estimation of neonatal and infant mortality
production functions, we note that increases in the prices of
food items, in particular milk and meat, would lead to increases
in neonatal and infant mortality rates.                 We discover that the
availability of abortion in Japan, unlike in the U.S., is
positively related to mortality rates, although never sig-
nificantly.       Finally, we see that cigarette smoking, alcohol
consumption, and poor environmental quality all have strongly
adverse effects on newborn survival outcomes in Japan.

I.   INTRODUCTION



        The consensus obtained from recent health economics studies
is that parental behaviors -.   the   consumption of medical care,
smoking, drinking, and residence 1ocation - determine infant
health through the health of the mother (Rosenzweig and Schultz

1982,     1983a,   1983b; Schultz 1984; Joyce and Grossman 1986;
Corman, Joyce, and Grossman 1987; Joyce, Grossman, and Goldman
forthcoming) •1

        These studies found that the use of medical care, which
includes teenage family planning, prenatal care, and neonatal
intensive care,      as well as the use of abortion significantly
reduce the risk of neonatal mortality. They also find that the
delay of prenatal care and smoking by te mother have adverse
effects on birth weight, gestational age, and infant mortality.
Finally, air pollution, mainly sulfur dioxide, is found to induce
high risks in newborn survival outcomes.
        Despite the implicit assumption that the health and nutri-
tional status of the mother is a major determinant of birth
outcomes (e.g. birth weight and the gestation period) and infant
health (e.g. neonatal and infant mortalities), these recent
empirical studies fai1 to emphasize the role of the mother's
nutritional status.        The health and nutritional status of the


       These studies emphasize that the omission of the child's
health endowment, known to the parents but not to researchers,
from econometric regressions leads to the misinterpretation of
the estimates of the child's health production function.

mother significantly affect her productivity in both labor and
non labor markets.    A weak health and poor nutritional status
often result in the loss of physical and mental strength, and,
consequently, in frequent illness (Pitt and Rosenzweig 1985).   It

is reasonable, therefore, to assume that inadequate nutrient
intake by the mother leads to a reduction in efficiency in the
production of her child's health.2
   Hence, we incorporate the mother's nutritional status as an
input into an infant health production function. Furthermore,
the omission of this variable will exacerbate the heterogeneity

problem (i.e., heterogeneous health endowments across households)
since the health and nutritional status of the mother appears
highly correlated with the health and nutritional status of the
infant. By including a variable representing the mother's health
endowment which captures part of the infant's health endowment,
we are able to mitigate the biases in the estimated coefficients
of the other explanatory variables which are causally related to
the health endowment of the infant.

     Specifically, we investigate the importance o1 nutrient
intake by the mother and other socioeconomic factors In the
determination of infant health in .Japan. This application of the


     2The importance of nutrition and health as determinants of
productivity have been demonstrated theoretically as well as
empirically in studies of     developing countries, especia1ly
economically poor countries (Belli 1971; Selowsky and Taylor
1973; Wilford 1975; Franke and Barrett 1975; Johnston 1977; Bliss
and Stern 1978a and 1978b; Ward and Sanders 1980; Wolfe and
Behrman 1982 and 1983; Behrman and Wolfe 1984; and Strauss 1984
and 1986).

economic models of the family to Japanese data should be under—
lined for the following reasons, First, an understanding of the
effect of nutrient intake by the mother on infant health is
crucial for the development of policies designed to improve
infant health.   Secondly, despite the many empirical studies of
U.S. infant health, no attempt has been made to explore theoreti-
cal and empirical studies in Japan. Finally, a quantitative
evaluation of these effects rests on studies such as ours.

II. ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK


     We assume that household utility depends on infant health H,
a vector of commodities Z1 which affect H, and a vector of
commodities Z2 which do not affect H (Rosenzweig and Schultz 1982

and 1983b):
            U = U(H, Zi, Z2)                   (1)

where U is        a strictly convex, twice differentiable utility
function. Let the survival probability of the infant x, repre-
senting infant health, be described by the following production
function:
              =   r(M,   z1, p)             (2)

M represents the quantity and quality of the medical care of the

mother which provides utility indirectly through infant health,
Z, includes the mother's health, smoking and drinking by the
mother, and the number of previous births, and p represents the

family specific (genetic and biological) infant health endowment,
known only to household members.                     Maximizing this utility
function subject to production and resource constraints generates
demand for the infant's survival probability as a function of

input prices, income,             productive         efficiency, environmentai
factors, and tastes.

     The mother's health H,,,         is determined by her consumption of

nutrients N, cigarette smoking S, alcohol drinking D, own-medical

care M, environmental quality Q (e.g. air pollution), mother's
age G, the health endowment of the mother                  n,,,,   and productive

                                        4
efficiency:

          Hm        h(N, 8, D, M, Q, 0, Pm)             (3)

 Substituting mothers health for Z, in the structural production
function of equation (2), we obtain a quasi-structural infant
survival production function:
               =   o(N,   S, D, M, Q, 0, jIm, jI)         (4)

The complement of t,            i—v,   is defined as the probability of
neonatal (or infant) mortality. Given the considerable evidence
obtained in previous research that low birth weight (2,500 grams
or less) is a major determinant of neonatal mortality (i.e.
Eisner, et. al 1979; Harris 1982; and the aforementioned group of
health economic studies), low birth weight can be included as a
determinant of infant survival. Since low birth weight is an
endogenous variable whose determinants are similar to those of
neonatal and         infant mortality,        the above quasi-structural
production function is obtained. The use of abortion services A
and prenatal care C, included in the medical care M received by
the mother, should be included in the birth weight function and,
hence, in the infant survival production function.4

       Mother's schooling is often used as a proxy variable for
both productive and allocative efficiency. Productive efficiency
implies that more educated individuals can produce a larger
output from quantities of inputs, while allocative efficiency
indicates that more educated individuals are better informed
about the true effects of the inputs and, hence, choose a better
input mix (Grossman and Joyce 1987).    In our study, mother's
schooling is treated as a determinant of the demand for health—
related inputs.
       The recursive models of others include neonatal mortality,
low birth weight, gestation, and risk of prematurity functions
(Corman, Joyce, and Grossman 1987, and Joyce 1987).     There are

                                        5
     The production function of the probability of neonata1 (or
infant) mortality to be estimated is:
            1—it =   ,t(N, S, D, A, C, X, Q, G, jim, ii)      (5)

where X is postnatal care. The health endowments of the mother
and infant are unobserved although some elements are captured by
the inclusion of the mother's nutrient intake. Furthermore, some
of the health—related behavioral inputs are likely to be causally
related to the unobserved endowments.           That is, given a poor
endowent, parents will seek more and better pre- and postnatal
care, will be more concerned with nutrient intake, and will
refrain from heavy smoking and drinking. Finally, a poor health
endowment of the fetus may induce parents to use abortion
services.      To circumvent the endogeneity problem, we first
estimate health—related behavioral input demand functions whose
determinants are orthogonal to the unobserved health endowments,
leading to our final, operational model of the production of
neonatal (or infant) mortality:



advantages and disadvantages to using a four equation system such
as these. The major advantage is that the system is built on
biological effects within a microeconomic framework, while the
primary disadvantage is that the specification of each function
becomes more arbitrary in order to satisfy the rank and order
conditions for identification.  Instead, we use a two equation
system comprised of production functions for neonatal (or infant)
mortality and for mother's health, implicitly assuming that
mother's health both directly and indirectly effects the health
of the infant. The indirect effects result from the impact of
mother's health on birth weight, gestation, and the risk of
prematurity. Our model of neonatal (or infant) mortality is
similar that of others with the exception of our treatment of
nutrient intake as an input into the production of the mother's
health, and, thus, the infant's health.

inputs as endogenous allows us to circumvent the problem of the
heterogeneity of the health endowment.

III. EMPIRICAL IMPLEMENTATION


     A. Regression Variables
     The variables used in our model are cross-sectional market
averages in 1980 and l98l.      Table 1 contains the definitions,

means, standard deviations, and sources of the variables used in

this study.   The probability of neonatal mortality (death of an
infant in the first 27 days of life) is defined by the ratio of
the observed number of neonatal deaths to the total number of
live births, while the probability of infant mortality (death of
an infant in the first 364 days of life) is defined by the ratio
of the observed number of infant deaths to the total number of
live births. Recently, in Japan, neonatal morta].ity accounts for
approximately two-thirds of all infant mortality, suggesting that
any attempt to explain the recent behavior of infant mortality
must focus on neonatal mortality and that infant health can be
improved by the identification of important determinants of
neonatal mortality.
     Sufficient nutrient intake is indispensable for both fetal
and maternal well-being.   Fetal growth will be retarded and the

risk of mortality or morbidity increased by deficiencies in the



       Japan is    administratively  divided   into forty—seven
prefectures of which forty-three carry the suffix ken and the
remaining four are known as to, do, or fu.    Each prefecture is
subdivided into shi (cities) and gun or shicho (rural country).
We employ data for urban areas, referred to as shi due to the
availability of data on household food consumption which allows
us to calculate nutrient intake, whose effects on infant health
are our primary concern.

mother's diet (King and Butterfield 1986). A number of nutrients
must be considered as inputs into the production of maternal and
infant health.     The inclusion of all nutrients is, however,
impractical, forcing us to choose           a tractable subset which
includes protein, calcium, iron, vitamin A, and vitamin C.

     Protein, obtained from dairy products, meats, and grains,
stimulates fetal and maternal tissue growth             and increases
maternal circulating    blood.7         A protein deficiency during
pregnancy decreases birth weight and causes toxemia. Excessive

protein consumption may induce         a premature birth and excessive

neonatal mortality. Calcium, present in dairy products and leafy
vegetables, is important for fetal skeletal growth and maternal
calcium metabolism. A calcium deficiency would lower the bone
densities of the mother and infant.              Iron, found in meats,
grains, and leafy vegetables, is needed for the manufacturing of
hemoglobin, which carries oxygen through the bloodstream, in both
fetal and maternal red blood cells.             Anemia, the principal
consequence of an iron deficiency, is associated with increased
incidences of spontaneous abortion, premature delivery, low birth
weight births, stillbirth, and perinatal death. Vitamins A and C
are essential for tissue growth. Vitamin A,        obtained from green

       The number of calories consumed is often included in
studies of nutrition demand in developing countries.         We choose
not to include cajories due to their high correlation with
protein consumption which we do include.

       The following arguments on the effects of nutrients on the
human body are taken from Worthington—Roberts and Vermeersch,
1985, and Williams, 1985.


                                  10
and yellow vegatables, is also important in bone growth, while
vitamin C,    found primarily in citrus and other fruits and
vegatables, stimulates iron absorption.            Impaired vision and
premature birth are two of the consequences of a vitamin A
deficiency, while renal anomalies and multiple malformations
result from excessive intake.              Massive intake of vitamin C
adversely influences fetal. metabolism, but a deficiency has not
be shown to affect the course or outcome of pregnancy.

     To quantify the above five nutrients we subgroup average
household food consumption into fourteen categories:              non-

glutinous rice, bread, noodles, cereal and other flours, fish and

shellfish, dried fish, meat, vegetables, fruits, pickles, eggs,
milk, powdered milk, and cheese. The annual per capita quantity
consumed of each food is obtained by dividing the average
household consumption by the average number of persons per
household. The annual per capita nutrient intakes are then
defined as weighted sums of per capita food consumption, where
the weights are the quantity of each nutrient in 100 grams of
each food.8
     Cigarette and alcohol consumption, whose adverse affects on
birth outcomes have been well documented, are also included as
health related behavioral inputs. Placental abnormalities are


       Formally, let F be the annual per capita quantity of food
i  consumed (in 100's of grams), and a1 be the quantity of
nutrient n in 100 grams of food i.   Then annual per capita
consumption of nutrient n is defined as:
              =   E   aF1 ,   1=1,2,. . ,14.
                                       .



The weights, a, are taken from Kagawa (1987).
                                  11
determined, in part, by both the number of years the mother has
smoked and her current smoking habits.     Women who smoke during
pregnancy give birth to smaller babies than nonsmokers (Wor-
thington-Roberts and Vermeersch 1985), while the consumption of
more than two alcoholic drinks per day increases the risk of
delivering a baby with physical and developmental abnormalities
(Brown 1983).
     We use the the levels of sulfur dioxide and particulates in
the air to control for environmental quality, allowing us to
compare the effects of these pollutants in Japan to those found
in the U.S. There is some evidence that air pollutants increase
Infant mortality rates by raising the percentage of low birth
weight births (Joyce, Grossman, and Goldman, forthcoming).
     As proxies for pre— and postnatal care, direct measures of
which are unavailable, we include the availability of general
hospital beds, abortion, and the delivery of an infant by a
midwife.   We expect a negative relationship between hospital bed
availability and neonatal and infant mortality arising from the
inverse relationship     between the availability of pre— and
postnatal care (assumed highly correlated with the availability
of beds) and their prices. The effect of abortion on mortality
is ambiguous.   If, through their use of amniocentisis or prenatal

checkups, more mothers decide to terminate their pregnancies,
there will be fewer high risk births, lowering mortality.
Alternatively, if abortion Is used in place of contraception or

to remedy contraceptive failure (frequent in Japan, as suggested

                                12
by Preston, 1986) or illegitimacy, a weak positive relationship
between abortion use and mortality would result, given the high
correlation observed between fertility and infant mortality.

     Finally, mother's age is included as a regressor due to the

high risk of light birth weight and neonataly mortality found
among teenage mothers (Geronimus 1987, and Corman, Joyce, and
Grossman 1987).



     B.    Estimation

     We assume that the probability of a neonatal death P is
given by the logistic function:

                  I +   exp-(a
                                 I
                                     +       E               ,   i=1,...,   m,   (8)


where X is a vector of right—hand--side variables, and a and f                         are
parameters. Solving for the logarithm of the ratio of the
probability of neonatal mortality to the probability of survival,
the following linear equation is obtained:
            ln [P/(1—P)] = a             +   E    131X1              (9)

The marginal effect of a one—unit change in X on the probability

of neonatal mortality is given by:

     Weighted regressions are fitted separately for neonatal and
infant mortality due to our expectations of differential impacts
of the health related behavioral inputs on morta1ity. For each
mortality function, we estimate a basic ordinary least squares

          The weight is defined as [BxPx(l—P)]'2, where B is the
total number of live births.

(OLS) model which includes cigarette smoking, alcohol consump-
tion, protein, calcium, vitamin A, hospital beds, sulfur dioxide,
and particulates. We also estimate an extended OLS model which
includes, in addition to the variables in the basic mode1, iron,
vitamin C, midwife deliveries, abortion services, and mother1s
age. We then reestimate the extended model using two-stage least
squares methods based on the assumption that an omitted variable,
the infant's health endowment, is correlated with the health
related behavioral inputs. Using Wu's T2 statistic (Wu 1973,
1974; Nakamura and Nakamura 1981) we then test the hypothesis of
a zero correlation between the OLS residuals and the health-
related inputs.        If a correlation exists between them, i.e. the
heterogeneity problem exists, then the os estimates will be
biased and inconsistent.

     One interest is to estimate the net effect of food prices on
infant health through their effect on the consumption of food
nutrients, requiring information on the own- and cross-price
elasticities of demand for the foods.               The elasticity of infant

health (neonatal mortality,               for example) with respect to the
price of food j   is       obtained as:
                       =    (l—P)                EN,pj , n=1, . . ,5
                                                                .       (11)

where the n are the         five    nutrients   in the infant health   produc-
tion functions and                        is   the elasticity of infant health

with respect to nutrient n.            EN,-,pj is a weighted average of the
price elasticities of demand for the foods which contain nutrient
n, and is defined as follows (Pitt 1983):

where 1=1,..., h are the h foods supplying nutrient n, and E11 is
the price e1asticity of demand for food I (F) with respect to
the price of food j.1° This estimation of the effects of various
food prices on infant health is important in designing public
policy to improve infant health. Of note here are the restric—
tive trade policies in place in Japan (particularly those on food
imports such as dairy products and meats) which lead to higher
prices for many commodities than would exist in a competitive
market. The more competitive market system which may result from
less restrictive trade policy in Japan may also improve the well-
being of other individuals in Japan.




     10 These food price elasticities are uncompensated.     To
estimate own— and cross—price elasticities of demand we used
seemingly unrelated equations procedure.     For computational
feasibility, we selected seven food categories: bread, fish and
shellfish, meat, milk, eggs, vegatables, and fruits. Each demand
equation contains the seven food prices and various household
characteristics (including income, head of household's age, size
of household, women's education, and the number of children). In
this procedure, identical regressors should not be used in each
of the equations, leading us to keep only those household
characteristics which were statistically significant in each
equation, while the seven prices are always kept. The results of
this procedure are available on request

IV. RESULTS


     Ordinary least squares (OLS) and two—stage least squares
(TSLS) estimates of the neonatal and infant mortality production
functions are reported in Table 2.        Selected nutrient price
elasticities and health price elasticities are contained in Table

3.   Equations (1) and (4) in Table 2 are the OLS estimates of the

basic neonatal      and infant    mortality production functions,
respectively, and include the variables on cigarette smoking,
alcohol consumption, nutrient consumption (protein, calcium, and
vitamin A), hospital beds, and air pollutant levels.    Equations
(2) and (5) are the respective extended OLS models which add two
additional nutrients (iron and vitamin C), medical care measures
(midwife deliveries and abortion services), and mother's age to
the basic models.    The estimates of these extended equations
obtained using two--stage least squares are reported in equations
(3) and (6) of Table 2.

     Cigarette and alcohol consumption are found to have strong
adverse effects on infant health as measured by the neonatal and

infant mortality rates. Similarly, higher levels of air pol-
lutants are found to result in higher neonatal and infant
mortality rates. With respect to the mother's nutrient intake,
calcium, iron, and vitamin C have the expected negative signs,
while the signs on protein and vitamin A are positive. Among the
medical inputs, the signs of the estimated coefficients on
midwife deliveries and hospital beds are as expected.

     Comparing the estimates obtained using two—stage least
squares with those obtained using ordinary least squares, one can

see that the coefficients obtained using TSLS are often substan-
tially larger than the corresponding OLS estimates. Also, the Wu
test rejects the null hypothesis of zero correlation between the
endogenous health inputs and the residuals at the one percent
significance level, suggesting, as Rosenzweig and Schultz (1983a,
page 42) conclude, that "parents do respond to differences in
their genetic and/or environmental health endowments."11         In

particular, women with poor unobserved health endowments are more

aware of hazardous health inputs (such as cigarette smoking and
alcohol consumption) during pregnancy than those with better
endowments, leading them to consume less of these inputs and,
hence, to, reduce the risk of a poor birth outcome.   In elasticity
terms, the effects of cigarette smoking on neonatal and infant
mortality range from 0.61 to 1.01 and from 0.57 to 0.97 respec--

tively.'2 The comparable elasticities for liquor consumption

     11 This result is consistent with the results of studies
using U.S. data, including those of Rosenzweig and Schultz (1982,
1983a, and 1983b); Corman, Joyce, and Grossman (1987); Joyce
(1987); Joyce, Grossman, and GoJdman (forthcoming).
     12 The estimated elasticities are obtained by multiplying
(l-P) by the estimated coefficients of the logit neonatal and
infant mortality production functions. (1-P) is equal to 0.9953
for the neonatal elasticities and is equal to 0.9929 for the
infant elasticities
     Our estimated elasticities using Japanese data are somewhat
larger than the estimates using U.S. data. For example, the
cigarettes elasticity of neonatal mortality for whites in the
U.S. i.s estimated to he in the range 0.41 to 0.51 (Corman, Joyce,
and Grossman 1987; Joyce 1987: and Joyce, Grossman, and Goldman
forthcoming)

                               18
fall in the range 0.87 to 1.05 for neonatal mortality and in the
range 0.88 to 0.98 for infant mortality.

     All of the coefficients on the nutrients, with the exception
of those on vitamin C, are statistically significant in the TSLS
regressions. An increase in the mother's consumption of calcium
and iron during pregnancy reduces the probabilities of neonatal
and infant mortality.      However, increases in the mother's
consumption of protein and vitamin A during pregnancy lead to
adverse effects on infant health.1-3
     Of particular interest in this research are the effects of
changes in food prices on neonatal and infant mortality, specifi-
cally those foods which are the main sources of the nutrients we

consider.    The price elasticities of selected nutrients and
health price elasticites for neonatal and infant mortality are
reported in Table 3,14

     A negative    nutrient price elasticity implies than an
uncompensated increase in the price of that food will result in a
decrease in the consumption of a particular nutrient. A row of
negative nutrient price elasticities suggests that an increase in
the price of that food will result in decreased consumption of

     13 While these results are somewhat surprising, there is
some evidence of the adverse effects of excessive consumption of
these nutrients    on infant    health (Worthington-Roberts and
Vermeersch 1985, pages 91-95 and 105).
    14 The nutrient price elasticities are calculated using
equation (12) and the results obtained from the seemingly
unrelated equations estimation procedure.    The health price
elasticities are obtained by applying equation (11) using the
estimates obtained from TSLS.

each of the nutrients. For example, an increase in the price of
milk leads to a        reduction in the consumption of all nutrients
and, consequently, increases the probability of neonatal and
infant mortality.       The values of the health price elasticity of
neonatal and infant mortality with respect to the price of milk
are 2.024 and 1.819, respectively. That is, a one percent rise
in the price of milk induces about a two percent rise in the
probabilities of neonatal and infant mortality. Alternatively,
an increase in the price of meat does not decrease the consump-
tion of all nutrients due to substitution effects among the
various foods. However, an increase in the price of meat also
increase the probabilities of neonatal and infant mortality, as
seen by their estimated health elasticities of 0.390 and 0.305,

respectively.       These results imply that a weakening of the
current strong restrictions on the importing of dairy products
and meat would result in an improvement in infant health.
       Among the medical care inputs, we find that a positive and
significant relationship exists between midwife deliveries and
both mortality rates, with the coefficients obtained in the TSLS
regressions about twice those obtained in the OLS regressions.
                                        20
These results indicate that women with poor unobserved health
endowments are likely to seek the care of medical doctors rather

than midwives and, consequently, they reduce their risk of
neonatal and infant mortality.

     Contrary to U.S. findings (for example, Corman and Grossman,

1985; Corman, Joyce, and Grossman, 1987; and Joyce, 1987), the
coefficient on the abortion variable is positive, albeit never

significant.       The persistent positive sign may indicate that
abortion is used in Japan in place of contraception or to remedy
contraceptive failure rather than to prevent high risk births, as

suggested by Preston (1986).
     The coefficient on the hospital bed variable, our proxy for
the availability of pre- and postnatal care, is consistently and
significantly negative in all equations, as expected. Greater
availability of these services reduces market prices for this
care, inducing women to initiate care earlier in their pregnancy
as well as after birth.        The hospital bed elasticity is in the

range from —0.58 to -0.67 for neonatal mortality, and varies from
—0.50 to —0.58 for infant mortality.
     Finally, we find a strong positive relationship between air
pollutant levels and both         neonatal and    infant mortality.
Although sulfur dioxide has the largest impact on birth outcomes
in the U.S. , we   find that particulates are more important in
Japan.   The particulates elasticity of neonatal mortality ranges
from 0.55 o 0.67, with the corresponding elasticity of infant
mortality in the range 0.62 to0.76.        The sulfur dioxide elas—

                                  21
ticities of neonatal and Infant mortality lie in the ranges 0.38
to 0.46 and 0.36 to 0.43, respectively.1 Thus, the impact of
particulates on infant health is about twice as large as that of

sulfur dioxide.




        These   elasticities    are   much   greater   than   the
corresponding elasticities found in the U.S. For example, .Joyce,
Grossman, and   Goldman (forthcoming) find a sulfur dioxide
elasticity of neonatal mortality for whites in the range from
0.02 to   0.08.     Moreover, they never find a significant
relationship between particulates and both the neonatal and
infant mortality rates, possibly due to collinearity between the
five pollutant measures they include in their neonatal mortality
production functions.

V. CONCLUSIONS


     The recent empirical health economic studies of U.S. infant
and neonatal mortality rates, as well as those of low birth
weight, have overlooked the importance of the mother's nutrition-
al status as a determinant of infant health.        These studies

emphasize medical care, smoking, drinking and residence location
as determinants of infant health. While using a theoretical and
methodological approach similar to these studies, our model
emphasizes the role of the mother's nutritional status in
determining neonatal and infant mortality rates.
     Using cross—sectional market averages for 1980 and 1981 in
Japan, we find that cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, and
environmental quality all have strongly adverse effects on
newborn survival outcomes in Japan, as in the U.S. Additionally,
we see that women who initiate care earlier in their pregnancy as
well as in the postnatal period reduce their risk of neonatal and

infant mortality.     Unlike in the U.S., we discover that the
availability of abortion increases, although never significantly,
neonatal and infant mortality rates, possibly due to its use in

place of contraception.   Finally, we note that the nutrient
intake of the mother during pregnancy is a potential determinant
of neonatal and infant mortality in Japan, with increased
consumption of calcium and iron leading to improved birth
outcomes. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that increased consump-
tion of protein and vitamin A lead to higher neonatal and infant

mortality rates. Using the results obtained from the estimation
of neonatal    and infant mortality production functions (in
addition to those obtained from the estimation of a system of
demand equations), we conclude that increases in the prices of
food items, in particular milk and meat, would lead to increases
in neonatal and infant mortality rates. This finding indicates
that less restrictive import measures in Japan, particularly on
dairy products and meats, would reduce neonatal and infant
mortality rates below their already relatively low levels.
