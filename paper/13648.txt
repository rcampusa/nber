                                               ABSTRACT

Using detailed data from North Carolina, we examine the frequency, incidence, and consequences
of teacher absences in public schools, as well as the impact of an absence disincentive policy. The
incidence of teacher absences is regressive: schools in the poorest quartile averaged almost one extra
sick day per teacher than schools in the highest income quartile, and schools with persistently high
rates of teacher absence were much more likely to serve low-income than high-income students. In
regression models incorporating teacher fixed effects, absences are associated with lower student achievement
in elementary grades. Finally, we present evidence that the demand for discretionary absences is price-elastic.
 Our estimates suggest that a policy intervention that simultaneously raised teacher base salaries and
broadened financial penalties for absences could both raise teachers' expected income and lower districts'
expected costs.

I. Introduction

        Whatever the importance of strong training, classroom experience, or advanced

pedagogical methods for the scholastic development of students, these factors can have scant

effect on a day a teacher is absent from school. Teacher absences are an endemic problem in

developing countries (Banerjee and Duflo 2006; Chaudhury et al. 2006). Baseline teacher

absence rates in the range of 20 to 44 percent have been reported in studies of policy

interventions in Kenya and India (Glewwe, Ilias and Kremer 2003; Duflo and Hanna 2005).

Interventions designed to reduce teacher absence, or improve teacher performance generally,

have met with mixed success in these settings (Banerjee and Duflo 2006).

         The rate of teacher absence in the United States is much smaller than in these developing

countries. Previous studies suggest absence rates for teachers in the U.S. on the order of 5%, or

about 9 days per 180-day working year.1 Perhaps for this reason, there exists surprisingly little

research on teacher absences in the United States. Compared to workers in other occupations,

however, American school teachers appear to have relatively high rates of absence. By

comparison, ostensibly similar rates of absenteeism due to sickness average less than 3% in the

        1
          Ehrenberg et al. (1991), who conducted a survey of 381 school districts in New York state in the mid-
1980s, found that teachers took an average of 8.9 days of leave a year. Podgursky (2003) cites a study of New York
City schools in 2000/01 showing an average of 11.3 days a year and a U.S. Department of Education survey
concluding that 5.2% of teachers were absent on any given day. Focusing only on sick leave, Bradley, Green and
Leeves (2005, Table 1) report rates for Queensland, Australia of about 3% and a similar rate based on another study
in the U.K.

                                                         2
U.S. workforce as a whole.2 This introduces the possibility that public education-specific

policies have contributed to the elevated absence rate, and that policies could be used to reduce

it.3 Potential social gains from reduced absenteeism include improved student discipline and

achievement, and reduced expenditures on substitute teachers.4 Previous literature provides

conflicting evidence on whether teacher absences are consequential for student achievement in

America, where certified substitute teachers are widespread (Ehrenberg et al. 1991; Miller,

Murnane and Willet 2006, 2007). Absenteeism may also have a regressive impact, in which case

interventions to reduce it could promote equity as well as efficiency.5

         This paper aims to address the questions of frequency, incidence, and effect, as well as

the potential impact of leave policy, using data on public schools in North Carolina. We show

that the pattern of absence-taking across schools in North Carolina has a disproportionate impact

on low-income students. Ranking schools by the fraction of students receiving free or



         2
           Measured as a percentage of hours missed due to illness, maternity or paternity leave, or child care or
other family ob ligations, the rates o f absence in 2 005 wer e 2.3% in the public se ctor and 1 .7% in the p rivate sector.
In two similar occupations, it was 2.4% in community and social services and 2.7% in healthcare support (U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2006, Table 47).

         3
           In addition to the generosity of leave policies, explanations given for the higher absenteeism of teachers
include the high rate of infectious illnesses carried by students, the stress of the job, and the expectation that teachers
will stay out of school to care for their own children. Such expectations and leave policies are consistent with the
notion that teaching as an occupation has traditionally been made to suit working mothers, with short work days and
summers off to accommodate the demands of child-rearing (Podgursky 2003).

         4
           One estimate of the cost of substitutes due to excessive teacher absences is on the order of 0.5% of total
per pupil expenditures (Roza 2007, p. 5).

         5
          One of the rare stories that did touch on teacher absences, published in the Chicago Tribune, illustrates
some of the issues lurking be neath the surfac e. Based on analysis of se veral years of d ata for the Ch icago Pu blic
Schools, the Tribune reported chronic ab senteeism co ncentrated among so me teache rs in a subset of the district’s
schools. In 22 elementary schools, most of which served poor and minority students, per teacher absences averaged
more than 20 days a year – a rate lower than that observed in developing countries, but quite substantial in a local
context. In these schools, substitutes attempted to do little teaching, and discipline deteriorated (Dell’Angela and
Little 2006).

                                                              3
reduced-price lunch, teachers in the lowest quartile average almost one extra sick day per school

year relative to teachers in the highest quartile. We also document that elementary students

perform worse on standardized tests when they are assigned to teachers who take more absences.

This relationship persists in models that incorporate teacher fixed effects. This finding

corroborates the work of Miller, Murnane and Willet (2006, 2007). The estimated magnitude of

the achievement effects is small, but aggregated across all students in a classroom they imply a

non-negligible impact of absences on aggregate achievement.

         Our study of the potential impact of leave policy on absences follows several existing

studies on the subject. Ehrenberg et al. (1991)’s detailed analysis of teacher contracts for a large

sample of New York school districts revealed that certain provisions were associated with higher

usage of leave.6 Currently some districts in the U.S. offer bonuses for teachers who take a

minimal number of absences; one district raffled off a new car among all teachers with perfect

attendance. At the school level, some schools distribute to teachers at the end of the year any

unused funds earmarked for substitute teachers.7 A randomized evaluation of a comparable

bonus program for teacher attendance in India found that the teacher absence rate was halved in

treatment schools (Duflo and Hana 2005). In addition, administrative rules covering teach



         6
          These provisions included larger than average numbers of leave days allowed overall, larger numbers of
days for bereavement leave, the presence of “sick leave banks,” whereby teachers may borrow leave days not used
by other teachers, and smaller numbers of contractually-specified professional leave. The authors also found that
policies specifying the “buyback” o f unused sick days – in cash or in the form of additional retirement benefits –
appeare d to influence the use of sick lea ve, with more generous b uyback rate s associated with fewer abse nces.

         7
          For examples of some current policies regarding teacher absences, see Tawnell D. Hobbs, “DISD Hopes
to Cut Daily Average of 678 Teachers Missing School,” Dallas Morning News, September 24, 2002; Pat Kossan,
“School Districts, Students Paying Price for Teacher Absences,” The Arizo na Rep ublic, January 27, 2006; and
Kristen A. Graham, “Teachers are Truant, Too, Reform Commission Says,” Philadelphia Inquirer, December 7,
2006.

reporting of absences have also been associated with differential rates of teacher absenteeism

(Imants and Van Zoelen 1995).8

        We evaluate the impact of a North Carolina policy that permits teachers to continue

taking sick days once they have exhausted their supply of “free” days, at the cost of $50 per day.

The dependence of available sick days on the duration of a teacher's employment history and the

number of sick days taken in prior years generates idiosyncratic variation in the point at which

teachers face a price increase. Our estimates, derived from a modified form of survival analysis,

indicate that the likelihood of taking an additional sick day, on the margin, is significantly lower

when the cost is $50 rather than zero. Back-of-the envelope calculations suggest that applying

the $50 penalty to all sick days starting with the first would reduce the average number of sick

days taken by slightly more than 1, or about 15%. Given the savings that would result from

cutting back on the use of substitute teachers, districts could raise base salaries sufficiently to

increase teachers' expected income while still realizing cost savings.

         The second section describes the data used in the present study and summarizes broad

patterns in them, the third analyzes correlates of absenteeism, the fourth focuses on the

distribution of teacher absence across schools, the fifth section examines the effect of teacher

absence on student achievement, and the sixth evaluates the impact of financial penalties on

absence-taking. The paper ends with a brief conclusion.

II. Data

         Our data on teacher absences were provided by the North Carolina Department of Public



        8
         For a number of references to studies of practices designed to reduce teacher absences, see also Miller,
Murnane and W illett (2007).

                                                         5
Instruction, the central state agency that collects uniform administrative data from all of the

state’s school districts.9 These administrative data cover the years 1994/95 to 2003/04, and we

were able to link them to other administrative records on teachers by means of identifying

numbers, encrypted so as to preserve confidentiality, supplied by the North Carolina Education

Research Data Center. For virtually all teachers, the data set gives the number of days absent, by

pay period and reason, and for most purposes we aggregate these data into annual totals for each

teacher by year.

         As is common in public school districts across the country, teachers in North Carolina are

permitted to take a limited number of days off from work for sickness without losing pay or

benefits, and these may include days when a child is sick or a doctor visit is scheduled. In

addition, teachers may take off days for other reasons, with full or partial pay, without losing

other employee benefits. Although the rules covering such absences are both copious and

complicated, it is worth highlighting a few that apply to the most important types of absences –

sick leave and vacation leave.

         Sick leave is credited to teachers in North Carolina at a flat rate of one day per month of

work. Significantly for our study of teacher absence, this sick leave can accumulate in a teacher’s

account indefinitely and without limit, potentially giving some experienced teachers the ability to

take very long spells of sick leave if necessary, without losing either their teaching position or

their employee benefits. But another provision means there are real costs to using this leave: at

the time of a teacher’s retirement, any unused sick leave is converted to additional service credit



         9
             Over the period covered by our data, the number of school districts in the state was reduced, through
consolida tion, from 11 9 to 117 . Throug hout, the con solidated d istrict definitions are used to classify d ata by district.

                                                               6
and thus higher pension benefits in the state’s defined-benefit system. A teacher who has

exhausted her store of sick leave can take as many as 20 additional days of extended sick leave,

but subject to a $50 reduction in salary per day.

         A second category of absence, which we label personal leave, covers voluntary absences

other than sick leave. A day of leave in this category entails a deduction in pay, either $50 or a

full day’s pay.10 A teacher who is absent due to illness but who has run out of accumulated sick

leave and extended sick leave would be forced to use a type of leave in this category.

         The third category is vacation (or annual) leave. Unlike sick leave and personal leave,

which are by their nature usually unexpected and often disruptive to classroom instruction,

vacation leave by design typically entails little disruption of classroom routines. Most days taken

in this category are in fact mandated to coincide with school vacation days, and teachers are not

allowed to take other days off as vacation days without a principal’s permission. During their

first two years of service, teachers are credited with exactly the number of days of vacation leave

during the school year that they earn (10), thus leaving no additional days to use. After those first

two years, teachers earn more than this minimum, at rates that rise with experience.11 Combined

with the ability to accumulate sick leave indefinitely, this rising rate for vacation leave means

being absent from school is generally easier for teachers as they gain more years of experience.

Consequently, as we show below, average absence rates due to sickness and vacation tend to rise



         10
          One form of what we generically label here as personal leave has the official name of personal leave,
which accumulates at a rate of 0.2 days per month of work. This form is subject to the $50 reduction in salary per
day.

         11
            The rate o f accumulatio n for vacatio n leave rises fro m 1.15 to 2.15 pe r month, the to p rate app lying to
teachers with 20 or more years of experience. A maximum of 30 days of vacation leave may be carried forward from
one year to th e next, with the ex cess conve rted to sick lea ve.

                                                            7
with experience. The only significant remaining category of leave is administratively mandated

leave, usually for training and rarely held at a time that conflicts with classroom instruction.

         Table 1 summarizes by category the main categories of leave taken by North Carolina

teachers between 1994/95 and 2003/04. For the period, sick leave averaged 7.1 days per teacher,

for a rate of about 3.9% based on a 180-day school year. Adding in personal leave, which

averaged about 0.9 over the period, yields a slightly higher average rate of roughly 4.4%, a rate

that is in the same ball park as the 5% suggested in the few previous studies of teacher

absences.12 Because they are usually unplanned-for, absences in the sick leave and personal leave

categories are of paramount significance for the functioning of schools, and it is for this reason

that we focus on them in the analysis in succeeding sections of the paper.

         Under annual vacation leave, Table 1 reveals a fairly steady decline, from about 13 to

about 10 over the period. Based on our conversations with school administrators, we believe this

decline is largely an artifact of differing and changing administrative practices. Since the first 10

days of vacation leave correspond to mandatory school holidays, the amount charged to a full-

time teacher should never be less than 10, and indeed for most districts the average number of

vacation leave days is well above 10. But for reasons not entirely clear to administrators in the

affected districts or in the state education department, the reported numbers for some districts are

much lower, in some cases covering only the excess vacation days above 10.13 For this reason,


         12
              See footnote 3 above.

         13
            Conversa tions with payro ll and finance p ersonnel in a n umber o f districts and in the D epartmen t of Public
Instruction uncovered various explanations for large jumps in reported vacation leave, including the adoption of new
software, relate d change s in record-k eeping, includ ing keeping parallel reco rds over a p eriod, lead ing to duplica te
leave records, an agreement to compensate teachers with annual vacation leave in return for working at school
athletic events, an d the practic e in a few districts o f recording only days of an nual leave ab ove the 10 mandated days.
These practices all appeared to be consistent with state policy, although they resulted in reported numbers of annual

                                                             8
our statistical analysis involving vacation leave in succeeding sections examines variations only

among teachers within the same district in the same year, thus allowing for practices in this

regard to differ across districts as well as to change over time within each district. The last

category of leave shown in the table, administrative leave, shows little variation over time,

although it does differ across districts.14

         As described above, the rules for accumulating leave explicitly favor more experienced

teachers. Not only can teachers carry forward some vacation leave and all sick leave, the rate at

which teachers earn vacation leave increases with experience. The actual usage of leave reflects

these factors, as illustrated by the distribution of leave by experience level, shown in Figure 1 for

the 2000/01 school year. Novice teachers have the lowest average usage of sick leave, at 4.8 days

a year, compared to over 8 days a year for teachers with 5 to 10 years of experience. Vacation

leave also tends to rise with experience, at least up to the last experience group. Excepting the

most experienced teachers, both personal leave and administrative leave are essentially constant

across the experience groups. To summarize, the most prominent regularity with respect to

experience is the markedly lower rate of sick leave for inexperienced teachers.

         At the individual level, absence rates differ widely across the teacher work force, and they




vacation leave days apparently inconsistent with state policy. Nonetheless, the extent to which otherwise similar
districts differed in their average annual leave amounts co uld not be fully e xplained b y any official.

         14
            For a detailed list of all leave categories and their frequency in one year, see Appendix Table A1.
         Although the data available to us are very rich, we had to make a few adjustments to deal with several
imperfectio ns in the adm inistrative recor ds. First, recor ds of absen ces for som e teachers in so me years we re missing.
We drop these teacher-year observations. For the years 1994/95 to 2000/01, these observations accounted for fewer
than 1.5% of the total, but the percentage of missing teachers rises to 3.4%, 10.1%, and 10.9% in the years 2001/02
to 2003/04. Second, we dropped the few observations with negative days of total leave or sick plus personal leave
(most likely reflecting adjustments to a previous year’s record) and those showing more than 150 days. Because they
affected such small numbers o f teachers, none of these adjustmen ts made any apprec iable difference in results.

                                                             9
differ as well across schools and districts. To give an indication of their variation at the

individual level, Figures 2 and 3 present histograms for days of absence per year for North

Carolina public school teachers over the years 1994/95 to 2003/04. Figure 2, which shows the

distribution of absences for sick plus personal leave, reveals that the modal number of days of

sick plus personal leave over the period was zero. The median was 6, and the mean was 8. A very

small number of teachers accounted for a disproportionate share of the total days taken: the 10%

of teachers showing the most days of sick plus personal leave accounted for a third of all teacher-

year observations.

       The frequency distribution for vacation leave, shown in Figure 3, reveals two peaks, one

at 6 days and the other at 10, a result of the apparent anomaly in the reporting or recording of

annual leave noted in the previous section. The higher peak reflects the standard practice

whereby all teachers are automatically charged with the 10 days per year corresponding to school

holidays, with any excess discretionary annual leave days added on top. The lower peak reflects

the sizable number of districts which, at least in some years, averaged significantly fewer than the

standard 10 days per teacher.

       Absence rates varied markedly across schools and, to a lesser extent, across school

districts. Figure 4 illustrates the variation across districts by showing the average sick plus

personal absences, ranked from lowest to highest in the state. Whereas 15 districts had fewer than

8 absences per teacher, seven districts at the top had more than 11 per teacher. It is worth noting

that such rankings by district tend to be fairly stable over time. To illustrate, Figure 5 shows the

scatter plot of average absence rates by district in school years three years apart. The high inter-

temporal correlation suggested by the figure is also indicated by a correlation coefficient of


                                                  10
.653.15 Needless to say, such high-absence districts, as well as problematic schools within

districts, should be a source of real concern if teacher absence harms student achievement.

III. Which Teachers are Absent Most Often?

         To understand what kinds of teachers tend to be absent most often, we estimated OLS

regressions with absences of different types as the dependent variable. We pooled records over

the seven school years from 1994/95 to 2003/04. Including all classroom teachers working at

least 10 months yields a sample of more than 492,000 observations. Covariates used as

explanatory variables include the teacher’s gender, race, age, and years of experience,

information on the teacher’s education and teacher credentials, and information on the teacher’s

school and district. Because of the strong indication, noted above, that the conventions for

recording vacation leave were not constant across districts or over time, regressions that included

such leave were estimated with district-by-year fixed effects. For the sake of comparison,

regressions for sick plus personal leave were estimated with and without these fixed effects, the

resulting estimates being very close to each other.

         Table 2 presents a subset of the estimated coefficients for these regressions. Estimates in

column 2.1 are taken from the regression for sick plus personal leave that includes year indicators

as well as variables describing district, school, and individual characteristics.16 In contrast, the

remaining equations in the table, because they employ district fixed effects, omit unchanging

district measures as well as year indicators. With respect to demographic characteristics, equation



         15
              These high absenc e districts are small and are located in the co astal plain and the far western mountains.

         16
            The full set of estimated coefficients corresponding to equation 2.1 is given in Appendix Table A3, and
descriptive statistics for the variables used are in Appendix Table A2.

                                                             11
2.1 shows that female teachers, like female workers in the workforce at large, are absent more

often than men. This difference is reflected not only in the dichotomous indicator for males,

which reveals a difference of less than one day, but also in the statistical age-gender probability

of giving birth in the year, derived from national data on birth rates. Together, these two

variables imply a male-female difference of 3.9 sick plus personal days for two teachers aged 22,

but a difference of only one day for two 42 year-olds.17 The quadratic age coefficients imply that

absences tended to rise at a diminishing rate (to age 57). Black and other nonwhite teachers took

slightly less sick and personal leave than white teachers.

         The experience indicators reveal a pattern that reflects the limited amount of sick and

personal leave that new teachers can accumulate. In their second year, teachers took an average

of 1.8 more days than they did in their first. This gap increased to 2.8 in their third and fourth

years and then to more than three days after four years of experience. Inexperienced teachers

therefore had considerably fewer absences due to illness and other personal reasons than those

with at least several years’ experience. As we note below, inexperienced teachers also took less

vacation leave. Teachers who graduated from a college in a bordering state had slightly more

absences than other teachers, which might reflect occasional trips home. Fewer days were taken

by teachers with high test scores, with master’s degrees, who had National Board certification, or

who had graduated from a very competitive college. Teachers in schools with higher percentages

based o n her age alo ne. The so urce was ac tual births per 1 ,000 wo men in 20 00: Statistical Abstract of the United
States, 2004-05 (Table 85, p. 6 8). This probab ility rises from .0597 for women und er 20, to .0918 fo r women at least
20 but under 25, to .1079 for women 25-30, and falls thereafter to .0109 for women at least 40 but under 45.Ichino
and Moretti (2006, Table 1, p. 37) report that, overall, female workers in the U.S. average about three more days of
illness-related absences than males, with a smaller difference for unmarried and childless workers. Although our
maternity risk var iable is based on the pro bability of giving b irth, the study by Ich ino and M oretti suggests tha t it
could also be picking up the effects of another biologically-based gender difference, namely the menstrual cycle.

of free lunch recipients tended to have higher absence rates, and the same is true for the district

free lunch percentage, but none of the estimated effects is very large on its own. For example,

the coefficient for proportion eligible for free lunch in middle and high schools imply that

increasing a school’s free lunch share from the 25th to the 75th percentile would increase average

absences for all the school’s teachers of only about a quarter of a day per year. The effect for

elementary schools is smaller.18 The district free lunch percentage has almost no effect on

absences. As for proportion nonwhite, the school’s proportion is positively associated with

absences while the district’s is negatively correlated. Although these estimates seem to give little

reason for concern that low-income or minority students are experiencing very elevated rates of

teacher absence, it will be important to examine the actual incidence of high absence rates, as we

do in the next section.

       The table’s remaining three regressions employ district-by-year fixed effects – which

mean that all coefficients reflect only differences within districts in a given year. Equation 2.2,

which is directly comparable to equation 2.1, produces very similar estimated coefficients. This

similarity suggests that unaccounted-for differences across districts or over time are not

important in explaining variation in sick plus personal days. Equation 2.3, which examines

annual vacation leave, reveals several contrasts with the comparable equation for sick plus

personal leave. Most striking is the disappearance of the maternity risk relationship, a sensible

finding in light of the high likelihood that the reasons why young women might take sick or

personal leave are quite unrelated to the timing of school vacations. A second difference is a

reduction in the experience gradient. Teachers with 2-3 years experience take 1.5 vacation days


       18
            For the 25th and 75th percentiles at each level, see Table 3, note.

                                                           13
more than novice teachers, compared to 2.8 more sick plus personal days. Because vacation leave

accumulates at a rising rate, more is used in later years, until after 30 years, when it is

presumably being saved to augment retirement benefits. In addition, in contrast to equation 2.2,

North Carolina college graduates take an extra half day of vacation, National Board certified

teachers take an extra three quarters of a day, and the effects of free lunch and racial composition

virtually disappear.

         In order to arrive at a comprehensive measure of absences most likely associated with

lost teaching time we summed all absences not associated with administrative reasons, shown in

equation 2.4. By and large, the coefficients in this model reflect the patterns seen in equation 2.2,

except for steeper age and experience gradients and the extra half day for in-state college

graduates.

IV. Distributional Aspects of Teacher Absence

         Do teacher absences occur more frequently in schools serving low-income or minority

students? If so, absences would join the list of unfavorable school characteristics that

disproportionately affect disadvantaged students, such as having inexperienced teachers.19

Our data from North Carolina indicate that teacher absences do indeed have this kind of

distributional impact. As shown in equations 2.2 and 2.4 in Table 2, otherwise similar teachers

have slightly higher rates of absence when they teach in schools and districts where higher

percentages of students are eligible to receive free lunches; equation 2.1 implies district-level

differences as well, but with racial composition going in the opposite direction. But it is not



         19
            For empirical studies of distributional patterns of school resources, see Betts, Rueben and Danenberg
(2000 ) and Clo tfelter, Ladd a nd Vigd or (200 5).

                                                         14
obvious that these regression results necessarily imply higher absence rates for low-income

schools, because the regressions also indicate lower absence rates for inexperienced teachers,

whom we know from previous work to be more numerous in these same kinds of schools and

districts (Clotfelter, Ladd and Vigdor 2005 and Clotfelter, Ladd, Vigdor and Wheeler

forthcoming). To understand the full distributional impact, therefore, one needs to compare

actual rates of incidence by income level.

       Table 3 presents tabulations showing for one year the average number of absences taken

by teachers in schools falling into each quartile of schools defined by free lunch percentage. To

allow for the differences in take-up of free lunch by school level, the averages are shown

separately for each school level. For each level, the average number of teacher sick days is

highest in the bottom income quartile and lowest in the most affluent quartile. The differences

between top and bottom quartiles in mean sick days is on the order of one day per teacher or less.

Likewise, personal leave tends to be highest in low-income schools, but the differences across

the income spectrum are not large. In contrast, annual vacation leave tends to rise with income

quartile (recall, however, that reporting conventions differ across districts). Because more

affluent schools tend to have more experienced teachers, and those teachers have more access to

annual leave days, this result is not surprising. In any case, one would expect that days of annual

leave do not carry with them the same potential for lost instruction time that sick days do, since

these absences require a principal’s approval and are thus most often taken during teacher work

days rather than on school days.

       If teacher absences are harmful to learning, they are apt to be especially damaging if they

are school-wide and occur year after year. Indeed, persistently high absenteeism appears to be


                                                15
one hallmark of troubled schools.20 For this reason, we sought to find out if some schools in our

sample tend to experience consistently high rates of absence and, if so, whether those schools

serve low-income students. We looked at schools that had been, in at least five of the ten years

covered by our data, in the highest quartile of average sick plus personal days. Out of 2,094

schools that were in our data for at least five years, 559 qualified by this criterion. Table 4 shows

the prevalence of high-absence schools by schools’ income quartile over this period. Each cell in

the table gives the percentage of schools, by income level, that fell into the highest absence

quartile.21 The table shows, first of all, that elementary schools are more likely to fall into the

high-absence category than middle schools, and that high schools are least prone among all

levels. This difference reflects in part the higher average rates of sick leave in elementary

schools, as shown also in Table 3, but it could also be a reflection of the smaller size of

elementary schools, and thus their tendency for wider swings in average absence rates from year

to year. Within each level, however, the pattern is quite clear, with high-absence schools being

much more prevalent among those with low-income students than those serving student

populations with higher average family incomes. For example, whereas a quarter of middle

schools fell into the persistently-high absence category, fewer than one in 12 middle schools

serving the most affluent quarter of students had such consistently high rates of absence. In sum,

low-income students in North Carolina face an appreciably higher chance than affluent ones of

attending a school with persistently high rates of teacher absence.

V. Absences and Student Achievement

        Common sense suggests that teacher absences will impede students’ academic progress.

To see if the data are consistent with this reasoning, we estimated variations of a standard value-

added model of the form:

        Ait = a Ait-1 + b Absit + c Xit + uit ,                                  (1)

where Ait is student i’s achievement test score in year t (normalized with mean zero and unit

standard deviation), Absit is the number of sick plus personal days taken by student i’s teacher in

year t, Xit is a vector of student, school, and teacher characteristics, uit is an error term, and a, b

and c are estimated coefficients or vectors of coefficients. In this model, the coefficient on

number of sick plus personal days taken by a student’s teacher, b, measures the average

difference in achievement associated with those absences, net of any teaching done by substitute

teachers.

        We used ordinary least squares to obtain the initial estimates reported in Model A of

Table 5. The richness of the available administrative data made it possible for us to match most

North Carolina students in grades 4 and 5 to the classroom teachers who taught them math and

English. This matching enabled us to compare the academic achievement of students whose

teachers differed in the number of sick days taken, holding constant a long list of other student,

teacher, and school characteristics, as well as the student’s previous achievement score. As

shown in the table, for math achievement, the coefficient for the absence variable is -0.0023 (s.e.

= 0.0001). This finding implies that having a teacher with ten additional sick days in a year

would be associated with a reduced math test score of about 2.3% of a standard deviation.22 By


        22
             The complete set of estimates is given in Appendix Table A2.

                                                         17
comparison, this effect is slightly larger than that of changing schools and about half the size of

the effect of being eligible for the subsidized lunch program. For reading, the coefficient is less

than half as large, implying that the same 10-day increase in sick days would be associated with a

lower test score of about 1% of a standard deviation.

       The coefficients that emerge from this simple ordinary least squares model, however, are

likely to be biased. One possibility is that teacher absences may be correlated with unmeasured

aspects of teacher ability or effort, which would cause omitted variables bias in the coefficient of

absences. In this case, the absence variable would reflect the combined effects of otherwise

unmeasured characteristics of teachers correlated with high absence rates and the effect of the

absences themselves. A second possibility that would threaten the validity of OLS is if absences

are influenced by students’ performance, thus subjecting OLS to simultaneity bias.

       To account for the possibility of bias due to omitted variables correlated with absences,

we followed the approach of Miller, Murnane and Willett (2006) by estimating an alternate

specification using teacher fixed effects. Such an approach depends entirely on variation over

time in a teacher’s absences to estimate the relationship between absences and student

achievement. Additive time-invariant teacher characteristics, which could include unmeasured

ability or effort, are swept away and thus cannot lead to omitted variables bias. These equations

with teacher fixed effects yielded somewhat smaller, though statistically significant, coefficients.

These fixed effects models imply that 10 additional days of teacher absence would be associated

with a decline of 1.7% of a standard deviation in math achievement and 0.9% s.d. in reading. 23

These magnitudes are less than that obtained by Miller, Murnane and Willett (2007) for math, of


       23
            Ten days is approximately one standard deviation in the absence measure.

                                                        18
3.3%, but of the same order of magnitude. By way of comparison, our basic fixed effect

achievement regression implies that having a teacher with 1-2 years experience is associated with

higher achievement of 7.7% s.d. in math and 4.6% in reading. 24

         The endogeneity problem is more difficult to address. In the absence of a good

instrumental variable to deal with this problem, we adopted one additional strategy in an effort to

pin down the causal effect of teacher absences on student achievement. If teacher absences

depress student learning, we reasoned, some absences might cause more damage than others. In

particular, teacher absences that occur early in the year would probably be less harmful than

those occurring in the second half, in the run-up to the annual testing period near the end of

school. Another possibility we considered is that absences that were covered by a certified

substitute might be less harmful than those covered by an uncertified substitute.

         We therefore estimated two variants of the achievement model described above. The first

variant divided teacher absences according to the month they occurred – July to December and

January to June. As shown in Table 5, Model B, the estimated coefficients of teacher absence

differ significantly between the first and second semesters, with the second semester effects

being about three times as large as the first semester effect in math. Although the imposition of

teacher fixed effects reduces most of the estimated coefficients, those for the two semesters

remain statistically different from each other. These results are strongly suggestive of a causal

link between teacher absence and student achievement in elementary grades.



         24
            All of the estima tes presented in the text and tab les are based on specifica tions in which nu mber of d ays
of sick plus personal days of absence enter linearly. We explored other functional forms, including quadratic, square
root, and discrete indicators for ranges of absences, but the implied effects were very close to those due to the linear
specification.

                                                           19
         By contrast, we found much smaller differences between the effects of absences when

absences are divided by the type of substitute, as shown in Model C. Although, as expected,

absences covered by an uncertified substitute were associated with larger declines in achievement

than those covered by certified substitutes, the differences are statistically significant in only one

of the two fixed effects equations.25

         If absences do indeed depress student achievement, it is natural to worry about whether

this effect might be more severe among certain, more vulnerable students. Indeed, Miller,

Murnane and Willet (2007) suggest that such a difference in impact might explain the contrast in

magnitudes between their estimates and ours. We therefore estimated a series of equations of the

basic form of Model A, adding, seriatim, interaction terms that would indicate a differential

influence. These variants are shown in Table 6. The fixed effects models show that the

deleterious effect of teacher absences is greater among students: who are in rural districts; who

are non-black nonwhites, compared to whites (for math only); who are eligible for the free lunch

program (math only, at the 10% level only); and who scored below average in the previous year.

Students whose parents did not graduate from high school or who were taught by a teacher with

two or fewer years of experience showed no statistically significant difference in effect of

absences, except for the anomalous result that those taught by inexperienced teachers actually

gained a small amount in math from additional teacher absences. Among these differential

effects, the largest was for low-achieving students. In the fixed effect equation for math, 10 days


         25
            As an additional check on the validity of our estimates, we sought to verify that our results were not being
driven by a c ompara tively small numb er of high-abs ence teach ers. Thus w e re-estimated the basic M odel A
regressions, o mitting teacher s with more tha n 50 abse nces in a year. T he resulting estim ated coefficie nts actually
showed a somewhat larger effect for absences in math (-.0018 vs. -0.0017 for the full sample, with fixed effects) but
no difference in reading.

                                                           20
of teacher absence would be associated with a drop of 3.3% of a standard deviation in score,

compared to only 0.3% s.d. for above-average achievers.26

         We believe that the teacher fixed effect model goes a long way in dealing with concerns

that teacher absences are endogenous. To be sure, our method is valid so long as there are no

time-varying determinants of teacher absence that correlate with unobserved determinants of

student achievement, which would be true in what we see as the likely case that year-to-year

variation in a teacher’s absences are driven by exogenous health effects rather than the teacher’s

response to that year’s class of students. Taken at face value, the estimated coefficients from our

fixed-effect model (Model A in Table 5) imply that the achievement level for a student in grades

4-5 will fall .0017 of a standard deviation in math and .0009 in reading for each day his or her

teacher is absent in the year. To put these effects in context, they imply, for example, that 10

additional days of absence would be associated with declines in achievement equal to about one-

fifth the advantage of having a teacher with 1-2 years experience, compared to having a novice

teacher.27

VI. Can Absences be Reduced through Incentives?

         Teacher absences are socially costly. Suppose we accept as valid the estimates from the

teacher fixed effect models above . There are two ways to translate these test scores into social

costs. One would be to rely on estimates of the relationship between test scores and lifetime

earnings, or some other long range outcome. A simpler method would be to consider estimates


         26
              It is worth noting tha t we found no statistically significant differe nce in coefficie nts by student ge nder.

         27
           For math, 10 days of absence implies a reduction of .017 s.d., which is 23% of the .0736 s.d. difference
associated with having a teacher with 1-2 years experience. For reading, the comparable calculation is .009/.0467, or
19%.

                                                               21
of the cost of offsetting these test score declines, based on existing interventions.28 Two recent

analyses, of the Tennessee STAR experiment and of a teacher retention bonus program in North

Carolina, suggest that the cost of increasing one student's test score in one subject by 1% of a

standard deviation is in the range of $36 to $39 in current dollars.29 Assuming a class size of 25

students, and that each teacher teaches both math and reading, the achievement costs of a single

absence are on the order of $250.30 Beyond these very rough calculations of the instructional

costs of a teacher absence, school districts also face the cost of paying a daily wage rate to a

substitute teacher, which could amount to as much as $90.31 The existence of both of these types

of costs suggests that a policy of unlimited free absences for teachers would be socially

inefficient.

         From a policy perspective, it would be useful to know how teachers respond to policies

that impose some cost on the decision to take an absence. The structure of teacher absence

policy in North Carolina provides us with an opportunity to address this question. As reviewed

above, teachers can take up to 10 sick days per year without penalty, with unused sick days being



         28
            This approach is reasonable under the presumption that interventions can be scaled upwards or
downwards at constant average cost to deliver a precise dose of test score improvement. Given the potential for
non-linear dose response in most interventions, this assumption is clearly questionable. Our goal here is to provide a
ballpark estimate of the instructional costs associated with the typical teacher absence, not to propose that any
particular intervention be applied to students of an absent teacher.

         29
            See Krueger (1 999) and C lotfelter, Glennie, Ladd and V igdor (forthcoming), with details of these
calculations in the latter. Using less conservative assumptions, the former study suggests an even larger cost estimate,
on the order of $100.


         30
              (math coefficient + reading coefficient)*25 students/class*$36 .

         31
            In the 2006/07 school year, the Wake County Public School System, the state's second largest at the time,
paid a daily wage of $84 to certified substitute teachers. Adding the 7.65% employer's share of payroll taxes for
social security and Medicare brings the cost to $90.

                                                            22
carried over into subsequent school years. Whenever the supply of “free” sick days is exhausted,

teachers may take up to 20 additional sick days, at a cost of $50 per day. Appendix Table A2

indicates that about 15,000 of these extended sick days were taken in the 2000/01 school year. In

that same year, teachers took over 535,000 “free” sick days.

         In any school year, a teacher's supply of free sick days will depend on her experience

level and on the number of sick days taken in prior years. Thus the impact of the $50 charge for

extended sick days can be identified by comparing teachers who have taken a comparable

number of sick days in a given year, exploiting the fact that some teachers will exhaust their

supply of free days earlier than others.

         To analyze the impact of the $50 charge on teacher absences, we estimated a Cox

proportional hazard model, analyzing a teacher's decision to take sick day t conditional on having

already taken t-1 sick days in a given school year. Our estimated model takes the form:



         logit[8(tijs)] = " + $1 Xij + $2 Xjs + $3 Ctij                           (2)

where i indexes teachers, j indexes school years, and s indexes schools. The term 8(tijs)

represents the conditional probability that t is the last sick day taken by a teacher in a given year,

conditional on the fact that sick days 1 through t-1 were not the last. The specification controls

for a vector of teacher characteristics, Xij, and school characteristics Xjs. The independent

variable of interest is the cost of sick day t for teacher i in year j, Ctij.32 The impact of the cost

         32
            Ideally, we would prefer to estimate a model that used the cost of sick day t+1 as the independent
variable of interest. Unfortunately, we lack reliable data on the size of each teacher's bank of available free sick
days. When we attempted to impute this information, using the subsample teachers with complete histories of
employment and sick days taken, we were unable to accurately forecast which teachers would be required to take
extended sick days in a given year. There are a number of conceivable reasons for these forecast errors. Teachers
actually accrue sick days at the rate of one per month, rather than ten per year, however our database is not

                                                          23
parameter on the dependent variable is identified by comparing teacher/year observations with

identical values of t, but different values of Ctij. For example, an inexperienced teacher might

start paying the penalty on the 12th sick day, while more experienced teachers with a greater

supply of banked sick leave would not face the penalty until many more days had been taken.

         Table 7 presents the results of estimating equation (2) with data on 341,420 teacher/year

observations between 1995 and 2005. The number of absences taken by these teachers over the

time period was more than 2.6 million. The table entries are hazard ratios, which carry a

different interpretation than typical regression coefficients. An independent variable associated

with a hazard ratio greater than one is a factor that makes it more likely that a teacher will stop

taking absences after absence t, while variables associated with hazard ratios less than one make

it less likely that a teacher will stop taking absences.

         The variable of interest, the cost in dollars of taking absence t, has a hazard ratio of 1.003,

which is significantly greater than one. To determine the impact of a $50 cost, this ratio needs to

be raised to the 50th power. These results thus indicate that associating a $50 penalty with sick

day t increases the likelihood that no further sick days will be taken by the affected teacher in the

given year by 16%, compared to a situation in which there were no cost to the teacher of taking

an additional sick day.

         To evaluate the magnitude of this impact, suppose that the same effect would result from

applying the $50 penalty to all sick days including the first. Suppose further that teachers take an


sufficiently detailed to allow us to observe the mon th in which a sick day was taken in all cases. Teac hers also
occasion ally have op tions to “bor row” sick d ays from othe r teachers, a p ractice that ma y not be fully do cumented in
our data. Our use of the cost of sick day t in place of the cost of sick day t+1 implies that we have some degree of
errors-in-varia bles bias, whic h should lea d us to unde rstate the impa ct of moneta ry incentives on absence ta king.
When we attempted to use our estimates of the cost of sick day t+1 instead, we obtained coefficients even more
attenuated than the ones presented here.

                                                            24
average of seven sick days per year, and that probability of taking sick day t, conditional on

taking t-1, is a constant value. Simple arithmetic shows that this constant value is approximately

equal to 0.875.33 The likelihood of sick day t being the last, conditional on taking sick day t, is

thus 0.125. Increasing this value by 16%, to 0.145, would reduce the mean number of absences

taken to 5.9.

         The average teacher would be charged about $300 for absences in each school year. This

sum could be offset by increasing base salaries. Districts could increase salaries still further by

applying cost savings associated with the 1.1 averted absences per year. A revenue-neutral

policy change , incorporating $100 in savings associated with averted payments to substitute

teachers, would thus increase teacher salaries by roughly $400 per year, in exchange for teachers

accepting a $50 charge for each sick day taken.34 Districts willing to compensate teachers for

averted educational costs could push the base salary increase still higher.35

         The remaining teacher and school-level covariates in the hazard model each display

relationships with the decision to stop taking absences that are fully consistent with the

coefficients in Table 2, a correspondence that increases our confidence that the hazard model has




         33
             Under the stated assumptions, referring to the conditional probability as p, the expected number of sick
days taken is p + p 2 + ... + p T , where T is the length of the sc hool year. If we replace this ex pression with an infinite
series 3 p i, the expected value can b e expressed as p/(1-p). The term p/(1-p) is equal to 7 when p=7/8. The impact
of extending the expecte d value to an infinite series is negligib le; if p=7/8 the n only one in 2 7.5 billion tea chers will
be expected to take as many as 180 sick da ys.

         34
             Politically, this policy would be easier to implement if advertised as a $400 bonus for perfect attendance,
reduced by $50 each day, with penalties accruing to teachers who took more than 8 sick days in a given year. Note,
however, th at risk-averse tea chers might re ject a policy tha t introduced the possibility of sa lary reductio ns even if
their expec ted comp ensation incre ased.

         35
            Recall also that our estimate of the impact of the $50 penalty likely suffers from attenuation bias. Thus
the net savings in terms of absences averted would likely be higher than this estimate.

identified a true deterrent effect associated with the $50 penalty.

VII. Conclusion

       Teacher absences are important for four main reasons. First, hiring substitute teachers not

only costs money, but it also consumes valuable administrative resources, often in the mundane

form of early morning phone calls by principals or assistant principals. In North Carolina, sick

and personal leave represent slightly more than 4% of the standard 180-day school year, a rate

typical in American public schools, though quite small in comparison with rates observed in

other contexts. Although absence rates in teaching tend to be higher than ostensibly comparable

figures for other similar occupations and sectors, however, they are not wildly out of line. In fact,

one could argue that it is precisely the opportunity to take the occasional day off that makes

teaching attractive to many people with children. Except for schools and districts with

persistently high rates of absence, then, the rate of teacher absences itself should probably not be

a cause for great concern.

       The second reason to pay attention to teacher absences is their effect on student

achievement: when regular teachers are not in the classroom, opportunities for students to learn

are cut short. This common sense conclusion is bolstered by statistical evidence showing that

students whose teachers miss more days for sickness score lower on state achievement tests. The

third reason to worry about teacher absences is that they occur with greater frequency in low-

income schools. Teacher absences therefore join other characteristics of teachers that are

distributed unequally across schools and should therefore be included in discussions of equity in

the provision of public schooling. The fourth reason to pay attention to teacher absences is that,

because the demand for absences is price-elastic, they can be influenced by school district


                                                 26
compensation policies. Our results suggest that teachers' valuation of a marginal sick day is in

some cases less than $50, which is in turn less than even the most conservative estimates of the

marginal social cost of an absence.

         Overall, then, policies that create or increase incentives to reduce the number of absences

teachers take can be advocated on two fronts. From an efficiency standpoint, these policies have

the potential to simultaneously raise teachers' expected compensation and reduce districts'

expected costs.36 From an equity perspective, policies that reduce absences have the potential to

reduce one of the many resource disparities between high- and low-poverty schools.

         Previous research suggests that policies regarding the number of absences, the ability to

carry forward unused sick days, the benefits if any of not using all allowable days, and school-

level requirements about reporting absences all have the potential to influence the actual rate of

teacher absenteeism. In assessing the desirability of adjusting such policies, policy makers must

weigh the costs of absences – budgetary, administrative, and educational – against the degree to

which more lenient policies might make teaching an attractive career option.

Note: FTE is full-time equivalent. Schools are classified by quartiles of percent free lunch, where the
quartile breaks are defined separately for elementary, middle, and high schools, taking all years together.
Income quartiles are based on full-time equivalent teacher counts. Where data on percent free lunch were
missing, data for the school in the previous year or following year were used instead, where possible. All
remaining schools were dropped. The lowest income quartile refers to the schools with the highest
percentage of students eligible for free lunch. For the state’s schools, the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles
for proportion free lunch were, respectively: .244, .360, and .516 in elementary schools; .204, .298, and
.428 in middle schools; and .103, .169, and .268 in high schools. Absences are for 10-month year or year
equivalent. 3/1/07

Note: Schools are classified by quartiles of percent free lunch, where the quartile breaks are defined
separately for elementary, middle, and high schools, taking all years together. See note, Table 3.
    Table entries indicate the weighted percentage of schools by income quartile which were in the
highest quartile of average absences, taking all years together (more than 9.84 sick + personal days per
teacher), in at least five years in the period 1994/95 to 2003/04, where the weights are full-time
equivalent teachers times years in the sample. A school that appears in different income quartiles over the
period will be reflected according to the number of years and FTE teachers in each income quartile.
Schools appearing in fewer than five years were omitted.
