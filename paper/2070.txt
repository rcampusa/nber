         Productivity, Wages, and Prices Inside and Outside of
              Manufacturing in the U.S., Japan, and Europe



                                ABSTRACT

      Thispaper studies the dynamic behavior of changes in productivity,
wages, and prices. Results are based on a new data set that allows a
consistent analysis of the aggregate economy, the manufacturing sector,
and the nonmanufacturing sector. Results are presented for the U. S.,
Japan, and an aggregate called "Europe" consisting of eleven European
economies.
      The primary theme of the paper is that differences between Europe
and the U. S. have been substantially exaggerated in recent work.
Europe has neither greater nominal wage flexibility nor more rigid real
wages than the U. S. Evidence that the U. S. exhibits more nominal
rigidity is confined to manufacturing, while the U. S. aggregate and
nonmanufacturing sectors display as much nominal wage flexibility as
Europe, and similar "output sacrifice ratios" as well. These results
undermine the case frequently made against demand expansion in Europe
on the ground that such a demand expansion would cause only extra
inflation with no bonus of extra output as a result of a uniquely vertical
European aggregate supply curve.
     The analysis of real wages also yields new results. A consistent
treatment of the income of the self-employed almost completely eliminates
the secular uptrend in previously developed wage gap indexes for Japan
and Europe between the 1960s and 1980s. If anything real wages in
Europe and Japan were too flexible rather than too rigid, in the sense
that much of the increase in wage gap indexes in Europe during 1968-70
and in Japan in 1973-74 can be interpreted as autonomous wage push.
The component of increases in wage gap indexes to be attributed to a
failure of real wages to respond to the post-1972 productivity growth
slowdown is relatively minor.
      The paper's analysis of productivity change confirms the real—wage
elasticity of labor input emphasized previously, but shows that the
response of productivity to changes in the real wage, and to cyclical
output fluctuations, is roughly the same the U. S., Japan, and Europe.
The cyclical analysis allows an estimate of trend productivity growth,
revealing interesting differences between the manufacturing and
nonmanufacturing sectors in the three economies.

  The Issues
     On the eastern side of the Atlantic only one great economic puzzle of the
1980s is acknowledged: persistently high unemployment in Europe. Faced with
an unwillingness of policymakers to reduce unemployment by expanding aggregate
demand, many economists and commentators have retreated into cataloguing a
litany of European supply-side maladies. To construct this list of ills,
Europeans often cast envious glances toward America and Japan to reveal those
aspects of European economic institutions that are different, and hence
"worse."
     Based on a new data set and a methodology that differs from most past
research on comparative macroeconomic behavior, this paper argues that,
whatever other differences between Europe and the U. S. may exist, any
differences in the cyclical dynamics of productivity, wage, and price behavior
have been greatly exaggerated. There is little evidence to support previous
claims that, in comparison with the U. S., Europe exhibit8 (a) classical
short—run diminishing returns in the relationship between output and labor
input, (b) greater "rigidity" of real wage behavior, or (c) greater "flexi-
bility" of nominal wage and price behavior. The absence of a case supporting
a unique set of cyclical aggregate supply responses in Europe undermines the
case against policies that expand the growth rate of nominal aggregate demand
in order to raise output and reduce unemployment in Europe. The main emphasis
in this paper is on comparisons between Europe and the U. S.; however,
evidence for Japan is also presented that confirms important differences
between Japan and both Europe and the U. S.

  The Central Role of the Real Wage

     Evaluations of the European unemployment problem often center around a

distinction   between Keynesian and classical unemployment, in which the real
wage plays a central role. Evidence for classical unemployment is provided by
a demonstration that growth in European real wages has been excessive, and
that employment responds negatively to an increase in the real wage. A widely
discussed summary measure of the excess component of the real wage, popular-
ized by Bruno-Sachs (1981, 1985) and Sacha (1979, 1983), is the "wage gap", an
index of the ratio of the real wage to labor's average product, which amounts
simply to an index of labor's share in national income. In their analyses of
European unemployment and stagflation, Bruno and Sachs have exhibited wage gap
indexes that increase much more in Europe than in the U. S., and they,
together with numerous other authors (especially Layard—Nickell 1984, Bean—
Layard-Nickell 1985, and Newell Symons 1985), have shown that employment and
labor hours exhibit a strong negative elasticity to changes in the real wage.
     But the case for an excessive real wage as the crux of the European
unemployment has been carried too far. The European problem of declining
employment and rising unemployment is centered in the manufacturing sector,
yet the European wage gap index for manufacturing has fallen steadily since
the late 1970s and is now well below the value of the same index for U. S.
manufacturing. Even more inconvenient is the enormous rise in the Japanese
wage gap, which dwarfs anything experienced in Europe, without any slowdown in
the growth of labor input.
     So much has been said about the evil of higher real wages that the
                                              Productivity, Wages, and Prices, Page 3


 benefits of higher real wages, enjoyed throughout history, seem to have been
 forgotten. The negative response of labor hours to an increase in the real
 wage implies a positive response of output per hour to the same Increase.
 Indeed, substitution away from labor in response to an inexorable rise in the
 real wage has been at the heart of the economic growth process for centuries.
 In a statistical decomposition, we show below that a substantial component of
accelerations and decelerations of productivity growth in Europe, Japan, and
even in the U. S. can be attributed to the behavior of the wage gap.
     The response of employment to changes in the real wage constitutes only
half of the circle linking the two. The Phillips curve can be interpreted as
postulating a positive response in the growth of the real wage to the level of
detrended employment. Thus a stimulus to aggregate demand provides not only
the direct benefit of raising output and employment, but also the indirect
benefit of raising the real wage and creating substitution away from labor
that boosts productivity and, if sustained, the nation's standard of living.
With this dual benefit obtainable from demand expansion, the case against
demand stimulation must rest with convincing evidence that such policies would
create an unacceptable acceleration of inflation.

  The Research Agenda in this Paper

     This paper is a comprehensive study of        the interrelationships among
productivity,   wages, and   prices in   the U. S., Japan, and Europe. New statis—

tical evidence is provided on the four major issues introduced      above, (1)    the
behavior of an index of the wage gap (labor's share), corrected for a major
conceptual error in past measures of this concept, (2) the response of
employment and productivity to changes in the real wage and in the wage gap,
                                        Productivity, Wages, and Prices, Page 4


(3) the "Phillips—curve" response of real wages to economic slack, and (4) the
division of a nominal demand change between inflation and real output growth.
While each of these four issues has been studied by numerous authors, the
research undertaken here is unique in its data base, distinction between
manufacturing and nonmanufacturing, and econometric specification.
     Almost all previous studies in this area have used data that are Incon-
sistent by sector, leading to regressions in which the wage rate in the
manufacturing sector is related to employment or unemployment in the aggregate
economy. Yet in 1984 manufacturing value added was only 24 percent of total
output in the U. S. and 29 percent in Europe. In contrast, this study is
based on a consistent data base in which time series for 14 countries over the
1961—84 interval have been developed for the aggregate economy, for the
manufacturing sector, and for the nonmanufacturing (residual) sector. The
data series available for all three sectors in each of the 14 countries
include such variables as real value added, the value added deflator, compen-
sation per hour, employment, and hours per employee.' As we shall see, this
distinction between sectors is important, for the interpretation of the
productivity growth slowdown, as well as constructed "wage gap" measures,
display quite different time series behavior inside and outside of manufac-
turing.
     A further innovation in the data base corrects an error in previous
measures of the wage gap or "labor's share." While employment and person—
hours data include not only employees but also the self—employed, the income
of the self-employed is included in the official OECD national accounting
system as part of capital's "operating surplus" rather than as part of the
                                        Productivity, Wages, and Prices, Page 5


income of labor. When the income of the self—employed, which the OECD calls
"household entrepreneurial income" is added to the compensation of employees
and treated as part of labor's income share, the secular increase in labor's
share in Europe and Japan, to which Bruno and Sacha have previously called
attention, disappears almost entirely. Rather than criticizing the concept of
the wage gap upon which previous investigators have based their claim that
European unemployment is "classical," this paper shows that the properly
measured wage gap shows little if any secular increase not just in the U. S.,
but also in Europe and Japan.
     To take advantage of the new information contained in the data base, all
regression equations describing the behavior of productivity, wage, and price
changes are estimated separately for the three sectors (aggregate, manufac-
turing, and nonmanufacturing). To limit the scope and length of the paper,
which would otherwise be unmanageable, results for the 11 European countries
are not reported separately. Instead, an aggregate for "Europe" has been
constructed. Thus all results are presented in groups of nine, three sectors
for three "countries" (U. S., Japan, and Europe).2
     The econometric specification builds on my own past research for the
U. S. and hence differs markedly from most other work on these issues. Since
unemployment rates by sector are conceptually meaningless, the measure of
cyclical variability that enters the productivity, wage, and price equations
is detrended sectoral output rather than the level of unemployment. All
equations are estimated in first differences rather than levels in order to
avoid spurious correlations among variables (especially productivity and the
real wage) that display common changes in trend. Special attention is given
                                        Productivity, Wages, and Prices, Page 6


to the response of real wage changes to the productivity growth slowdown that
has occurred everywhere, an issue that is ignored in the majority of studies
that include only a single constant term in equations explaining wage changes,
and yet is essential in testing the hypothesis that real wage growth in Europe
was too "rigid" to respond to the post-1973 productivity growth slowdown.
Wage and price equations are based on an explicit model of disequilibrium
labor market adjustment, in contrast to some work (especially Newell—Symons
1985) based on a market—clearing interpretation.

  Theaes That ERerge
     The results cast doubt on some of the contrasts between the U. S. and
Europe that have received heavy emphasis in previou8 research. While we
confirm the real-wage elasticity of labor input stressed in papers by Layard-
Nickel! and Newell—Symons, we find that the response of labor input and labor
productivity to changes in the real wage is roughly similar in the three
countries, rather than being especially high in Europe. There is absolutely
no evidence to support Sachs' (1983) claim that productivity in Europe is
"classical," varying countercylically, in contrast to procyclical movements in
the U. S.
     The apparent consensus that European real wages are excessive is sim-
plistic; in 1984 the European wage gap was lower than the U. S. wage gap in
manufacturing but higher in nonmanufacturing, creating problems for classical
interpretations of unemployment in Europe where the great bulk of the employ-
ment decline has occurred in manufacturing. The high wage gaps in the
nonmanufacturing sector in Europe and Japan are shown to result almost
entirely from the omission of self—employment income as part of labor's share
                                        Productivity, Wages, and Prices, Page 7


in national income.
     The wage and price equations estimated in the paper address the common
distinction between real wage rigidity in Europe and nominal wage rigidity in
the U. S. (see especially Branson—Rotemberg 1980). We find that the bulge in
the wage gaps of Europe and Japan in the 1970s is not due primarily to a
failure of real wages to decelerate in response to the post—1973 productivity
growth slowdown, but rather results in large part from episodes of autonomous
"wage push" in Europe in the late 1960s and in Japan during 1973-74. In this
sense, real wages in Europe and Japan were too flexible, rather than too
rigid.
     The nominal wage rigidity part of the Branson-Rotemberg dichotomy
receives only partial support. Some specifications indicate roughly similar
cyclical responsiveness of nominal wage rates in Europe and the U. S. for the
aggregate economy, leaving only the manufacturing sector to support Branson-
Rotemberg on the grounds that there is almost complete nominal rigidity for
U. S. manufacturing. Yet what matters is the aggregate economy, and here the
differences among the U. S., Japan, and Europe are minimal. Responses of the
nominal wage rate to the output ratio are of roughly the same order of
magnitude in the three aggregate economies. The sectoral division between
manufacturing and nonmanufacturing displays the expected result that there is
little cyclical responsiveness of wage rates in U. S. manufacturing, but the
unexpected result that there is also less cyclical responsiveness in Japanese
manufacturing than in Europe, and more cyclical responsiveness in both the
U. S. and European nonmanufacturing sectors than in Japan. These results
suggest that the emphasis in my own past research (1982, 1983) on the greater
                                                       Productivity, Wages, and Prices, Page 8


nominal wage rigidity in the U. S. than in Japan may be limited in applic-
ability to the manufacturing sector, and that differences in nominal wage
flexibility in the aggregate economy (and in the nonmanufacturing sector) may
be much less than is commonly supposed.

     This section develops an explicit model of disequilibrium wage and price
adjustment in the labor market.3 The approach is based on the assumption that
the nominal wage rate adjusts in response to any change in the size of the gap
between labor demand and supply. The advantage of the formulation is that the
influence of supply shocks, of the post-1973 productivity slowdown, and of tax
changes on wage and price behavior can be motivated concretely in the model.
This section concludes by using the model to develop definitions of the much—
discussed concepts of real and nominal wage stickiness, the output gap, and
the natural rate of unemployment.

  The Static Labor Market Model
     The    exposition begins with a production function in which output (Qt)                               is
written    as a function of labor input (Nt) and a multiplicative factor 8t that
incorporates the effects of capital and materials inputs and of technological
change:

     (1)                         Qt         8tQ(Nt),                 Q' > 0.

The real product wage, which is set equal to the marginal product of IBbor, is
expressed as the ratio of the actual nominal wage rate, Wt, to the expected
                                                                     Productivity, Wages, and Prices, Page 9



product price, Pet, adjusted for the influence of indirect taxes, Vt.

Payroll taxes do not enter into the expression for the real product wage,

because the wage concept in our date (Wt) is measured gross of all payroll

taxes paid by employers and employees:



                            WtT't              =
     (2)                                                ®tQ (Nt).


Here the expression V represents the an indirect tax factor, defined as:


                                       =
                                                   Ll_.tt

where t' is the indirect tax rate.

     Equation (2), inverted, expresses the demand for labor as a function of

the real expected product wage, adjusted for the tax term, T't, and the

productivity shift factor, et:



                       Ndt.        =
                                               Ndtt•J,              N'd   < 0.



     The supply of labor is a positively sloped function of the real wage

stated in terms of the expected consumer price index, Cet, with an adjustment

for a personal tax factor, T't =                   [l/(l—rf't)J.[l/(ltst)],           where rt is the

personal tax rate and t6t     is       the total payroll tax rate on both employers and

employees, included in our measure of the wage rate (Wt):




                            N9t            =
     (4)                                           NS
                                                        {RTJ'         N'S   >    0.



In equation (4) the factor Rt is the "aspiration" real wage that workers
                                             Productivity, Wages, and Prices, Page 10


compare with the tax—adjusted real expected wage.
     The excess demand for labor, Xt, can be expressed as the difference
between the logs of labor demand and labor supply:

     (5)                   Xt        log(Ndt) — log(Nt),


so that in equilibrium Xt z 0. This expression can be converted into a
relationship between the proportional rates of growth of the demand for and
supply of labor by substituting equations (3) and (4) into equation (5),
taking time derivatives of the log version of (5), and rearranging:

     (6)     xt    _(a+b)(w6_pe)t + b(r_e+ce_pe+tP)t       —
                                                               at1t.


Here lowercase letters indicate rates of change (w             dlogW/dt), and a and b
are, respectively, the real—wage elasticities of labor demand and supply.
  The Phillips Curve Wage Equation

     The    Phillip8 curve adjustment hypothesis is that the nominal wage rate
moves in the direction needed to eliminate the excess demand for labor at a
rate that depends on the size of the gap between demand and supply:

     (7)                   xt        —gXt,


where once again lower case letters represent proportional rates of change.
Thus in equilibrium xt     Xi   0.     When the right-hand sides of equations (6)
and (7) are set equal to each other and solved for the rate of change of real
unit labor cost, the result is the augmented Phillips curve wage change
equation:
                                                        Productivity, Wages, and Prices, Page 11




        (8)     wt —     — pet       [b(r_e+cepe+tP)t —       at't   + gXtJ.



Our subsequent reduced—forni equation is simplified if at this stage we

eliminate the expected change in the consumer price index (Cet) from (8) by

assuming that the only difference between the changes in the consumer and

producer price indexes (c—p) is due to the difference between the change in

import (pt) and export (pXt) prices:


        (9)     ct = pt + j(pFt — pXt),



where    we apply the same weight (,j) to import and export prices on the assump—

tion of balanced trade. If the rate of change of import and export prices is

the same, then the c—p terni drops out. We shall make the alternative sim-

plifying assumption that the growth rate of export prices is the same as that

of domestic producer prices, so that:


        (10)     (c — p)t.     = j(pFt —   pt).

When (10) is substituted into (8), we obtain the modified augmented Phillips

curve    wage change equation:


        (11)     w—          — pet         (b[r_9+j(pV_p)+tPJt —   at't   ÷ gXt},



where    the distinction between the actual and expected change in the real
import    price term has been dropped.

  Price Equations: Markup and Reduced—for,,,

       Equation (11) describes the   time series behavior of the rate of change in
the   nominal wage rate and in the wage gap (Wt        —   et   —
                                                                    Pt).   To determine the

cyclical behavior of the inflation rate to changes         in demand or supply, (11)
must be supplemented by an explicit hypothesis regarding the determination of
prices. We assume that the product price is set as a weighted average of
domestic unit labor cost adjusted for the indirect tax factor T't introduced
in equation (2), and the import price PFt, with a variable markup, M, that
depends on excess demand (Vt) in the commodity market:

      (12>                 Pt        T'tM(Vt) (Wt/8t)h(PFt)1—h.


Although imports are excluded from the domestic value—added price index (P),
nevertheless the prices of foreign goods can influence domestic value—added
prices through their effect on import substitutes. The weight h incorporates
this effect, and h would be expected to differ from the import share j that
appears above in equation (10).
      By taking the time derivative of the logarithmic version of (12), we
obtain an expression that relates the current inflation rate to the current
rates of change of unit labor cost, foreign prices, excess commodity demand,
and the indirect tax factor:

      (13)               Pt       h(wt—et) + (1_h)pFt + t't + m(vt).

Now, substituting the wage change equation (11) into the price change equation
(13), it is possible to obtain a reduced—form expression for the inflation

rate that does not directly involve the wage rate:




     (14)           Pt       =    pt    + m(vt) +


                                  + [(l—h)+J(pF_p)t + — {hb(r—e+t)t + [b+a(1—h)]t't}.

To interpret equation (14), it helps to combine all of the terms on the second

line into a single "cost—push" or "supply—shift" term zt., where



     (15)      zt        =       [(a+b)(l_h)+hbj](pFp)t    + fhb(r—9+t")t + [b+a(l—h)]t't}.



This definition allows us to write a more compact version of the reduced—form

inflation equation as:


     (16)                              Pt   =   pet + m(vt) + —[hgXt + zt].

This expression (16) is an expectational Phillips curve relating the actual

inflation rate to the expected inflation rate and the growth (v) and level (X) of

excess demand. When the economy is operating at a fixed level of excess demand,

with vt =   0, inflation accelerates (pt > pet.) when that level of Xt is positive
and decelerates when Xt is negative.


  Alternative Interpretations of the Natural Rate Hypothesis
  and the Wage Gap

        The presence of the cost—push term (zt) in (16) requires that we identify

two concepts of the natural rate of unemployment. The "conventional" or "no—

shock" natural rate of unemployment (U*t) is that which is consistent with zero

excess demand in the labor market when the supply shock terms net out to zero
                                            Productivity, Wages, and Prices, Page 14


(Zt   0). With zt and vt set at zero in (16), then a steady rate of inflation,
with pt      pet, is achieved whenever Xt     0. This situation also defines the
natural unemployment rate (U*t) as that which is consistent with zero excess
demand in the labor market:

      (17)                   U*t     Ut — Xt,


where Ut is the actual unemployment rate.
      However, when the supply shock terms in (15) do not net out to zero (Zt
0), then the alternative "shock's natural rate concept (Ust) indicates the
unemployment rate consistent with steady inflation:

      (18)                  USt     Ut +

      The cost-push or supply-shock factors appearing in (15) that may set the zt
term at a nonzero value can be a cause of inflation, unemployment, or both. If
the monetary authority accommodates the shocks by attempting to set Xt             0, then
inflation will accelerate when zt > 0. If the authority extinguishes the shocks
by attempting to maintain pt       pet, then unemployment will rise above U*t by the
amount shown in equation (18). Thus the three components of zt in (15) can be
interpreted as causes of inflation, unemployment, or both, depending on the
degree of monetary accommodation provided by the monetary authority:
      1. There can be an increase in the real price of foreign goods expressed in
             domestic currency (p}' — p).
      2. There can be an excess in the growth rate (rt) of the "aspiration" real
             age relevant for labor supply over the growth rate of productivity (et)
             that is relevant for price setting.
                                       Productivity, Wages, and Prices, Page 15


     3. There can be an increase in either of the two tax factors, personal or
          indirect.

  Interpretations of Real and Nominal Wage Rigidity
     Equations (15) and (18) help us gain insight into the interrelationship
between real and nominal wage rigidity. The usual interpretation of real wage
rigidity is an excess of workers' aspirations for real wage increases relative
to the rate of productivity growth, i.e., that the term (rt - et) is positive
in (15), presumably because of a failure of the rate of real wage increase to
adjust downwards in response to a slowdown in productivity growth, such as
that which occurred after 1973. Clearly, real wage flexibility in the sense
that rt always stays equal to et is necessary but not sufficient for an
avoidance of classical unemployment, since the other terms on the right—hand
side of (15) that comprise zt could have a positive sum. Conversely, real
wage rigidity in the sense of an inflexible rt is not necessary for classical
unemployment to occur, because real wage flexibility can be as serious a
problem if there is an autonomous jump in rt while et remains constant. Below
we present evidence supporting the interpretation that an "autonomous wage
push" occurred in Europe in the late 1960s and in Japan in 1973-74.
     Second, if all of the terms in (15) sum to zero, so that the supply shock
term zt is zero, nominal wage rigidity in the sense of a small adjustment
parameter g in (18) is irrelevant to inflation and unemployment, as long as
the economy begins in equilibrium with Xt     0 and matters only by raising the
amount of employment or output that must be sacrificed to reduce the inflation
rate from some initial value (thus there should be a direct correlation across
countries between high values of     and low sacrifice ratios).
                                        Productivity, Wages, and Prices, Page 16


       Third, the effects of excess real wage growth in the sense that rt > et
cannot be separated from those of nominal wage rigidity, since in (18) the
value of Xt required to maintain a constant value of the inflation rate
depends both on the amount by which rt exceeds et and on the nominal adjust-
ment parameter g. If g is quite small, then excess real wage growth can cause
a large amount of unemployment when the monetary authority acts to prevent
inflation from accelerating. More generally, the amount of unemployment that
results from any positive component of the supply—shift zt term depends
inversely on the size of the nominal wage adjustment parameter g.

  III.     THE DA TA BA SE AND   ISSUES IN ECONOMETRIC SPECIFICATION

  The Data Base for Manufacturing and Nonaanufacturing

       Most comparative econometric studies of wage and   employment equations
have   indiscriminately mixed data on the hourly wage rate for the   manufacturing
sector   with economy—wide data on unemployment and/or output.4 The work of

Artus (1984) is almost unique in developing a consistent data base for

manufacturing,   and this paper builds on his research by developing an analo-
gous data base for the aggregate economy, as well as the manufacturing and
nonmanufacturing (residual) sectors.
       The aim of the data compilation is to develop consistent series on value
added, the value added deflator, compensation, employment, and hours per
employee. These series allow the calculation of all of the variables that
matter for a study of productivity, wage, and price behavior. Average labor
productivity is real value added per labor hour, the wage rate is compensation
per labor hour, and the wage gap is the nominal wage rate, divided by the
                                       Productivity, Wages, and Prices, Page 17


value added deflator, divided in turn by average labor productivity. Because
the real product wage relevant for the hiring decisions of business firms is
expressed at factor cost, i.e., net of indirect taxes, special care has been
taken to achieve a consistent set of net—of—tax product price deflators at
factor cost.
     A unique feature of this study is the symmetric attention to the manufac-
turing and nonmanufacturing sectors. Data for the latter are created as a
residual, from data on the absolute values of output, compensation, and labor
input for the aggregate economy and for manufacturing. The manufacturing data
come from the IMF quarterly data base derived from original national accounts
sources, and the aggregate data are developed here from published OEOD series,
together with a crucial unpublished series on aggregate hours per employee.5
     Another unique feature of the data base is the explicit treatment of
self—employment income. Previous studies have included in indexes of labor's
income share and the "wage gap" only the compensation of employees. But the
income of the self—employed, consists mainly of labor income, should also be
included rather than being hidden, as at present, in the OECD's umbrella
capital income measure called "the operating surplus." This is particularly
important in this study, which measures the wage rate as compensation per
hour. Since measures of employment and total hours include the self—employed,
so should the measure of compensation. Thus our measure of total compensation
adds the OECD measure of "household entrepreneurial income" to employee
compensation. We assume that most of this entrepreneurial income is earned in
the agricultural, trade, and service sector, and so include it in the aggegate
and in nonmanufacturing, but make no adjustment in the manufacturing sector.
                                      Productivity, Wages, and Prices, Page 18


Below we display the effects of the entrepreneurial income adjustment on
indexes of the "wage gap."
     Because regression results are presented below for all three sectors, it
is not possible to follow the usual format in such studies by providing
separate regression estimates for each of the 14 countries covered in the data
base. Instead, a "Europe" aggregate for the 1]. European countries has been
compiled, using 1972 GNP weights expressed in dollars, and this allows the
subsequent research to be carried out for three countries, the U. S., Japan,
and "Europe".
          Potential defects in these procedures are obvious and may be
enumerated briefly. The use of compensation per hour to represent the wage
rate has the advantage that separate wage rate series can be developed for the
aggregate, manufacturing, and nonmanufacturing sectors, but has the disad—
vantage that any compensation per hour series displays cyclical fluctuations
created by changes in the fraction of hours paying overtime rates, and by
changes in the interindustry mix between high and low wage activities, rather
than by changes in the "pure" wage rate itself. While my past work on U. S.
wage behavior has been based on an hourly earnings index adjusted for shifts
in overtime and the interindustry employment mix, such indexes are not
available for other countries, and thus the need for consistency requires use
of an unadjusted compensation per hour series for each country and each
sector. The addition of self—employment income to employee compensation also
raises issues that require further research, including the true breakdown
between manufacturing and nonmanufacturing, and the more difficult issue of
separating the labor and capital components of entrepreneurial income.
                                          Productivity, Wages, and Prices, Page 19


     Another limitation of our approach is the requirement that detrended
output rather than the official or standardized unemployment rate be used as
the basic measure of cyclical variability, simply because unemployment rate
series are available only for the aggregate economy and are meaningless for
sub—sectors. While the regressions presented below for the aggregate sector
of the U. S., Japanese, and European economies could be reestimated with the
unemployment rate replacing the detrended output series, this task would
expand the scope of the paper and is deferred for future research.

  Converting the Theoretical Equations
  into   an Econowetric Specification

     The aim of the econometric research is to estimate      equations corres-
ponding to the   above equations    for wage change (11),   price change within a

markup framework (13), and price change within a reduced—form framework (14).
Decisions required to convert theoretical ideas into an explicit econometric
specification are discussed here.
     1. Basic format. All equations take the form of (11), (13), and (14),
by expressing all variables (other than the cyclical Phillips curve variable)
as first differences of logs.
     2. Expected price change. The pt term in equations (11) and (14) is
proxied by two lags on the annual change in the value-added deflator. Two
lags appear to be sufficient to explain the wage changes without including a
third or further lags, while the "zero" lag (current price change) is excluded
to avoid simultaneity and identify the wage and price equations (i.e., the
current change in unit labor cost is entered into the price markup equations,
but the current change in price is not entered into the wage equations). This
                                      Productivity, Wages, and Prices, Page 20


treatment reflects the (structural) assumption that wages can influence prices
within the current year more than prices can influence wages, and the high
degree of simultaneity between annual changes in wages and prices is at-
tributed to the price—setting process. Note that the wage equation (11)
calls for the expected price change term to enter with a unitary coefficient;
the wage equations are estimated below with the sum of coefficients on the two
lagged price change terms both estimated freely and also constrained to equal
unity.
     3. Demand Pressure variables. It has been customary in previous studies
to designate the unemployment rate or its inverse as the sole demand pressure
variable. However, in theory it is not the level of the unemployment rate
that matters, but rather the excess demand for labor, which should be measured
as the deviation of the actual from the natural unemployment rate. If the
natural unemployment rate has risen, as seems to have occurred in most
countries, the use of the unemployment rate to measure excess demand intro-
duces measurement error. The procedure used here is to take advantage of the
regular "Okun's Law" relationship observed in many countries (Gordon, 1984;
Hamada-Kurosaka, 1983) in the form of a high negative correlation between the
log ratio of actual to "natural" output (log Q - log Q*) and the deviation of
the actual from the natural unemployment rate. The required natural output
series consists of exponential trends running between the benchmark years of
1961, 1972, and 1979, with the 1972—79 trend extended to 1984 on the assump-
tion that most countries were operating below natural output after 1979 and
hence that no benchmark year is available for the l980s.
     The standardized unemployment rates for each country are shown in Table 1

for the benchmark years 1961, 1972, and 1979, and also for 1984. While the
U. S. in 1979 seems to have been operating close to natural output (Gordon,
1985), the choice of 1979 as a benchmark year is subject to debate for some of
the other countries. The unemployment rate for Europe (the fourth line in
Table 1) rose from 2.7 percent in 1972 to 4.9 percent in 1979, suggesting the
possibility that setting natural output equal to actual output in 1979 for
Europe may lead to an understatement of natural output and overstatement of
the log output ratio for the entire post—1972 period.
       4. Tax Rates. There are insufficient degrees of freedom to include both
tax change terms (V and t) in annual equations for the short 1964-84
interval. Instead, the rate of change of the total indirect, payroll, and
personal tax rates is entered as a single variable. The change in the total
tax rate (tT) is calculated at an annual rate over two years, rather than one
year, to allow for lags without using up an extra degree of freedom.
       6. Productivity growth. The wage change equation (11) contains a term
(r —   ) to allow for the posaibility that the "aspiration" real wage rate
rises more rapidly than the rate of productivity growth () relevant for price
setting; this could reflect either real wage stickiness in response to a
slowdown in productivity growth, or an autonomous episode of "wage push" that
is not captured by the other terms in the wage equation. The productivity
growth concept assumed to be relevant for price setting is trend productivity
growth (*) rather than actual productivity growth (e).8     Separate   values of
  are estimated before and after 1972, as discussed in Part IV below, and are
subtracted from the rate of wage change to form the dependent variable of the
wage equation (wt — e*t, i.e., the change in trend unit labor cost).
                                        Productivity, Wages, and Prices, Page 22


    The real-wage rigidity or wage push effect (r - ), which we can call the
"excess change" in the real wage, is measured by a set of dummy variables.
The first is simply a constant term for the full sample period. Since the
specification in (11) contains no constant term, a significant positive value
for the constant term would indicate that, on average over the sample period,
the change in the real wage rate is larger than the trend growth rate of
productivity, after taking account of the effect of the other variables in the
equation (the log output ratio, the relative consumer price change, and the
relative import price change). Additional dummy variables are also entered
for the 1973-84 and 1980—84 periods to test for the excess change in the real
wage during different intervals of the sample period. The sum of the constant
and the 1973—84 dummy indicates for the 1973-79 period the excess change in
the real wage (measured as an annual rate of change), while the sum of the
constant, the 1973—84 dummy, and the 1980—84 dummy indicates the excess change
for the 1980—84 interval. This interpretation of the excess change in the
real wage requires that the coefficients on the lagged product price change
terms (pt-i and pt-2) are constrained to sum to unity.  The wage equations
are estimated both with and without the set of constants and dummy variables.
     In previous research on European wage setting behavior Nordhaus (1972)
identified a "wage explosion" in the late 1960s, and this episode of autono-
mous wage push was confirmed later by Perry (1975) and Gordon (1977a). To
isolate this episode, an additional dummy variable is included in the European
wage equations, defined as 1.0 for the years 1968—70 and zero otherwise.
While there have been no wage explosions in the U. S., allowance for the Nixon
wage and price controls period in 1971—72 and subsequent rebound in 1974-75
                                            Productivity, Wages, and Prices, Page 23


needs to be made, and this is handled by a single dummy variable defined as
1.0 in 1971—72, —1.0 in 1974—75, and zero otherwise. The fit of the Japanese
wage equations is markedly improved when the period 1973-74 is treated as a
period of wage explosion in that country, captured by a dummy variable equal
to 1.0 for 1973—74 and zero otherwise.

  Suwwary of the Specification of the Wage and Price Equations

       The    preceding discussion suggests the following wage equation, in which
the dependent variable is the rate of change of trend unit labor cost:

       (19)     Wt —   e*t   aiipt—i + i2t—2 + a2OQt + 21Qt—i + a3(pF._p)t

                              + cx4(tT)t + czsDVPt + ccoDot + cciDjt + 2D2t.


       A
Here   Qt is the output ratio, tTt is the change in the total tax rate, DWPt is
the wage push or controls dummy (1968-70 for Europe, 1973-74 for Japan, and
1971-72 reversed in 1974—75 for the U. S.), and the dummy variables designated
Dt measure the presence of excess real wage change for the periods 1964—84,
1972-84, and 1980—84. The inclusion of the lagged as well as current output
ratio term allows the effect of aggregate demand to enter either as a level
effect, rate of change effect, or both. In Table 5 below, this specification
of the wage change equation is estimated first with the Dit terms omitted and
with the coefficients on the lagged price terms freely estimated, and then a
second time with the Dt terms included and the constraint imposed that ii +
12     1.0.

       The wage change equation is supplemented by an equation that explains
changes in the value-added deflator, as in (13), which can be estimated in the
                                          Productivity, Wages, and Prices, Page 24


straightforward form:

     (20)     Pt     io(we9t + ii(w_e*)t_i + 2Ot + 2iQt—1
                        + 3cpF_p)t + 4tTt + 5DWPt.

The wage—push/controls dummy variables are entered exactly as in the wage
equations. In the case of Europe and Japan, the coefficient s might be
negative if an autonomous wage push squeezed profit margins, while in the
U. S. the 1971-72 controls program applied to price markups as well as wage
rates.
     The final equation to be estimated is the reduced-form that results when
(19) is substituted into (20). To simplify the presentation of the reduced
form, the complex set of lagged coefficients is relabelled (e.g., Vu
Bioaii), and several lagged terms that are indicated by the substitution are
dropped to save degrees of freedom:

     (21)     Pt     Vupt—i + Vi2pt—2 +       + V21Qt-1 +

                            + V4tTt + V5DWPt + oDot + iDit + 2D2t.

Notice that the productivity trend term (e*t) drops out of the reduced-form,
but included are the three dummy variables (Dt) that measure the presence of
excess real wage change for the periods 1964—84, 1972—84, and 1980—84. The
reduced—form price change equation (21) is estimated first with the Dit terms
omitted and with the coefficients on the lagged price terms freely estimated,
and then a second time with the Dt terms included and the constraint imposed
that Vu + Y12 1.0. If any of the three i coefficients are significantly
positive, this would indicate that excess real wage change created an acceler—
                                       Productivity, Wages, and Prices, Page 25


ation of inflation, and indirectly an increase in the natural rate of
unemployment.




                IV. PROD (ICTI VITY GROWTH AND THE REA I WA GE




         The specification of the wage and price mark-up equations contains a
productivity trend growth term (*) which must be estimated, in order to
disentangle cyclical movements in productivity from trend movements. The
cyclical productivity regressions developed in this section also allow us to
assess the effect of real wage movements on the demand for labor and on
labor's average product. A subsidiary purpose of this section is to assess
the claim by Sachs that "in Europe (but not in Japan) the overall effect of a
sustained rise in unemployment is to raise productivity relative to trend"
(1983, p. 281). His claim that labor productivity varies countercyclically in
Europe contrasts with the standard assumption in the U. S. that productivity
varies procyclically.

  Specification of the Productivity Equations
     The basic specification relates the log ratio of hours to trend output
(Nt — Q*t)to the log output ratio (Qi — Q*t), representing the cyclical
effect of output on hiring decisions; to the real wage rate defined relative
to the underlying productivity trend [(Wt — Pt) - 8t], which could differ
from zero as a result of excess growth in the real wage; and to the productiv—
ity trend itself (e*t). Taking this opportunity to redefine all upper—case
                                            Productivity, Wages, and Prices, Page 26


 letters as logs of levels, we can write:


       (22)      (Nt — Q*t)   A + $(Qt — Q*t)   —
                                                    (Wt   —   Pt   —   e*t) —

 where     A is a constant. Note that (22) is consistent with the labor demand
function in (3), simply adding the cyclical effect to the normal static labor
 demand function in which labor hours depend on the real wage and labor—
augmenting technical progress. As in (3), the trend in (22) picks up the
effects of growth in the capital-labor ratio and of changes in other inputs.
     When (22) is rewritten as an equation for the average product of labor
(Q/N), we can interpret the parameter $    indicating the effect of cyclical
                                             as

movements in the output ratio on labor productivity:

       (23)       (Qt — Nt)    —A + (l—$)(Qt — Q*t) +              —   Pt   —
                                                                                8*t)     + 8t,
If the parameter $    unity, then a permanent increase in the output ratio has
                       is


no impact on actual labor productivity, whereas a value of • below unity
implies a permanent productivity gain ("short—run increasing returns") and a
value of $ above unity implies a permanent productivity loss ("short—run
diminishing returns"). Thus the Sachs phenomenon of countercyclical produc-
tivity movements in Europe requires an estimated value of $                     > 1.0.


  Theoretical       and Actual Wage Gap Indexes

     We    note that (23) allows us to define a wage gap concept adjusted not
just for cyclical effects but for the endogenous reponse of productivity
growth to excess growth in the real wage. The actual wage gap index (WGt) is
W- P   -   8 and the adjusted wage gap index (WGt) is W - P                 - 8*t. Using these
                                                   Productivity, Wages, and Prices, Page 27


definitions, we can rearrange (23) to obtain:

     (24)               WGt    A — (1—4')(Qt   —
                                                   Q*t) + (1a)(WG*t).


This expression places an interesting perspective on the interrelationships
between real wage behavior, productivity growth, and the wage gap index. If
the elasticity of labor input with respect to the excess real wage (a) in (22)
is unity, then (24) shows that the excess real wage growth ttpays for itself"
by boosting actual productivity enough to keep the actual wage gap index (WGt
  Wt —   Pt   —
                  8t)   unaffected. Only if the elasticity (a) is less than unity is
excess real wage growth manifested in an increase in the observed actual wage
gap index.
     The actual wage gap index (WGt) for each of the three sectors in the
U. S., Japan, and Europe without any adjustment for self—employment income is
displayed in Figure 1. Because the actual wage gap is defined as the real
product wage divided by labor's average product, the data displayed in Figure
1 can be interpreted simply as an index (1972                  1.0) of the share of employee
compensation in value added. Three interesting features are worthy of notice
in Figure 1. First, in Europe the wage gap index increases relative to that
in the U. S., and this feature of the data has been stressed by those authors
who have advocated the hypothesis of classical unemployment in Europe.
Second, this contrast between Europe and the U. S. is reversed after 1981 in
the manufacturing sector; by 1984 the European manufacturing wage gap index
 had declined back to 1.0, in contrast to a value of 1.07 for U. S. manufac-
 turing. Third, in each of the three sectors the wage gap index increased far
 more in Japan than in either Europe or the U. S., raising a question as to how

an increase in the wage gap could be a sign of classical unemployment in
Europe, whereas an even larger increase in the wage gap in Japan did not cause
the same phenomenon.9
     The Japanese puzzle, as well as most of the contrast between Europe and
the U. S., is eliminated by our inclusion of household entrepreneurial income
with employee compensation as part of labor's income share. The difference
made by the entrepreneurial income adjustment is displayed in Figure 2, where
there is one frame for the aggregate sector in each of the three economies.
While the difference made by the adjustment is small in the U. S., it makes a
substantial difference for Europe and an even greater difference for Japan.
With the adjustment, the values of the actual wage gap index for selected
years are as follows:

                                   U. S.          Japan           Europe
     1964                           98.0          101.0           98.5
     1972                          100.0          100.0          100.0
     1975                           98.7          107.6          102.8
     1979                           99.3          104.5          100.2
     1984                           94.9          100.7           97.0

It is hard to see how the minor differences in these indexes could be respon-
sible for the substantial differences among the three economies in the
evolution of unemployment rates since the 1960s, Comparing 1964, 1972, and
1979, the U. S. and European wage gap indexes were basically identical, and
the 1979—84 decline of 4.4 percent in the U. S. was only slightly greater than
the 3.2 percent decline in Europe. The Japanese story seems to have been one

  Estimation of the Labor Input Equations

testing    indicated that the growth rate specification is superiors avoiding the
serial correlation that occurs with the level specification for some sectors.
Allowing       for lags and         a   post—1972 break in the productivity growth trend, (22)

wage variable. With the real wage variable omitted, a2    was   significant for
the European aggregate and nonmanufacturing sectors, as discussed below in
connection with Table 4.


  Estimated Productivity Equations
         Results are presented in Table 2 for the three sectors within the U. S.,
Japan, and Europe. All sums of coefficients on the output ratio are between
zero and unity, indicating uniformly procyclical behavior of productivity,
with U. S. manufacturing and European nonmanufacturing closest to a neutral
effect, and the Japanese aggregate indicating the greatest degree of labor
hoarding (i.e., procyclical productivity response). A interesting result is
that the labor hoarding phenomenon is more important in European nonmanufac—
turing than in U. S. nonmanufacturing.
     The real wage elasticities are about one half in the nonmanufacturing
sectors of each country but are markedly lower in manufacturing, with a
significant negative coefficient within manufacturing only for Europe. The
aggregate real wage elasticity is about one—half in Japan and Europe and about
one-third in the U. S. (although the U. S. coefficient is statistically
insignificant). The productivity trend terms indicate extremely rapid rates
of productivity growth in Japan prior to 1973 and very large slowdowns in the
productivity growth trend in 1973—84, particularly in the aggregate and
nonmanufacturing. The U. S. productivity trend growth rates are so low as to
be insignificantly different from zero in the aggregate and in nonmanfac—
turing, and the U. S. post—1972 slowdown term8 are insignificant in all three
sectors. Europe is notable for having a post—1972 productivity trend in

 nonmanufacturing higher than in both the U. S. and Japan, and in having a
 relatively slight slowdown in all three sectors.
     Table 3 decomposes the change in productivity growth over three intervals
 among the effects of the estimated trend, the real wage, and cyclical move-
ments in the output ratio. The total shown in columns (4), (8), and    (12)
 refers is for the fitted value of the equations from Table 2. Recall that the
post—1972 trend effect is the sum of columns (3) and (4) in Table 2, with the
signs reversed, as written out in equation (27).
     A novel aspect of these results concerns the nonmanufacturing sectors of
the U. S. and Japan. The U. S. displays no slowdown in trend productivity
growth after 1972 in nonmanufacturing, despite the slowdown evident in the raw
data. This occurs because the equation explains almost all of the post-1973
productivity growth slowdown as a response to a shift from positive excess
real wage growth during 1964—72 to negative excess real wage growth in both
periods after 1972. This effect of the time path of the real wage on U. S.
productivity growth has received remarkably little discussion in the fruitless
U. S. literature on the productivity slowdown puzzle. A similar phenomenon
occurs in Japan, where real wage moderation after 1979 in nonmanufact,uring has
the effect of cancelling out the positive post—1972 trend, leaving the fitted
rate of productivity growth in nonmanufacturing exactly zero for 1979-84.
    This approach attributes all of the slowdown in European productivity
growth after 1979 to the real wage and cyclical effects, in roughly equal
proportions in manufacturing, and with a larger role for real wage moderation
in the aggregate and nonmanufacturing sectors. The contrast between European
and U. S. manufacturing during the 1979-84 period is particularly striking,

with U. S. manufacturing managing to achieve above-trend productivity growth
as a result of excess real wage growth and a transitory cyclical effect (due
to rapid output growth in 1983-4), while in European manufacturing actual
productivity growth was below trend as a result of real wage moderation and a
negative cyclical effects.

  Trends    in Output, Productivity, and Hours

          Table   4 brings together the assumed trend growth rates of output (based
on the benchmark years 1961, 1972, and 1979, as explained on p. 20—21 above)
with the estimated trend growth in productivity. Unlike those in Table 3, the
productivity trends in Table 4 are obtained from estimates of equation (26) in
which the real wage effects are omitted. These trends can be interpreted as
incorporating a cyclical adjustment but no decomposition of the portion of the
productivity trend attributable to real wage movements. When (26) is re-
estimated without the real wage variable, the third dummy variable represent-
ing the post—1979 slowdown becomes significant for the aggregate and nonmanu—
facturing sectors of Europe (these regression results are omitted to save
space).
     The purpose of Table 4 is to shed some light on the sources of the
divergent movements of European unemployment rate from the unemployment rates
of the U. S. and Japan. The counterpart of rising unemployment is, of course,
slow or negative growth in labor hours. Obviously some part of the European
unemployment problem results from output falling below trend, with log output
ratios in Europe for 1984 of —8.5 percent for the aggregate, -11.1 percent for
manufacturing, and —7.8 percent for nonmanufacturing.
     But it is also possible to look at the implications for labor hours of

the underlying trends in output and productivity. Taken together, the output
and productivity growth trends imply trends for labor input, shown in columns
 (3), (6), and (9) of Table 4. Aggegate European trend hours fell in both
periods before 1979 and actually rose slightly in the l980s, but at a much
slower rate than in the U. S. or Japan. However, the European aggregate
disguises sharply divergent hours trends in manufacturing and nonmanufac—
turing. The real European problem is low growth in manufacturing output in
relation to a much higher rate of productivity growth. In nonmanufacturing
European trend hours growth on average since 1972 has been about equal to that
in Japan.
     Table 4 places an interesting perspective on the U. S. phenomenon of
rapid hours growth. Part of the U. S. difference from Europe stems from a
lower decline in hours per employee (at a rate of about —0.25 percent per year
as contrasted with —0.9 percent per year since 1972). However, most stems
from faster employment growth. One can view the U. S. success in achieving
rapid employment growth, however, as the counterpart of its dismal produc-
tivity record. One can calculate that if the U. S. had achieved the existing
growth rate of output in 1979-84 but had combined it with European trend
productivity growth, the U. S. would have had 8 percent fewer hours of labor
input, or 9 million additional unemployed (ignoring effects on labor force
participation and hours per employee).

                  V. ESTIMA TED WA GE AND PRICE EQUA TIONS

  Equations for Wage Change
     We now turn to estimates of the equation for wage change, specified as in
                                       Productivity, Wages, and Prices, Page 34


(19) above on p. 23. For variables where a string of lagged values are
entered, only the sum of coefficients is exhibited in Table 5, as in Table 2
above. Asterisks designate the significance of coefficients or sums of
coefficients.
     Two estimates of the wage equation are presented in Table 5 for each
sector within each country. The first omits the "excess real wage growth"
dummy variables and freely estimates the coefficients on lagged price change.
The second includes the dummy variables and constrains the sum of coefficients
on lagged price change to be unity, so the dependent variable is in the form
of real wage growth adjusted for the estimated productivity trend.
     We discuss first the results of the first version of the wage equation,
presented as the first line of each pair.   Some of the coefficients on lagged
inflation are below unity and some are above. If "excess real wage growth"
occurs but no dummies are included, then the excess growth in the nominal wage
rate relative to price change is likely to be picked up by a coefficient of
greater than unity on the price change variable. This occurs in the U. S.
aggregate and nonmanufacturing, and in all three sectors for Europe.
     The coefficients on the output ratio are generally positive and highly
significant, supporting the Phillips curve hypothesis of a relation between
the change in the wage rate and the level of a cyclical variable. Note that,
because the current and one lagged output ratio term are included, the
specification could reveal either a "level effect" (a positive sum of coef-
ficients) or a "rate of change effect" (a positive current coefficient
followed by an equal and negative lagged coefficient, with a zero sum of
coefficients). Only in U. S. manufacturing and Japanese nonmanufacturing is

the sum of coefficients insignificant in both versions of the wage equation,
and in neither case does an insignificant sum of coefficients disguise a rate
of change effect.
     The sum of coefficients on the output ratio is an important indicator of
nominal wage rigidity. The theme in the literature supporting a greater
degree of wage rigidity in the U. S. than in Europe or Japan is supported here
only for manufacturing. In nonmanufacturing the output response of wage rates
is actually greater in the U. S. than in either Japan or Europe, resulting in
an aggregate response that is not appreciably smaller than in Europe and a bit
greater than in Japan.
     The wage equations also include the change in the real import price and
in the total tax rate. The import price terms have the correct positive sign
but are generally insignificant, except in U. S. and European manufacturing.
The tax terms almost always have the incorrect (negative) sign, with a
significant positive coefficient only in U. S. manufacturing, and significant
negative coefficients in the Japanese and European aggregate equations. Thus
these results deny the existence of a significant "tax push" effect that is
responsible for driving up real wage rates and in this sense conflict with the
hypothesis advanced by Tullio (1987) in this volume and with results of
Knoester and van der Wiridt (1985).
     Turning now to the coefficients displayed in column (8) of Table 5, the
wage push dummy variables for Japan and Europe have large and significant
coefficients. As an example, the coefficient for the Japanese aggregate
economy indicates that in 1973—74 wage rates increased 13 percent more p
year than can be explained by the other variables, and for Europe in 1968-70
                                        Productivity, Wage8, and Prices, Page 36


wage rates increased 3.6 percent more per year than the other variables ables
 can explain. The wage controls dummy variables are significant for the U. S.
aggregate economy, but not for manufacturing and nonmanufacturing separately.
     The second line of each pair of results displays a version of the wage
equation in which the sum of coefficients on lagged inflation is constrained
to be unity, and the "excess real wage growth" dummy variables are included
(see columns (5), (6), and (7)). These coefficients are almost all insigni-
ficant, except for a large negative coefficient in Japanese manufacturing
after 1972, and a positive coefficient in European nonmanufacturing for the
entire period. Of particular importance are the small and uniformly insigni-
ficant set of excess real wage growth dummy variables for the European
aggregate economy and for the manufacturing sector, denying the importance of
real wage rigidity, and calling attention instead to wage push during 1968—70
(column 8) as the sole source of a "real wage problem" in Europe. Also
important for the interpretation of the European unemployment problem is the
absence of a significantly positive coefficient for 1980—84, as would be
required to confirm the hypothesis that high unemployment in Europe did not
hold down wage changes as much as would have been predicted from pre—1980
behavior. The interpretation of the 1980—84 period receives more attention in
our discussion of the "hysteresis" hypothesis below.

 lag), the output ratio (current and one lag), the current rate of change of
 relative import prices, the two—year change in the total tax rate, and the
 single dummy variable for wage push or controls. To validate the original
 theoretical specification in (13), the output ratio should enter as a first
 difference, that is, the coefficient on the current output ratio should be
positive and on the lagged output ratio should be equal in absolute value and
negative in sign.
     The results appear to contradict the hypothesis of a procyclical price
markup. Of the nine lines in Table 6, seven indicate a negative sum of
coefficients on the output ratio (with four of the seven sums significant),
indicating a perverse Phillips curve phenomenon that offsets part of the
positive Phillips curve effect in the wage change equations. This can be
interpreted as suggesting that in an open economy in which competition from
abroad limits the short—run flexibility of prices, a demand expansion that
raises the output ratio and the rate of wage change is reflected only partly
in price change, resulting in a positive growth rate of the real wage. Such a
result implies procyclical rather than countercyclical real wage behavior, but
refers to the rate of change of the real wage rather than its level. Five
sums of coefficients in column (2) of Table 6 are insignificantly different
from zero, and in no case does this reflect any significant zig—zag from a
positive to a negative coefficient, as would be implied by a rate-of-change
effect of the business cycle on the change in the markup.
    The other coefficients in Table 6 imply that the elasticity of price
change to the change in trend unit labor cost is close to unity within the
current and subsequent year. Import price changes are insignificant, except
                                       Productivity, Wages, and Prices, Page 38


in the nonmanufacturing sector for the U. S. A positive and significant tax
push effect occurs only for the Japanese aggregate economy. Finally, the
wage—push and controls dummies are uniformly insignificant, indicating that
for Japan and Europe the wage—push episodes raised wages but did not squeeze
profits, leaving the markup unaffected.

  Reduced-form     Inflation Equations

        Together   the wage and price mark—up equations imply the reduced—form
equation for price change written above as (21). This relates the current
inflation rate to two lags of the inflation rate, the current and lagged
output ratio, the current change in the import price, the two—year change in
the tax rate, and the same wage—push and control dummies discussed before.
Table 7 presents the results of estimating (21).
     The reduced—form equation is critical for determining the overall nominal
flexibility of an economy. Flexibility in the form of a high positive
coefficient on the output ratio in the wage change equation means little if it
is offset by a high negative coefficient on the output ratio in the price
mark-up equation. Column (2) of Table 7 indicates that there are significant
Phillips curve effects of the level of the output ratio in the reduced—form
inflation equation in six of the nine sectors. Only in U. S. manufacturing
and in both Japanese disaggregated sectors is there no significant Phillips
curve effect. At the aggregate level the sum of coefficients on the output
ratio is significant for all three economies in the relatively narrow range of
0.30 for the U. S., 0.37 for Europe, and 0,45 for Japan. Thus Table 7
conflicts with previous claims that Europe exhibits significantly greater
nominal flexibility than the U. S. Table 7 confirms the verdict of Table 5

that nominal rigidity is limited to U. S. manufacturing, but nominal flexibil-
ity in U. S. nonmanufacturing is almost as great as in European nonmanufactur—
ing.
       The other coefficients displayed in Table 7 can be compared with the
parallel coefficients in Table 5 for the wage change equations. The coef-
ficients on the relative import price change term are all significantly
positive for the aggregate and manufacturing sectors of the U. S. and Europe
and are of plausible magnitudes. The insignificance of the import price
coefficients for Japan may reflect the much—discussed absence of manufactured
imports and of an import—competing sector.
       The estimated controls coefficients in column (8) for the U. S. aggregate
economy are similar to but less significant than those in my recent paper
(1985) on the behavior of the U. S. inflation rate in quarterly data. For
Japan the 1973—74 wage—push phenomenon was almost entirely reflected in faster
inflation in the manufacturing sector, while in nonmanufacturing about one—
quarter of the "push" was not reflected in faster inflation but rather
(implicitly) in a profit squeeze. As for Europe, the reduced—form coeffi-
cients imply a 8ignficant acceleration of inflation in 1968—70 which was
roughly equal to the magnitude of the wage-push effect in the wage equation.

  The Outpt Sacrifice Ratio
          A useful measure of an economy's nominal rigidity is its "output sacri-
fice ratio," a concept originally applied to a hypothetical reduction in
nominal GNP growth intended permanently to slow the rate of inflation. The
ratio is defined as the cumulative output loss (expressed as a percent of one
year's GNP) following a hypothetical nominal GNP deceleration, divided by the
                                          Productivity, Wages, and Prices, Page 40


permanent reduction in the inflation rate which is achieved. For instance,
the U. S. disinflation of the 1980s can be described as involving (roughly) a
five percent permanent reduction in nominal GNP growth, a five percent
permanent reduction of the inflation rate, and a cumulative output loss equal
to 30 percent of a year's GNP, for an output sacrifice ratio of 6.0 (30/5).
     Of course the sacrifice ratio concept can be applied in reverse to the
issue of reflation. Starting from a situation of a low output ratio and low
inflation, how much output would be gained from an acceleration of nominal GNP
growth, and at what cost in the form of permanently higher inflation? The
wage—price model developed in this paper can be simulated to calculate the
sacrifice ratio implied by the estimated coefficients. When the reduced—form
equations of Table 7 are used, the simulations are particularly straight-
forward, consisting of a two—equation model. The first equation is the
reduced-form equation relating inflation to lagged inflation and the current
and lagged output ratio (the relative import price change, tax change, and
wage—push dummy variables are all set to zero). The sum of coefficients on
lagged inflation is constrained to sum to unity, and no other dummy variables
or constants are included. The second equation is the identity that defines
this year's log output ratio as equal to last year's ratio, plus the current
growth rate of nominal GNP, minus the current inflation rate, minus the growth
rate of natural (i.e., trend) real GNP.
     The simulations are calculated for the 20-year period from 1985 to 2004.
The growth rate of nominal GNP is initially set at the growth rate of natural
real GNP plus the 1984 inflation rate, and the two-equation model is simulated
to determine the output ratio and inflation rate over the 20—year period when
                                       Productivity, Wages, and Prices, Page 41


the growth rate of nominal GNP is set permanently at this initial level. Then
an alternative simulation is run in which the growth rate of nominal GNP is
set permanently at a rate 5 percent higher than the initial level.
     Table 8 exhibits the average inflation rates over the 20 year period in
each simulation, the cumulative values of the output ratio, and the implied
output sacrifice ratio. The line labelled "reduced form" describes the
experiment described above, and the line labelled "wage—price model" describes
the analogous experiment using a three—equation model consisting of the wage
equation from Table 5, the price mark—up equation from Table 6, and the
identity defining the current output ratio.
     It is important to note that these simulations maintain at zero the
changes in the relative import price terms that enter into the wage and price
equations. Thus the expansion of nominal GNP growth is implicitly assumed to
take the form of a mixed monetary and fiscal policy stimulus that maintains
the value of the real exchange rate. Sacrifice ratios calculated for a
monetary expansion with the exchange rate endogenous tend to yield a smaller
output sacrifice, since the exchange rate depreciation resulting from a
monetary stimulus would tend to accelerate inflation faster and reduce the
remaining amount of the extra nominal GNP growth available to support real
output growth.
     The sacrifice ratios displayed in Table 8 for the U. S. are 6.5 for the
reduced—form inflation equation and 6.6 for the separate wage and markup
equations. These compare to sacrifice ratios in Gordon (1985) of about 8 with
no import price feedback, and of about 4.5 with an endogenous foreign price
feedback. As might be expected, the sacrifice ratios for Japan are much

smaller than for the U. S. Finally, the sacrifice ratio implied by the
reduced form equation for Europe is 4.8, only moderately below that for the
U. S., and for the separate wage and markup equations is actually 13.5, much
higher than that for the U. S.'°

  The "Hysteresis" Hypothesis
     The last topic of the paper is the "hysteresis" hypothesis, which states
that the natural rate of unemployment is "path dependent," that is, is not
independent of the evolution of the actual unemployment rate but rather
responds with a lag to the path of the actual unemployment rate. In this
paper, which focusses on the equivalent concepts of the natural level of
output and the log output ratio, the hysteresis hypothesis states that the
natural level of output evolves not along a log—linear trend but with a lagged
response to the actual path of output. If valid, this hypothesis would have
the important policy implication that the output slump in Europe in the 1980s
has reduced the natural level of output, gradually eliminating slack to the
point that there is no longer any further downward pressure on wage changes."
     Our test of the hysteresis approach can be illustrated in a simplified
version of the wage equation included here for expository purposes only:

     (28)      we — pt—i    o+     cxii(Qt   —
                                                 Q*t) + i2(Qt—1 — Q*t_i),

                             ao +   cii(Qt       —
                                                     Q*t) + (c1i+cx12)(Qt—1   —
                                                                                  Qtt_i)


where   once again upper—case letters designate logs of levels, and both the
current and one lagged value of the output ratio are included in the wage
equation to accord with our basic specification reported ire Table 5. The
second line of (28) restates the role of the output ratio as entering through
                                             Productivity, Wages, and Prices, Page 43


 the current difference (A) and the lagged level.
      Let us assume that the unobservable natural output level (Q*t) is some
 unknown weighted average of the linear trends of Table 3 (QTt) and a hyster-
esis term (QHt) equal to a three—year moving average of actual output:

      (29)     Q1t     PQEt + (1—P)QTt.


To identify the i' parameter, we substitute (29) into the lagged level term
(28), while assuming that in the difference term Q*t          QTt.   Rearranging, we
obtain:

      (30)     wt — pt—i       xo + cxiiA(Qt — QTt) + (c11+a12)(Qt_1 —   QTt—i)

                           —
                                (11+c(I2)14s(QHt_l — QTt_j)


     The hysteresis coefficients (P) listed in Table 9 are obtained by running
the wage change equations from Table 5 and the reduced—form price change
equations from Table 7 again with the addition of the lagged (Q5t -               QTt)   term,
where Q5t is defined as a trend—adjusted three—year moving average:

     (31)              [Qt + (l+qTt_i)Qt_j + (l+2qTt_2)Qt_l]/3,

where a lower—case q refers to the growth rate of the output trend for the
year in question. The most important finding in Table 9 is that the hyster-
esis coefficients are insignificant for the wage change equation, except in
U. S. and Japanese manufacturing, and in the reduced—form price change
equation except in U. S. nonmanufacturing and the Japanese aggregate sectors.
In Europe, where the problem of high unemployment stimulated the development
of the hysteresis hypothesis, the 4' coefficients are uniformly insignificant.

        Because the statistical insignificance of the hysteresis effect for
 Europe conflicts with most of the recent literature, particularly Blanchard—
Summers (1986) and Sachs (1986), we have conducted further te8ts to assess its
importance. First, we display four time series for the European aggregate
covering the period 1979—84, including the log output ratio defined alter-
 natively relative to the 1972—84 trend (Qt —   and relative to the hyster-
                                                 QTt)

esis concept of the natural rate (Qt — Qt), as well as the dependent vari-
ables of the price change (Pt) and wage change (wt — et) equations:

Thu8 the hysteresis version of the log output ratio in the second column
indicates that slack in Europe had almost disappeared by 1984, in contrast to
the GNP gap of 8.5 percent implied by the output ratio measured relative to
the 1972—84 trend.
     Since the estimated hysteresis coefficients in Table 9 do not provide a
statistically significant measure of the hysteresis coefficient ($) for
Europe, another alternative is to estimate separate wage change and reduced—
form price equations using the two concepts of the log output ratio (Qt —     QTt
and Qt — Qt)   as alternatives. The standard errors for the alternative
                                       Productivity, Wages, and Prices, Page 45


are:

       Using Qt —   QHt                      1.03      1.56


The first line corresponds precisely to the unconstrained results for the
European aggregate economy in Tables 7 and 5, respectively. The second line
uses the alternative hysteresis concept of the output ratio (Qt — QUt in place
of Qt — QTt) for the full 1964—84 period. The results indicate a mixed
verdict. The hysteresis version of the log output ratio performs slightly
better in the reduced—form price change equation but much worse in the wage
change equation. Since most theoretical justifications of the hysteresis
concept are based on labor market behavior and the presumed failure of wage
rates to adjust to labor market slack, these results raise serious questions
about the validity of the hysteresis hypothesis for Europe in the 19808.12
       What is the implied natural rate of unemployment predicted by our concept
of the log output ratio based on the 1972-84 output trend? To calculate this
implication of the results, an Okun's Law equation was estimated for 1964—79
which regresses the unemployment gap (defined relative to an assumed natural
rate of unemployment series linearly interpolated between the actual values of
1961, 1972, and 1979) on the current and one lagged value of the log output
ratio. The forecast values of the unemployment gap for 1980-84, given the
actual values of the output ratio, allow us to calculate the implied natural
rate of unemployment as the actual value of the unemployment rate minus the
forecast unemployment gap:

The natural rate of unemployment series implied by our log output ratio thus
does not remain fixed at the 1979 level, but rather rises from 5.0 percent in
1979 to 6.4 percent in 1984. Nevertheless, based on the Okun's law relation-
ship of unemployment and output gaps in Europe prior to 1980, the 1984 output
gap of —8.5 percent implies an unemployment gap of 3.5 percent.    Further, the
estimated 1984 natural rate of unemployment for Europe, 6.4 percent, is
roughly the same as the 6.0 percent rate for the U. S. estimated in Gordon
(1985).


                                 V. CONCLUSION

     The primary theme of the paper is that the previous literature has
greatly exaggerated the contrast between the cyclical behavior of labor
productivity, wage rates, and price deflators in the U. S. and Europe. Most
important, the evidence that the U. S. exhibits more nominal rigidity than
Europe is confined to manufacturing. In the aggregate economy and in nonmanu
facturing the coefficients on the output ratio in the wage equations for the
U. S. and Europe are roughly similar. The same similarity arises in the
                                       Productivity, Wages, and Prices, Page 47


reduced—form inflation equations for the U. S. and Europe. In Japan the
familiar result of greater nominal flexibility appears only in the aggregate
reduced—form price equation, but not for the two sub—sectors or for the wage
equations. Calculated output sacrifice ratios confirm the conclusion that
nominal wage rigidity in the U. S. 18 greater than in Japan, but no greater
than in Europe, at least for the aggregate economy. Thus these results
undermine the case frequently made against demand expansion in Europe on the
ground that a uniquely vertical European aggregate supply curve would cause
such an expansion to cause only extra inflation with no bonus of extra output.
The sacrifice ratio calculation indicates that substantial extra output would
be generated by a nominal demand expansion, albeit with an acceleration of
inflation (just as would occur in the U. S. with a similar demand expansion).
     The behavior of real wages also receives a new interpretation in this
paper. Perhaps most important, the symmetric treatment of the self—employed,
with both their income and their labor hours included in measures of labor
compensation, labor's share, and the "wage gap" index, completely eliminates
the secular uptrend in the wage gap indexes for Japan and Europe that have
been so evident in previous research. Further, the frequent claim that real
wages are more rigid in Europe than in the U. S. now requires reinterpreta-
tion. In 1984 the European wage gap was lower than the U. S. wage gap in
manufacturing but higher in nonmanufacturing), creating problems for classical
interpretations of unemployment in Europe where most of the observed decline
in employment has occurred in manufacturing. If anything, real wages in
Europe and Japan were too flexible rather than too rigid, in the sense that
much of the increase in the wage gap indexes in Europe during 1968-70 and in
                                        Productivity, Wages, and Prices, Page 48


Japan during 1973—74 can be interpreted as autonomous wage push. The com-
ponent of the higher wage gap that can be attributed to the failure of real
wages to adjust to the post-1972 productivity growth slowdown is relatively
small.
     Finally, the paper contains new results on productivity behavior that are
of independent interest, outside of the context of the controversy over real
and/or nominal rigidity. The paper confirms the real-wage elasticity of labor
input emphasized in several recent papers, but shows that the response of
labor input and labor productivity to changes in the real wage is roughly
similar in the three countries, rather than being especially high in Europe.
The results have the interesting implication that a substantial component of
the slowdown in productivity growth, especially after 1972 in U. S. nonmanu-
facturing and after 1979 in Japan and Europe, can be attributed to a shift
from excessive to moderate real wage growth. Finally, the paper finds no
evidence to support those who have claimed that productivity exhibits a
countercyclical response in Europe in contrast to a procyclical response in
the U. S. There is a slight procyclical response of productivity to changes
in the output ratio that is almost identical in the U.S. and Europe, in
contrast to a more marked procyclical response in Japan.

     2. Canada is also omitted, since we saw no point in constructing a
"North American" aggregate that would be totally dominated by the U. S.

     3. This model was first developed in Gordon (1977b) and was recently
applied to the U. S. economy in Gordon (1985). The version set out here uses
a different definition of the wage rate (gross of all employment taxes) and
also solves out the consumer price index term that appears in previous
versions of the model.



     4. The LSE data base, as described by Grubb (1986), contains hourly
earnings only for manufacturing, and not always on a consistent base. Data
for Australia and Norway are for males only, data for the U. S. include
production worker8 only, data for Austria, Belgium, Denmark, and Sweden
include mining, data for Belgium includes transport, and data for Spain
include all industries.

     5. This unpublished series was provided by John Martin of the OECD. All
other series for the aggregate sector were obtained from an OECD PC data
diskette. The manufacturing data were transcribed manually from printouts
provided by the IMF in May, 1985 and include manufacturing value-added
deflators, output, compensation, employment, and hours for the fourteen
countries identified in footnote 2. The compilation of the manufacturing data
is described in the data appendix of Artus (1984). A critical step in the
development of the data base was the location of data on the absolute value of
each variable (particularly nominal output, nominal compensation, and labor
hours) for the aggregate economy in 1972, in order to allow subtraction of
manufacturing values from aggregate values to obtain the needed residual
values.

     6. For a discussion of alternative methods of imposing structure on wage
and price equations within this context, see Blanchard (1986). In some of his
quarterly wage equations Blanchard imposes the structural assumption that the
coefficient on the current price change in the wage equation cannot be higher
than a specified amount, e.g., 0.3.

     7. Exceptions to this procedure are that 1984 is used as a benchmark
year for Japan to take account of highly different growth rates of output
during 1979—84 in manufacturing versus nonmanufacturing. Also, since 1961 was
a recession year in North America, the first benchmark is 1964 in Canada and
the U. S., and also in France. The 1961—64 growth rate of natural output for
these countries is assumed to be equal to the observed 1964—72 growth rate.

    8. The price change equations I have estimated for the U. S. over the
years, as in Gordon (1985), include a productivity deviation (—') term to
measure the proportion of price setting behavior based on actual as opposed to
trend productivity growth. The estimated proportion is usually in the range
of 0.15 to 0.20. This productivity deviation term is not included in the
price equations estimated in this paper, thus imposing the restriction that
price changes depend only on trend productivity growth with no role for actual
productivity growth.

     9. The Japanese anamoly cannot be explained away by disguised unemploy-
ment, since the annual growth rate of labor hours in the aggregate Japanese
economy actually accelerated after 1979 when the wage gap index was at its
highest (annual growth rates were 0.43 percent during 1960—72, 0.29 percent
during 1972—79, and 0.86 percent during 1979—84).

     10. The wage—markup model for Europe is prone to oscillations, due to
the fact that virtually the entire positive cyclical effect of the output
ratio on the rate of wage change occurs with a one—year lag. The results
displayed in Table 8 were obtained by constraining the current and one—year
lagged coefficients on the output ratio to be equal. This constraint reduces
the sum of coefficients on the output ratio only from 0.62 to 0.56 and raises
the standard error of the estimated equation only from 1.25 to 1.28.

     11. Empirical evidence supporting the hysteresis hypothesis for Europe
is presented by Blanchard and Summers (1986) and for France by Sachs and
Wyplosz (1985). Policy implications are analyzed by Sachs (1986).

     12. In the sub—sectors the results are also mixed. In the manufacturing
sector, which has previously been the primary focus of proponents of the
hysteresis hypothesis, the use of the alternative Qt — Qt concept of the
output ratio unambiguously worsens the fit of the wage equation (standard
error of estimate rises from 1.82 to 2.28) and of the reduced—form price
equation (standard error rises from 1.46 to 1.94). In the nonmanufacturing
sector, however, the hysteresis concept Qt — QNe reduces the standard errors
from 1.50 to 1.36 and 1.31 to 1.10, respectively.

Hours Worked
     Aggregate hours worked per employee per year, from John P. Martin, at the
     OECD, covering the period through 1982 or 1983, depending on the country.
     Updated to 1984 using the Yearbook of Labour Statistics, 1985 published by
     the ILO, using the growth rate of weekly hours worked, except for Canada,
     Germany, Netherlands, and Norway, where it wasn't needed. No change was
     assumed for Italy. Since no data were available for Austria, Switzerland
     and Denmark, the hours for Germany were used for Austria and
     Switzerland, and the hours for Norway were used for Denmark.
Employment
     Total employment, taken from Labour Force Statistics, 1963-83 (OECD).
     Updated to 1984 using for most countries from Quarterly Labour Force
     Statistics, No. 4 1985 (OECD) country pages, except for Denmark and
     Netherlands, for which we used the Yearbook of Labour Statistics, 1985
     (ILO), and Belgium, which was guessed to have 1% growth from the OECD
     Economic Outlook description in December 1984.
Entrepreneurial Income
    Taken from the National Accounts, Vol. II (OECD), various issues, from the
    old table 6, line 4.1, through 1981, and from the new table 8, line 5, after
    1981.

Employment Tax
    Employment tax rate paid by firms, from Andrew Newell, Centre for Labour
    Economics, Working Paper 781, series Ti.
Income Tax
    Average rate of income tax paid, from Andrew Newell, Centre for Labour

     Economics, Working Paper 781, series T2.
Natural Real GDP
     Geometric interpolation between the benchmark years 1960, 1972, and 1979,
     with post—1979 using the same growth rate as for 1972—79. For Japan we
     used the benchmark years 1960, 1972, 1979, and 1984. For the US, Canada
     and France, where output was at or near a cyclical trough in 1960, we used
     the years 1964, 1972, and 1979, with the growth rate for 1964—72 used to
     extrapolate natural real GNP backwards from 1964 to 1960.


2. The Manufacturing Sector
All data were taken from an IMF unpublished quarterly data printout. Sources
and methods are given in the appendix of Artus (1984).


Real Output
     Heal domestic manufacturing output.
Wages
     Hourly compensation in manufacturing.
Total Hours
     Total hours in manufacturing.
Employment
     Total number of employees in manufacturing.


Value Added Deflator
     The valus added deflator for manufacturing.

 3. The Nonmanufacturing Sector
Variables for the nonmanufacturing sector were calculated by taking the absolute
magnitudes of the series for the aggregate economy and subtracting the
corresponding absolute figure for the manufacturing sector. Since the
manufacturing series were all in index form, the real magnitudes for
manufacturing had to be determined from various sources for a particular base
year (1972 was used throughout except where specified):


Manufacturing Output In Current Dollars
     Manufacturing output as a percentage of GDP was taken from Historical
     Statistics 1960—83 (OECD), p. 59, table 5.3. Since this number was not
     available for Switzerland, the manufacturing output ratio was taken to be
     equal to the proportion of civilian employment involved in manufacturing,
     from the same source, p. 37, table 2.11.
Manufacturing Employment
    Total civilian manufacturing employment was taken from Labour Force
    Statistics, 1963-83 (OECD) in the country tables for Breakdown by
    Activities. The series for France, Italy and the Netherlands were obtained
    from the Yearbook of Labor Statistics, 1980 (ILO) in the series Employment
    in Manufacturing.
Total Manufacturing Hours
    This was calculated by taking hours per employee per year for the
    aggregate sector in 1972, and then modifying it to obtain manufacturing
    hours per employee per year by multiplying it by the ratio of manufacturing
    hours per week divided by non—agricultural hours per week for 1970,
                                                        Data Appendix, Page 5


    obtained from the Compendium of Social statistics: 1977 (United Nations).
    This was then multiplied by 1972 manufacturing employment (determined
    above) to obtain total hours for manufacturing in 1972. This number is
    then multiplied by the index series of total manufacturing hours to obtain a
    series for nominal manufacturing manhours. Subtracting this series from
    absolute aggregate hour8 yields absolute nonmanufacturing hours.
Manufacturing Compensation
    To determine the absolute level of total compensation for the manufacturing
    sector for Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Japan, the United
    Kingdom, and the United States, the labor share of value added in
    manufacturing was obtained from Bruno and Sachs (1985, p. 162). For
    Austria, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland the labor
     share of value added in the aggregate economy was used as a proxy.
