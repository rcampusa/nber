1    Introduction
With the aging of the population, the proportion of voters eligible to receive old-age social
security has increased, and these pensions are by far the largest component of transfers in all
industrial economies. Indeed, in the rich countries, the ratio of people of working age to those
over 65, currently about four to one, is expected to fall in half by the year 2030. This paper
examines the implication of this ongoing increase in the size of the social security/transfer
system for the welfare state, focusing particularly on the relationship between aging of the
population and the tax rates and benefits involved in the welfare state.
       Data for the United States and 12 Western European countries from 1965 to 1992
show a negative correlation between the dependency ratio and two measures of the size of
the welfare state, namely the tax rate on labor income and the generosity of social transfers.
This is the case after controlling for other factors that would be expected to influence the
size of the welfare state. This is a puzzle, as it might have been expected that countries with
larger shares of dependent populations would have higher taxes and more generous social
transfers reflecting the increased political power of the retired population.
       We provide an explanation using a simple theoretical model in which the extent of
taxes and social transfers between the working age population and the retired is endogenously
determined by voting. The political economy equilibrium is determined as a balance between
those who gain and those who lose from a more extensive tax-transfer policy. The aging of the
population and the consequent increase in the dependency ratio aÔ¨Äects the political economy
balance in two directions: the greater number of retirees increases demand for benefits, but
at the same time reduces the willingness of the working age population to accede to higher
taxes and transfers, since current workers are net losers from the welfare state. We show
that the outcome of the model in which both workers and retirees vote on the level of taxes
and social benefits is that a higher dependency rate may well lead to an equilibrium with
lower taxes and transfers.
       Our conclusions are consistent with the standard theory of the determinants of the
size of government in a direct democracy, in which the size of government or the scope of
redistribution depends on pre-tax income inequality. Two economic interpretations have


                                               2
been used to explain this dependence. Lovell (1975) emphasizes the size of the government
as a provider of public goods, while others, notably Meltzer and Richard (1981), consider
the role of the government in redistributing income; see Persson and Tabellini (1999) for a
recent survey. In both applications, the size of government or the scope of redistribution
depends on a particular measure of the skewedness of the income distribution: the ratio of
the pre-tax median income to the pre-tax average income; this ratio represents the ‚Äúprice‚Äù
of collectively supplied goods in terms of private goods for the median voter. Our model
adds a new channel through which the size of government is determined, namely the eÔ¨Äect
of the ‚Äúfiscal leakage‚Äù that occurs in a pay-as-you-go social security system, in which current
workers are net contributors while the retired are net beneficiaries.1
        The results of this paper may shed light on the current debate over privatization of
the Social Security systems in the industrial countries. Privatization of social security is
typically conceived of as providing for individual-specific balances between total discounted
contributions and total discounted benefits. That is, the privatized system does not redis-
tribute income, but instead simply provides a publicly-run (and in some cases, mandatory)
mechanism for savings. Privatization would eliminate the payroll tax/transfer element of
national Social Security systems, cutting both the payroll tax burden and the size of public
transfers. Our model can thus explain the rising calls for privatization in light of the aging
of the population.
        The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 develops an overlapping-generations
model of human capital formation and derives the political-economy equilibrium tax-transfer
policy. Section 3 studies the eÔ¨Äects of changes in the dependency ratio on the equilibrium.
Section 4 presents empirical evidence, while Section 5 concludes.

     In a diÔ¨Äerent context (subsidies for farmers), Becker (1983) suggests a negative relationship between
group size and transfers per group member.

2    Tax-Transfer Policy in a Political-Economy Equilib-
     rium

Consider a standard overlapping-generations model in which each generation lives two pe-
riods: a working period and a retirement period. Following Saint-Paul (1994) and Razin
and Sadka (1995), we assume a stylized economy in which there are two types of workers:
skilled workers who have high productivity and provide one eÔ¨Éciency unit of labor per unit
of labor time, and unskilled workers who provide only q < 1 eÔ¨Éciency units of labor per unit
of labor time. Workers have one unit of labor time during their first period of life and an
endowment of K units of capital, but are born without skills and thus with low productivity.
Each worker chooses whether to acquire an education and become a skilled worker, or in-
stead remain unskilled. After the working period, individuals retire, with their consumption
funded by savings from their earnings and a government transfer discussed below.
       There is a continuum of individuals, characterized by an innate ability parameter,
e, which is the time needed to acquire an education. By investing e units of labor time in
education, a worker becomes skilled, after which the remaining (1 ‚àí e) units of labor time
provide an equal amount of eÔ¨Äective labor in the balance of the first period. Less capable
individuals require more time to become skilled and thus find education more costly in terms
of lost income (education is a full-time activity). We assume a positive pecuniary cost of
acquiring skills, Œ≥, which is not tax deductible. The cumulative distribution function of
innate ability is denoted by G(¬∑) with the support being the interval [0, 1]. The density
function is denoted by g = G0 .
       Suppose that the government levies a flat payroll tax to finance a flat grant, b. The
literature [e.g., Mirrlees (1971)] suggests that the best egalitarian income tax can be approx-
imated by a linear tax which consists of a flat rate, œÑ , and a lump-sum grant, b. The tax
rate and generosity of the grant are linked through the government‚Äôs budget constraint. In
a multi-period setting, this simple specification captures the spirit of a pay-as-you-go tax-
benefit (transfer) system. The features of the transfer can include a uniform per capita grant
(either in cash or in-kind, such as national health care), as well as age-related benefits such


                                              4
as old-age social security and medicare, or free public education.
        Given these assumptions, there exists a cutoÔ¨Ä level, e‚àó , such that those with education
cost parameter below e‚àó will invest in education and become skilled, while everyone else
remains unskilled. The cutoÔ¨Ä level is determined by the equality between the return to
education and the cost of education (including lost income):

        (1 ‚àí œÑ )w(1 ‚àí e‚àó ) = qw + Œ≥,

where w is the wage rate per eÔ¨Éciency unit of labor.
        Rearranging terms gives the cutoÔ¨Ä level for the education decision:



                                                             Œ≥
                                        e‚àó = 1 ‚àí q ‚àí               .                                     (1)
                                                         (1 ‚àí œÑ )w

        To obtain analytical results, we must use a specification in which factor prices are not
variable.2 Thus, for analytical tractability, we assume a linear production function in which
gross output, Y , is produced using labor, L, and capital, K:




                                          Y = wL+(1 + r)K,                                               (2)


        The wage rate, w, and the gross rental price of capital, 1 + r, are determined by the
marginal productivity conditions for factor prices (w = ‚àÇY /‚àÇL and 1 + r = ‚àÇY /‚àÇK) and
already substituted into the production function.3 The linearity of the production function
can arise as an equilibrium outcome through either international capital mobility or factor
price equalization in the presence of goods trade. For simplicity, the two types of labor are
assumed to be perfect substitutes in production in terms of eÔ¨Éciency units of labor input,
and capital is assumed to fully depreciate at the end of the production process.

   2
     Razin, Sadka, and Swagel (1998) considers a related model with variable factor returns, but the solution
requires numerical simulations.
   3
     The fixed factor price assumption and the period-by-period budget balancing in the pay-as-you-go tax-
transfer system break the links between generations that do not overlap. In this way, our intertemporal
model becomes essentially isomorphic to a static atemporal model. This enables us to focus in a simple way
on the eÔ¨Äect of the dependency ratio on the tax-transfer system.


                                                     5
       We assume that the population grows at a rate of n. Since individuals work only in
the first period, the ratio of retirees to workers is 1/(1 + n), and the dependency ratio‚Äì
retired as a share of the total population‚Äìequals 1/(2 +n). Each individual‚Äôs labor supply is
assumed to be fixed, so that the income tax does not distort individual labor supply decisions
at the margin. The total labor supply does, however, depend on the income tax rate, as
this aÔ¨Äects the cut-oÔ¨Ä ability parameter e‚àó and thus the mix of skilled and unskilled in the
economy. In period t, the total labor supply is given by:


                                    ‚àó
                                Ret
                      Lt = { (1 ‚àí e)dG + q[1 ‚àí G(e‚àót )]}N0 (1 + n)t
                                0                                                         (3)
                           =   l(e‚àót )N0 (1   + n)t



where N0 (1 + n)t is the size of the working age population in period t (with N0 the number
                                                 R e‚àó
of young individuals n period 0), and l(e‚àót ) = 0t (1 ‚àí e)dG + q[1 ‚àí G(e‚àót )] is the average
(per worker) labor supply in period t. This specification implies that for each e and t, the
number of individuals in period t with an innate ability parameter less than or equal to e is
(1 + n)t times the number of such individuals in period 0.
       The government‚Äôs budget is balanced period by period. Since the income tax is levied
on labor income, the wage bill, wLt , constitutes the tax base. The cash grant is paid to both
workers and retirees, so that the government budget constraint implies:
                      bt N0 [(1 + n)t‚àí1 + (1 + n)t ] = œÑ t wLt
                                                          = œÑ t wl(e‚àót )N0 (1 + n)t
Therefore, the lump-sum grant equals:


                                bt = œÑ t wl(e‚àót )(1 + n)/(2 + n).                         (4)



       Note that if the transfer is paid only to the old, then in the political economy equi-
librium, the young who outnumber the old in a growing economy will drive the tax and
transfer down to zero. We may thus conjecture that ‚Äúbundling‚Äù together benefits to the
young and old is essential for establishing an incentive-compatible social contract or norm

                                                      6
in which the current young engage in redistribution to the old with the anticipation that
the future young will honor the ‚Äúcontract.‚Äù However, as this is not guaranteed, the current
young would like to receive some of the benefits up front. In reality, some bundling indeed
occurs. For example, the payroll social security tax serves to finance both old-age transfers
and unemployment benefits (and national health care in many countries).
        For any tax rate, œÑ , and population growth rate, n, equations (1) and (4) determine
e‚àót = e‚àó (œÑ t ) and bt = b(œÑ t , n) as functions of œÑ t and n. The population growth rate, n, is
exogenous, but we nevertheless write b as a function of n because we wish to explore the
eÔ¨Äect of changes in the rate of population growth, since changes in n translate directly (and
inversely) into changes in the dependency ratio.
        Denote by W (e, œÑ t , œÑ t+1 , n) the lifetime income of an individual born at period t with
ability parameter e. This is a strictly decreasing function of the innate ability parameter, e,
for the skilled worker; and constant for the unskilled worker. This function is given by:

        A young individual born in period t chooses her first- and second-period consumption

(c1t and c2t , respectively) to maximize lifetime utility, u(c1t , c2t ), subject to the lifetime
budget constraint, c1t + c2t /(1 + r) = W (e, œÑ t , œÑ t+1 , n).
        Second-period consumption of a retiree born in period t ‚àí 1 (that is, consumption of
a retiree in period t) is given by:




                                 c2,t‚àí1 (e) = St‚àí1 (e)(1 + r) + b(œÑ t , n),                    (6)



                                                        7
where St‚àí1 (e) denotes this individual‚Äôs savings in period t ‚àí 1.
        Since the government‚Äôs budget constraint is balanced period by period, it follows that
the transfer in period t + 1, b(œÑ t+1 , n), is independent of the tax rate œÑ t in period t. In voting
on the tax rate œÑ t , individuals living in period t therefore take b(œÑ t+1 , n) as exogenous,
because there is no serial correlation between b(œÑ t , n) and b(œÑ t+1 , n). The political economy
equilibrium for the tax rate, œÑ t , is then determined by majority voting of individuals alive
in period t, without being aÔ¨Äected by preceding or future generations.
        We therefore calculate the eÔ¨Äect of taxes on the income of any young individual
in order to find how she will vote on a proposed change in the tax rate. DiÔ¨Äerentiating
W (e, œÑ t , œÑ t+1 , n) with respect to e and œÑ t , we find that:


                                                   Ô£±
                         ‚àÇ W (e, œÑ t , œÑ t+1 , n) Ô£≤ w f or 0 ‚â§ e < e‚àó (œÑ t )

                                                                 t



         Therefore, if ‚àÇW/‚àÇœÑ > 0 for some eo , then ‚àÇW/‚àÇœÑ t > 0 for all e > eo . And,
similarly if ‚àÇW/‚àÇœÑ t < 0 for some eo , then ‚àÇW/‚àÇœÑ < 0 for all e < eo . This implies that if
an increase in the income tax rate benefits a particular young (working) individual (because
the higher tax rate can support a higher transfer), then all young individuals who are less
able (that is, those who have a higher innate ability parameter, e), must also gain from this
tax increase. Similarly, if an income tax increase hurts a certain young individual (because
the increased transfer does not fully compensate for the tax hike), then it must also hurt all
young individuals who are more able.
        So long as raising the tax rate in period t (that is, œÑ t ) generates more revenues and,
consequently, a higher grant in that period, b(œÑ t , n), it follows from (6) that the old (retirees)
in period t always opt for a higher tax rate in that period. As long as n > 0, it follows that
there are always more young (working) people than old (retired) people. These considerations
imply that the median voter‚Äìthe pivot in determining the outcome of majority voting‚Äìis a
young (working) individual. That is, the political equilibrium tax rate maximizes the lifetime


                                                    8
income of a young (working) individual and thus the lifetime income of the median voter.
       Denote the innate ability parameter of this median voter by eM . There are N0 (1 +
n)t G(eM ) young individuals with innate ability parameter e ‚â§ eM (more able than the
median voter), and N0 (1 + n)t [1 ‚àí G(eM )] young individuals with innate ability parameter
e ‚â• eM (less able than the median). There are also N0 (1 + n)t‚àí1 retired individuals in period
t who always join the pro-tax coalition. Hence, eM is defined implicitly by:

                N0 (1 + n)t G(eM ) = N0 (1 + n)t (1 ‚àí G(eM )) +N0 (1 + n)t‚àí1 .

Dividing this equation by N0 (1 + n)t‚àí1 and rearranging terms yields the innate ability pa-
rameter for the median voter:


                                                      ¬∑            ¬∏

                                   eM (n) = G                        .                     (7)
                                                          2(1 + n)

       As noted, the political equilibrium tax rate, œÑ , in period t [denoted by œÑ o (n)] maxi-
mizes the lifetime income of the median voter:




                               œÑ o (n) = arg max W [eM (n), œÑ , n].                        (8)
                                              œÑ



       For a given n, the political equilibrium œÑ is constant over time, so that the time
subscript t is suppressed henceforth. As œÑ t+1 is exogenous in period t, we likewise drop it
from the arguments of W .
       As indicated, œÑ o (n) is implicitly defined by the first-order condition:



                            ‚àÇW [eM (n), œÑ o (n), n]
                                                    = B[œÑ 0 (n), n] = 0,                   (9)
                                    ‚àÇœÑ

and the second-order condition is:




                                                  9
                               ‚àÇ 2 W [eM (n), œÑ o , n]

        Recalling equation (5), we can see that B(œÑ , n) depends on whether the median voter
is skilled or unskilled:

        In addition to the eÔ¨Äect of the population growth rate (and thus the dependency
ratio) on the political-economy equilibrium, the tax rate œÑ o (n) also depends on the median
income (IM ) versus the average income (IA ), as predicted by the standard models of the
determinants of the size of government. For example, in the case where the median voter is
an unskilled worker, B(œÑ , n) = 0 in the second part of equation (11) implies:




                                                        10

or

                                        ‚àÇœÑ

where IM = wq is the pre-tax median wage and IA [e‚àó (œÑ )] = l[e‚àó (œÑ )]/(2 + n) is the pre-tax
average taxable income. When there is no income inequality‚Äìthe limiting case with no old
and where G is concentrated around its mean, and hence IM = IA ‚Äìthe equilibrium tax rate
is zero since there can be no pro-tax coalition. As the median income is typically smaller
than the average income (IM ‚àí IA < 0), and since a labor tax is detrimental to labor supply
and pre-tax labor income (that is, ‚àÇIA /‚àÇœÑ < 0), it follows that the equilibrium tax rate is
positive [see also Meltzer and Richard (1981)].



3     The Dependency Ratio and the Tax Burden in the
      Political-Economy Equilibrium
We next examine the eÔ¨Äect of changes in the population growth rate and thus the dependency
ratio on the equilibrium.
       Total diÔ¨Äerentiation of (9) with respect to n implies:



                                    dœÑ o (n)    Bn [œÑ o (n), n]
                                             =‚àí                 .                              (13)
                                      dn        BœÑ [œÑ o (n), n]

Since BœÑ [œÑ o (n), n] 5 0 (see equation (10)), it follows that the direction of the eÔ¨Äect of changes
in n on the equilibrium tax rate, œÑ o , is determined by the sign of Bn [œÑ o (n), n].
       By diÔ¨Äerentiating equation (11) with respect to n, we conclude that:

         If the sign of Bn [œÑ o (n), n] is positive, then an increase in the rate of population growth,
n, raises the political-economy equilibrium tax rate, œÑ o , and consequently, the amount of the
per-capita transfer, b.4 Upon inspection of the right-hand side of (14), we can see that it
contains one term‚Äìwl{e‚àó [œÑ 0 (n)]}/(2 + n)2 )‚Äìwhich is positive, while the other terms are
negative (because deM /dn and de‚àó /dœÑ are both negative). Thus, the sign of Bn [œÑ o (n), n]
cannot be determined a priori. When this is positive, an increase in the population growth
rate (a decline in the dependency ratio) raises the political equilibrium tax rate and the
per capita transfer. Conversely, an increase in the dependency ratio lowers the political
equilibrium œÑ and b.
         The rationale for this result is as follows. Consider for concreteness the case in which
the median voter is a young, skilled individual (eM ‚â§ e‚àó ), and that the population growth
rate rises (the dependency ratio falls). In this case, there is a decline in the amount of tax
revenue collected from the median voter that ‚Äúleaks‚Äù to the retirees, who with the higher n
become a samller share of the population. This is an unambigously pro-tax factor. However,
the median voter now becomes more able (because deM /dn < 0), and therefore opts for a
lower tax and transfer. Moreover, the per-capita marginal eÔ¨Éciency cost of distortionary
               Œ≥ g{e‚àó [œÑ 0 (n)]} de‚àó
taxation, œÑ                          , rises as well, as can be seen in the last terms on the
            (1 ‚àí œÑ ) (2 + n)2 dœÑ
right-hand sides of (11) and (14).5 This is also an anti-tax factor. When the negative terms

   4
     Notice also that a higher n increases lifetime welfare of everyone in our pay-as-you-go tax-transfer system
(for given tax rates), because the transfers will be higher. See also Razin and Sadka (1999).
   5
     The eÔ¨Éciency cost of taxation arises because taxation distorts economic decisions. In our model, the
payroll tax distorts the decision on whether or not to acquire skills (the cutoÔ¨Ä e‚àó ) and reduces output. This


                                                      12
deM /dn and de‚àó /dœÑ are suÔ¨Éciently small, the pro-tax factor dominates the anti-tax factors
and dœÑ 0 /dn is positive. In this case, an increase in n (smaller dependency ratio) raises the
political equilibrium tax rate and per capita transfer.
        If the median voter is an unskilled worker, Bn [œÑ o (n), n] does not include the anti-
tax term deM /dn, because the change in the median voter toward a less able individ-
ual is of no consequence, as all of the unskilled have the same demand for redistribution
regardless of their innate ability parameter. If, furthermore, the distortionary element
     Œ≥ g{e‚àó [œÑ 0 (n)]} de‚àó
œÑ                          is suÔ¨Éciently small and q is large enough, then Bn [œÑ o (n), n] is
  (1 ‚àí œÑ ) (2 + n)2     dœÑ
positive.6 It then follows that an increase in the population growth rate (a decline in the
dependency ratio), raises the political equilibrium tax rate and the per capita transfer, œÑ
and b. Conversely, an increase in the dependency ratio lowers the political equilibrium tax
rate and transfer.
        We have so far assumed that n > 0, so that the median voter is a member of the
working-age population. For completeness, we will also consider briefly the case in which the
median voter is among the retired population. In our setup, this happens when n < 0. We
can see from (6) that the political-economy equilibrium tax rate in this case maximizes the
transfer, b(œÑ , n), since retirees‚Äô savings from the previous period are already determined. In
contrast, when the median voter was a member of the working-age population, the political-
economy equilibrium tax rate maximizes b(œÑ , n) plus another term‚Äìeither (1 ‚àí œÑ )w(1 ‚àí eM )
or (1 ‚àí œÑ )wq‚Äìwhich is decreasing in œÑ . Thus, the political-economy equilibrium tax rate
‚Äújumps‚Äù upward when the old become a majority; that is, as n switches from being positive
to being negative.
        This eÔ¨Äect is along the lines of the theory of Meltzer and Richard (1981), who attribute
the increase in the size of the welfare state to the spread of the right to vote (franchise), which
increased the number of voters with relatively low income and thus a natural incentive to vote
for higher taxes and transfers. The increase in the number of social security recipients has
an expansionary eÔ¨Äect similar to the extension of the franchise in expanding the size of the

approach one if q is suÔ¨Éciently large.

welfare state. Meltzer and Richard conclude that: ‚ÄúIn recent years, the proportion of voters
receiving social security has increased, raising the number of voters favoring taxes on wage
and salary income to finance redistribution. In our analysis the increase in social security
recipients has an eÔ¨Äect similar to an extension of the franchise.‚Äù However, if the median
voter is not among the retirees‚Äìas is probably still the case in all western countries‚Äìthen
the increased size of the non-working population may well lead to lower taxes and transfers,
as the median voter is adversely aÔ¨Äected because she is a net contributor to the welfare
system. These opposing eÔ¨Äects on the equilibrium tax rate and per capita transfer are next
examined empirically.



4       Empirical Evidence
We use data for the United States and 12 European countries over the period 1965 to
1992 to examine the relationship between the dependency ratio and the tax burden and the
generosity of social transfers.7 We show that the data are broadly consistent with the main
implications of the theory, but do not test the specific structural model of the theory. The
empirical results must thus be seen as only suggestive, particularly since the regressions do
not test against alternative mechanisms.
        We estimate regressions in which the dependent variables of the labor tax rate and
real per capita transfers are functions of the dependency ratio as suggested by our theory,
the measure of income skewedness suggested by the standard theory, and additional control
variables. These include government employment as a share of total employment to indicate
the breadth of government involvement in the economy, real GDP growth to control for
business cycle eÔ¨Äects, and a measure of openness to trade to capture exposure to external
shocks. Openness is included to address the hypothesis of Rodrik (1998) that a function
of the welfare state is to provide social insurance against the adverse eÔ¨Äects of external
shocks, so that larger governments would be expected to be found in more open economies.
Alternately, Alesina and Wacziarg (1998) suggest that the connection between openness and

    7
     The countries included are Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Nether-
lands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The working paper version of
this paper (2001) provides a more extensive summary of the data.

                                                  14
the size of government comes about indirectly through a size eÔ¨Äect, with small countries
being both more open than large countries and having larger government spending as a
share of national income (and thus higher taxes).
       The measure of income skewedness is the ratio of the income share of the top quintile
to the combined share of the middle three quartiles (‚Äúrich versus middle‚Äù). This corresponds
to the ratio of the mean income to the median income suggested by the standard theory. This
measure of income inequality is used in empirical tests of the standard theory because the
disproportionate share of income accruing to the upper quartile of the income distribution
ensures that the mean income is determined in large part by the income of those at the
top and thus exceeds the median income (for which consistent cross-country data are not
available).


4.1    Data Sources and Description

Data on the labor tax rate from 1965 to 1992 are from Mendoza, Razin, and Tesar (1995)
as extended by Mendoza, Milesi-Ferretti, and Asea (1996), and Daveri and Tabellini (2000);
these are derived by using revenue statistics to calculate an average tax rate on labor income.
The measures of income skewedness are derived from the updated inequality database of
Deininger and Squire (1996), which provides measures of income shares by quintile over time,
though data are not available for every year. Only the high quality measures in the database
are used, and the missing observations are then obtained through linear interpolation (the
shares do not vary all that much over time, though in most countries there is a general trend
toward increased inequality).
       The OECD Analytical Database is used to calculate measures of per capita GDP,
per capita transfers received by households, government employment as a share of total
employment, and openness to trade defined as the sum of the imports plus exports as a
share of GDP. The dependency ratio is defined as usual as one minus the labor force as a
share of the population. Per capita transfers include both social security and other transfers
such as unemployment and disability compensation, though social security payments are
by far the largest component of transfers in all countries. Transfers are deflated by each



                                              15
country‚Äôs CPI to provide real transfers in 1990 terms, translated into the common currency
of U.S. dollars, and then divided by the population to provide per-capita transfers.
       The data encompass slightly diÔ¨Äerent periods for some of the countries, so that an
unbalanced panel is used in the regressions. As expected, high tax countries are generally
those with more generous transfers (the correlation between the two variables is 0.83). In
all countries, the bottom quintile receives about 5-10 percent of income, the middle three
quintiles around 50-60 percent, and the top quintile 35-40 percent (the United States is the
least equal, with just under 5 percent going to the bottom quintile and just over 60 percent
going to the top). The dependency ratio varies widely, with particularly high dependency
rates (fewer workers per population) in Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain. But
there is little correlation with the tax rate (-0.07), and only a moderate correlation with
(log) per-capita benefits (-0.26). Countries with high unemployment rates generally have
high labor tax rates and high benefits, a point examined in detail by Daveri and Tabellini
(2000) and discussed further below.


4.2    Estimation Results

Table 1 provides results from regressions for the determinants of the labor tax rate and
(log) real transfers per capita. The equations are estimated with ordinary least squares‚Äìthe
regressors are the same in the two equations, so there is no eÔ¨Éciency gain from seemingly
unrelated regressions. All specifications include a complete set of country fixed eÔ¨Äects; the
regressions thus take into account the fact that richer countries tend to have higher tax rates
and provide more generous welfare benefits.
       Columns 1 and 2 show results for the labor tax rate. The dependency ratio has
a statistically significant negative eÔ¨Äect on the labor tax rate, resolving the ambiguity in
the analytical model. A one percentage point increase in the dependency ratio leads to a
nearly 0.4 percentage point decline in the labor tax rate. To put this in perspective, the
(unweighted) average tax rate in the data rose from 30 percent in 1970 to 41 percent in
1991, while the average dependency ratio fell from 58 percent to 54 percent over this period.
Given the negative coeÔ¨Écient, the fall in the dependency ratio resulted in higher taxes‚Äì



                                              16
the coeÔ¨Écient of -0.382 implies that the 4 percentage point decline in the dependency ratio
accounted for roughly 1.5 percentage points of the 11 percentage point increase in the labor
tax rate.
          A larger share of government employment is associated with a higher labor tax rate,8
with significant negative coeÔ¨Écients for per capita real GDP growth and income skewedness
(the latter is the opposite of the prediction of the standard theory that inequality leads
to pressure for redistribution). The eÔ¨Äect of openness on the labor tax rate is positive, in
accord with the theories of Rodrik (1998) and Alesina and Wacziarg (1998). Column 2 adds
the unemployment rate, with a statistically significant positive coeÔ¨Écient. As suggested by
Daveri and Tabellini (2000), this possibly reflects the eÔ¨Äect of reverse causality, with high
labor taxes leading to unemployment. The results for the other variables are essentially
unchanged, though the coeÔ¨Écient on openness is now far from statistically significant. The
coeÔ¨Écient for the eÔ¨Äect of the dependency ratio on taxes remains negative and significant
and nearly unchanged in value.
          Columns 3 and 4 provide estimation results with (log) transfers per capita (in 1990
dollars) as the dependent variable. As with the results for the tax rate, a higher dependency
ratio is found to lead to lower per capita transfers, with the coeÔ¨Écient statistically significant
in all specifications. Benefits rose on average from $1,600 per person in 1970 to $4,360 in
1991 (again, in 1990 dollars); in terms of the log, this is an increase of 1.0. Recalling that
the dependency ratio fell from 58 percent to 54 percent over this period, the coeÔ¨Écient of
nearly -7.5 means that the lower dependency ratio can account for 30 percent of the higher
social transferss (0.3 of the 1.0 increase in the log of per capita benefits). The results are
unchanged by adding the unemployment rate in column 4, in which a higher unemployment
rate is found to be associated with lower per-capita transfers. And if there is reverse causality
as suggested by Daveri and Tabellini (2000), this would likely mean that this coeÔ¨Écient would
be even more negative were it possible to use instrumental variables to account for the eÔ¨Äect
of benefits on unemployment. This is because more generous benefits would be expected to
lead to a longer duration of unemployment and thus a higher higher unemployment rate; this

  8
      This could reflect reverse causality as higher tax rates allow for a larger government share of employment.



                                                       17
positive correlation would mask a more negative coeÔ¨Écient for the eÔ¨Äect of unemployment
on transfers. The negative relationship between unemployment and transfers might reflect
the same factors as that between benefits and the dependency ratio: the unemployed are net
gainers from the welfare state, so that higher unemployment implies a larger fiscal leakage
from the employed who are net contributors. This translates into a larger anti-tax coalition
and thus lower benefits. This is particularly relevant for countries in Europe, where the
prevalence of long-term unemployment means that a large segment of the unemployed are
essentially dependent (they appear in the labor force only because this is required to maintain
eligibility for social benefits). The positive coeÔ¨Écient for the eÔ¨Äect of the unemployment rate
on the labor tax rate likely reflects the positive relationship in the other direction (high labor
taxes leading to high unemployment), which could thus mask an anti-tax eÔ¨Äect of higher
unemployment along the lines of the analytical framework of this paper.
        In addition to using instrumental variables to disentangle the causal eÔ¨Äects of migra-
tion, unemployment, labor market taxes, and social benefits, another extension of this paper
would be to develop and test a theory that distinguishes between the factors that determine
the level of taxes and benefits (or more generally, revenue and expenditure).



5       Conclusion
We explore here how the demand for redistribution by the decisive voter is aÔ¨Äected by
the growing demands on the the welfare state‚Äôs public finances implied by the aging of
population. In a related paper [Razin, Sadka, and Swagel (2001)], we pointed out a similar
relationship between low-skill migration and the size of the welfare state.9 Both phenomena
can be explained by a similar mechanism: a fiscal ‚Äúleakage‚Äù from the median voter to the net

    9
     Earlier studies that emphasize a similar consideration have examined the burden imposed on the modern
welfare state by low-skilled migration. For instance, Wildasin (1994) and Razin and Sadka (1995) show how
all income groups of the native-born population may lose from migration with income redistribution schemes.
Razin, Sadka, and Swagel (2001) examine how these schemes are shaped in the context of a political-economy
equilibrium. The theory suggests that migration does not necessarily tilt the political balance in favor of
heavier taxation and more intensive redistribution. The reason for this is that more native-born individuals
from the middle of the income distribution (that is, the skill/ability distribution) may lose from the extra
tax burden brought about by the need to finance the transfer to the migrants, and as a result shift to the
side of the high-income anti-tax coalition. This shift may be larger than the increase to the pro-tax coalition
brought about by the migrants who join this coalition.

                                                      18
beneficiaries of the welfare state. The mechanism for the determination of the tax burden
and generosity of social transfers emphasizes the demand for redistribution by the median
voter. A crucial factor determining the political-economy tax-transfer policy is whether this
decisive voter is a net contributor or a net beneficiary of the pay-as-you-go social security
system.
       On the one hand, a higher dependency ratio means a larger pro-tax coalition, as
the retired are net beneficiaries of transfers from those who are employed. On the other, a
higher dependency ratio puts a higher tax burden on the people around the median voter,
as it is necessary to finance transfers to a larger share of the population. People for whom
the costs of higher taxes outweigh benefits shift to the anti-tax coalition. Hence, it may well
be the case that the second factor dominates and the political-economy equilibrium tax rate
declines when the dependency ratio rises. This would be the case until society ages enough
so that the median voter is retired, at which point there is a discontinuous jump up in the
tax rate and corresponding increase in the share of transfers.
       An important consideration for our analytical result that the tax rate may be nega-
tively related to the dependency ratio is the fact that in the model (and typically in reality),
redistribution is financed by a tax on labor income rather than on capital income. If in our
setup a capital income tax were available as a source of revenue to finance social security
benefits, and this made retirees net contributors to the fiscal system rather than net ben-
eficiaries, the tax rate would then be positively related to the dependency ratio (until the
weight of capital owners in the population becomes large enough to shift the tax burden
onto labor income).
       The puzzle is why, in reality, work-related redistribution (such as old-age pensions,
public medical benefits, etc.) is typically financed by payroll taxes rather capital income
taxes. On this point we can only oÔ¨Äer some conjectures:
       (1) In the global village, the capital income tax is subject to a ‚Äúrace to the bottom‚Äù
erosion from international tax competition (see, for instance, Frenkel, Razin and Sadka
(1991), and Razin and Sadka (1995)).10

  10
    In a full-commitment dynastic equilibrium, the optimal Chamley-Judd rate of capital income tax ap-
proaches zero in the steady state, leaving a labor tax as the only stable means of finance. This result,


                                                  19
        (2) In general, a payroll tax induces retirement in tenure-based institutions [see, for
instance, Mulligan (2000)].
        (3) Many social security benefits are geared to replacing income or fringe benefits
received while working. A foremost example is that of the social pension for the elderly,
in which publicly provided retirement income replaces labor income. Another example is
unemployment insurance. Also, many workers enjoy employee-provided health care insurance
(in Europe, often as a supplement for the public health system); public medical insurance
replaces this provision during retirement. Therefore, it may be considered ‚Äúfair‚Äù to finance
these benefits by payroll taxes. Extending the model and empirical work to consider the
overall tax burden and the split into labor and capital income tax would be an important
topic for future research.
        Looking forward, the aging of the baby boom generation and declining fertility rates
in the advanced economies both suggest future increases in the dependency ratio. The results
of this paper imply that this will put downward pressure on labor tax rates, so long as the
voting bloc of the retired are not the majority. This is relevant for the current debate on
the privatization of social security systems. In the context of our model, the desire to have
individual retirement accounts rather than a pay-as-you-go system can be seen as an attempt
by current workers to lessen the fiscal leakage of transfers to the retired.

however, does not hold in an overlapping generations model. In a dynastic model in which both human and
physical capital are endogenously accumulated, then both the optimal capital and the labor income tax rates
approach zero in the steady state and all steady state government revenues derive from budget surpluses
accumulated during the transition period.
