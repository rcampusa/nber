Exchange Rate Fluctuations and Firm Leverage

                                           ABSTRACT

We quantify the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on firm leverage. When home currency
appreciates, firms who hold foreign currency debt and local currency assets observe higher net
worth as appreciation lowers the value of their foreign currency debt. These firms can borrow
more as a result and increase their leverage. When home currency depreciates, the reverse
happens as firms have to de-lever with a negative shock to their balance sheets. Using firm-level
data for leverage from 10 emerging market economies during the period from 2002 to 2015, we
show that firms operating in countries whose non-financial sectors hold more of the debt in
foreign currency, increase (decrease) their leverage relatively more after home currency
appreciations (depreciations). Combining the leverage data with firm-level FX debt data for 4
emerging market countries, we further show that our results hold at the most granular level. Our
quantitative results are asymmetric: the effects of depreciations, that are generally associated with
sudden stops, are quantitatively larger than those of appreciations, which take place at a slower
pace over time during capital inflow episodes. As our exercise compares depreciations and
appreciations of similar size, these results are suggestive of financial frictions being more binding
during depreciations than a possible relaxation of such frictions during appreciations.

1     Introduction

Standard international macro theory postulates that a small open economy should let its ex-
change rate carry the burden of adjustment when financial conditions change in the rest of
the world. When external demand decreases due to a tightening of monetary policy, for ex-
ample, the associated appreciation in the rest of the world and depreciation in the small open
economy help to switch the external demand from the rest of the world to the small open
economy's goods. This channel, known as the expenditure switching channel of the Mundell-
Fleming model, highlights the virtue of flexible exchange rates.1 However, policy makers in
emerging market economies (EMEs) argue that flexible exchange rates not help but hurt their
economies as exchange rate volatility has negative effects on economic activity due to sev-
eral channels. One such channel works via the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on foreign
currency (FX) debt.2 In an economy where agents largely borrow in FX, exchange rate depre-
ciations will lead to higher debt burdens as the value of FX debt grows, while that of local
currency assets shrinks. The empirical literature on such balance sheet currency mismatches
shows that exchange rate depreciations are contractionary, due to these balance sheet effects.3
    Interestingly, there is no counterpart to this firm-level empirical literature on currency
deprecation-driven balance sheet effects for currency appreciations. This is the task we un-
dertake in this paper. The original theoretical frameworks on balance sheet effects by Calvo
(1998) and Krugman (1999) show that the effects should be symmetric for depreciations and
appreciations. When home currency appreciates, the balance sheet effect should work in re-
verse, lowering the value of FX debt, which constitutes a positive net worth shock to the bal-

    1 The  evidence on such expenditure switching is, however, weak. Under dominant currency pricing, expen-
diture switching is muted as it works mostly via imports and not exports as shown by Gopinath (2016) and
Gopinath, Boz, Casas, Diez, Gourinchas and Plagborg-Moller (2019).
     2 See Calvo and Reinhart (2002) who document a pervasive "fear of floating," where the "fear" can be linked

to liability dollarization. Another argument for preventing exchange rate volatility is the high degree of pass-
through into domestic inflation in emerging market economies as argued by Burnstein and Gopinath (2014).
     3 Aguiar (2005), for example, considers the large depreciation episode during the 1995 Mexico debt crisis

and finds that firms with heavy exposure to short-term FX debt before the devaluation experienced relatively
low levels of post-devaluation investment. Kalemli-Ozcan, Kamil and Villegas-Sanchez (2016), using also firm-
level data from six Latin American countries, show that non-exporters with a balance sheet currency mismatch
decrease investment as argued by Aguiar (2005), but that foreign-owned exporters with access to liquidity from
their parents increase investment after currency crises in these countries. See also Serena and Sousa (2017) who
show similar results for 36 emerging market economies. Bleakley and Cowan (2008) argue that exporters will
not have a balance sheet currency mismatch due to their natural hedge of revenue in foreign currency. This
might change if exporters are also importers since another channel for the contractionary effects of depreciations
is imported intermediate inputs, where such inputs will be more expensive after a depreciation as shown in
Mendoza and Yue (2012) and Gopinath and Neiman (2013).

ance sheets of firms. This allows firms to borrow more, leading to a credit expansion and an
investment boom in the economy. An alternative way of modeling the expansionary effects
of appreciations is through credit supply of global banks. If these banks' balance sheets suf-
fer from currency mismatches with liabilities in US dollars exceeding assets in US dollars, as
argued by Bruno and Shin (2015a), then they will extend more credit globally as a result of re-
laxation of their value-at-risk constraint when the US dollar depreciates and other economies'
currencies appreciate vis-a-vis the US dollar.4 However, there are also papers, such as Aghion,
Bacchetta and Banerjee (2000, 2001), C´
                                      espedes, Chang and Velasco (2004) and Mendoza (2010),
that show asymmetric effects. In these models the balance sheet effects only work with de-
preciations and not with appreciations due to firms' occasionally binding constraints during
depreciations. Thus, these models suggest that regulation/policy should prevent an increase
in firm leverage during appreciation episodes.
    We empirically investigate whether or not appreciation- and depreciation-driven balance
sheet effects work in a similar way. Specifically, we ask whether firms reduce their leverage
with depreciations and increase their leverage with appreciations and whether policies aimed
at limiting exchange rate fluctuations, such as foreign exchange interventions (FXI) have any
effect on firm leverage.
    We use firm-level data from the ORBIS database for 10 EMEs in Asia over the period from
2002 to 2015. The ORBIS database allows us to have a granular look since it includes balance
sheet variables for both listed and non-listed firms. This is a big advantage over other firm-
level datasets such as Worldscope which covers only listed firms, and the Capital IQ database
which has an extremely small coverage of non-listed firms (a few giant firms in most EMEs).
Another advantage of using data on private firms is that leverage will be evaluated at the book
value and hence there will not be a mechanical effect on leverage with the changes in exchange




   4 Bruno  and Shin (2015b), using bank-level data, provide evidence that a depreciation of the US dollar against
many countries' currencies is associated with an increase in the leverage of global banks and an acceleration of
cross-border banking flows into countries whose home currencies appreciate against the US dollar. Avdjiev, Koch
and Shin (2018) show similar evidence that cross-border banking flows are higher when there are depreciations in
major funding currencies. On the pricing side, Hofmann, Shim and Shin (2017, 2019) show that an appreciation
of local currency vis-`
                      a-vis the US dollar in EMEs leads to a compression in government bond yields of those
EMEs, which signals easier borrowing conditions for governments. See also Avdjiev, Du, Koch and Shin (2019)
and Avdjiev, Bruno, Koch and Shin (2018) with similar results on prices. The literature still lacks evidence at the
firm level on the direct effects of local currency appreciations on firms' borrowing, a gap that our paper tries to
bridge.

    ORBIS data may not be representative nationally due to the fact that it does not cover the
universe of private firms. Thus, we will focus on 10 Asian EMEs with good coverage of the
economy (over 45/50 per cent of aggregate output and corporate sector debt), as shown in

            1 This column shows the aggregated sales of all firms in our sample divided by the nominal gross output. The

            coverage numbers are calculated in every year from 2002 to 2015. The table reports the average of the yearly
            numbers for each economy. The gross output data are from World KLEMS for India and Korea, from CEIC
            for China and Indonesia, and from ADB and national statistics for Hong Kong SAR, Malaysia, the Philippines,
            Singapore, Thailand and Chinese Taipei.
            2 This column shows the aggregated debt outstanding of all firms in our sample divided by the national total

            credit to the private non-financial corporate sector. The denominator is from the BIS. The coverage numbers are
            calculated in every year from 2002 to 2015. The table reports the average of the yearly numbers for each economy.



    It is hard to obtain currency composition of debt at the firm level for private firms in any
country unless a credit registry is used. These registries include firms' and banks' regulatory
filings to the national authorities. In the aggregate form, such data can partly be obtained
from banks reporting to the BIS, through the BIS Global Liquidity Indicators (GLI) database.
The GLI database is based on BIS Locational Banking Statistics and BIS International Debt Se-
   5 See Adrian and Shin (2013) on the different cyclical properties of book leverage and market leverage. Al-
though we do not have a mechanical valuation effect on firm leverage due to higher valued foreign currency
assets when foreign currency appreciates and vice versa on debt, we have an accounting problem due to con-
version of FX values to local currency. Under the accounting practise IAS 21 in IFRS standards that our sample
economies use, the book values of foreign currency debt/assets are transalated to local currency using the period-
end exchange rates in firm balance sheets. Thus, with a 10 percent depreciation a 100 dollar loan that was booked
as 100 pesos in local currency before the peso deprecation, will now be booked as 110 pesos in local currency,
although there is no new 10-peso local currency debt. This has to be adjusted to the original value of 100 dollars.
We adjust for this "accounting effect" and show that it does not affect our results.
    6 The only exceptions are China and Hong Kong SAR. We ran robustness exercises without including these

two economies, and obtained similar results. Notice that the coverage of aggregate output and aggregate corpo-
rate sector debt in Worldscope data and in Capital IQ data will be much lower, around 10 per cent, for all our
sample economies due to the focus of these data sets on listed firms.

                                                                   3
curities Statistics. This database provides FX debt exposures for both bonds and loans. As
the database is at the aggregate level, firms', households' and governments' FX debt is aggre-
gated into the total FX debt of the non-financial sector of a given country. Through another
BIS dataset, we can separate the government sector and keep the non-financial sector as firms
and households. This is important as results on the effects of appreciations change with and
without government debt.
   FX bonds are debt securities issued in the US dollar, euro and Japanese yen and issued in
international markets by the residents in the non-financial sector of a given economy. FX loans
are bank loans extended to the non-bank sector of a given economy both by domestic banks
and international banks located outside the economy and denominated in the US dollar, euro
and Japanese yen. The BIS GLI data cover 42 economies, 21 of which are advanced economies
(AEs) and the rest are EMEs. The share of total FX debt of our 10 EMEs out of the 21 EMEs with
FX debt data available in the GLI database was 42% in 2000, and reached to 65% in 2015. The
average share during the whole sample period is 53%. Thus, our sample of 10 EMEs accounts
for a dominant share of global EME FX debt.
   As Table 2 shows, for all our sample economies, FX loans constitute the larger share of FX
debt of the non-financial sector over time. This is because FX loans can be obtained both from
domestic and external lenders, whereas FX bonds are predominantly issued internationally.
Since most small firms cannot issue internationally (and most of the private firms are small),
studying effects of FX debt exposure through international bond issuance, as common in the
literature due to data availability issues, will underestimate the "true" FX debt exposure of a
given country.
   Most of the papers in the literature so far consider either FX loans or FX bonds to capture
FX debt of a country, but not both of these asset classes, which is done first in our paper.
For example, Maggiori, Neiman and Schreger (2018) analyze only FX bonds issued by the
non-financial sector, and do not consider FX loans. At the other extreme, Avdjiev, Bruno,
Koch and Shin (2018) consider only dollar-denominated cross-border loans to EMEs. Lane
and Shambaugh (2010) and B´
                          en´
                            etrix, Lane and Shambaugh (2015) consider both FX loans and
FX bonds, but their approach is based on "estimates" and not real exposures. They combine
BIS and IMF balance of payments data in order to obtain "estimates" for a large cross-section of
countries only for cross-border FX exposures and not total FX exposures. We have a limited set
of countries compared to those papers but use data on "actual" FX exposures to both domestic

and foreign lenders.
   In order to estimate the "share" of FX debt in total debt of the non-financial sector, we use
the BIS Total Credit database. This database provides data on total loans and debt securities
used for borrowing by the residents in the non-financial sector of a given economy, both in
domestic and foreign currencies and from both domestic and foreign lenders. By dividing the
sum of loans and bonds in FX from the GLI data set for the non-financial sector by the sum
of total loans and bonds for the non-financial sector from the Total Credit database, we obtain
the country-level non-financial sector FX debt share.
   We run a firm-level leverage regression using annual data, where we regress firm-level
leverage on firm fixed effects, standard firm leverage controls and the country-level non-
financial sector FX debt share. We interact this FX debt exposure with dummies for exchange
rate depreciation and appreciation in excess of 0, 5 and 10 per cent. We do this, instead of
using continuous changes in the exchange rate, to be able to separate the quantitative impact
of depreciations from appreciations in the light of the theoretical literature reviewed above.7
We find that when home currency appreciates (depreciates), firms operating in the countries
whose non-financial sectors hold a larger share of their debt in FX, increase (decrease) their
leverage relatively more than those in countries with smaller FX debt shares. We show that
our results are predominantly driven by FX loan exposures rather than FX bond exposures,
which is not surprising given the fact that most of our firms are small and these firms mainly
borrow in FX loans from their domestic banks rather than issuing FX bonds in international

   7 We   use continuous changes in the exchange rate as a robustness check.

                                                                    5
markets.
   In terms of economic significance, we find the effect of deprecations to be larger than that
of appreciations, so our results are asymmetric as argued by the literature on occasionally
binding constraints. In the data, such an effect can be identified from within firm variation
during large depreciation events (sudden stops in a given year), whereas appreciations happen
slowly during booms when a typical capital inflows bonanza lasts 2 to 3 years. To make sure
our results are not driven by this type of variation in the data, we compare similarly sized
depreciations and appreciations. Using the mean ratio of FX debt to total debt for the 10
sample economies, we find that a depreciation of 10 per cent or more decreases leverage by
0.1517 and that the effect of a 10 percent or more appreciation is an increase in leverage of
0.0265. Given the mean firm leverage is 0.16, a 10 percent or more depreciation represents a
90 percent decline in leverage relative to its mean, whereas a 10 percent or more appreciation
represents a 20 percent increase in leverage over its mean, still a sizeable effect.
   Possible threats to our identification are through omitted time-varying factors if these fac-
tors are correlated with the country-time level exchange rate fluctuations interacted with the
share of corporate sector FX debt. One possibility is terms-of-trade shocks. To check the role
of these factors, we use country×time fixed effects by re-defining FX debt at the firm level so
that our country-level FX debt interacted with the exchange rate changes are not absorbed by
country×time fixed effects.
   We follow two approaches to bring firm-level FX debt into our analysis. First, we use
a proxy firm-level measure, where we proxy the level of firm-level FX debt by assuming that
each firm's FX debt share is equivalent to the corporate sector's FX debt share, and back out the
level of firm-level FX debt out of total firm-level debt by using the corporate sector FX debt share.
We control for time-varying firm size as larger firms will have larger FX debt by construction in
this approach. Assuming each firm's FX debt share being constant and equal to the corporate
sector's share of FX debt is of course a big assumption and this exercise cannot replace having
actual data on firm-level FX debt levels and shares. However, econometrically it solves a huge
problem as it allows us to control for time-varying unobserved heterogeneity at the country
level by using country×time fixed effects. The omitted variables at the country-time level
will be correlated with the exchange rate fluctuations and country-level FX debt shares and
they need to be absorbed through the use of country×time fixed effects for our identification
strategy to remain valid.

                                                 6
    Our second approach is to use actual data on firm-level FX debt share, though this will be
only for 4 countries given the data availability. We obtain similar results to our benchmark
results from both of these approaches. We further explore the role of firms operating in non-
tradeable sectors for possible selection effects and also rerun our regressions by separating
long-term and short-term debt. We also run a placebo exercise where we use very low levels
of deprecations and appreciations (less than 1 per cent) and show that there is no effect of such
small movements in the exchange rate on firm leverage.
    Finally, we study the role of policy in limiting or exacerbating leverage via moral hazard by
focusing on FXI policies that are aimed at smoothing exchange rate fluctuations. In our sample
of 10 EMEs, we find a negative effect of FXI on leverage. That is, firms in countries that increase
FXI, decrease their leverage over time conditional on other determinants of leverage including
the effect of exchange rate fluctuations. As the theoretical literature argues for moral hazard
effects of FXI on firms' risk taking in terms of increasing their FX debt (e.g. Diamond, Hu and
Rajan (2018)), we checked our results in a larger set of countries since the effects of FXI on
leverage might differ across firms and across countries. In the larger sample of 42 countries,
we find that the effect of FXI on firm leverage turns out to be largely insignificant.8
    The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the data and presents stylized facts.
Section 3 presents the empirical methodology, benchmark results and robustness exercises.
Section 4 concludes.



2     Data and Stylized Facts

2.1    Firm-Level Financial Data

Our study uses accounting data of non-financial firms for the period of 2002 to 2015 in the
following 10 economies: China, Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong SAR, India, Indonesia, Korea,
Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. We obtain annual data on firm-level bal-
ance sheet items such as total assets, total debt, long-term debt, short-term debt, sales, tangible
    8 We find a marginally positive significant effect only in countries with high levels of FX debt at the beginning
of the sample. Note that our results differ from those of Tong and Wei (2019) who find a very strong positive
effect of FXI on firm leverage. We believe this is due to the small and select sample Tong and Wei (2019) use as
they only focus on listed firms, whereas we have a much larger sample including private firms. Listed firms may
increase their leverage as a result of FXI but this does not mean country-level corporate sector leverage will be
higher. The listed firms will not be representative of the corporate sector leverage in EMEs as they represent a
small share of the corporate sector given less developed stock markets in these economies.

fixed assets and earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) from the ORBIS database produced
by Bureau van Djik. Exchange rate data come from the BIS.
    An important feature of our data is that it contains not only publicly traded companies,
but also privately held firms which represent the majority of GDP for many economies in the
sample. We exclude from the sample the firms inactive during the sample period and those in
bankruptcy procedures. By taking advantage of the ownership and headquarter information
provided in the ORBIS database, we also exclude those firms that are part of multinational net-
works, where decision making will be governed elsewhere than the firms' financial reporting
location.9 For example, a branch of a Korean company located in China reports the financial
information to China. Such a branch is excluded from our sample because its decisions have
little to do with the fluctuations in the value of the Chinese yuan against the US dollar. To
avoid double counting, we use unconsolidated financial information for the firms reporting
both consolidated and unconsolidated information. We further clean up the financial data fol-
lowing the procedures described in Kalemli-Ozcan, Sorensen, Villegas-Sanchez, Volosovych
and Yesiltas (2015).
    We combine the cleaned financial data from the ORBIS database and the country-level
nominal bilateral exchange rate data synchronized with each country's fiscal year applied to
financial reporting. The fiscal year of the financial data reported before June is assigned to the
year before the reporting-end year. The unit of observation in the sample is "firm-year". Our
final sample contains 1,661,677 firm-year observations. Table 3 shows the number of obser-
vations and descriptive statistics of the main variables in the final sample after winsorization.
All the variables are winsorized at 1 per cent to control for outliers before it is used in the
regressions, while Sales growth is windsorized at 5 per cent.
    Our dependent variable is a firm's financial leverage measured by the book value of total
financial debt scaled by the book value of total assets. Total financial debt is the total value of
the outstanding bank loans and financial bonds at the end of the fiscal year. We prefer not to
use the book value of total liabilities as the main measure of firm leverage in our benchmark
analysis. This is because such liabilities contain trade credits or other forms of liabilities such
as pension liabilities, although using these alternative measures of leverage for robustness


   9 We  exclude from the sample the firms that are identified as "branches of foreign companies" and those with
their headquarters or ultimate parents located outside the financial reporting country in terms of the ISO country
code.

equals 1 when the nominal exchange rate against the US dollar decreases (i.e. the home cur-
rency appreciates) or increases (i.e. the home currency depreciates) between the end of the
previous fiscal year and the end of the current fiscal year by more than k, where k takes values
of 0, 5 and 10 per cent.
    Following Rajan and Zingales (1995), we use other control variables that are typical for
leverage regressions, such as Collateral measured by tangible fixed assets/total assets, Pro f itability
measured by the EBIT/total assets, Size measured by the logarithm of total assets, and Sales growth
measured by the growth in sales.10 For all firms in our sample, total debt and other financial
variables reported in local currency are converted into the US dollar by using the bilateral
exchange rates of the nearest quarter-end of the reporting date. All the control variables are
lagged by one year relative to the dependent variable.


2.2       Non-Financial Sector FX Debt

Figure 1 shows that the ratio of total corporate debt to GDP has increased over time, espe-
cially in EMEs. We want to decompose this increase in corporate sector debt into FX and local
currency components, regardless of the lender.
    As explained in the introduction, we start with the entire non-financial sector FX debt share
as the sum of FX loans and FX bonds in the non-financial sector of a given country (from the
GLI database of the BIS) divided by total debt (loans and bonds) of the non-financial sector

  10 In the literature, the market-to-book value or Tobin's Q is typically used to control a firm's growth oppor-
tunity. Since this is not available for non-listed firms in our sample, we use sales growth as a proxy for growth
opportunity.

                                                          9
of the same country (from the Total Credit database of the BIS). Hence this share includes
households, corporates and governments.
   Figure 2 shows this FX debt share for different regions using the entire GLI database for
comparison to Asia where our 10 EMEs are from. This figure calculates the weighted average
by using each country's FX debt as the weight. Under this weighting scheme, an economy
with a larger amount of FX debt receives a greater weight since that economy is more likely to
create instability in the region. Overall, the Latin American countries have the highest level of
the FX debt share, though declining over time, while the advanced economies have the lowest
level. The Asian EMEs are somewhere in between.

         non-financial sector of 42 economies in four different regions, using the economies'
         FX debt as the weight. Data source: BIS.


   As explained above, we want to obtain corporate sector FX debt. The non-financial sec-
tor includes non-financial corporations, households and government. Since we assume that
households cannot issue FX bonds (but they can borrow in FX loans), we can calculate the
amount of FX bonds issued by non-financial corporates by deducting the FX bonds issued by
the government from total FX bonds of the non-financial sector. We can also take out total debt
of the government from the denominator. Doing this, we end up with Figure 3 that shows the
ratio of FX bonds issued by corporates to total credit to corporates. It seems that FX exposure
in bonds is not large relative to total credit that includes loans to the corporate sector. These
patterns imply that our results will mainly be driven by FX loan exposures.

3      Empirical Analysis: Firm-Level Regressions

3.1     Aggregate FX Debt

Our macro-level (as we use country-level FX debt) specification (for firm i in industry j and
country c in year t) is as follows:

                                                  k                                 k
        Leveragei, j,c,t =  · FXdebtc,t-1 × Dummyec ,t +  · FXdebtc,t-1 +  · Dummy ec,t
                                                                                                                               (1)
                                                                      +  · Xi , c , t - 1 +  i + c +  j , t +  i , j , c , t

where Leveragei, j,c,t is the firm-level financial leverage measured by financial debt/assets.
Xi,c,t-1 is the set of lagged control variables that are firm size, collateral, profitability and sales
growth, i.e., standard determinants of firm leverage. i captures the firm fixed effects, while c ,
and j,t are the country and industry-year fixed effects, respectively, which capture country-
level time-invariant factors such as average differences across countries and also industry-
level time-varying shocks which matter to a great extent for firm-level leverage. Notice that
these industry-year effects are at a very granular 4-digit level and hence will also capture most
of firm demand shocks as long as those shocks are specific to the 4-digit industry that the firm
operates in. These granular 4-digit sector-year fixed effects will also capture supply shocks
such as terms-of-trade shocks that will affect firms in tradeable sectors differentially.
     The FX debt variable is the share of FX debt in the total debt of the non-financial sector as we
have explained above and it is lagged. Hence this variable is at the country level. Dummy ek
is a dummy variable for depreciations and appreciations that takes a value of 1 in years where
the bilateral US dollar exchange rate, e, appreciates or depreciates more than k per cent, where
k will be 0, 5 or 10. So we define the exchange rate, e, as local currency divided by the US dollar.
Both of these variables, the FX debt share and exchange rate changes, vary at the country-
time level, preventing us from using country-time fixed effects to capture other country-level
shocks and policy changes. We estimate the regression model using the ordinary least squares
(OLS) method with standard errors clustered at the firm level.11 We also conducted a dynamic
system general method of moments (GMM) estimation and obtained similar results.
     Table 5 presents benchmark results. Columns (1)-(3) show the case for depreciations and
columns (4)-(6) that for appreciations. As expected, when the exchange rate depreciates, lever-

    11 The   results are robust to clustering standard errors at the country level.

age goes down; and when it appreciates, it goes up. But this only happens in countries whose
corporate sectors are heavily indebted in FX. In fact, the effect of depreciations and apprecia-
tions in countries with no FX debt is the opposite: firm-leverage increases with depreciations
and decreases with appreciations, though the effects are small. The effect of FX debt on lever-
age in the absence of exchange rate movements is always positive. All the other determinants
of firm-level leverage enter into the regression with the expected signs.
    The effects are economically significant. To calculate the total effects, we use the mean ratio
of FX debt to total debt for the 10 Asian economies (0.1519) and show that a 10 percent or more
depreciation decreases firm leverage by 0.0844. Also, the effects tend to become larger with
the size of depreciations and appreciations. In general, the effect of deprecations is larger than
that of appreciations, and appreciations larger than 10 per cent deliver the wrong sign on the
estimated coefficient as shown in the first line of column (6) in Table 5.

 This table reports the OLS regression results based on panel data from 2002 to 2015 for 10 Asian economies. Financial debt/assets is
the ratio of the book value of total financial debt over the book value of total assets. FXdebt is the country-level share of FX debt
defined as non-financial sector FX debt divided by total credit to the non-financial sector. Collateral is tangible fixed assets scaled by
total assets. Profitability is the ROA ratio (i.e. EBIT/total assets). Size is the logarithm of total assets. Sales growth is the growth rate
in sales. t-stats based on clustered standard errors at the firm level are in parentheses.
  p < 0.10,  p < 0.05,  p < 0.01.




    One reason for this "wrong sign" interaction effect can be the role of government. Although
we use lagged shares of FX debt and these shares are time-invariant mostly as shown before
in Figure 2, it is still possible that governments of the commodity-exporting countries borrow

                                                                    14
less in response to an appreciation. We can subtract government bonds from FX bonds issued
by the non-financial sector. Table 6 shows these results, and now all columns deliver the right
sign on the interaction effect. Using the mean ratio of FX debt excluding government FX
bonds to total debt (0.1191), we show that a depreciation of 10 per cent or more decreases firm
leverage by 0.1352, whereas an appreciation of the same magnitude increases firm leverage
only by 0.0108, an order of magnitude difference.

This tables uses FX debt of the non-financial sector after excluding FX government bonds. See notes to the previous table for the
definitions of other variables.
 p < 0.10,  p < 0.05,  p < 0.01.




    Next, we consider FX loans and FX bonds separately to see which type of FX debt drives
the results. Table 7 shows that firms in a country where the share of FX loans in the total
non-financial sector debt is higher, tend to have higher (lower) leverage when the country
experiences an appreciation (depreciation). Given much larger magnitudes in this table, it is
clear that our results are driven by FX loan exposures. In particular, when we use the mean
ratio of FX loans to total debt (0.0996), the effect of a 10 percent or more depreciation is a
decline in leverage of 0.1517 and the effect of a 10 percent or more appreciation is an increase in
leverage of 0.0265. Given that the mean firm leverage is 0.16, a 10 percent or more depreciation
represents a very large change in leverage, equivalent to the mean. An appreciation of 10
percent or more also represents a 20 percent increase in leverage over its sample mean.

    Finally, our benchmark result is robust to using continuous changes in exchange rates as
shown in Table 8. As shown with the negative coefficient, the higher the depreciation, the
lower the leverage. The results using continuous changes in exchange rates for specifications
in Tables 6 and 7 are also similar.


3.2       Firm-Level FX Debt: Non-Financial Sector Proxy Approach

A threat to our identification is the omitted country-year shocks, policies and other factors. To
be able to control for these, in this section we will include country×year fixed effects. Given
the fact that our main variable of interest is at the country-time level (interaction of exchange
rate movements with FX debt), we will redefine FX debt to be at the firm level.
    To do this, we proceed with two approaches. First, we assume that each firm's share of FX
debt is equal to the aggregate non-financial sector share (after excluding government FX debt).
Then we apply this share to each firm's total debt to get the firm-level FX debt. The appendix
explains in detail how we calculate firm-level FX debt. By construction, larger firms will have
more debt and hence more FX debt. Thus, it is important to control for time-varying firm size
in the regressions. We use firm-level FX debt as a dummy in the regressions, where we create

a time-invariant dummy variable for firm-level FX debt exposure, FXdebti , that takes value 1
when the average value of FX debt of a firm is higher than the respective value of the median
firm in the same country, and zero otherwise. For our second approach, we use actual firm-
level FX debt data from four countries, which will also allow us to check the validity of our
proxy approach.
   For our first approach, we interact the two dummies, that is, firm-level FX debt and dummy
for appreciations/depreciations. This interaction term corresponds to a "Difference-in-Differences"
interpretation of the relative effect of an appreciation (or depreciation) on firms with different
degrees of FX debt exposure. We also interact all the firm-level controls with the apprecia-
tion/depreciation dummy, to make sure that our main variable of interest is not a proxy for
these effects. We include firm, industry-year and country-year fixed effects. The firm fixed
effects help to control the unobserved firm-level time-invariant heterogeneity and help us to
identify from within variation as before. The industry-year and country-year fixed effects con-

trol all shocks, policy changes and unobserved time-varying heterogeneity at the industry and
country levels, respectively. The dummy for appreciation (or depreciation) will be absorbed
by the country-year fixed effects and the dummy for the firm-level FX debt will be absorbed
by the firm fixed effects.
   Our micro-level specification (as we now use firm-level FX debt instead of country-level)
is as follows:



                                         k                                           k
   Leveragei, j,c,t =  · FXdebti × Dummyec ,t + 1 · Xi,c,t-1 + 2 · Xi,c,t-1 × Dummy ec,t
                                                                                                                             (2)
                                                                                    +  i + c , t +  j , t +  i , j , c , t

where Leveragei, j,c,t and Xi,c,t-1 are the same as in equation (1). i captures the firm fixed
effects, while c,t and j,t the country-year and industry-year fixed effects, respectively. We
again estimate the regression model using the OLS method with robust standard errors clus-
tered at the firm level.12 A dynamic system GMM estimation provided similar results. FXdebti
is obtained for each firm as explained above with the proxy approach.
   Table 9 reports the results for depreciations and appreciations more than 10 per cent in
columns (1) and (2), respectively. Our results are similar to the results before, though with
smaller coefficients. These smaller coefficients show the importance of country× year fixed
effects, that is, the role of other policies and country-level shocks driving the relation between
exchange rate changes and firm leverage, leading to higher coefficients. The interaction of
other firm-level controls with exchange rate movements shows the importance of controlling
these effects as certain firms behave in the opposite way. For example, larger firms do not
increase leverage with appreciations. These results show the importance of using a repre-
sentative set of firms and not only relying on large listed firms for inference on the effects
of exchange rate changes on firm leverage. Our results are again robust to using continuous
changes in exchange rates as shown in Table 10.


3.3   Other Robustness

We provide further robustness on our proxy approach to firm-level FX debt to see if results
can be driven by other factors.
  12 The   results are robust to clustering standard errors at the country level.

   First, we conduct a placebo test to see if there is still any effect when the exchange rate
changes minimally. We redefine our appreciation and depreciation dummies for very little
changes in the exchange rate, where we limit the appreciations or depreciations to less than
1 per cent. We also used alternative thresholds such as no more than 2 per cent for appreci-
ation or depreciation, and obtained similar results. The results are reported in Table 11. We
have run this exercise as an event analysis using only those years with limited exchange rate
changes, which is why we lose observations. We show only the coefficient of interest on the
interaction of firm-level FX debt and the change in the exchange rate dummy. Clearly this
is insignificant either statistically or economically. This exercise shows the importance of the
size of exchange rate movements to realize the effects on firm leverage. It also shows that our
firm-level FX debt proxy does not capture other factors creating a spurious relation between
this firm-level dummy and firm-level leverage. The exchange rate shock clearly matters for
the relation between firm-level leverage and FX debt.

   We further investigate the role of firms in the non-tradeable sector. Since firms in the trade-
able sector have more capacity to generate revenues in FX, their borrowing in FX could be
hedged by cash flows. The balance sheet channel therefore should work stronger for firms in
the non-tradeable sector because they are likely to be more sensitive to exchange rate shocks.
As commonly classified in the literature, the tradeable sector includes agriculture, mining and
manufacturing industries, while the non-tradeable sector includes construction, transporta-
tion, communication, utilities, wholesale/retail trade, and services. Therefore, we split the
firms to see the different effects on firms in the tradeable and non-tradeable sectors.

                                                             21
    As conjectured, Table 12 shows that the effects of depreciations are significant in the non-
tradeable sector while insignificant in the tradeable sector.13 The effects of appreciations are
significant in both sectors but stronger in the non-tradeable sector, as the coefficient is twice
the size of the coefficient for the tradeable sector.

    Next, we test the role of maturity by looking at the effect of currency appreciations (depre-
ciations) on short-term and long-term debt-based leverage. We again focus on the case of more
than 10 percent depreciations and appreciations. Table 13 shows that the main effects are due
to changes in long-term debt-based leverage.
    In fact, for depreciations, the effect of FX debt on short-term debt is opposite: during depre-
ciations more than 10 per cent, firms with higher FX debt increase short-term based leverage
and decrease long-term based leverage. This is consistent with a roll-over crisis during large
sudden stop events and financial crises where firms try to borrow short term, if they can, to
roll over their maturing debt. Clearly firms with FX debt are more stressed during such events
and hence they do this more, while reducing the long-term leverage and strengthening their
balance sheet to be able to borrow short term. The work of Albuquerque and Hopenhayn
(2004) predicts exactly this relation for a closed economy for local currency debt for distressed
   13 This
         result is in line with Bleakley and Cowan (2008) who find no effect of balance sheet mismatch on
investment of exporters.

firms. This roll-over effect is not relevant for appreciations of course and hence the effects of
appreciations are in the same direction but stronger in magnitude for the long-term debt-based
leverage, consistent with appreciations making balance sheets stronger for firms with FX debt.


3.4      Firm-Level FX Debt Share: Data for Select Countries

One may be concerned that the country-level non-financial sector FX debt share applied to all
firms to back out the firm-level FX debt is not a good approach. Therefore, we proceed with
our second approach of using actual firm-level data on firm-level FX debt shares in their total
debt.14 We have such firm-level data only for four countries: Korea, Argentina, Mexico and
Colombia. Also the data are only for listed firms and hence these samples will be different
from our benchmark sample of 10 economies that covers private firms.
     The only country common to both data sets, that is our ORBIS data and the new firm-level
FX debt data we obtained for the four countries, is Korea. To illustrate that our proxy approach
does not capture anything different in terms of dynamics, we will use Korea data and compare
the aggregate non-financial sector FX debt share of Korea in our data for 1994 to 1999 to the


    14 Wethank Kim, Tesar and Zhang (2015) for sharing their firm-level data for Korea and Kalemli-Ozcan, Kamil
and Villegas-Sanchez (2016) for sharing their firm-level data for Argentina, Brazil and Mexico.

                                                                   23
"aggregated" firm-level data we got from Kim, Tesar and Zhang (2015) for those years.15 As
shown in Figure 4, they follow similar patterns.16 In 1997, the year of the Asian financial
crisis, the increase in the share of FX debt in total debt is larger in the aggregate than the
average firm in the sample of Korean listed firms, which again shows the importance of using
a representative set of firms. The FX share increases as local currency debt collapses during
these types of sudden stop crises and listed firms might have more access to local currency
debt markets during such events. Nevertheless, the time variation in our aggregate BIS data
and in the Korea firm-level data seems to be similar and this is important as all our regressions
are identified from such dynamic (within) variation.
    It is worth noting the difference in the variables and breadth of the two different firm sam-
ples for Korea. Notice that our data are for the later period and hence firms in the two datasets
on Korea cannot be matched. Kim, Tesar and Zhang (2015) use data from Korea Information
Service, Inc. (KIS) which includes FX debt information for a set of select listed Korean firms.
They construct their FX exposure variables as the ratio of FX debt to net worth. The coverage
of firms between the two samples is quite different. Our ORBIS-based sample of Korean firms
includes 151,684 firms, the majority of which are small, unlisted firms and most of which have
not been rated by rating agencies. By contrast, the KIS is a rating agency and thus the KIS data-
based sample of 6,987 firms are mostly relatively large, rated domestic bond issuers. In Kim,
Tesar and Zhang (2015), the sample only includes firms with total assets no less than 7 billion
Korean won. In this sample, the median of total assets and total liabilities are around 13 bil-
lion won and 9 billion won, respectively. By contrast, in our ORBIS-based sample, the median
of total assets and total liabilities are around 3 billion won and 1.5 billion won, respectively.
Clearly we have a much more representative sample in terms of firm size.




   15 Our firm level data for Korea are for later years.
   16 To compare with country-level FX debt shares, we calculate Korean firms' average debt-to-liability ratio
based on our ORBIS sample, which is around 0.6 and then estimate the FX debt-to-total debt ratio by dividing
the foreign debt-to-liability ratio by 0.6. This is because Korean data only reports total liability and not total debt,
which is what we use due to the existence of non-financial obligations in the total liability item as argued in the
data section.

         This figure shows the simple average of FX debt shares of Korean firms using the
         KIS sample and the ratio of aggregate FX debt to aggregate liabilities using the KIS
         sample, compared with the BIS country-level FX debt share. Data sources: BIS,
         KIS.


   Next we use firm-level FX debt data for Korea during 1994 to 1999 in regressions to see if
we obtain similar results. Since we do not have the detailed firm-level controls for Korea, we
run the following regression using the firm-level data available for Korea:

where FXdebt sharei takes value 1 when the average FX debt share of a firm is higher than
the respective value of the median firm, and zero otherwise. Leveragei, j,c,t is defined as the
liability-to-asset ratio due to no available data on total debt in the current KIS dataset. i
captures the firm fixed effects, while j,t industry-year fixed effects.
   Table 14 reports the results for depreciations and appreciations more than 0, 5 or 10 per cent
in columns (1) to (6), respectively. We also add one more result using continuous exchange rate
changes in the interaction term to show the robustness in column (7). Our results are similar
to the results in benchmark Table 9 in terms of the sign and significance of the interaction term

FXdebt sharei is a dummy that equals 1 if a firm's average FX debt scaled by total liability during the sample period is higher than the country's sample
median, and equals 0 otherwise. See notes to the previous tables for all other variables. The standard errors are clustered at the firm level. t-statistics
are reported in parentheses.
p   < 0.10,    p   < 0.05,    p   < 0.01.



      To further support our evidence, we bring in firm-level data on FX debt shares from three
other countries, Argentina, Mexico and Brazil, during 1990-2005. We also control other firm-
level controls in these regressions. As these countries went through very severe crises during
this period, for large depreciations of columns (1) and (3) we define a threshold of the 90th
percentile of changes in the exchange rate between local currency and the US dollar in the
data sample, which is around a 24% depreciation of local currency. The dummy for large
appreciation used in columns (2) and (4) is defined by the threshold of the 1st percentile of
changes in the exchange rate, which is a 16% appreciation of local currency.
      The detailed results are reported in Table 15. These results are consistent with our previous
results for depreciations, but for appreciations we only find an effect for exporters. Column
(4) shows that exporters defined as high exporters (10 per cent of revenues are from exports)
are the ones who significantly increase their leverage with appreciations.


3.5      The Role of Exchange Rate Policies

As we have argued before, the literature on asymmetric affects of depreciations and apprecia-
tions provides a rationale for the use of foreign exchange intervention (FXI) policies in order to
limit appreciations (lean against the wind) so that risk-taking behavior of firms will be limited
and firm leverage will be lower. A parallel literature talks about the costs of reserve accumu-
lation and FXI policies during depreciations in terms of moral hazard where firms expecting
FXI during depreciations, will increase leverage during appreciations in any case.

   In order to see the effect of such policies in our benchmark sample, we have added the
most commonly used FXI variable to our regressions, that is the FX reserves-to-GDP ratio. As
we show in Table 16, our results are robust and FXI itself has a strong negative effect on firm
leverage.

      The results are robust to using alternative specifications in benchmark Table 6 and Table 7
as shown below in Table 17.
      FXI policies differ across countries in their timing and nature and hence the results above
might be specific to our 10 EMEs. Hence we have also run a similar regression for the larger
sample of 42 economies with aggregate FX debt data from the BIS, including our 10 EMEs,
using over 7 million firms from these economies. We have obtained an insignificant result for
FXI as shown in column (1) of Table 18. When we separate the 42 economies into high and low
FX debt in the first year of the sample (instead of controlling FX debt in the regressions), then
we find a weak positive effect in the high FX debt economies as shown in column (2).

4    Conclusion

This paper quantifies the response of firm leverage to exchange rate fluctuations. When home
currency appreciates, firms that hold FX debt and local currency assets observe higher net
worth as appreciation lowers the value of their FX debt. These firms can borrow more as a
result. When home currency depreciates, the reverse happens and firms have to de-lever with
a negative shock to their balance sheets.
    Using firm-level data for leverage from 10 emerging market economies during the period
from 2002 to 2015, we show that firms operating in countries whose non-financial sectors hold
more of the debt in FX, increase (decrease) their leverage relatively more after home currency
appreciations (depreciations). The effect of a depreciation is quantitatively larger than that of
an appreciation, especially for depreciations larger than 10 per cent. By separating FX debt
of the corporate sector into loans and bonds, we show that our results are due to loans in FX,
rather than bonds. Instead of proxying firm-level FX debt with the non-financial sectors' ag-
gregate FX debt, we also use actual firm-level FX debt data from 4 emerging market economies
and show that our results hold. Furthermore, we show a significantly negative effect of FXI
policies--that are designed to limit exchange rate fluctuations--on firm leverage in our 10
emerging market economies, and no effect of such policies in a larger sample of 42 economies.
    Our findings point to the importance of monitoring firms' FX exposure and in particular,
the extent of currency mismatch on their balance sheet. We show that currency appreciations
combined with higher levels of FX exposure can prompt firms to increase their leverage during
good times (risk taking), but that such firms are likely to become subject to de-leveraging pres-
sures when their local currency depreciates. When the firms suffer from FX valuation losses
and FX funding strains, the national authorities are often expected to step in to provide FX
liquidity to these firms either directly or indirectly through their banks to minimize the nega-
tive impact on growth. However, it might be difficult for some emerging market economies to
provide FX liquidity, especially during crises.

Appendix

We go through the following five steps to calculate FX debt at the firm level:

  1. Total FX debt in an economy. The BIS Global Liquidity Indicator (GLI) database pro-
     vides total FX debt data at the country level, which consist of data on debt securities
     denominated in the US dollar, euro and Japanese yen and issued by the non-financial
     sector entities in a country and data on bank loans denominated in the US dollar, euro
     and Japanese yen and extended to the non-bank sector entities in the country. Bank loans
     include both cross-border bank loans and locally-extended bank loans. The non-financial
     sector includes non-financial firms, households and the government, while the non-bank
     sector includes non-bank financial firms in addition to the non-financial sector. The debt
     securities data are from the BIS International Debt Securities Statistics, while the bank
     loan data from the BIS Locational Banking Statistics. The BIS International Debt Secu-
     rities Statistics also provide data on the value of FX-denominated debt securities issued
     by the government. In order to focus on FX-denominated debt securities issued by non-
     financial firms, we subtract the value of FX-denominated debt securities issued by the
     government from total FX debt. When we use the country-level total FX debt, the val-
     ues denominated in the euro and Japanese yen are converted into those in the US dollar
     using the quarter-end exchange rate.

  2. Total credit to the non-financial sector. The BIS Total Credit database provides data on
     total credit to the non-financial sector. Total credit includes all forms of credit (including
     both loans and debt securities) extended by banks and non-banks in all currencies. The
     database also provide data on total credit broken down into the following three sectors:
     non-financial firms, households and the government.

  3. Based on (1) and (2), we compute the FX debt share of each country as the ratio of FX
     debt to total credit to the non-financial sector. Note that both FX debt and total credit
     include both loans and debt securities.

  4. Firm-level total debt. From the ORBIS database, we obtain the value of total debt out-
     standing reported in the balance sheets of each firm's annual reports.




                                               31
5. Finally, we multiply the FX debt share for an economy by firm-level total debt for all
  firms located in the economy, to estimate the amount of firm-level FX debt outstanding.
