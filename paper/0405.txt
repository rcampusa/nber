                   Inequality Within and   Between Families


                                  ABSTRACT



            Between—family differences in expenditures arid   output   reflect

the effect of simultaneous increases in children's ability on the

willingness of parents to transfer resources to them. Within—family

differences also reflect the attitudes of parents toward disparity among

children. In this paper we characterize the conditions on parents'

preferences that determine whether between—family differences exceed

within—family differences. For an additive utility, within—family

differences in expenditures always exceed between—family differences.

This may also be true for the max—mm utility function if an increase

in ability reduces the marginal utility of income. Within—family

differences in output (utility or income) can also exceed between—family

differences. In this case, the implication for income distribution is

that equality is enhanced by a higher correlation of ability between

brothers.

1.       Introduction

     A major goal of government policy is to affect the income distribution

between individuals in society. There are, however, other social institu-

tions which affect the income distribution and their actions may either

reinforce or countervail those of the government. The family plays a major

role in this respect. The effect of the family on the distribution of

income depends on the variation in individual characteristics within and

between families and on the rules for allocation of family resources. We

are interested in a particular aspect of this problem: the allocation of

parental resources among children of different abilities and its effect on

the distribution of their future income and welfare.

     The nature of the problem can be illustrated by means of a very simple

example. Consider two families, each consisting of two children. Let the

parents of each family have the same wealth. Children are distinguished

solely by their endowed ability. Suppose that half the children's popula-

tion is of 'high ability' and half of 'low ability.' One possibility is

that all differences in ability are within families and hence each family

has one 'able' and one 'less able' child. Another possibility is that

differences are only between families where one family has two 'able'

children and the other has two 'less able' children. We would like to

compare the distribution of inputs, e.g., schooling expenditures, and the

distribution of outputs, that is, income and utility, in the above two

cases.

     As noted by Griliches [1978], the relevant question for this comparison

is whether a given difference in ability leads to a larger difference in

expenditures or income within families than across families. This issue

is quite separate from the one analyzed by Becker and Tomes [1976] who

inquired whether parents invest more resources in the relatively able child.

This latter question is relevant for the comparison of the family's optimal

redistributive policy to the hypothetical policy of no intervention.

     The purpose of this paper is to characterize the properties of parental

preferences that are relevant for the comparison of within— and between—

family differences. We limit our discussion to parents' utility functions

which are symmetric in children's utility. It is assumed that utilities

are comparable within the family. Much of our discussion will focus on

two special cases that have received attention in the social choice

literature: the additive (utilitarian) and the max—mm (utility equaliza-

tion) functions. Both rules can be justified as egalitarian. The max—mm

principle is egalitarian ex post, while the utilitarian principle is

egalitarian ex ante, equalizing the expected utility of each (unborn)

child (see Harsanyi [1975], Myerson [1979] and Appendix). We assume that

the utility of each child depends on the transfers he receives from his

parents and on his ability. This has to be interpreted as the indirect

utility function in which all future individual actions have been

'maximized out.'

     Much of the analysis hinges upon the interaction between children's

abilities and parents' expenditures in the indirect utility function.

This, in turn, depends on the feasible methods of transferring resources
                                   3




within the family. If parents can make positive and negative direct

transfers that are not conditional on schooling and if ability affects

utility only through the production of earnings, then it is possible to

separate efficiency from distributive considerations (see Becker and

Tomes [1976)). In this case, the differences in schooling expenditures

within and between families are identical. In our analysis we assume that

such separation is not feasible, either due to the fact that ability may

affect utility directly or due to limits on parents' power to enforce

negative transfers on their grown—up children. In this sense our analysis

is similar to Arrow [1971] and Behrman, Pollack and Taubman [1979] who,

however, did not compare within— and between—family differences.

     Between—family differences in expenditures and outputs reflect the

effect of simultaneous increases in children's ability on the willingness

of parents to transfer resources to them. Within—family differences also

reflect the attitudes of parents towards disparity among children. In this

paper we characterize the conditions on parents' preferences that determine

whether between—family differences exceed within—family differences. For

an additive utility, within—family differences in expenditures always

exceed between—family differences. This may also be true for the max—mm

utility function if an increase in ability reduces the marginal utility of

income. Within—family differences in output (utility or income) can also

exceed between—family differences. In this case, the implication for

income distribution is that equality is enhanced by a higher correlation

of ability between brothers.

2.      Analysis of Family Allocation Rules

        Consider a family consisting of parents and two children. Denote

the consumption of parents by c and the expenditures on each child by
                                                                                              s1
and s2, respectively. The indirect utility function of each child,                                 is
                                                                                         u,
written u1= u(s.,a.), i =              1,2,   where a. is an index of child i's ability

and                   0,           0. Parents seek       to rnaxfrize   a utility function,

V., which depends on their own consumption and on the utility levels of their

children,


(1)               V =
                           V(c,u(s1,a1),u(s2,a2)),

where V is assumed to be strictly monotone, quasi—concave and symmetric in

the last two arguments, i.e.,


(2)               V(c,x1,x2) =      V(c,x2,x1)            V c,x1,x2 >   0.


        The family's budget constraint is given simply by


(3)               c + s + S2 = in


where m is the family's wealth, to beallocated by the parents.1

       Naximization of (1) subject to (3) yields solutions

                  and (a1,a2). Wealth will be assumed constant throughout most

of the discussion and hence the dependence on in                  is    suppressed. It is also

assumed that these solutions are strictly positive. Our discussion focuses

on the following properties of these solutions:

      (2) Within—Family Differences in Inputs and Outputs (Becker and

Tomes [1976]). For a1 >                                           and similarly
                                 a2, whether 1(a1,a2) -- 2(a1,a2)
for utility levels, i1(a1,a2) - c12(a1,a2); that is, whether heterogeneous

families whose children have different abilities reinforce or compensate

for these ability differences;

      (3) Between—Family Differences in Inputs and Outputs. For a1 > a2,

whether 1(a1,a1) --         2(a2,a)   and Ci1(a1,a1) --   ci2(a2,a2); that is,whether
expenditures and utility increase or decrease with ability across homogeneous

families whose children's abilities are perfectly correlated.

      (4) Comparison of Within— and Between—Family Differences in Inputs and

Outputs (Griliches [1978]). For any pair (a1,a2), whether 1(a1,a2) —

             is    larger or smaller than I1(a1,a1) —
                                                              2(a2,a2)l.    Similarly,

whether i11(a1,a2) —                      is larger or smaller than ci1(a1,a1) —
                             i2(a1,a2)I
                 that    is, for given ability differences, whether differences

within heterogeneous families are larger or smaller than differences across

homogeneous families.

      For purposes of exposition we start with a simplified version of the

above problem which brings out its essential features. Suppose that

ability affects utility only through its effect on earnings capacity and
                                                                                   =
that the production function is multiplicative, i.e., u. =             u(sa.)
f(a.s.),   i =    1,2.    Utility is thus identified with (observable) income

and, without loss of generality, we can assume that f(a.s.) =              a.s,.
      The problem can now be reduced to a standard consumer model:


(4)              Max
                         V(c,u1,u2)

where p. =    -i--, i   = 1,2.   With this formulation, the dependence of inputs

on own ability is determined by whether demand elasticity is less than or
                                               s.
larger than unity in absolute value:                =   —p              ,    i=          1,2.       The

dependence of outputs (i.e., utilities) on own ability is determined by

the slope of the uncompensated demand functions:                   = —p.    2 ii.1.i            =   1,2,
                                                             --—
                                                               1             ---——,
                                                                                     i
which is generally assumed to be negative.

     The more able child will obtain larger inputs if and only if

from a state of equality, there are two opposing forces at work. An

increase in ability of one child increases his efficiency in producing

earnings. On the other hand, since his utility is higher, it reduces

the relative weight given to him in the parents' utility. The outcome

is therefore ambiguous (see Becker and Tomes [1976]). In contrast, there

is no ambiguity with respect to within—family differences in utility.

Proposition 1.           < U2 as        a2.

Proof. Let a1 >

Then p1i1 + p22 >              + p2i11. However, by symmetry, V(c,ia1,i2) =
                         p12
                for any c. By strict quasi—concavity, there exists therefore
V(c,1a2,ii1),
a feasible allocation that yields a higher V. Hence, (c11,C12) cannot be

optimal J.

composite good p(u1+u2), where p is some base level of ability.

Between—family differences in expenditures depend on the uncompensated

cross elasticity of parents' consumption with respect to this composite

good.


Proposition 2.      If    is a gross—substitute (complement) to u1+u2 then,

among homogeneous families, expenditures increase (decrease) with the

children' s ability.

        Increased ability of children has two opposing effects on parents'

consumption:. an income effect which is likely to induce higher consumption

by parents and a substitution effect which encourages an increase in

expenditures on children and a reduction in parents' consumption.

        We are now ready to compare within— and between—family differences in

inputs and outputs.

Proposition 3. If ,                    and 2 are all either gross—substitutes or gross—

in expenditures. Specifically, for a1 >

When the goods are gross—substitutes, all inequalities are reversed in the

case of gross—complements.


Proof. The middle inequality follows from Proposition 2. The other two

Proposition 4. If ,                   and £2 are gross—substitutes then within—family

Proof.     The middle inequality follows immediately from Proposition 3 since

the allocation of expenditures within the family reinforces ability

differences. The other inequalities follow directly from the assumption .


      Contrary     to the previous case, gross—complementarity does not imply

the same result. Indeed, we have the following.


Proposition 5. If              and        are gross—complements, then between—family

differences exceed within—family differences in utility. Specifically,

       The above propositions can be used to determine the implications of

alternative specifications of the family utility function for the allocation

of family resources.

       We shall examine these implications for the ex ante (additive utility)

and for the ex post (max—mm) egalitarian criteria.


      A. Additive Utility

       Let V have the form


(8)
              V(c,u(s1,a1)        ,u(s2,a2)) = w(c)   + v(u1) +
                                                                       v(u2)

where   u.1   =   a.s.,
                   11     I =    1,2,   and w and v are monotone, strictly concave

functions. In this case, the conditions of Propositions 1—5 depend solely on

the signs of
                    a        =   v'(u.)   + u.v"(u.), i =       1,2.    If the marginal utility

of expenditures increases with ability for both                         and 2 then        and

  will be gross—substitutes. In the opposite case all goods are gross—

complements. Hence, for an additive utility function, within—family

differences always exceed between—family differences in expenditures.

       On the other hand, within—family differences exceed or are less than

      between—family differences in utility according as the marginal

utility of expenditures increases or decreases with ability.

                                                tnin[v(u1),v(u2))

where u. =   a.s,,   1   1,2. Clearly,      =      and hence these are gross—

complements. Thus, only Propositions 2, 3 and 5 are potentially applicable.

As in the previous case, it can be shown that &        Is    a gross—complement to

      (and    if and only if v'(u.) + u.v"(u.) <      0,    i =   1,2.
        In this case the max—mm function too entails that within—family

differences exceed between—family differences in expenditures. Since the

conditions of Proposition 5 hold, between—family differences exceed

within—family differences in utility. In particular, therefore, the

max—mm criterion implies that an able child enjoys a lower utility level

in a heterogeneous family than in a homogeneous family. This may raise a

question with regard to the 'fairness' of the max—mm criterion in the

present context. That is, if children or parents compare utilities across

families, then within—family equalization may be judged unfair towards

the able child. The ex ante egalitarian (sum of utilities) rule bypasses

this difficulty since it accounts for the chance of the able child to be

born into a family with another able child.2

       As the above two examples Illustrate, within—family differences may

well exceed between—family differences in expenditures. Variations in

children's ability induces two kinds of transfers from parents to children

and among children. These may reinforce or offset each other. In the

additive case the same cause that leads parents to transfer resources to

the able (or less able) child, namely, his higher marginal utility, also

induces them to transfer resources from his brother if he is of different
                                                    11




ability. In the max—mm case parents may also transfer resources to their

less able child if they perceive his marginal utility to be higher. If

children within the family have different abilities, parents will also

transfer resources from the able to the less able, thereby reinforcing

between—family differences. In the opposite case, however, when the

marginal utility of the able child is higher, then in homogeneous families

parents will be willing to transfer resources to them, but in heterogeneous

families parents will tax the able child in favor of the less able.

Between— and within—family differences in expenditures will therefore be

of opposite sign.

       Consider now the more general case of nonlinear 'production functions'

u. =   u(s.,a),   i =    1,2.       Since u               is strictly monotone in s, one can

invert u to obtain s. =
                          1
                                e(u.,a.),
                                   1 1
                                                     I =    1,2.   With this transformation the

maximization problem is


(10)          Max V(c,u1,u2)
            c ,u1 ,u2

            s.t. c+p1u1+p2u2 =                 m




where p (u.,a1)
                        e(u. ,a.)
                              1 1
                                     ,    j   =    1,2.    Previously we have analyzed the case

in which e. is linear in u. and hence p. is independent of u, giving rise

to a standard consumer problem. In the present case, Propositions 1—5 have

to be reinterpreted as describing outcomes of shifts in the 'supply

functions,' p.(u.,a.), due to changes in a.. For instance,                           and 112 are

gross—substitutes when                   < 0, i           j. However, such relations now depend
                                J
jointly on utility, V, and on the'production function,' u.

 3.     Unobservable Utilities

        In the previous section we have assumed that the utility of children

 can be directly observed and have placed restrictions on parents'

 preferences. When children's utilities are unobservable one cannot

 separately identify the functional forms of parents' and children's

 utilities. Meaningful restrictions must therefore be in terms of

 expenditure allocation patterns. As before, we shall investigate two

 cases, the additive and the max—mm utility functions.


        A. Additive Utility

        Let


 (11)         V(c,u(s1,a1),u(s2,a2)) =    w(c)   + v(s1,a1) + v(s2,a2)


where w and v are strictly concave with respect to c and s.,.

        The crucial restriction to this specification is that the marginal

 rate of substitution between parents' consumption and expenditures on

 child i are independent of the ability of child j, j           i.

        A very simple geometrical argument can be used to show that the

 results in the previous section pertaining to the additive specification

 carry over to the present, more general case. Specifically, within—family

 differences always exceed between—family differences in expenditures.

        In Figure 1, we depict the solutions for each of the first—order

conditions (F.O.C.) of the problem:


                   =   —w   (m—s1—s2) + v1(s1,a1) = 0
               2
 (12)

                   =   —w
                            (m—s1—s2) + v1(s2,a2) = 0


where v1 = Bv/Bs.

     Strict concavity implies that the curves are negatively sloped and inter—

sectat point c ((,a), 2(a,a)). Consider initially the allocationwhen

the two children are of equal ability, say, a1 = a2 =                 . Due   to symmetry

the two curves must intersect on the 45° line at point a. Suppose now that

the ability of the second child is reduced to a2 = a <                . Due    to the

additive specification, only the curve               = 0 shifts. Suppose that

v12(s,a) > 0.    Then the solution corresponding to this variation must be

below the 45° line, that is, at point c, expenditures on the able exceed

those on the less able child. Furthermore, the solution for the case

a1 = a2 = a is at point b, so as seen,

                                                       s(,a)
This chain is reversed when v12(s,a) < 0.                 Thus, in this case too, within—

family differences exceed between—family differences.


       B. Max-uiin

       Let


(13)         V(c,u(s1,a1),u(s2,a2)) =         w(c)     + min[v(s1,a1),v(s2,a2)]


       Assuming, as we have throughout, that the solution is strictly

positive, maximization of (13) is equivalent to the maximization of (11)

subject to the constraint


(14)         u(s1,a1) —                 = 0
                             u(s2,a2)

       The F.0.C. can be written


                    =                                              0

                    =                   + (1-X)v1(s2,a2) = 0
                        —w'(m—s1—s2)


where —1 <    A <       1 is the Lagrange multiplier associated with (14). We may

use the same diagram as before to analyze the solution. Suppose initially

that a1 =         =   a.   Then (14) is described by the 45° line and the solution
             a2
is 1(a,a) =
                  2(a,a).      Now decrease a2 to a <       a.
       Suppose that v12(s,a) < 0.         The curve —w' +                    = 0 shifts
                                                                 v1(s2,a2)
upwards as described and intersects the curve —w' +                            = 0 at point b.
                                                                    v1(s1,a)
The curve that represents contraint (14) also shifts upwards. It can be

shown that if

4.     Wealth Effects

       The attitude of families towards inequality among children depends, in

general, on the family's wealth. A natural question is whether inequality

increases or decreases with the level of wealth. This can be easily

analyzed within the framework of Section 2. For the additive case,

attitudes towards inequality in output are summarized by the index —

Specifically,        from the F.0.C., when
                                                      u1 > u2 (i.e., a1 > a2),

                       F.
                     d(u 1 —u)

                                     = sgn
(17)           sgn          dm                  L'
       Although for choices under risk the index of absolute risk—aversion,
—   s--, is   generally assumed to be decreasing in u, it is perhaps more

plausible to assume the opposite when the degree of inequality within

families is concerned.

       The inequality in expenditures is related to family preferences by


                     d(s1 —s 2)
(18)           sgn                   =      d Iv(u)
                            dm           sgn— LvIu2

for         > u2 (i.e., a1 > ag). The condition that —                    decreases in u is
                                     d(s1—s2)                     .
clearly     sufficient for                                 .
                                                > 0. This may imply, however, an increase

or a decrease in inequality depending on the sign of                     S1 2 Note further
that if —         is   increasing in u, that is, the family prefers higher equality

in outputs as wealth increases, the inequality in expenditures may increase

with wealth.
                                                       17




       Under the max—mm criterion full equality in outputs is attained at

all wealth levels. In terms of expenditures, however,

       For     a1 >   a2,       and hence       <             this    implies that inequality increases

with wealth.


5.     Efficient Allocations

       Throughout the discussion we have assumed that parents' transfers to

children interact with ability in the indirect utility function. Typically,

ability interacts with schooling expenditures in the production of earnings.

However, if there are other modes of direct wealth transfers then at the

optimum, unless ability affects utility directly, the level of utility is

independent of ability. Suppose that the production function of earnings,

y, is given by u =               f(s,a).    The indirect utility function, u, is u(x+y),

where x is direct wealth transfers from parents. The family's problem is

restated as


(20)                   Max
                                      V(c,u(f(s1,a1) +x1),u(f(s2,a2) +x2))
                c,s1,s2,x1,x2
                s.t. C      +         + 2 +        +          = in
                                 5
       If     negative x. are admissible then, at the optimum, utility of children

is fully equalized and the allocation                                and        satisfies f1(1,a.) = 1,

i =    1,2.    We shall refer to this as the efficient solution. In contrast to

the previous discussion, the allocation of .                               to   each child depends only on

his own ability. Thus, between— and within—family differences coincide.
                                    18




       The efficient solution will also be attained when schooling decisions

are made outside the family, either by individuals with access to the

capital market or by a planner who can enforce income transfers across

individuals.

       In the absence of direct income transfers, the family's allocation of

expenditures will generally not be efficient.3 Distributive considerations

will also play a role since the allocation to each child depends on family

income and on his brother's ability. It is impossible to compare the

second—best allocation to the efficient one. If family's wealth happens

to be at the level that would yield the same total expenditure on children

as in the efficient allocation, then the distribution of expenditure within

the family will be less favorable to the able one than the efficient

allocation.4 At other levels of family income the two allocation rules

are not comparable.


6.     Implications for the Distribution of Income

       The implications of our analysis       the distribution of income can be

described simply in the framework of the model presented in Section 2.

Suppose that the earnings function, y, is of the form:


(21)        y =   (as)1

and that the family allocation rule is approximated by:


               log s1                    log a1
(22)                      =
               log   2        ct2        log a2


       Due to Proposition 1, 1+a1,ct2 >    0. Denoting by c the variance of
log x, we can write the variance of the log of children's earnings as
                                     19




            a2 =
(23)
                   y202((l+ct1)2 +        2pct2(1+c1))

where p is the correlation in ability between brothers. Assumingthat y.

has a negatively sloped demand, 1+a. >        0,   i =        1,2.   Suppose that       <    0.
This corresponds to the case in which the two children can be viewed as

gross—substitutes. In the case of no systematic differences in ability

between families p will be zero, while if p =            1.   all differences in ability

are between families. The implication of Proposition 2 is that income

inequality will be larger in the former case.

       The interaction of a positive correlation between children' ability

and negative within—family cross effects reduces the inequality in

earnings relative to the case of random assignments of children to

families. Since within—family differences in income exceed between—

family differences, income equality is enhanced by a more egalitarian

distribution of ability in the family. The converse holds when 2 > 0,

i.e., when children are gross—complements.

       In the extreme case of only between—family differences, i.e., p = 1,

the family affects the income distribution only through transfers from

parents to children. If it is assumed that parents' consumption is a

gross—substitute to children's utility (income), i.e.,                       >   0,   then

the family can be viewed as contributing to inequality relative to the

case of no intervention, i.e.,       =
                                          2 = 0.    If the correlation between

children's ability is less than unity, then the family will have an

additional effect on inequality due to transfers of earnings capacity

among children. This contribution to income inequality will be positive

if 2 > 0, and negative if 2 < 0.
                                 20




     The analysis can be extended to incorporate variations in family

wealth. As explained in Section 4, family wealth is likely to interact

with ability in the family allocation rule. Furthermore, it is probable

that children's ability and parents' income are correlated. In principle,

one can derive from these relations the intergenerational laws of motion

for the income distribution (see Becker and Tomes [19791), but we shall

not pursue this issue here.

                                  Footnotes


1. Future earnings of children are not subject to redistribution and are
    reflected in the indirect utility of each child. For a case in which
    the allocation scheme also affects the size of wealth to be distributed,
    see Green and Sheshinski [1975].

2. One may view such ex ante evaluation as irrelevant, insisting on ex post
    fairness and yet be satisfied with a weaker form of within—family
    equalization. One plausible rule is to maximize the sum of children's
    utilities subject to the constraint that neither receives less than he
    would have received if all children had his ability.

3. In some special cases, the efficient solution is attained even in the
    absence of direct transfers. In particular, if V1(c,u,u) = V2(c,u,u) =
    V3(c,u,u) for any c and u (e.g., V(c,u1,u2) = F(c+u1+u2) +
    then in families with identical children the allocation will be efficient.
    In this case, between—family differences are identical to the differences
    that exist when income transfers are feasible. However, within—family
    differences are not efficient.

4. The within—family allocation satisfies


                   — V2(u1,u2)
         _________ —
                      V1(u1,u2)
   Assume a1 > a2; then due to symmetry and quasi—concavity of V, u1 > u2
   and V1(u1,u2) < V2(u1,u2) at the optimum. Thus, the ratio on the R.H.S.
   is larger than 1. The efficient allocation satisfies

         f1(s,a1) —
         f12 ,a2)
   By assumption, 4 +   s =       + 2 and f   0. It must therefore be the
                                              <
   case that    <
                 4, s2>  s. This is the  comparison made by Behrman, Pollak
   and Taubman [199] who assume that total expenditures are independent of
   children's ability and, accordingly, test for the concavity of V. They
   find that parents' utility is concave in children's incomes and that the
   allocation of expenditures is therefore inefficient. In general, however,
   total expenditures will depend on children's ability, giving rise to
   between—family differences.

        The purpose of this appendix is to prove the equivalence of ex ante

egalitarianism and ex post utilitarianism in the context of redistribution

within the family.

        A family consists of parents (viewed as a single unit) and k children,

denoted by i, i =       1,2,•••,k.   Let a. denote the ability of child i and

a =                       It is assumed that a is a random vector with proba-
      (al,a2,...,ak).

        Consider the following two problems.

where


            E[x(a)] =    ff".fx(a)dF(a).

        Denote the solution to this problem by sA(a).

        B. Ex Post Utilitarianism

        For a given vector a,

                                  k                           k
(A.3)              Max                u(s.,a.) + w(rn —            s.).
             Sl,S2,Sk i=i                                    i=l


        Denote the solution to this problem by sB(a).


Theorem. If the probability function F(a) is symmetric, i.e., F(a) =

F(a'),   where a' is a permutation of a, then Problems A and B are equivalent,
         A          B
i.e., s (a) = s (a) for all a.


Proof. The F.O.C. of Problem A are

                                       k                    k
(A.4)        u1(s1(a),a1)(i —               A..) — w'(m —         s.)   =   0,
                                      i=2                   i=i

                         k
(A.5)        —w'(m —
                         1=1
                               s,) + X.u1(s(a),a.) =        0,     i =   2,3,",k

and (A.2), where X2X3•••Ak are k—i constants.

        The F.C.C. for Problem B are


(A.6)          u1(s.,a.) —       w'(m   —            = 0,   i =    i,2,",k.

        Set A. =   1/k   in (A.4) and (A.5). Then the solution to (A.6) satisfies

(A.4) and (A.5). We shall show that this solution also satisfies (A.2) and

hence is a solution of Problem A.

        Consider a solution to (A.6) associated with a =

and a permutation a' =                                            Relabeling the solution
                                 (a.,a2,...,al,...,a.K).
correspondingly, the same set of equations is seen to be satisfied. That

is, the following symmetry condition holds:                                        -
                                             A-3



(A.7)        s1(a1,a2, •,a., • ,a,) =              s.(a.,a2,•• ',a1,    ••


Therefore,

(A.8)        E[u(s.(a),a.)]

             =



Relabeling    variables


             =   If.. .fu(s.(a.,a2,   ••
                                           • ,a, • • • ,a,) ,a1)dF(a.   ,a2,
                                                                               •
                                                                                   ,a,   •   ••



by (A.7) and the symmetry of F(a),

             =
                 ff".fu(s1(a1,a2,...,a.,. •.,ak),al)dF(al,a2,...,a.,...,ak)
             =
                 E[u(s1(a),a1)].

thus satisfying (A.2).


Remark. The above theorem can be illustrated geometrically for a family

with two children whose respective abilities assume the values (a,a) and

(a,a) with equal probabilities. Due to symmetry, (A.7), the same total

  + s =          will be distributed to the children in both cases. The

efficient utility pairs (u1,u2), given , corresponding to the two realiza-

tions are the curves AA and BB in Figure A.1. Pairs that yield equal

expected utilities must be equally distant from the 45° line. The pair

that yields the highest equal levels of expected utilities is such that

the line connecting them is bisected by the 45° line and is tangent to

both utility frontiers. Such a line exists because of symmetry of the

utility frontiers. The implied allocations, a on AA and b on BB, maximize

the sum of utilities for each realization of the ability vector.
