Copyright and Creativity. Evidence from Italian Opera During the Napoleonic Age

NBER Working Paper No. 26885
March 2020
JEL No. K0,N23,O3,O34

                                          ABSTRACT

This paper exploits exogenous variation in the adoption of copyrights ­ as a result of the timing
of Napoléon's military victories in Italy ­ to examine the effects of copyrights on creativity. To
measure changes in creative output we compare changes in the creation of new operas across
states with and without copyrights. Difference-in-differences analyses show that basic copyrights
increased both the number and the quality of operas, measured by their popularity and durability.
Notably, there is no evidence of comparable benefits for extensions in copyright lengths.
Complementary analyses for other types of musical compositions confirm the main results.

Copyrights establish intellectual property rights in creative goods ranging from literature and science
to images, film, and music. According to U.S. law, "the primary purpose of copyright law is to foster
the creation and dissemination of intellectual works" (General Revision of the U.S. Copyright Laws
1961, p.5). Yet, systematic empirical evidence on the effects of copyrights on creativity continues to be
scarce. Existing analyses of copyrights have exploited variation in exposure to piracy but found no
significant effects on sales or on the quality of popular music (Oberholzer-Gee and Strumpf 2007,
Waldfogel 2012). Starting from low levels of existing protection, stronger copyrights have been shown
to raise the price of content in literature (Li et al. 2018) and science (Biasi and Moser 2019).1 Analyses
of book contracts further suggest that stronger copyrights increase payments to authors (MacGarvie
and Moser 2014). Despite these contributions, however, existing research has been unable to identify
the causal effects of copyrights on the creation of new works.
        This paper exploits exogenous variation in the adoption of copyright laws ­ as a result of the
timing of Napoléon's military victories in Italy ­ to examine the effects of copyrights on creativity. In
1796, Napoléon began his Italian campaign by invading the Kingdom of Sardinia at Ceva. Although he
was unable to subdue Sardinia at the time, two other states, Lombardy and Venetia, were annexed and
formed the Cisalpine Republic, which adopted French laws. In 1801, the Republic adopted France's
copyright laws of 1793, granting composers exclusive rights for the duration of their lives, plus ten
years for their heirs (Legge 19 Fiorile anno IX repubblicano, Art.1-2). In 1804, France replaced its
system of feudal laws and aristocratic privilege with the code civil, a codified system of civic laws.
The code left copyrights intact where they already existed, but did not introduce them in states without
copyright laws. As a result, only Lombardy and Venetia offered copyrights until the 1820s (Foà 2001,
p.64), while all other Italian states that came under French rule after 1804 had no copyrights, even
though they shared the same exposure to French rule, as well as the same language and culture.2
        The empirical analysis examines rich new data on 2,598 operas that composers created across
eight Italian states between 1770 and 1900.3 These data offer a unique opportunity to examine the
effects of copyrights on creativity. First, because opera is a public art form for which output is easily
observed, records of new pieces are exceptionally complete. Moreover, because aficionados of operas
have created unparalleled archival records on notable performances, it is possible to create alternative
measures for the "quality" of operas, capturing variation both in the immediate popularity and in the

  Li et al. (2018) find that extensions in the length of copyrights increase the price of books by improving publishers' ability
to practice intertemporal price discrimination. For music, Scherer (2004, pp.195-196) compares the number of composers
across countries with and without copyrights but finds no effects of copyrights on country-level counts of composers.
2
  Acemoglu, Cantoni, Johnson, and Robinson (2011) show that German states that were more exposed to occupation by
France (and thereby the code civil) experienced higher rates of subsequent growth. While the current analysis focuses on
copyrights, we also estimate robustness checks with controls for variation in exposure to French rule.
3
  We chose the beginning and end of our sample based on the periodization of opera: 1770 is the beginning of the bel canto
period, characterized by a vocal technique that emphasizes beauty of sound over dramatic expression. 1900 is the final year
of the verisimo, a period or realism, associated with composers such as Giacomo Puccini.


                                                                                                                                   2
durability of operas. These features of opera create an exceptional measure for analyses of creativity
that would be impossible to replicate in modern data.
        Baseline estimates compare changes after 1801 in the number of new operas across Italian
states with and without copyrights. These estimates indicate that the adoption of basic copyright laws
led to a substantial increase in the creation of new operas. OLS estimates show that Lombardy and
Venetia created 2.2 more new operas per year after 1801 compared with other Italian states without
copyrights. Relative to a pre-1801 mean of 1.4 operas, this implies a 157-percent increase in the
creation of new operas. These estimates are robust to a broad range of alternative specifications. Even
when we exclude Milan and Venice (the cultural centers of Lombardy and Venetia), we find a 66-
percent increase in the creation of new operas. Importantly, pre-1801 trends in the creation of new
operas are comparable for Italian states with and without copyrights. Moreover, states with and without
copyrights are similar in terms of the pre-existing demand for opera (measured by the number of
theaters and by the number of theater seats), as well as in terms of population, GDP per capita, and
urbanization.
        In addition to influencing the number of new operas, copyrights may change the "quality" of
creative work by encouraging composers to create pieces that are more profitable.4 Without copyrights,
composers are only paid when they deliver the work, and derive no extra benefits from future
performances. Copyrights, which grant composers the right to charge theaters every time they perform
a piece, strengthen composers' incentives to create works that are more popular and durable.5
Historical letters and contracts between composers and theater managers document that composers
used the 1801 law to extract additional pay for repeat performances. These additional payments
increased composers' wealth, allowing them to spend more time on each piece. For a later period, the
poet Ezra Pounds (1885-1972) explained that such freedom is critical for encouraging creativity: "The
only thing one can give an artist is leisure in which to work. To give an artist leisure is actually to take
part in his creation" (Pound and Zinnes 1980, p.147). Anecdotal evidence suggests that even star
composers responded to these types of financial incentives. Gioacchino Rossini (1792-1868), for
example, announced that he would produce pieces that had "nothing new in them but the variations"
(Beyle 1824, pp.200-201) when he felt that theaters in Naples paid too little for his operas.
        Copyrights did in fact increase the "quality" of an opera, defined by its popularity and
durability. We construct three complementary measures for these economically important differences
in operas. Our first measure uses a standard reference of notable performances (Loewenberg 1978) to
capture differences in the immediate historical success and popularity of an opera. The second measure
identifies operas that were popular and durable enough to be performed at least once at the

 Importantly, we do not judge the artistic quality of operas and instead focus on their most economically relevant traits.

 Performance rights remained composers' main source of revenue until the mid-19th century (Scherer 2004, p.178). Britain
adopted performance rights in 1842, and the United States adopted them in 1870 (Scherer 2004, p.180).


                                                                                                                             3
Metropolitan opera house in New York in the 20th and early 21st century. The third measure
investigates the most durable operas that are still available for purchase on Amazon in the 2010s.
Analyses for all three measures suggest that copyrights changed the quality of operas, by encouraging
composers to create more popular and durable works.
        Composer-level regressions confirm the main results. Controlling for differences in the
productivity of individual authors, composers created twice as many new operas when they had
copyrights. Importantly, there is no evidence for a brain drain from other Italian states to Lombardy
and Venetia after 1801. Instead, we find the adoption of copyrights encouraged Italian-born émigré
composers to return to Lombardy and Venetia after 1801. Even controlling for return migrants,
however, other Italian composers who had never worked abroad produced more operas when they had
copyrights. Return migrants, who were more productive than the average composer, made substantially
larger contribution to the quality than to the quantity of operas.
        Between 1826 and 1840, all remaining states adopted copyrights as part of Italy's process
towards unification; we find that these copyrights adoptions were associated with an increase in
creativity. Most, if not all of these changes, were driven by political processes leading to Italy's
unification in 1861, unrelated to the creation of new operas. Confirming the main results, Italian states
produced more new operas when they had copyrights. They also produced more popular and durable
works.
        Copyright extensions, however, appear to have minimal effects on creativity, at best. In 1998
"Mickey Mouse" Copyright Term Extension Act increased US copyrights from the duration of the
creator's life plus 50 years to life plus 70 years.6 These extensions are set to expire in 2023, setting the
stage for discussions on further increases in the length of copyrights. Compared with today, 19th-
century extensions started from much lower levels, increasing copyrights from a base of the
composer's life, plus ten years for their heirs. Even in this setting, we find that extensions were
associated by a decline in creative output.
        We use performance data to show that few pieces are durable enough to benefit from copyright
extensions beyond their author's life. In that case, the dynamic costs of long-lived copyrights for future
creativity outweighs the benefits of longer terms. Recent research on copyrights has documented these
costs. For example, Nagaraj (2018) shows that copyrights discourage the re-use of images on
Wikipedia. Examining the case of US science, Biasi and Moser (2019) show that copyrights
discourage the creation of new science by raising the costs of accessing existing work.
        Did copyrights interact with pre-existing demand for entertainment? We answer this question
by exploiting detailed city-level data on theaters and theater seats. These data indicate no significant

differences in the level or the trend of pre-existing demand for states with and without copyrights until
1801. Instead, we find that cities with a better pre-existing theater infrastructure benefitted more from
copyrights.
         To investigate the generalizability of our findings, a final section examines the effects of
copyrights on librettos and on a broader set of musical compositions, including symphonies, operettas,
and songs. Under the 1801 Copyright Law, opera scores and librettos received separate copyrights.
Similar to composers, librettists benefitted from this change and were able to extract more revenue
from their work. Repeating our main analyses, we find that copyrights encouraged the creation of new
librettos, measured both by the count of new librettos and by the share of operas that used a new
libretto. We also find that the adoption of basic copyright protection encouraged the creation of new
musical works, confirming the finding based on operas. Taken together, these results suggest that the
adoption of copyrights encouraged creativity for larger set of creative goods beyond operas, including
their literary text and other types of musical compositions.

1. HISTORICAL BACKGROUND

       Opera was an exceptionally popular form of entertainment in 18th- and 19th-century Europe.
Beyle (1824, p.9), describes the scene at a performance of Rossini's La Scala di Seta:

      "...an immense concourse of people, assembled from every quarter of Venice, and even from the
      Terra Firma...who, during the greater part of the afternoon, had besieged the doors; who had been
      forced to wait whole hours in the passages, and at last to endure the `tug of war' at the opening of
      the doors."

Theaters were managed by a professional agent (impresario), who identified a promising story,
procured a libretto, and then hired a composer to create a score (Valle 1823, p.155).7
       Composers typically took four to eight weeks to create a new opera. During this time, they
worked closely with singers and the orchestra at the commissioning theater (Valle 1823, p.157 and
Moore 1854, p.823). The Teatro Torre Argentina in Rome, for example, commissioned Gioacchino

                                                                                                             5
Rossini to compose Il Barbiere di Siviglia on December 17, 1815. Rossini stayed in Rome and Il
Barbiere premiered there roughly six weeks later, on February 5, 1816 (Panico 2002, p.62). In 1819,
Rossini complained: "...you know very well that scarcely six weeks are allowed me to compose an
opera" (Moore 1854, p.823).

1.1. Without Copyrights, Composers Received No Pay for Repeat Performances
        Without copyrights, composers were only paid for the initial composition opera, and had no
legal rights to demand additional fees when their works were performed again after the first
performance. Piracy was rampant and impresarios would

    "...either steal an authentic score (as a rule by bribing a copyist) or pirate it by getting a minor
    composer to work up a new orchestral setting from the printed vocal score [...]. An impresario who
    wanted to give a recent opera would commonly try to knock down the cost of hiring the authentic
    score by pointing out that he could get one elsewhere at half the asking price" (Rosselli 1996,
    p.74).8

Under these conditions, composers would "recycle some of the music in another opera and another
town" (Rosselli 1996, p.74).

1.2. Napoléon's Military Campaign in Northern Italy
        Napoléon's military campaign brought copyright laws to parts of Northern Italy in 1801. After
taking command of the French "Army of Italy" on March 11, 1796, Napoléon invaded the Kingdom of
Sardinia at Ceva on April 11, 1796. Between April 12 and 14, Napoléon defeated Sardinia's King
Vittorio Amedeo III in the battles of Cairo Montenotte, Dego, Millesimo, and Cosseria (in Liguria, a
region in the North-West of Italy), and in a decisive victory on April 19, 1796 near the town of
Mondovì (in Piedmont, about 50 miles from Turin). As a result of these victories, Sardinia granted
Nice and Savoy to France under the Treaty of Paris on May 15, 1796. In his campaign against Austria,
Napoléon conquered Verona on April 25, 1797, Venice on May 12, 1797, and Milan on May 14.9 On
June 29, 1797 Napoléon decreed the creation of the Cisalpine Republic (Repubblica Cisalpina) with
Milan as the capital. On August 5, Napoléon defeated the Austrian Army at Castiglione, forcing Kaiser
Franz to retreat. Austria acknowledged the Cisalpine Republic in the Treaty of Campoformio on
October 18, 1797, in exchange for what remained of the Venetian Republic. To curb Napoléon's grasp
on Europe, Piedmont, Austria, England, Russia, Turkey, and Sweden formed the Second Coalition
against France on March 12, 1799. Austria was defeated in the battle of Marengo (June 14, 1800) and

8
  In 1782, Mozart wrote to his father that he felt indebted to the Baron von Riedesel who had bought the score for Die
Entführung aus dem Serail from him instead of acquiring a cheaper version from a copyist (Scherer 2004 p.167).
9
  France had declared war on Austria on April 20, 1792, after Austria joined the first coalition against France, which had
formed between Great Britain, Prussia, Spain, Holland, and the Kingdom of Sardinia on April 6, 1792.


                                                                                                                             6
Napoléon invaded Venetia on June 20, 1800. Venetia officially became part of the French empire with
the Peace of Pressburg on December 26, 1805 (Pecout 1999, p.138).

1.3. Lombardy and Venetia Adopted Copyrights in 1801
       In 1793, France passed a copyright law to replace royal privileges, which had been abolished
by the French Revolution four years before (Appendix B).10 On May 9, 1801, Legge n. 423
(Repubblica Cisalpina, 19 florile IX) extended this law to Lombardy and Venetia.11 The 1801 law
granted exclusive rights to composers for as long as they lived, plus another 10 years for their heirs:

     "The authors of any type of writing, composers, painters, and designers who make paintings or
     drawing, will benefit for the entire duration of their lives from the exclusive right of selling, allowing
     to sell, and distributing their works in the Cisalpine Territory, and of ceding their property to others
     (in its entirety or in parts). Their heirs, or assignees, will have the same right for the duration of ten
     years after the death of the authors."12

        Due to the timing of Napoléon's military victories, only Lombardy and Venetia adopted
France's copyright law. On March 21, 1804, the Parliament of France adopted the (Napoléonic) code
civil, which was extended to all French dominions, including Lombardy and Venetia. The code was
agnostic about copyrights; it did not introduce them to states without copyright laws and left them in
place for states where copyrights existed already. As a result, Lombardy and Venetia kept their
copyright laws, while other Italian states that came under French rule after 1804, adopted the same
code civil, but without copyrights (Foà 2001, p.64): Sardinia (under French influence in 1804), Parma
(1805), Tuscany (1809), Naples (1812), and the Papal State (1812).13 Lombardy and Venetia's




10
   The 1793 law created exclusive publication rights for the duration of the composer's life plus 10 years, whereas a 1791
French law, which abolished censorship in the performing arts, had created exclusive performance rights for life plus 5
years. The 1791 law was codified as Article 428 of the code pénal of 1810.
11
   Even though Venice and other parts of Venetia had been granted to the King of Austria in the Treaty of Luneville in
1801, and officially remained under Austrian control until the Treaty of Pressburg in 1805, copyrights and other laws of the
Cisalpine Republic applied to Venetia in 1801. A description of the locations where the laws of the Cisalpine Republic
apply in 1801 specifically includes Venice and territories in Venetia (Raccolta di Tutte le Leggi ossia di Tutti i Proclami,
Editti ed Avvisi della Repubblica Cisalpina, reported in Appendix B). Also see Foà (2001, p.313) who writes that "after
Milan and Venice in 1801, the other major Italian city to adopt a copyright law was Rome in 1826."To check whether other
laws of the Cisalpine Republic may have influenced the creation of new operas, we examined all 414 laws, edicts, and
public announcements in the Cisalpine Republic between 1797 and 1805 in the "Raccolta di Tutte le Leggi ossia di Tutti i
Proclami, Editti ed Avvisi della Repubblica Cisalpina" (1807). None of these laws relate to copyrights or other elements of
artistic creativity. Instead, laws such as "Per la Consegna del Grano Turco," govern the delivery of corn, wheat, and other
crops, and define other elements of public order.

13
   Tuscany, the Papal States, and the Two Sicilies repealed the code civil in 1819 (Code civil italien 1866, pp.xxiv).




                                                                                                                               7
copyright laws also survived the 1815 Congress of Vienna, which placed Lombardy and Venetia under
the rule of Kaiser Franz I of Austria.14 Foà (2001, p.62) explains:

     "In Italy, the first acknowledgment of `the most sacred and precious of all properties'
     occurred with the Law of 19 Fiorile anno IX (May 9, 1801) of the Cisalpine Republic; it was
     followed by the Edict September 23, 1826 for Papal State, the Decree February 5, 1828 for
     the Kingdom of Two Sicilies, the Decree December 22, 1840 of Maria Luigia for the Duchy
     of Parma, Piacenza, and Guastalla."

The borders drawn by the Congress of Vienna remained intact until Italy's unification in 1861. We use
them to distinguish eight states within Italy: the Kingdom of Lombardy and Venetia, the Kingdom of
Sardinia (for simplicity, Sardinia), the Duchy of Parma and Piacenza (Parma), the Duchy of Modena
and Reggio (Modena), the Grand Duchy of Tuscany (Tuscany), the Papal State, and the Kingdom of
the Two Sicilies (Two Sicilies, Figure 1).15
       Operas that had premiered either in Lombardy or in Venetia were protected in Lombardy and
Venetia but not in other states. Censors, whose main role was to judge the content of an opera (and
eliminate "blasphemous" references to religions) were the first line of defense against illegal
reproductions. "Since the censors had to approve all new publications, anyone could apply directly to
them to stop publication of a work" (Jensen 1989, p.16). In a letter to Ricordi, Bellini describes how
the Governor of Catania stopped a pirated performance of La Sonnambula and confiscated its score:

     "I see that you're always thinking of the pirates of our Sonnambula: and do you believe that I sleep?
     I learned for a fact that the impresario in Catania, not being able to have the score [...] from you for
     a small price, had the score compiled and orchestrated [...] thereby he wanted to present it on the
     stage in Catania: the Governor, or Intendent of said city has been advised, and not only will he not
     permit it to be given, but if he is able, he will try to sequester the counterfeit score to punish the
     criminal for his crime" (Letter from February 18, 1832 cited in Jensen 1989, p.19).

        Performance data, which we describe in more detail below, indicate that enforcement was
effective. No opera that had premiered in Lombardy or Venetia after the adoption of copyrights in
1801 was performed by another theater in Lombardy and Venetia after 1801 (Appendix Table A1). But
operas that had premiered in Lombardy and Venetia before 1801 (and were therefore not protected
under the 1801 law) continued to be performed frequently in the same states. Similarly, operas that
premiered in other states after 1801 (and were therefore not protected by the laws of Lombardy and

legislation (Allgemeines Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch) reintroduced exceptions to the principle of equality, but left property
rights intact (Soresina 2018).
15
   The Congress of Vienna also created the Duchy of Lucca. Because Lucca remained under the influence of Tuscany and
was annexed by Tuscany in 1848, we treat Lucca as a part of Tuscany.

Venetia) continued to be performed in other states, including Lombardy and Venetia. For example,
Weinstock (1963, p.353) writes about a pirated performance of Donizetti's Roberto Devereux, which
had premiered in Naples in 1837: "A pirated version of it was sung at the Teatro Re, Milan, late in
1837 or early in 1838."

1.4. With Copyrights, Composers Were Paid for Repeat Performances
         The 1801 law entitled composers to charge royalties for repeat performances, starting with the
first repeat performance after the premiere (e.g., Jensen 1989, pp.8-10, 31). Systematic data on 19th-
century authors show that payments to authors increased in response to stronger copyrights
(MacGarvie and Moser 2014). Contracts between impresarios and composers document comparable
improvements in composers' pay as a result of the adoption of copyright in 1801. For example, the
composer Giuseppe Mosca (1772-1839) entered a contract with the impresario Francesco Benedetto
Ricci of Milan's Alla Scala theater in 1802, to compose the opera Chi Vuol Troppo Veder Diventa
Cieco. Their contract specifies:

  "Francesco Benedetto Ricci is obliged to pay Giuseppe Mosca the sum of 3,500 francs for the score
  and 250 francs for each repeat performance in the current season." (Contract between Francesco
  Benedetto Ricci and Giuseppe Mosca, January 16, 1802, Archivio dello Stato Centrale, Carte
  Sciolte N. 6268, reported in Appendix Figure A1, Panel A).

Writing from Venice in 1803, three years after the adoption of copyrights, the composer Stefano
Pavesi (1779-1850) uses a reference to the Venetian copyright law to demand additional pay from the
Teatro Regio in Turin:

   "It is not that I disregard your offer of 3,000 francs. But it is less than the pay I could get in Venice.
   There, I receive a sum of 200 francs for each repeat performance of my work since 1801" (Letter
   from Stefano Pavesi to Giacomo Pregliasco, November 3, 1803, Archivio dello Stato Centrale,
   Carte Sciolte N. 6253, reported in Appendix Figure A1, Panel B).

Another composer, Giovanni Pacini (1796-1867), acknowledges an offer from the impresario Angelo
Petracchi at the Alla Scala in Milan. In his letter to Petracchi, Pacini explicitly accepts payments for
repeat performances, starting from the current season:

   "Acknowledging the proposal you made on behalf of Alla Scala Theater in Milan for the Carnival
   season of 1820, I am delighted to accept 6,000 francs for the composition and 300 francs for each
   repeat performance starting in the same Carnival season of 1820." (Letter from Giovanni Pacini to
   Angelo Petracchi, December 12, 1819, Archivio dello Stato Centrale, Carte Sciolte N. 6261,
   reported in Appendix Figure A1, Panel C).




                                                                                                                9
Ubertazzi (2000, pp.47-48) confirms this increase in payments to composers as a consequence of the
adoption of copyrights in Lombardy and Venetia:

     "...while the Teatro Regio in Torino had started to become very famous at the beginning of 19th
     century, it faced no small challenge to attract successful composers, due to the absence of a
     copyright law compared with La Scala in Milan and La Fenice in Venice."

1.5. Other Italian States Adopt Copyrights Starting in 1826
        On September 28, 1826, an edict by Pope Leo XII (Editto n. 433, Stato Pontificio, Appendix B)
established exclusive rights in compositions, books, and other types of media for the duration of their
creator's life, plus 12 years for heirs. In 1828, a decree of Francesco I (1777-1830), King of the Two
Sicilies, created copyrights for the duration of the composer's life plus 30 years (Regio decreto 5
February 1828, n. 1904, Regno delle Due Sicilie). These were the longest copyright terms in all of
Italy. Four other states ­ Sardinia, Modena, Parma, and Tuscany ­ continued to offer no protection.
Without rules of reciprocity, copyrights from the Two Sicilies were enforceable only in the Two
Sicilies, and copyrights from the Papal State were limited to the Papal State.
        On June 26, 1840, Sardinia entered into a bilateral copyright treaty with Austria. This treaty
granted copyrights for the duration of the composer's life plus 30 years for heirs (Convenzione Austro-
Sarda 22 May 1840, Regno di Sardegna). Sardinia had emerged as a political leader in Italy's fight for
independence (Pecout 1999, p.158), and within weeks, all other Italians states (with the exception of
the Two Sicilies) joined Sardinia's treaty with Austria. This process introduced copyrights to Tuscany,
Modena, and Parma, and extended the length of existing copyright terms in Lombardy and Venetia
from life plus 10 to life plus 30 and in the Papal State from life plus 12 to life plus 30.16
        On March 17, 1861, five states ­ Lombardy, Modena, Parma, Tuscany, and the Two Sicilies ­
joined Sardinia to form the Kingdom of Italy (Pecout 1999, p.170). On June 25, 1865, the Kingdom's
first copyright law extended copyrights from life plus 30 to life plus 40 years (Legge 25 June 1865,
n.2337, It, Appendix B). On June 29, 1866, the Kingdom declared war on Austria, beginning the Third
War of Independence. With the Peace of Vienna (August 24, 1866), the Kingdom of Lombardy-
Venetia dissolved into the Kingdom of Italy, and a decree of King Vittorio Emanuele II extended the
Kingdom's laws to Venetia (Regio Decreto 4 November 1866, n.3300, It.). On September 20, 1870,
after the Breach of Porta Pia, Vittorio Emanuele II annexed the Papal State to the Kingdom of Italy



16
   Verdi and his publisher Ricordi used copyrights to levy hefty fees for each performance (of 400 Francs, roughly three
months' earnings for a building craftsman). In an 1850 letter to Verdi, Ricordi proposes price discrimination: "It is more
advantageous to provide access to these scores for all theaters, adapting the price to their special means, because I obtain
much more from many small theaters at the price of 300 or 250 Lire, than from ten or twelve at the price of a thousand"
(cited in Scherer 2004, pp.179). Verdi accepted the scheme and Ricordi enforced it through a team of field agents.


                                                                                                                               10
(Pecout 1999, pp.183-189). A decree on October 9 (Regio Decreto 9 October 1870, n.5903, It.)
extended the Kingdom's laws to the Papal State.
       Now all of Italy offered copyrights for the composer's life plus 40 years.

1.6. Interactions between Composers, Impresarios, and Publishers
        Impresarios and publishers played an important part in helping composers to extract profit from
their copyrights, and both benefitted from reduced competition as a result of copyrights. Without
copyrights, commissioning impresarios faced intense competition from other theaters, who did not
have to pay for the commission, but could copy and freely perform an opera if it turned out to be
successful. With copyrights, composers and their impresarios had the right to forbid unauthorized
repeat performances of their work (Art. 7 of 1801 Copyright Law). Exclusive rights to a new opera
improved the commissioning impresario's ability to practice inter-temporal price-discrimination and
extract a larger share of the consumer surplus created by new operas.17 As we document in Section 1.4,
theaters passed some of these extra profits on to composers, increasing their compensation.
         Over time, prominent publishers, like the famous Casa Ricordi (founded in 1808), also began to
take a more active role in helping composers to exploit copyrights, and publishers and composers often
worked together to protect their interests. Vincenzo Bellini (1801-1835) "and his Milanese publisher
(Ricordi) did not enjoy a warm relationship from their first association, but it developed during a joint
effort to fight pirated scores and the closely related matter of unauthorized performances" (Jensen
1989, p.5). Jensen (1989, p.14) explains that "publishers kept tight control of all full scores and
required rental fees for scores which someone wished to perform."
         Some composers would sell their rights to publishers, who were in a better position to
maximize returns. Bellini, for example, offered Ricordi the rights to all the works he would write from
1835 to 1838; Ricordi offered a similar contract to Verdi (Jensen 1989, p.31). Alternatively, theaters
would acquire rights to rent performance materials ("spartiti") and printing rights ("riduzioni") from
the composer at the time of the premiere, and then market these rights to publishers (Jensen 1989,
pp.8-10). In 1841, Alla Scala's impresario Merelli sold the performance rights to Verdi's first opera
Oberto to Ricordi to raise the necessary capital for production. When theaters could not afford to pay
the fees of Italy's favorite composers, they would turn to publishers for additional funds (Jensen 1989,
p.89). Such three-way agreements between the composer, impresario and the publisher became
common after 1845, when Ricordi won a comprehensive contract with Alla Scala (Jensen 1989, pp.11
and 19-20), but they were less common in the early 1800s, which are the focus of our analysis.



17
  Li, MacGarvie, and Moser (2014) show that extensions in the lengths of copyrights in 19th-century England enabled
publishers to practice intertemporal price discrimination and charge higher prices for Romantic period literature.


                                                                                                                      11
        Performance rights remained composers' main source of revenues until the 1850s: "...it took
the combination of copyright protection, Italians' love of opera, and the love of money shared by
Ricordi and Verdi to carry the reduction enterprise to its height of sophistication...In 1851, Verdi was
paid the unprecedented sum of 14,000 francs (£550) for the publication rights, not including
performance rental royalties, to Rigoletto" (Scherer 2004, p.178).

1.7. Collaborations between Composers and Librettists
        In the 18th and 19th century, "the writing of opera libretti was a precarious business. An
impresario would employ one or more `poets,' sometimes on a contracted basis with a salary, but often
on a more casual basis" (Black 1984, p.4). While successful librettists like Felice Romani (1777-1841)
became paid staff of a theater, "most librettists were theatrical hangers-on, amateurs or professionals"
(Black, 1984, p.5).18 More typically, the life of 19th-century librettists was a "history of dignified
misery, improvable only if they could steadily work with a successful composer" (Bianconi 1987,
p.259). 19th-century composers began to give librettists specific guidance about changes in the text
(Bianconi, 1987, pp.264-265). By the 1830s, an increasing number of composers chose their own
librettist, further shifting balance of power in favor of composers (Bianconi, 1987, p.269).19
         Importantly, the 1801 law granted separate copyrights for the score and the libretto (Article 1,
Appendix B, Treccani 2001, p.260). Unlike composers ­ who received additional payments for
performance rights ­ librettists continued to receive only lump sum payments from the theater
(Roccatagliati 1996, p.117). Copyrights, however, improved librettists' ability to derive additional
income from the sale of physical copies of their work (Treccani 2001, p.261). Like composers,
librettists also began to rely on publishers to profit more from copyrights. In 1812, for example, Luigi
Romanelli (1751-1839) signed an exclusive contract with Ricordi to publish the libretto of Tancredi,
which had premiered at Alla Scala a few weeks earlier. Ricordi paid Romanelli 1,000 Milanese lira for



18
   Many successful librettists were full-time professionals. Felice Romani (1778-1865), for example, was hired as a "poeta
di teatro" at least once in 1824 by the impresario Glossop at Alla Scala in Milan (Roccatagliati 1996, p.116). Gaetano Rossi
(1774-1855) was first hired as "poeta di teatro" at La Fenice Theater in Venice and then became director of the Philarmonic
Theater of Verona (Treccani 2001, p.348-9). Andrea Leone Trottola (died in 1831) was the official poet of the royal
theaters in Naples and a librettist for the impresario. Domenico Barbaia (1777-1841) when he joined the San Carlo theater
in Naples (Black 1996, pp.772-3). This is in sharp contrast to Venetian opera between 1636 and 1670, when most librettists
were "amateurs" (Glixon and Glixon, 2006, pp.110-11). Some were nobles, but many had day jobs, frequently as attorneys.
The librettist Niccoló Minato (1627-1698), for example, explained "you should know that I am not a poet by profession.
My attensions (sic) lie in the courts; to serve who may command me, I have robbed myself of some hours of sleep to give
you this drama."
19
   The contemporary American composer John Adam's (2008, pp.221-222) explains that the composer is necessarily the
dominant partner in the creation of an opera: "In making an opera the librettist invariably feels cheated or disrespected. But
the composer is responsible for so much more than the librettist. The music is what determines the ultimate form and feel of
the piece." Adams also explains why such collaborations are difficult: "Artistic collaboration is never easy. On occasion it
has occurred to me that, next to double murder-suicide, it might be the most painful thing two people can do together."


                                                                                                                                 12
the first 100 printed copies, and 50 Milanese lira for each additional copy (Appendix Figure A1, Panel
D).

2. DATA
        Our data comprise 2,598 new operas by 705 Italian-born composers between 1770 and 1900,
including the title of each opera, the name of its composer, the year and location for its premiere, and
three alternative measures for quality, defined by its popularity and durability.20 These data cover
Lombardy and Venetia as well as six other Italian states that did not adopt copyrights in 1801: the
Kingdom of Sardinia, the Duchy of Modena, the Duchy of Parma, the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, the
Papal States, and the Kingdom of Two Sicilies. To measure variation in copyright laws across these
states, we collect information from Franchi (1902) and examine the original texts of the Italian laws
(e.g., Legge 9 May 1801, n. 423 Repubblica Cisalpina). The original text of these laws and our
translations are available in Appendix B.
        We chose the beginning and end years for our analysis to match musicologists' periodization of
opera. According to the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians (2001), 1770 is the beginning
of the bel canto. Italian for beautiful singing, bel canto denotes a vocal technique that emphasizes
beauty of sound over dramatic expression. Bel canto composers include Gioacchino Rossini (1792-
1868), Vincenzo Bellini (1801-1835), and Gaetano Donizetti (1797-1848). Our sample ends in 1900,
the final year of the Italian verisimo. Derived from the Italian "vero" for "true," the verisimo is the
period of artistic realism, exemplified by Giacomo Puccini (1858-1924).

2.1. New Operas across Eight Italian States, 1770-1900
       To collect data on the creation of new operas, we have searched five standard reference books
for opera by Italian-born composers. Carlo Dassori's Opere e Operisti. Dizionario Lirico (1903)
includes 1,353 operas by 544 Italian-born composers that premiered between 1770 and 1900.
Extending these data, Loewenberg's (1978) Annals of Opera includes 254 operas by 90 Italian-born
composers between 1770 and 1900.21 A third reference book, Corrado Ambiveri's (1998) Opere e
Operisti Minori dell'Ottocento Italiano adds "minor" operas that were performed by city orchestras;
Ambiveri lists 71 premieres by 45 Italian-born composers between 1770 and 1900. Among these three
major reference works, Loewenberg (1978) is the most restrictive: 133 of 1,353 operas in Dassori
(1903) and none of 71 operas in Ambiveri (1998) are included in Loewenberg.


20
   We use the term Italy as defined by the country's borders in 1900. Compared with Italy's borders today, this definition
excludes Trentino, Alto Adige, Eastern Friuli, Venezia and Giulia, Istria, Zara; these regions had been part of the Austro-
Hungarian Empire and became part of Italy in the Treaty of Rapallo in 1920. Italy lost Istria and Zara to Yugoslavia as a
result of World War II in 1945; the 1975 Treaty of Osimo affirmed this change.
21
   Ambiveri includes composers born between 1792 (the year when Rossini was born) and 1900 (the end of the verisimo).


                                                                                                                              13
         To complement these data, we also search the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians
(2001) and Treccani's Enciclopedia Italiana di scienze, lettere ed arti (2001) for works Italian-born;
this search adds another 880 operas by the 705 Italian-born composers in our data. As an additional
data check we compare a complete list of 89 composers whose last names begin with B or D and who
are listed in Dassori (1903), Loewenberg (1978) or Ambiveri (1998) with a list of all entries for B and
D in the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians (2001). This comparison reveals that our
sample includes 80 composers who are missing from the New Grove, while the New Grove includes no
operas that are not included in the first three sources, suggesting that the sum of the first three sources
is more comprehensive.,

2.2. Measures for the Popularity and Durability of Operas
         Three complementary measures capture variation in the popularity and durability of operas.
First, to quantify differences in the immediate, historical popularity of operas, we use records of
notable performances in Loewenberg (1978) Annals of Opera. According to Opera Today (January 24,
2005), "(t)his volume has long been regarded as the definitive work on the subject...it is a magnificent
piece of work, and belongs on the bookshelf of every researcher in the operatic field..." Loewenberg
records notable premieres and repeat performances between 1597 and 1940. He includes 254 of the
2,598 operas in our data (9.7 percent).
        Our second measure uses performance records for the Metropolitan opera house in New York
to identify operas that were popular and durable enough to be performed throughout the 20th century.
Moser (2012) uses performances at the Met between 1900 and 1950 to document shifts in ethnic
preferences in response to World Wars I and II. We extend data in Moser (2012) to include
performances between 1900 and 2014. In our data, 182 of the 2,598 operas (7 percent) were performed
at least once at the Met between 1900 and 2014. We also collect data on performances at a broader set
of venues, such Alla Scala in Milan (1947-2018), the Opéra National de Paris (1900-2018), the Wiener
Staatsoper (1955- 2018), and the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires (1908-2018).
         A third measure identifies the most durable operas in our sample, based on their availability as
a complete recording on Amazon today.22 To collect these data we have searched Amazon for
complete records of the 2,598 operas, using the name of the composer and the name of the opera as
serach variable. For example, a search for Giuseppe Verdi's La Traviata shows that it was available as
a complete recording in 2008 from Arthaus Musik and in 2012 from Virgin Classics; we therefore
record the Amazon dummy for La Traviata to equal 1. By comparison, a search for Domenico
Cimarosa's Penelope yields no results and we record the Amazon dummy to equal 0. A total of 156

operas created between 1770 and 1900 (6 percent of the 2,598 operas in our data) were still for sale on
Amazon in 2014.

2.3. Estimating the Expected Length of Copyrights Using the Life Expectancies of Composers
        Demographic data on composers' years of birth and death allow us to estimate the expected
length of copyrights, by calculating composers' age in the year of the premiere and estimate their
remaining years of life (Appendix Table A2). Years of birth and death are available for all 705
composers from Dassori (1903), Ambiveri (1998), and the New Grove (2001). The oldest composer in
our data is Giovanni Paisiello (1741-1816); the youngest is Stefano Donaudy (1879-1925). The
longest-lived composer was Vincenzo Mela (1803-1897), and the shortest-lived was Nicola Manfroce
(1791-1813).
        On average, Italian-born composer lived to be 59.7 years (with a median of 55 years),23 and
they were 33.6 years old at the time of the premiere (with a median of 32 years). Composers of
exceptionally popular or durable operas were slightly older, with an average of 35.9 years for operas in
Loewenberg (1978, with a median of 36) and 35.6 years for operas on Amazon (with a median of
34).24

3. EFFECTS ON THE NUMBER OF NEW OPERAS
        To examine whether copyrights helped to encourage creativity, we exploit exogenous variation
in the adoption of copyrights as a result of the timing of Napoleon's military victories in Italy. This
approach allows us to control for unobservable factors, such as shifting aesthetics, or changes in
interactions between composers, librettists, and impresarios, which may have encouraged the creation
of operas across Italy, independently of copyrights.

3.1. Identification Strategy
        Summary statistics indicate that composers in Lombardy and Venetia created significantly
more operas than composers in other states after 1801. Until 1801, composers in Lombardy and
Venetia created 1.6 new operas per state and year (Table 1). After 1801, composers in Lombardy and
Venetia produced nearly three times as many new operas, with 4.6 new operas per state and year. By
comparison, creative output increased much less in other states, from 1.4 new operas per state and year
until 1801, to 2.1 afterwards.


23
   This is slightly below the average for European composers with birth years between 1650 and 1849, which was 64.5
(Scherer 2004, p.8).
24
   These age distributions are also confirmed by information on composers of Italian opera that were performed at the
Metropolitan opera house in New York played between 1900 and 2014. In that year, the average composer was 36.2 years
old at the time of the premiere (with a standard deviation of 13.5).


                                                                                                                        15
       To systematically compare changes in the creation of new operas in states with and without
copyrights, we estimate OLS difference-in-differences regressions

                    operait =  Lombardy & Venetiai × post 1801t + i +t + it                           (1)

where the dependent variable, operait, counts newly-created operas in state i in year t. The variable
Lombardy & Venetiai is an indicator for the two states that adopted copyrights in 1801, and post1801t
equals 1 for years after 1800. State fixed effects !" control for variation in output across states that is
constant over time, for example as a result of time-invariant cultural differences or as a result of pre-
existing differences in the infrastructure to perform operas. Year fixed effects #$ control for variation
in output over time that is common across all Italian states. Standard errors &"$ are clustered at the
state-year level.25 Robustness checks estimate standard errors collapsing years for the pre- and post-
copyright period (Appendix Table A3, implementing Bertrand et al. 2004, p.14).
        Under the assumption that ­ without copyrights ­ changes in the creation of new operas after
1801 would have been comparable in Lombardy and Venetia and other Italian states, the coefficient 
estimates the causal effect of copyrights on the creation of new operas.

3.2. Tests of the Identification Assumption
        To investigate the identification assumption, we perform a series of tests. First, we compare the
time series of new operas for states with and without copyrights until 1801. These comparisons reveal
no differences in output trends between the two sets of states before the adoption of copyrights (Figure
2). Until 1801, composers in states with and without copyrights both created around 1.5 new operas
per state and year. Afterwards, output increased steadily for states with copyrights, from 4 in 1801 to 7
in 1805, but stayed stable in states without copyrights, at slightly more than 2 new operas per state and
year.
        States with and without copyrights were also comparable in population, urbanization, and GDP
per capita. In 1800, the last year before the adoption of copyright laws, Lombardy and Venetia had a
population of 3.2 million people per state compared with 3.0 million for other Italian states. Rates of
urbanization were also comparable, with 15.5 cities above 5,000 people in Lombardy and Venetia
compared with 15.8 in other states (Table 2, Panel A). GDP per capita was 1,450 millions in Lombardy

  Even though our results are robust to clustering both at the state and the state-year level, our preferred specification
includes fixed effects for states and for years, with clustering at the level of states and years. Abadie, Athey, Imbens, and
Woolridge (2017) show that there may be harm in clustering at a level that is too aggregate. With only eight states, the
number of clusters would be too small to cluster standard errors at the state level (Cameron et al. 2008). Moreover, because
only two of eight states are treated, we cannot estimate the t-wild bootstrap (MacKinnon and Webb 2016). Sub-clustering
the wild bootstrap estimate is not appropriate for difference-in-differences estimates because clusters (states) switch from
control to treatment (MacKinnon and Webb 2016).


                                                                                                                                16
and Venetia, and 1,386 millions in other Italian states. This evidence is consistent the findings of
Daniele and Malanima (2007, 2011), who show that, at the time of Italy's unification in 1861, states
were comparable in terms of GDP and urbanization.
        Next, we check whether states with and without copyrights were comparable in terms of their
pre-existing infrastructure, as proxies for demand (Table 2, Panel B). Between 1781 and 1800,
Lombardy and Venetia had 2.0 theaters per state and year, compared with 1.7 for other states. With a
p-value of 0.793, an equality of means test fails to reject the hypothesis that the two values are
identical. The two sets of states were also comparable in the total number of theater seats, which we
use to proxy the demand for entertainment. Between 1781 and 1800, Lombardy and Venetia had a total
of 4,710 theater seats per state and year, compared with 3,711 for other states (p-value 0.671).
        We also compare counts of active opera composers, as a proxy for differences in pre-existing
supply. With 1.0 active composers on average per state and year in Lombardy and Venetia between
1781 and 1800, compared with 1.2 in other states, this difference is not statistically significant (p-value
0.603).
         A related threat to our identification strategy is that composers may have moved from control
states to states with copyrights after 1801. To investigate this possibility, we examine changes in the
count of composers who had created at least one opera in one of the control states and moved to a state
with copyrights 1801 (Appendix Table A4). These data show that migration within Italy was cannot
explain the differential change in creativity. Only two composers moved within Italy before 1801
(Appendix Table A4, Panel A). After 1801, 16 composers moved within the control group of other
Italian states, but none of them moved to Lombardy and Venetia (Appendix Table A4, Panel B).
         Instead, data on composer migration suggest that the adoption of copyrights encouraged Italian-
born émigré composers to return home. After 1801, 30 Italian-born composers who had previously
created operas in France returned to Italy to compose in Lombardy, and another 25 moved to Venetia.
Similarly, 14 Italian-born composers who had composed operas in Austria returned to Italy to compose
in Lombardy, and another 9 returned to Venetia. Flows of return migration had been substantially
smaller before 1801. Only 5 Italian-born composers returned from France to Italy to compose in
Lombardy before 1801, and 4 moved to Venetia; 11 Italian-born composers returned from Austria to
Italy to compose in Venetia after 1801 and 6 returned to Venetia. Moreover, the historical records
reveal no differences in migration patterns to Lombardy and Venetia for non-composers, compared to
the other Italian states (Romani 1955).
         Finally, we check whether Lombardy and Venetia had higher pre-existing stock of librettos or
librettists before copyrights. Librettists complement the work of the composer in an important way, by
providing the text of the opera higher pre-existing stock of potential collaborators may have
encouraged opera creation even without copyrights. A comparison of means, however, shows that the
pre-1801 stock of librettists was similar across states with and without copyrights. Before copyrights,


                                                                                                              17
Lombardy and Venetia had 4.0 librettists per state and year, slightly more than the 3.5 librettists per
state and year in other Italian states. A p-value of 0.871 fails to reject the null hypothesis of equality in
means. Similarly, Lombardy and Venetia had 4.5 librettos ­ for operas, operettas and oratorios ­ per
state and year before 1801, compared with 3.5 librettos per state and year in other Italian states. A p-
value of 0.849 fails to reject the null hypothesis of equality in means.
         In sum, comparisons of observables yield no evidence against the identification assumption.
There are no differences in time trends of creative output for states with without copyrights before the
adoption of copyrights, and the two sets of states shared similar characteristics. There is also no
evidence for a decline in the number of active composers, or in the share of movers for control states
after 1801, and there is no evidence for higher pre-existing numbers of potential collaborators
(librettists) in states with copyrights.

3.3. Baseline Estimates and Time-Varying Effects
       OLS estimates of equation (1) indicate that states with copyrights created 2.2 additional operas
per state and year after 1800 compared with other Italian states (Table 3, column 1, significant at 1
percent). Relative to an average of 1.4 new operas per state and year across Italy until 1800, this
implies a 2.6-fold increase. Excluding state fixed effects leaves the estimate at 2.1 (Table 3, column 2,
significant at 1 percent). We also estimate quasi-maximum likelihood (QML) Poisson regressions to
address the count data characteristics of the opera data. Average treatment effects of these regressions
imply an increase by 1.1 additional operas per year (Table 3, column 5, significant at 1 percent).
        Comparisons of the raw data in Figure 2 indicate no significant differences in pre-trends of
creativity across states with and without copyrights. To exam whether states with copyrights had begun
to create more operas before copyrights, we estimate ß separately for each year, allowing the
coefficient to be different from zero before the adoption of copyrights in 1801:

                 operait= r Lombardy & Venetiai × yearr + i + t + it                     (2)

where the variable yearr represents an indicator variable for each year between 1791 and 1820. Years
between 1781 and 1790 are the excluded category. Estimates of annual coefficients indicate that opera
output before 1801 is not statistically different between Lombardy and Venetia and the other Italian
states (Figure 3). The annual coefficients between 1791 and 1800 are close to zero and not statistically
significant; they increase to 1 additional opera in 1801 and remain positive and statistically significant
in all year except 1806 until 1820.




                                                                                                                18
3.4. Controls for Pre-Trends and Excluding Major Cities
        Regressions with alternative controls for differential pre-trends confirm the main results.
Estimates with a common linear pre-trend for Lombardy and Venetia indicate that the two states that
adopted copyrights in 1801 produced 2.3 additional operas per year after 1801 (Table 3, column 3,
significant at 1 percent). Specifications that allow for a separate linear pre-trend for each state indicate
a differential increase by 2.4 additional operas (Table 3, column 4, significant at 1 percent).
        In addition, we use a de-trended version of equation (1) by estimating a linear pre-trend for
Lombardy and Venetia and subtracting the estimated pre-trend from the dependent variable operait.
De-trended estimates confirm the main estimates, with 2.2 additional operas for states with copyrights
after 1801 (Appendix Table A5, column 1, significant at 1 percent).
        Milan and Venice were the commercial and cultural centers of Lombardy and Venetia
respectively. Is it possible that our results are driven by these two major cities?26,27 To investigate this
issue, we perform additional robustness checks that exclude Milan and Venice from the regressions.
All of the main specifications are robust to dropping either Milan, or Venice or both (Appendix Table
A6). These findings indicate that copyrights encouraged the creation of new operas, even outside the
major city centers.

3.5. Controls for Exposure to French Rule
        We also examine whether exposure to French rule, rather than the adoption of copyrights,
triggered the observed increase in creative output. All Italian states had come under French rule by
1812, but the length of their exposure varied according to the timing of their occupation (Foà 2001,
p.64). Acemoglu et al (2011) use variation in institutional reforms created by the French Revolution to
estimate the effects of exposure to revolutionary ideas on economic growth in Germany.
       To test for the influence of French rule, we estimate the following equation:

     operait =  Lombardy & Venetiai × post 1801t + g Length of French Presenceit + i +t + it                          (3)

where Length of French Presenceit measures the length of exposure (in years) to French presence in
state i in year t, and all other variables are as defined in equation (1).


26
   In his study of Giuseppe Verdi's (1813-1901) relationship with the publishing house Ricordi, Jensen (1989, p.3) explains
that "Napoleon's campaigns brought a large part of Italy together with Milan as the headquarters. Italy's intellectuals and
artists flowing into this center, and even after Napoleons' vision of Italy collapsed and it fragmented once again, Milan
remained a magnet for Italy's best human resources, becoming a rich and important province under Austrian rule." City-
level data for Venetia also indicate some geographic concentration, albeit at a smaller scale.
27
   Venetia also had a pre-existing tradition of spoken comedies (commedia dell'arte) and theaters that performed commedia
dell'arte in the seventeenth century became a natural performance venue for public opera (Glixon and Glixon 2006, p.3).
We examine interaction between such copyrights and pre-existing infrastructure in more detail in Section 7.


                                                                                                                              19
       Controlling for French rule leaves the main estimates unchanged, with 2.16 additional new
operas per state and year in states with copyrights, compared with 2.20 in the main specifications
(Appendix Table A7).

3.6. Constructing a Synthetic Lombardy and Venetia with Copyrights
         As an additional test, we construct a synthetic Lombardy without copyrights from data for other
states that are most similar to Lombardy.28 We apply these methods to match the characteristics of the
real Lombardy as closely as possible through a weighted average of the characteristics of other Italian
states with similar characteristics, but without copyright laws.29
         Figure 4 shows the estimated time path of new opera creation for a counterfactual Lombardy
without copyrights. With 1.3 new operas per year, counterfactual output without copyrights, would
have been only half the output of the real Lombardy. Matching estimates for Venetia confirm that a
counterfactual Venetia without copyrights would have produced fewer operas (66 percent, Appendix
Figure A2).


4. POPULAR AND DURABLE OPERAS
        Beyond simply increasing output, intellectual property may also affect quality, by rewarding
creative people to produce works that are more popular and more durable. The analysis in this section
focuses on these two economically important aspects of an opera, without trying to judge its artistic
quality. Specifically, copyrights may strengthen composers' incentives to create more popular and
durable work, by enabling them to draw revenue from repeat performances. In Section 1.4, we have
shown that composers used the 1801 copyright law successfully to demand additional pay for repeat
performances. In addition, copyrights may affect quality through wealth effects, by enabling cash-
strapped composers to spend more time developing each piece. Giuseppe Verdi, for example, used
income from performance fees and scores under Sardinia's copyright law of 1840 to devote time to
increasingly complex operas and stop working like a "galley slave" (Scherer 2001, pp.179-180).30

28
   Abadie and Gardeazabal (2012) estimate a Mahalanobis matching estimator to create a synthetic Basque region without
terrorism from the characteristics of other Spanish regions to evaluate the effects of terrorism on GDP growth over time.
Abadie, Diamond and Hainmueller (2012) extend the earlier paper to create a synthetic control for California to examine
the effects of a large-scale tobacco control program that California implemented in 1988.
29
   Specifically, let J be the number of available control states without copyright laws and let W be a (J x 1) vector of non-
negative weights (w1, w2, ...wJ)' that sum to one. The scalar wj represents the weight that state j is given in constructing the
synthetic Lombardy. Let X1 be a (K x 2) vector of the number of theater seats in Lombardy (as a measure of demand), and
the number of active composers (as measure of supply) in Lombardy and let X0 be a (K x J) matrix of the values for these
same variables in the set of possible controls. Let the (K x K) matrix V be the inverse sample variance-covariance matrix of
the matching variables. This is the weighing matrix of the Mahalanobis matching estimator (Rubin 1977, Rosenbaum and
Rubin 1983). The vector of weights W* minimizes (X1-WX0)'V(X1-WX0). Each country can be used as a match twice,
allowing one replacement.
30
   Verdi mentions his "anni di galera," in a letter to his Milanese friend Clarina Maffei on 12 May 1858 (Gossett 2009,
p.237). In the 1840s, Verdi composed 14 operas; in the 1850s he composed 7 operas, including Rigoletto (1851), La


                                                                                                                                   20
        Financial incentives were particularly important at a time when many Italian composers came
from families of poor musicians and depended on opera as a source of income. Rossini's parents were
itinerant musicians:

   "His mother...was a seconda donna of very passable talents. They went from town to town, and
   from company to company; the husband playing in the orchestra, and his wife singing on the stage.
   Poverty was of course the companion of their wanderings" (Beyle 1824, p.2).31

Data on composers' families indicate that Rossini's background was fairly typical. Among 493
composers whose father's occupation is listed in the New Grove (2001) or in Treccani (2001), 210
fathers (43 percent) were musicians, 141 (29 percent) composers, and 9 were chapel masters.
        Anecdotal evidence suggests that even successful composers lowered the quality of their work
when they thought that they were underpaid. Rossini, for example, wrote angrily:

   "And, as for those good gentlemen, the impressarj (sic), who pretend to pay me handsomely, by
   giving me for sixteen or eighteen pieces, ...I know a way of being even with them. In every fresh
   opera, I will serve up three or four of these pieces, which shall have nothing new in them but the
   variations" (Beyle 1824, pp.200-01).

To investigate systematically whether and how copyrights may have affected "quality," we examine
three alternative measures to capture differences in the popularity and durability of operas.
        Our first measure indicates that composers produced more popular operas when they had
copyrights. Between 1781 and 1800, composers in Lombardy and Venetia created 0.1 new operas per
year that entered Loewenberg's (1978) compendium of notable performances. After 1801 composers
in Lombardy and Venetia created 0.6 popular operas per state and year (a 5.8-fold increase). By
comparison, the number of new popular operas increased much less in other states, from 0.1 per year
until 1801 to 0.2 afterwards (a 100-percent increase, Table 1). Re-estimating equation (1) for
historically popular operas shows that composers created 0.4 additional popular operas per state and
year after 1801 in Lombardy and Venetia compared with other states (Table 4, column 1, significant at
1 percent). Relative to an average of 0.1 new operas per year before 1801, this implies a 5.3-fold
increase. These results are robust to alternative specifications, including controls for state- or
treatment-specific pre-trends (Appendix Tables A8 and A9).



Traviata (1853), and Simon Bocanegra (1857). In the 1870s, 1880s, and 1890s Verdi produced only one opera each decade:
Aida (1871), Otello (1887), and Falstaff (1893). Whether these later works are of higher quality is a subject of debate
(Gossett 2009), and recent research has highlighted the originality of Verdi's early works, before Luisa Miller (1849).
31
   Rossini's letters suggest that he cared deeply about quality and thought that the public was a poor judge of it. "The
theatres are filled with performers, who have learned music from some poor provincial professor. This mode of singing
violin concertos, and variations without end, tends to destroy, not only the talent of the singer, but also to vitiate the taste of
the public" (Beyle 1824, pp.199).


                                                                                                                                      21
        Copyrights also raised share of popular operas among all new operas in state i and year t. OLS
regressions indicate a 10.4 percentage point increase in the share of historically popular operas per
state and year after 1801 for Lombardy and Venetia (Table 4, column 2, significant at 5 percent).
Compared with 5.5 in 100 operas until 1800, this implies a 2.9-fold increase in average quality.
        A complementary measure for historical popularity counts the number of repeat performances.
This analysis indicates that operas created in states with copyrights had more repeat performances in
the years after the premiere than operas composed in states without copyrights, and were also more
likely to be a "hit" in the premiere year (Appendix Table A10).
        Next, we examine whether copyrights increased the number and the share of operas that were
both durable and popular enough to be performed at the Metropolitan in New York between 1900 and
2014. Summary statistics indicate a 6.3-fold increase in the number of Met operas in states with
copyrights after 1801, nearly three times the 2.2-fold increase for other Italian states (Table 1). Re-
estimating equation (1) for Met operas indicates that composers in Lombardy and Venetia produced
0.45 additional Met operas after 1801 (Table 4, column 3, significant at 1 percent). Relative to an
average of 0.075 Met operas per state and year, this implies a 7.0-fold increase. The share of Met
operas also increased by 10.2 percent with copyrights (Table 4, column 4, significant at 1 percent).
These results are robust to excluding state fixed effects, controlling for a pre-trend for Lombardy and
Venetia, controlling for a pre-trend for each Italian state (Appendix Table A8, Panel B), and to de-
trending the dependent variable (Appendix Table A9, column 3).32
       Finally, we show that copyrights increased the number and the share of the most durable
operas, measured by their availability on Amazon in the 2010s. Between 1781 and 1800, composers in
Lombardy and Venetia premiered 0.03 durable operas per state and year. Between 1801 and 1820, they
produced 0.4 per year (17 times more, Table 1). By comparison, composers from other parts of Italy
created 0.03 durable operas per year until 1800 and 0.2 afterwards (6 times more). Regressions with
durable operas as an outcome variable indicate that composers in Lombardy and Venetia created 0.3
additional durable operas per year after 1801 compared with other Italian states (Table 4, column 5,
significant at 5 percent). Estimates are robust to controlling for a separate pre-trend for states with
copyrights, state-specific linear pre-trends (Appendix Table A8, panel C, columns 4 and 5), or de-
trending the dependent variable (Appendix Table A9, column 5). The share of durable operas among
all new operas increased by 6.9 percentage points per state and year after 1801 in Lombardy and
Venetia (Table 4, column 6, significant at 5 percent), compared with a pre-1801 share of historically
popular operas of 1.6 percent.

32
  Additional robustness tests in Appendix Table A11 examine performances at Alla Scala in Milan, the Opéra National de
Paris, the Wiener Staatsoper, and the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires in the 20th century. These tests confirm that operas,
which composers created with copyright protection, were more likely be extremely durable, measured by repeat
performances at any of these theaters.


                                                                                                                           22
5. COMPOSER-LEVEL REGRESSIONS
       State-level regressions have shown that Lombardy and Venetia produced more and better
operas after they adopted copyrights compared with other Italian states that did not offer copyrights.
Successful composers like Rossini, however, may have produced more and better operas, regardless of
copyrights. In this section, we repeat the analysis at the composer level, controlling for individual
productivity differences through composer fixed effects.

5.1. Baseline Estimates
       To estimate the effect of copyrights at the composer level, we estimate

               operacit =  Lombardy & Venetiai × post 1801t +c+ i +t + cit             (4)

where the dependent variable, operacit, is the number of new operas that composer c creates in state i
and year t. Composer fixed effects c control for differences in base-line levels of productivity across
composers. All other variables are defined in equation (1).
        Composer-level regressions confirm that opera output increased in response to copyrights.
Composers in Lombardy and Venetia created 1.5 additional new opera per state and year after 1801
compared with composers in other Italian states (Table 5, Panel A, column 1, significant at 1 percent).
Relative to a pre-1801 mean of 1.2 operas per composer, state, and year this implies that composers
produced approximately twice as many operas when they had copyrights. QML Poisson estimates
confirm these results (Appendix Table A12, column 1, significant at 1 percent). Composers in states
with copyrights also created an additional 0.8 popular operas per state and year (Table 5, Panel A,
column 2, significant at 1 percent), as well as an 0.7 additional Met operas (Table 5, Panel A, column
4, significant at 1 percent), and 0.6 additional durable operas (Table 5, Panel A, column 6, significant
at 5 percent). To check whether our results may be driven by a small number of exceptionally prolific
composers, we repeat the analyses excluding composers in the top 10 percent and 20 percent of opera
output. The results further corroborate our findings from the full sample (Table 5, Panels B and C).

5.2. Return Migrants from Austria and France
        Recent work on superstar patentees has shown that variation in tax rates helps to attract
superstar inventors to countries (Akcigit, Baslandze, and Stantcheva 2016) and US states with more
favorable tax rates (Moretti and Wilson 2016). In principle, copyrights could play a similar role, by
attracting productive composers to states with better copyrights. If copyrights triggered a brain drain to
Lombardy and Venetia from other Italian states, these flows would threaten the validity of our baseline


                                                                                                             23
estimates. In section 3.1, we have examined this issue by tracing composers' movements within Italy.
This analysis reveals no evidence that composers who had been active in other Italian states moved to
Lombardy and Venetia after 1801.
         We do, however, find that the adoption of copyrights encouraged Italian-born émigré to return
to Italy and compose in Lombardy and Venetia (Figure 5). Until 1801, 1.25 Italian composers per year
moved from France and Austria to Lombardy and Venetia. After 1801, return migration increased
more than 3-fold, to 4.75 composers per year. Return migration peaked in 1804, when eight Italian
composers returned; after that return migration remains above the pre-copyright levels until 1820.33
         To estimate the contribution of these return migrants to the creation of new operas, we re-
estimate equation (4) with an additional interaction for return migrants * L&V * post. This analysis
show that return migrants made substantially larger contribution to the quality than to the quantity of
new operas. In these regressions the estimate for Lombardy & Venetia * post remains large and
significant, at 1.1 additional new operas per composer, state, and year (Appendix Table A14, Panel A,
column 1, significant at 1 percent). Compared with a pre-copyright average of 1.2 new operas per
composer, state, and year, this implies a 92-percent increase in the number of new operas by other,
non-migrant composers. By comparison, the estimate for return migrants * L&V * post is smaller (at
0.846, Appendix Table A14, Panel A, column 1, significant at 5 percent).
       By comparison, return migrants contributed significantly to the increase in high-quality operas
(Appendix Table A14, Panels B-D, columns 1-2). Comparisons of output before 1801 show that
composers who had worked abroad and returned to Italy after 1801 were more productive than the
average Italian composer. Return migrants produced 1.4 operas per year before 1801, compared with
1.2 operas for the average composer (Appendix Table A13). Return migrants also created more
popular and more durable operas, with 0.074 popular and durable operas before 1801, compared with
0.056 popular and 0.046 durable for the average composer.
        A complementary set of regressions examines the effects of copyrights on stayers, who only
worked in the state where they composed their first opera. Because they were exceptionally immobile,
these composers may have been particularly hard hit by increased competition with return migrants.
Conversely, they may have benefitted from knowledge spillovers and other types of positive
agglomeration externalities (Marshall 1920, Ciccone and Hall 1999, Kline and Moretti 2014).34
Consistent with negative competition effects on the most immobile composers, OLS estimates are
negative but imprecisely estimated due to the small number of stayers (Appendix Table A14, column

33
   Competition with prolific return migrants may have also discouraged composers from other Italian states to move to
Lombardy and Venetia after 1801. Even though the returns from writing an opera improved with copyrights, competition
with return migrants and other composers lowered the probability of earning a commission, thereby reducing the expected
returns to migration.
34

6. COPYRIGHT ADOPTIONS AND EXTENSIONS ACROSS ALL OF ITALY
        In this section we exploit a broader set of changes in copyrights laws across all of Italy to
investigate the effects of copyright adoptions across states, and to compare the benefits of copyright
extensions starting from different levels of existing rights.

6.1. Copyright Adoption in Other States, 1826-1840
        Between 1826 and 1840, all the remaining states within Italy adopted copyrights as part of a
political process towards unification. Many, if not all, of these changes were exogenous to artistic
creativity. For example, states that were politically close to Sardinia adopted copyrights for life plus 30
years when they co-signed Sardinia's Bilateral Treaty with Austria in 1840 (Ubertazzi 2000, p.50).
With the exception of Sicily, there is little evidence for lobbying. In Sicily, authors (but not
composers) lobbied unsuccessfully for copyrights in the 1820s (Pomba et al. 1986, p.86).35
        This broader set of changes enable us to explore the effects of adopting copyright laws in an
environment when other states already offer such laws, similar to today. Summary statistics after 1826
confirm that the introduction of copyrights also encouraged creative work in this setting. After
adopting copyrights, Italian states produced 2.72 new operas per state and year, compared with 1.43
before (Appendix Table A15). To examine these changes in output more systematically, we estimate

                                       operait=  copyrightit + i + t + it                                         (5)


where the variable copyrightit equals 1 if state i offers copyrights in year t, and all other variables are as
defined above. OLS estimates indicate that composers created an additional 2.6 new operas per state
and year in states with copyrights (Table 6, column 1, significant at 1 percent). Relative to a mean of
1.5 new operas per year in states without copyrights, this implies a 2.7-fold increase.36
        In addition to increasing the number of new operas, the adoption of copyrights also changed the
quality of operas ­ even when surrounding states already offered copyrights as well. OLS estimates

35
   Carlo Mele (1792-1841) and Pasquale Stanislao Mancini (1817-1888) had lobbied for protection. Mancini later argued
that the Two Sicilies' decision not to join the Bilateral Treaty between Sardinia and Austria contributed to its cultural
decline in the 1840s and 1850s (Pomba et al. 1986, p.87). In Germany, parliament (Bundesversammlung) received a request
for copyrights in 1825 by composers including Johann Nepomuk Hummel, Carl Maria von Weber, and Ludwig van
Beethoven, who complained that publishers were "getting fat by robbing without penalty their neighbors' property," and
demanded the right to collect fees for "operas and opera-like works" (Scherer 2002, pp.176-8).
36
   We also estimate pre-post regression for Sardinia, Modena, Parma, and Tuscany which adopted copyright for life+30 in
1840 when they joined the Bilateral Treaty with Austria using as time windows 25, 20, 15, and 10 years before and after
1840. The results, reported in Appendix Table 16, indicate an increase of 2.9 operas per state and year after 1840.


                                                                                                                            25
indicate that composers in states with copyrights produced 0.2 more historically popular new operas
per year (Table 6, column 3, significant at 10 percent). Relative to a mean of 0.1 premieres per year
without copyrights, this implies a 2.5-fold increase. States with copyrights also created 0.4 additional
new operas that continued to be played at the Metropolitan opera in the 20th and 21st centuries (Table 6,
column 4, significant at 1 percent), implying a 6.3-fold increase. States with copyrights also produced
more durable operas (0.5 per year) compared to states without copyrights (0.2 per year). OLS estimates
imply that composers in states with copyrights produced 0.3 additional durable operas per year (Table
6, column 5, significant at 1 percent). Relative to an average of 0.1 durable operas per year in states
without copyrights, this implies a 4.1-fold increase.

6.2. Extensions in the Length of Copyright
        We also examine the effects of copyright extensions on the number and the quality of 19th-
century operas. In recent years, such extensions have been a subject of intense debate surrounding the
1998 US Copyright Term Extension Act and the 2018 Music Modernization Copyright Bill. Compared
with extensions today, which lengthen copyrights from pre-existing levels of life+50 or more,
historical extensions started from much lower levels of pre-existing protection, at life+10, and may
therefore have been more economically meaningful.37
         Similar to copyright adoptions, most of these changes were a result of broader politically-
motivated changes, independent from lobbying by composers. Lombardy and Venetia first extended
their terms from life+10 to life+30 in 1840, when they were under Austrian rule, and Austria signed a
Bilateral Treaty with Sardinia (Ubertazzi 2000, p.50). A second extension in 1865, from life+30 to
life+40, was a result of the unifications of Lombardy, Venetia, and five other states into the new
Kingdom of Italy. In 1870, the last remaining independent part of Italy, the Papal State, extended its
copyrights to life+40 when it was annexed to Italy (Ubertazzi 2000, p.81)
       We exploit these changes to investigate the effects of copyright extensions. In contrast to the
adoption of basic copyrights, there is no evidence that extensions in copyrights terms ­ beyond the
death of the composer ­ have encouraged creativity. Under the initial copyright lengths of life+10,
composers in Lombardy and Venetia created 5.59 new operas per state and year (Figure 6). After
copyrights increased to life+30 in 1840, output stayed unchanged at 5.60 new operas per state and
year. After a further extension to life+40 in 1865, output declined to 5.1 new operas per state and year.

37
   The 1998 Copyright Term Extension Act extended copyrights for privately owned works from the life of the author plus
50 years to the life of the author plus 70 years, and for works of corporate ownership from 75 years to 120 years from the
creation or 95 years after the publication (whichever comes earlier). Notably, opera is very different from Mickey Mouse
and other fictional characters whose commercial value to the original owner depends on its use in other types of products,
extending from comic books to consumer products, such as t-shirts and mugs, and even theme parks. With such products,
copyrights alone are insufficient as a means of protection. Instead, creators need a "convergence of intellectual property
rights," including copyrights, trademarks, and claims of unfair competition (Helfand 2002). In contrast, opera scores, which
are the subject of our paper, typically are used "as is," so that they do not need the same type of protection.


                                                                                                                               26
         We also estimate OLS regressions for copyright extensions across Italy:

                      operait = 1 adoptit + 2 extend30it + 3 extend40it + it                           (6)

where the dependent variable counts new operas per state i in year t between 1770 and 1900. The
variable adoptit indicates state-year pairs after state i has adopted copyrights and before any further
extensions.38 The variable extend30it equals 1 after a state i has extended its copyrights from life+10/12
to life + 30 and before it extends copyrights life + 40.39 Finally, the variable extend40it indicates state-
year pairs after state i has extended its copyrights from life + 30 to life + 40. The difference between 1
and 2 estimates the effect of extending existing copyrights to life +30. The difference between 2 and
3 estimates the effects of further extending copyrights from life + 30 to life + 40.40
        OLS estimates of 1 confirm that the adoption of copyrights was associated with an increase in
output, with 3.3 additional new operas per state and year (Table 7, column 1, significant at 1 percent).
Relative to a mean of 1.5 operas per year for states without copyrights, this implies a 3.2-fold increase.
Extensions in copyright lengths, however, were followed by a decline in output. States that extended
existing copyrights to life + 30 created 2.1 fewer operas per year afterwards ('  )    )
                                                                                   ( - '+ =1.14-3.23=-2.09,
with a p-value of 0.001, Table 7, columns 1). Estimates for 3 indicate no positive effects for further
extensions from life + 30 to life + 40.
        Regressions for popular operas confirm these results. Estimates of 1 indicate that states which
adopted copyrights produced 0.5 additional popular operas per year (Table 7, column 3 significant at 1
percent). Relative to a mean of 0.1 in states without copyrights, this implies a 6-fold increase.
Estimates for copyright extensions are not statistically significant and negative. Estimates of 2 indicate
that copyright extensions were not associated with an increase in the number of popular operas ('    )(-
)
'+ =-0.13-0.47=-0.6, with a p-value of 0.000). Estimates of 2 imply that further extensions to life + 40
were associated with 0.1 fewer popular operas per year ('   )    )

0.254, Table 7, columns 3). States that had adopted basic copyrights also created 0.5 additional Met
operas per state and year (Table 7, column 4) while states that had extended their copyrights to life+30
produced 0.70 fewer Met operas per year ('   )     )
                                              ( - '+ =-0.23-0.47=-0.7, with a p-value of 0.000). States


38
   Lombardy and Venetia adopt copyrights for life + 10 in 1801. The Papal State adopt copyrights with life + 12 in 1826,
and the Sicilies adopt copyright laws with life + 30 in 1828. Sardinia, Modena, Parma, and Tuscany adopt their own
copyright laws with life + 30 in 1840 (Appendix Table A15).
39
   Sardinia, Modena, Parma, and Tuscany adopted copyrights in 1840, with a length of life+30. To reflect this change for
the variable adoptit in equation (6) equals 1 after 1840, while extend30it equals 0 since these states never extended their
copyright lengths to life+30.
40
   The identifying assumption for 2 and 3 is that states with and without copyright extensions would have experienced a
comparable change in opera creation per year had there been no copyright extension. This assumption would be violated if
composers who were exceptionally productive lobbied successfully for extensions in their state. As we explain above, we
have found no evidence for successful lobbying by composers. Instead nearly all changes in Italian copyrights during this
time resulted from Italy's process toward unification.


                                                                                                                              27

('     )
  , - '( =-0.39-(-0.13)=-0.26, with a p-value of 0.001).
        Results for durable operas that were available on Amazon in the 2010s confirm the direction of
these estimates (Table 7, column 5). States that had adopted basic copyright laws created 0.40
additional durable operas per state and year. States that had extended copyrights to life+30 produced
0.24 fewer durable operas per year (' )     )
                                        ( - '+ =0.17-0.40=-0.23, with a p-value of 0.000). Further
extensions from life+30 to life+40 produced 0.2 fewer operas per year ('    )     )
                                                                              , - '( =-0.352-(-0.168)=-
0.18, with a p-value of 0.001).
        While estimates for all of Italy are less well-identified than our preferred specifications, they
have economically important implications for copyright extensions. At the very least, our evidence
suggests that extensions in the length of copyright terms ­ even starting from relatively short terms of
existing terms ­ did little to encourage creativity. Intuitively, extensions in copyrights only affect
cultural goods that are durable enough to be consumed after the original terms expire. But even the
most popular operas in our data were rarely performed after the first 20 years (Figure 7).
       Using biographic data to calculate the expected lengths of copyrights under a rule of life + 10
we show that less than one third of the most popular operas would have benefitted from extensions
beyond life + 10. To estimate the expected length of copyrights under life+10, life +20, and life+30,
we use data on years of birth and death, which are available for all 705 composers, to construct
demographic life tables for Italian-born composers of operas between 1770 and 1900 (Appendix Table
A2). Life table estimates imply that a composer who was of the average age at the time of the premiere
(33.6 years) could expect to live another 29.3 years. For a copyright term of life+10, this implies an
expected length of 39.3 years. Less than one third of operas (27 of 173 in Loewenberg) were still
performed after 39 years. In the full sample of all 677 operas created between 1781 and 1820, this
implies that only 4 percent of operas were still performed after their copyrights under life +10 would
have expired.41 Another 24 operas (13.9 percent) were still performed after 59 years, the expected term
under life+30. Only 20 operas (11. 6 percent) still played after 69 years, the expected term under
life+40.

7. INTERACTIONS BETWEEN COPYRIGHTS AND DEMAND
        In this section, we exploit variation in theater infrastructure and the pre-existing demand for
operas within states to examine interactions between copyrights and demand. State-level analysis
indicate that both Lombardy and Venetia experienced a clear increase in output after they had adopted
copyrights. In Lombardy, the number of new operas increased by a factor of three; in Venetia output

41
  The number of repeat performances is similar for new operas between 1781 and 1820 that premiered in Lombardy and
Venetia and other states (Appendix Figure A3). On average 165 operas in Loewenberg's Annals were performed 10 times,
including 7.5 times within the first 40 years (the expected length of copyrights under life+10) and 2.8 times afterwards.


                                                                                                                            28
more than doubled. Within Lombardy, however, opera output increased substantially more in Milan,
than in Mantua, Brescia, and Bergamo. One notable characteristic of Milan was its sheer size, with a
population of 124,000 in 1800 (Malanima 2015, p.4). By comparison, Brescia (the next largest city)
had 38,000 people, Bergamo had 36,000, and Mantua 25,000. City size in turn is correlated with the
density of skilled performers and with the demand for shows. Both these factors increase the payoffs
from creating more and better music, which, theoretically, should amplify the effects of adopting
copyrights.
        To proxy for city-level variation in demand, we examine detailed historical city-level data on
the theaters and theater seats. Antonini (2000, p.23) records such data for theaters that had staged at
least one opera by 1800 and explains that theaters needed around 100 seats to play operas. Until 1801,
trends in theater construction were comparable in Lombardy and Venetia and the rest of Italy
(Appendix Figure A5). In 1770, 9 cities in Lombardy and Venetia had on average 0.3 theaters that
were large enough to perform operas, and 16 cities in other Italian states had on average 0.3 such
theaters. By far the greatest expansion in theater construction occurred with the unification of 1861,
which increased demand for opera across Italy (Morelli 2012). Only Venice (Venetia) and Florence
(Tuscany) had three theaters in 1800 that were large enough to stage operas. Another four cities had
two theaters in 1800: Milan (Lombardy), Naples (Two Sicilies), Turin (Sardinia), and Ferrara (Papal
State), while all the other cities had one (Appendix Figure A6, Panel A).
        To systematically examine interactions between copyrights and pre-existing differences in
demand we separately estimate the effects of copyrights for cities with one or more than one theater in
1800. These regressions show that cities with more pre-existing demand and a better infrastructure
benefitted more from the adoption of copyright laws. Cities with one theater produced 0.27 additional
new operas per year after 1801 with copyrights. Relative to a pre-1801 mean of 0.22 new operas per
year for cities with one theater, this implies a 122-percent increase in opera output in response to
copyrights. Cities with two or more theater produced 1.89 additional new operas per year after 1801.
Relative to a pre-1801 mean of 1.04 new operas per city and year for cities with two or more theaters,
this implies a 182-percent increase, which is substantially larger than the increase for cities with just
one pre-existing theater. Regressions with controls for quality show that cities with more theater also
experienced a larger increase in high-quality operas after they had adopted copyrights (Table 8,
columns 3-8).
        Analogous regressions with theater seats confirm that copyrights with a larger pre-existing
demand for entertainment benefitted more from copyrights. Cities with less than 1,000 theater seats
before 1800 produced 0.3 additional operas after 1800 (Appendix Table A17, column 1, significant at
1 percent). Cities with more than 1,000 theater seats before 1800 produced 1.3 additional operas after
1801 (Appendix Table A17, column 2, significant at 1 percent).



                                                                                                            29
8. OTHER MUSICAL COMPOSITIONS AND LIBRETTOS
        Operas are the focus of our analysis because they provide exceptionally rich empirical
measures for the quantity and quality of creativity. To complement the analysis of operas, this final
section presents results for librettos, as well as for a broader set of musical compositions, including
symphonies, operettas, and songs. All tests confirm our main findings that the adoption of basic
copyrights encouraged the creation of new works.

8.1. Librettos
         Librettos, the text that complements the score of an opera, were a literary composition with
separate copyrights, under Article 1 of the 1801 Copyright Law (Appendix B). Although many
librettists were "amateurs" (Black 1987, p.5), they came to expect some type of financial recognition
for their efforts, and the sale of physical copies of the libretto became an important source of revenue
to its authors (Section 1.6).
         If copyrights helped to increase these revenues for librettists, the 1801 law may have
encouraged the creation of new librettos, similar to musical scores.42 OLS estimates indicate that the
adoption of copyrights led to a substantial increase in the creation of librettos. Lombardy and Venetia
produced an additional 2.6 new librettos per state per year after 1801 compared with other Italian states
(Appendix Table A18, column 1, significant at 1 percent). Relative to a pre-1801 mean of 3.0 new
librettos per state and year, this implies an 87-percent increase.43
        We also investigate whether copyrights increased the share of operas using new librettos. Since
the late 17th- century, it had become a custom of "recycling" existing librettos (Glixon and Glixon
2006, p.117). Our analysis shows that the adoption of copyrights was associated with a shift towards
using new librettos. Until 1801, only 16.5 percent of new operas used a new libretto. After Lombardy
and Venetia adopted copyrights in 1801, the share of operas that used a new libretto increased by 53
percentage points in Lombardy and Venetia compared with other states (Appendix Table A18, column
3, significant at 1 percent). These results suggest that the adoption of copyrights encouraged the
creation of new librettos above and beyond the effects on scores.




42
   To measure changes in the creation of new librettos, we first collect the names of all 648 librettists who were active in
Italy between 1770 and 1900 from Dassori (1903) and Treccani (2001). We then use the New Grove Dictionary of Music
and Musicians (2001) to collect all 1,091 librettos that they created in Italy between 1770 and 1900 and re-estimate the
main specifications with librettos as the outcome variable.
43
   In principle, this increase in the number of new librettos may have increased the returns to writing the score, as a
complement to the libretto. While we cannot estimate cross-price elasticities with our data, historical evidence on the
collaboration between librettists and composers in Section 1.6, however, indicate that scores were more important than
librettos for the success of an opera. As a result, some of the observed effect of copyrights on librettos may have been
driven by the increase in the production of scores, whereas the opposite effect was probably quite small.


                                                                                                                               30
8.2. Other Musical Compositions
        In this final section, we examine whether our results on operas generalize to a broader set of
musical compositions. We start by examining data from Opening Night! Operas and Oratorio
Premieres, a crowd-sourced data base of more than 42,000 musical compositions, maintained by
Stanford University.44 While our main data includes only operas, Opening Night covers a broader
range of compositions, including operettas, oratorios, and serenades. Opening Night includes 5,949
premieres of such works in Italy between 1770 and 1900. Estimating equation (1) with this broader set
of compositions, but excluding operas, confirms that the adoption of copyright laws encouraged the
creation of new works. After the adoption of copyrights in1801, output in Lombardy and Venetia
increased by an additional 1.2 works per state and year compared with other Italian states (Appendix
Table A19, column 1, significant at 1 percent).
        A complementary set of tests examines the effects of copyrights on the creation of new
symphonies and songs, using information on scores from the International Music Score Library
Project (IMSLP, also known as the Petrucci Music Library),45 that covers the entire history of
symphonies and songs. In 2018, the IMSLP covered 139,837 works by 17,003 composers, including
2,398 symphonies and nearly 5,600 songs that premiered in Italy between 1770 and 1900.46
        This analysis confirms the positive link between the adoption of basic copyrights and an
increase in creative output. With copyrights, composers in Lombardy and Venetia created an additional
3.4 symphonies and 5.9 additional songs per state and year (Appendix Table A19, columns 3 and 5,
significant at 1 percent). Taken together, our analyses of Opening Night and the IMSLP suggest that
the adoption of basic copyrights encouraged the creation of new music ­ beyond opera.



9. CONCLUSIONS
        This paper has used exogenous variation in the adoption of basic copyrights­ as a result of the
timing of Napoléon's military victories in Italy ­ to investigate the effects of copyrights on creativity.
Comparing changes in the creation of new operas across Italian states with and without copyrights, we
show that the adoption of basic copyrights encouraged the creation of new work. Moreover, we find
that copyrights changed the quality of creative output by encouraging composers to produce more
popular and durable works. These results generalize to a broader set of musical compositions and to
librettos, as the literary component to the score of operas. Based on these findings, we conclude that

the adoption of basic levels of copyright protection ­ not exceeding the lifetime of the composer ­ can
help to raise both the quantity and the quality of new creative works.
        Importantly, we find that extensions in the length of copyright beyond the composer's life did
not encourage creativity. Performance data reveal that few operas were played after the first 20 years,
which suggests that only the most durable creative goods stand to gain from copyright extensions.
Analyses of payments to 19th-century authors have shown that copyright extensions disproportionately
benefitted a small number of superstars, such as Sir Walter Scott (MacGarvie and Moser 2014).
Similarly, extensions in 19th-century Italy ­ beyond the life of the original composers ­ may have
disproportionately benefitted the heirs of superstar composer, such as Gioacchino Rossini, without
encouraging creative work. Thus, copyrights may have helped to turn the music into what Krueger
(2019, p.1) called a "superstar, winner-take-all affair [....] where a small number of performers did
fabulously well, while almost everyone else struggled to make ends meet."
        Moreover, copyrights engender a critical tradeoff between the benefits of increasing pay for
creative work today and the costs of restricting access for future generations. These dynamic costs of
copyrights are especially damaging for fields in which new creativity depends on access to existing
work. An analysis of US science has shown that copyright policies which reduce access costs can
encourage the creation of new follow-on science by encouraging broad-based participation (Biasi and
Moser 2019). Despite recent advances, more systematic theoretical and empirical research is needed to
improve our understanding of these tradeoffs and how copyrights, more generally, shape creativity and
innovation.

until 1800. State fixed effects control for variation in the creation of new operas that is constant over time. Year fixed effects control
for variation in opera output over time that is shared across states. Columns (1-4) are estimated using OLS; column (5) reports the
average treatment effect of a quasi-maximum likelihood Poisson regression with conditional fixed effects.

Notes: The dependent variable measures the count or share of historically popular operas (1-2), Met
operas (3-4) or durable operas (5-6). For example, share in column 2 measure the number of new
operas that were historically popular (appearing in Loewenberg 1978) divided by the total number
of new operas in state i and year t. Share in column 4 reports same share for operas that were
performed at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York at least once between 1900 and 2014.
Share in column 6 report the share for durable operas that were still available as a complete
recording on Amazon in 2014. The indicator Lombardy & Venetia equals 1 for Lombardy and
Venetia, which adopted copyright laws in 1801. The indicator post equals 1 for years after 1800.
The pre-1801 mean reports the average number / share of high-quality operas per state and year
before 1801. State fixed effects control for variation in the creation of new operas that is constant
over time. Year fixed effects control for variation in opera creation over time that is shared across
states.

Notes: The dependent variable measures the count or share of all operas (1), historically popular operas (2-3), Met operas (4-5) or
durable operas (6-7). For instance, the share in column 3 measure the number of new operas that were historically popular (based on
notable performances in Loewenberg's (1978) Annals of Opera) divided by the total number of new operas in state i and year t. Share
in column 5 reports same share for operas that were performed at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York at least once between
1900 and 2014. Share in column 7 report the share for durable operas that were still available as a complete recording on Amazon in
2014. The indicator L&V equals 1 for Lombardy and Venetia, the two states that adopted copyrights in 1801. The indicator post equals
1 for years after 1800. Return Migrant equals 1 for composers who composed in Italy after composing at least one opera abroad.;
stayers equals 1 for composers who worked exclusively in the state where they premiered their first opera. The pre-1801 mean reports
the average number of new operas created per composer and year until 1800. Panel A includes all the composers; Panel B and C
exclude, respectively, composers in the top 10 percent and 20 percent of opera output.

Notes: The indicator adopt equals 1 if state i has adopted basic copyrights in year t but not extended lengths to life + 30.
The indicator extend30 equals 1 after a state i has extended its copyrights to life + 30 and before it extends copyrights life
+ 40. The indicator extend40 represent state-year pairs after state i has extended copyrights to life + 40. Pre-copyright
mean reports the mean of the dependent variable for state-year pairs without copyrights. Column (2) presents average

Notes: Lombardy & Venetia adopted copyright laws in 1801, after they had fallen under Napoleonic rule.
The vertical lines correspond to the bilateral treaty between Kingdom of Sardinia and Austria of 1840 that
extended copyright length from life+10 to life+30, and to the Italian copyright law of 1865 that extended
copyright length from life+30 to life+40. Data include 580 new operas that premiered between 1781 and
1820 across eight Italian states within the year 1900 borders of Italy.

Notes: Performances per year for the first 100 years since the premiere for 165 operas that premiered across Italy
between 1781 and 1820 and entered Loewenberg's (1978) Annals of Operas. Performances to the left of the vertical
line would be on copyright under a regime of life + 10, which Lombardy and Venetia began to offer in 1801. The
expected length of copyright under life + 10 equals 39.23 years: 10 years plus the expected remaining years of a
composer of the average age at the time of the premiere (See Appendix Table A1 for life table calculations).

Notes: Counts of repeat performances (in column states) of operas that had premiered in row states. Shaded areas represent repeat
performances of operas that would have been protected by copyrights. Copyrights were only valid in states with copyrights and not
enforceable in other states. By granting composers the right to charge theaters for repeat performances, copyrights increased the costs
of copyrighted operas to theaters in states with copyrights, and all else equal, there should be fewer repeat performances, as long as
copyrights were enforced.

Notes: Expected remaining years of life in 1800 using biographic data for 705 composers
who created at least one opera in Italy between 1770 and 1900. Data on birth and death
years from Dassori (1903), Ambiveri (1998), and the New Grove Dictionary of Music
and Musicians (2001).

We estimate remaining years of life for at the time of the premiere of an opera. Among
2,598 operas that premiered in Italy between 1770 and 1900 the average age of the
composer at the time of the premiere was 34 years. The life table shows the expected
years of life R([a; a+4], [t;t+4]) for composers in the age bracket [a, a+4] in intervals of
five calendar years [t, t+4] between 1795 and 1809.

R(34[1800,1804]) = 0.2 * R([30,34],[1800,1804]) + 0.8 * R([35,39],[1801,1804])
                 = 0.2 * 29.75 years + 0.8 * 29.23 years.

Life table estimates exceed the average age at death because they are conditional on a
composer's survival to age 34, the average age of a composer at the time of the premiere.
Life tables predict the expected remaining years of life R([a, a+4], [t, t+4]) for a
composer at age bracket [a, a+4] in intervals of five calendar years [t, t+4] between 1770
and 1900. For the median composer in age bracket [a, a+4], the expected remaining years
of life are the average remaining years of life across all composers in the same age
bracket and time interval [t, t+4].

Notes: Standard errors are clustered at the level of eight states, implementing Bertrand et al. (2004), who show that "collapsing the
data into pre- and post- periods produce consistent standard errors, even when the number of states is small." The dependent variable
new operas per state and year counts new operas created in state i per year t between 1781 and 1820. The indicator variable Lombardy
& Venetia equals 1 for Lombardy and Venetia, which adopted copyright laws in 1801; post indicates years after 1800. The pre-1801
mean reports the average number of new operas created per state and year until 1800. State fixed effects control for variation in opera
output across states that is constant over time. Year fixed effects control for variation over time that is shared across states. Columns
(1-4) are estimated using OLS.

Notes: This table checks whether the increase in opera creation in Lombardy and Venetia after 1800 may have been driven by outmigration
from the control group of other Italian states. It counts composers who had previously composed at least one opera in one of the column states
of origin with at least one opera in one of the row destination states.

Notes: The dependent variable new operas per state and year counts new operas created in city i and year t between 1781 and 1820 and
is de-trended by a linear pre-trend for Lombardy and Venetia, estimated for the pre-1801 data. Pre-copyright mean reports the mean of
the dependent variable ­ new operas per state and year ­ for year-state pairs without copyrights. Specifications (1-4) estimate OLS
regressions; specification (5) estimates the average treatment effect (ATE) of the conditional fixed effects quasi-maximum likelihood
Poisson regression.

Notes: The dependent variable new operas per state and year measures the number of new operas in state i and year t between 1781
and 1820. The indicator variable Lombardy & Venetia equals 1 for Lombardy and Venetia, which adopted copyright laws in 1801.
The indicator variable post equals 1 for years after 1800. Pre-1801 mean reports the average number of new operas per state and year
until 1800. State fixed effects control for variation in opera output that is constant over time. Year fixed effects control for variation
over time that is shared across states. Columns 1-2 exclude operas premiered in the city of Venice, columns 3-4 exclude operas
premiered in the city of Milan, columns 5-6 exclude operas premiered in the cities of Venice and Milan, and columns 7-8 exclude
operas premiered in the state of Venetia. Columns 1, 3, 5, and 7 are estimated using OLS; columns 2, 4, 6, and 8 report the average
treatment effect (ATE) of a quasi-maximum likelihood Poisson regression with conditional fixed effects.

Notes: The dependent variable measures the count or share of high-quality operas, using
different measures for quality. For example, the share of historically popular operas measures
the share of historically popular operas among all operas created in state i and year t between
1781 and 1820 (columns 2, 4, and 6). Panel A reports results for historically popular operas in
Loewenberg's (1978) Annals of Operas. Panel B reports results for operas that were performed
at least once at the Metropolitan opera house between 1900 and 2014. Panel C reports results for
durable operas that were still for sale as complete recordings on Amazon in 2014. The indicator
variable Lombardy & Venetia equals 1 for Lombardy and Venetia, which adopted copyright laws
in 1801. The indicator variable post equals 1 for years after 1800.

 Notes: The dependent variable measures the count or share of high-quality operas, using different measures for quality. For example,
 the share of historically popular operas measures the share of historically popular operas among all operas created in state i and year t
 between 1781 and 1820 (column). The indicator variable Lombardy & Venetia equals 1 for Lombardy and Venetia, which adopted
 copyright laws in 1801. The indicator variable post equals 1 for years after 1800. The pre-1801 mean reports the average number (or
 share) of high-quality operas per state and year before 1801.

Notes: The variable new operas per state and year is the average number of operas premiered in state i (columns) between year t and
year t+r (rows). No copyright indicates that state i did not offer copyrights protection in that time period. Life +10, 30, or 40 indicate
that state i offers exclusive rights in an opera for the duration of a composer's life plus 10, 30, or 40 years after his death. For example,
on average 1.16 operas were premiered in Venetia between 1770 and 1800, when the state offered no copyrights protection.

                              PER IL TEATRO REGIO DI TORINO


    Venezia, lí 3 Novembre 1803


    La precisione con cui mi scrivete nella cara vostra 12 scadente esige ch'io vi risponda coll'eguale
    sincerità. Non è già ch'io disprezzi l'offerta dei franchi 3000. Che mi proponete, ma questa riesce
    inferiore alle paghe concesse a me in Venezia. Dove per ogni ripetizione d'opera mi viene
    corrisposta una somma di franchi 200 dal 1801.


    Lascio dunque a voi la facoltà di stabilire il contratto con un adeguato accrescimento, acciò abbia
    luogo l'opera al teatro vostro ch'io valuto moltissimo. Vi assicuro ch'io mi induco a questo ribasso
    per il vero piacere di riuscire un affare con voi.

    Nell'attendere un vostro decisivo riscontro, mi offro disposto à vostri comandi, preggiandomi
    essere con perfetta stima.

    Vostro affezionatissimo servo e amico

    Stefano Pavesi

Venice, November 3, 1803

The precision of your offer with the deadline on November 12th requires that I respond to
you with the same level of sincerity. It is not that I disregard your offer of 3,000 francs.
But it is less than the pay I could get in Venice. There, I receive a sum of 200 francs for
each repeat performance of my work, since 1801.
I will give you the opportunity to offer a contract with an appropriate increase, so that the
opera that I value so much can be performed at your theater. I assure you that I would
even accept a lower offer in exchange for the pleasure of doing business with you.
While I await your reply, I am at your service, and remain yours faithfully, with the
highest esteem.
Your affectionate servant and friend,
Stefano Pavesi

copyright law.




Authors' translation from the Italian: Before the end of the 18th-century, it would be wrong
to say that there were real or true property right for authors, even though some privileges
were granted to authors and booksellers. A first and tentative legislative acknowledgement
of authors' right occurred with the January 13-19, 1791 Decree of the French National
Assembly, which prohibited performances of works whose authors were still alive, without
their consent. It was also added that the heirs or assignees would have been "owners" of
the authors' works for five years after the authors' death. Two years later, the National
Convention passed the Law of July 19-24, 1793, with which it recognized the exclusive
right of the author for all creative work.
In Italy, the first acknowledgment of "the most sacred and precious of all properties"
occurred with the Law of 19 Fiorile anno IX (May 9, 1801) of the Cisalpine Republic; it
was followed by the Edict September 23, 1826 for Papal State, the Decree February 5, 1828
for the Kingdom of Two Sicilies, the Decree December 22, 1840 of Maria Luigia for the
Duchy of Parma, Piacenza, and Guastalla.

The Kingdom of Italy passed its first copyright law on June 25, 1865, as Legge n.2337.
With a few modifications, this law is still in force today.
Authors' translation from the Italian:
        6.1. The laws in Lombardo-Veneto were passed in two separate periods. The first
period coincides with the French occupation, the second with the Habsburg Restoration.
        In the French period, the first law was passed in Milan on 19 Fiorile IX (May 9,
1801) in the period of the Cisalpine Republic.
        Art.1 provides that "the authors of any type of written works, composers, painters,
and designers of carvings and drawings, have, for the duration of their lives, exclusive
rights to sell, allow to sell, and distribute their works in the Cisalpine Territory, and to cede
this property to someone else, either in part or as whole," thereby establishing the existence
of a right for the author that no privilege granted by a government could ensure.
        With the Habsburg Restoration, French laws lost their strength, but the path of
codifying property rights that had been traced by the Napoleonic Code remained open, and
the Habsburg Empire followed it. The Allgemeines Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch (ABGB)1
came into effect on 1812, and focused attention on the protection of the copyrights for
authors.
        The decree of September 28, 1815 established that the ABGB would become law
in Lombardy and Venetia on January 1, 1816.
        Even though these rules had been originally conceived to protect new book editions,
an Addendum to the Act extended the provisions to musical compositions.

Even though a portion of the Venetian Republic, including Venice, was granted to
Austria in the Treaty of Luneville, an account of all laws of the Cisalpine Republic (the
