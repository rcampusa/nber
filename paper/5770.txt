        While much economic policy presumes that more information infrastructure yields higher

economic returns, little empirical work measures the magnitudes of these returns.            We examine

investment by local exchange telephone companies in fiber optic cable, ISDN lines and signal seven

software,     infrastructure    which plays an essential role in bringing digital technology     to local

telephone networks.       We estimate the elmticity of the derived demand for infrastructure investment

faced by local exchange companies, controlling for factors such as local economic activity and the

political disposition of state regulators.     Our model postulates a regulated profit maximizing   local

exchange firm and a regulatory agency with predetermined political leanings in favor of consumer

prices or firm profits.        The model accounts for variation in state regulation and local economic

conditions.

         In all our estimates we find that consumer demand is sensitive to investment in modem

infrastructure,     particularly    as represented   by fiber optic cable.   Our estimates    imply that

infrastructure investment is responsible for a substantial fraction of the recent growth in consumer

surplus and business revenue in local telecommunication          services.

I. Introdllction

                Much recent policy discussion presumes that improvements           in information    infrastructure

lead to large economic returns. Despite the explosive growth in recent commentary                     about the

development            and impact of digital infi-astructure, there have been few attempts to estimate the

magnitudes of the economic gains associated with improving information                    infrastructure.

                This should not be a surprise. Some well known problems in the economics of

technology, infrastmcture           and measurement make this estimation particularly         difficult. First,

calculating the economic trade-off between old and new technologies                  or equipment requires

knowledge about the benefits associated with modem facilities relative to those arising from

existing ones. Yet, it is. difficult to measure levels of quality and quantity of infrastructure, let

alone differences between old and new. Second, although infrastructure                  improvements        may

reduce the costs of providing new services and increme the quality of old services, the exact

benefits associated with these changes may be difficult to trace. Third, questions about economic

benefits require information          about the demand for the incremental improvements             associated with

modernization.           Measuring demand for such change requires information          about users’ valuation,

which are also hard to learn. Inferences from actual behavior require appropriate models and

extensive data collection. These are not easy to match to each other as the particularities                 of

institutions and markets influence both the availability of data and the appropriateness                 of the

models at hand. Finally, multiple information technology markets comprise the information

infrastructure, but at best, any study can only focus on a few markets at a time.

                In this study we focus on one type of modem itiastructure,         digital technology,      in a

particularly important setting, local telephone service. We measure how investments                    in digital

technology influence the demand for -- and economic value of -- local telecommunications

services.          Local telephone networks are a crucial part of the much-anticipated         “information

super-highway.”           The main providers of local telephone sewice in the United States generate

revenues in excess of seventy billion dollars in 1992 and they offer service to over ninety percent

of the US population.          Yet, the benefits associated with modernizing       these firm’s networks

remains sketchy.

                More specifically, this study focuses on memuring the impact of modernizing              Local

Exchange Companies’        (LECS) telecommunications       infrastructure at the sub-state level, which is

the most disaggregate     level at which one can measure local phone company infrastmcture. At

this level of aggregation there is a statistical “natural experiment,” i.e., there is a large regional

variation in the quality of local telephone nenvorks across the United States, particularly in the

level of digital technology.   Further, LECS also cover different geographic territory, face different

state regulatory environments,     and operate under very different local economic conditions. Some

of these features vary widely across the US and a few vary widely over time. All this regional

variation provides an opportunity to relate regional variation in infrastructure        quality to regional

variation in telephone demand and revenue, While this variation has been recognized for some

years as a source of many mini-experiments        in telecommunications       across the US, it has been

difficult to translate into a measurement framework. In this study we offer both a novel data

collection effort and a novel modeling framework for taking advantage of this variation.

            Several key factors shape our econometric and measurement strategy. First, we need a

model of demand that is consistent with economic theory, flexible enough to lend itse~ to

estimation and related welfare inferences, but robust to a variety of specifications.        Our’strategy is

to treat the demand for infrastmcture    as a derived demand for the input of a regulated firm, where

that input influences the revenues a firm collects. Second, some part of investment behavior

responds to factors such as local economic activity and the political disposition of state ,
regulators. We need to control for these factors, so we collect very extensive data on the

economic and demographic        factors that influence telephone demand. Third, we camot observe

prices, nor the regulated process that determines them, though we can proxy for both. Thus, our

goal is to estimate the elmticity of final user demand for infrastructure investment by their LEC,

but not employ a method that depends on any particular estimate of the price elasticity of

demand.

            Our approach attempts to hold measurement problems to the lowest minimum possible,

since geographic variation in the quality of local telephone ne~orks          should lead to related (and

localized) geographic variation in the quality and amount of local telephone revenue.           This study

also differs from previous research in our econometrics        treatment of these issues: we treat

modem infrastructure      as endogenous, we estimate all effects within the structure of a
.+ U: US[31.   1996                    lbrELF.4REBE.YEFITS FRO.\[ 1.VFR4STRUCXRE                                  Page 3


regulator/utility       interaction model, and we offer an expanded list of “controls” (i.e., regressors)

for related economic behavior. Thus, our study advances novel approaches to issues pertinent to

the economics of information infrastructure,           empirical models of regulation and the measurement

of benefits to users from technical change.

               ?Ve specifically examine investment in fiber optic cable, Integrated Services Digital

Network (ISDN) lines and signal seven software (SS7), infrastructure                   which plays an essential

role in bringing digital technology to LEC’s networks (more on the technology below). We

broadly interpret these as measures of a whole range of digital technology which are demand

enhancing. We find that fiber-optic cable greatly enhances LEC demand, but the contribution

from ISDN and SS7 is probably smaller as of 1992, when our data ends. The estimated elasticity

of consumer surplus to fiber optic deployment is never less than 7 percent and is much higher in

some estimates. The elasticity of consumer surplus for ISDN ranges between zero and 16

percent. The elasticity for SS7 is not robustly estimated.

               We cannot say how much of the additional revenue brought about by these inwstments

were or were not captured by the LEC or consumers, but these estimates are consistent with large

social returns to investment in digital technology, especially those technologies                related to fiber

optic cable. Our estimates also appear consistent with industry consensus that in the absence of

LEC investment in new technologies,           revenues would have fallen in many localities. It is also

consistent with the view that LECS differed tremendously               in the returns and installation costs

associated with these investments due to local economic conditions,                  and that these differences

have narrowed somewhat over time. We also find quantitative evidence that the political and

regulatory environment had a large role in shaping the differences in returns to new infrastructure

across localities.



II. The Economic Consequences              from Modernizing        Infrastructure

               In this study, we ask whether variation in the degree of modernization          across regions of

the US influences economic outcomes in those regions.                What are the additional cost and benefits

of upgrading from a merely fictional           system to a state-of-the-art        digital system capable of

carrying many additional services? mere has been surprisingly                little reseach   done on this

question, though related issues in telecommunications                and infrastructure have received

considerable           attention outside the US context. “z

                Our approach to this question is in the spirit of a line of new research primarily on

information technology -- and new goods more generally (Bresnahan and Gordon [1996]).;This

research tries to measure the benefits to users from improvements                  in technology by estimating

the underlying (derived) demand for the new technology                  or the new sewice it enables. This

literature places emphasis on modeling heterogeneous                 consumer demand for technical

improvement.            It tries to link estimation and inferences to the underlying utility msociated with

new technology, though no standard technique has yet emerged for making such estimates.

                Our goals also relate to an extensive literature on the economic consequences of

infrastructure         investment in modem market economies, where infrastmcture                 is broadly defined as

highways, water and sewer systems, schools, hospitals, electrical and transportation                    facilities,

and other publicly owned equipment and structures.’ We will not review all these studies here,

and instead, will focus only on recent studies of the modernization                    of telecommunications

networks in developed economies, a topic relates most closely to our focus. These studies find

that a large fraction of economic growth maybe attributable to increases in the efficiency of

telecommunications            infrastmcture.5These    studies also argue that some part of regional variation

in economic activity may be attributed to the quality of regional telecommunications

infrastmcture.6

                We are sensitive to many of the methodological        concerns raised in these studies. We

adopt a framework that has elements of change embedded in it, albeit in a simple structural

model. Second, our econometrics framework controls for statistical endogeneity. Third, we use a

very disaggregate            analysis, below the state level, but contrast infimtructure        across many

different regions, taking advantage of the statistical variation embedded in cross-regional

differences in telecommunications            network quality. Fourth, unlike previous studies, our

estimation begins to account for some of the institutional              features of telecommunications         politics

and regulatory environment. Fifth, we use a structural model to link our estimates directly back

to parameters of direct economic interest, the benefits to buyers from technical change.

III. Model and Econometrics

            We undertake our analysis at the level of the local exchange company at the sub-state

level. This is the most disaggregate level of data available on local telephone infrastructure. This

also takes advantage of the peculiw federalism of local telephone service within the US.

Furthermore,          every state divides its territory be~een      a regional bell operating company and

potentially other local telephone companies, such as GTE or other independents.                    Thus, two

different LECS may face different regional demand and regulatory restrictions even if they are

within the same state or within proximate geographic regions.

            We observe some of the differences in the quality and quantity of infrastructure between

LECS and match it to LEC specific revenue. We also observe some of the variation in local

demographic           and economic conditions (at the LEC level), as well as some of the differences in

state regulatory environments          between states. However, we are not able to obseme the multiple

tariffs that prevail within each LEC for calls of different distance at different times of the day,

nor the various toll prices for within-state calls. Thus, to make use of LEC-specific data on

revenue and infrastmcture,          we require a method for estimating an infrastmcture           elasticity that

should not depend on observing prices at all.



1. Modei of demand.

            We derive a model to guide our estimation, both in terms of selecting appropriate

regressors and of interpreting the coefficients of the final system. Our model has the following

actors: A regulator and a profit maximizing LEC that invests in a single infrastructure variable,

fiber, with a single product (local telephone semice) and price (which, as mentioned, we will not

observe).          The regulatory agency has predetermined        political leanings in favor of consumers or

firms. The model, then, accommodates               variation in local economic and regulatory conditions.

The key assumptions           in the model concern the relationship       between itiastructure     and final
                                .
demand, We assume that infrastructure rotates outward the demand for telecommunications                         as it

leads to the provision of new services. Increases in infi-astructure have the feature of making the

demand for telecommunications             more elastic. Although this assumption        makes intuitive sense

for the technologies we study,’ it is nevertheless a strong parametric assumption.*

          In particular if we let Q represent quantity demanded then



                                                                                                               (1)



where X represents a vector of location specific demographic            and economic variables, I

represents the installed level of fiber and P represents the price of final senice.           Consumer

surplus is given by

          The effect on consumer welfare from infrastructure        deployment is represented as either:

                                                                    —
                             es              c~(~x>~~)                         X1,)       ,



where 1, and Iz measure yesterday’s and today’s level of infrastructure               deployment, or as



                                                                    = EQJ




         The first formulation measures the change in consumer surplus attributable to

infrastmcture     deployment as a percent of the end period’s level, holding constant prices .9The

second measures the elasticity of consumer surplus with respect to infrastructure,              also holding

constant prices. Under our parametric assumptions,         the elasticity of consumer surplus with

respect to infrastructure deployment is the same as the elmticity of demand with respect to

infrastructure.

         Similarly, the historical effect on revenues from itiastructure              deployment maybe

represented as:

           That is, the percentage change in revenue attributable                to ifiastructure   deployment

relative to final period’s revenue is the same as the percentage change in consumer surplus.’0

Similarly, the marginal revenue associated with another unit of infrastructure                      is


                                          d PQ               ;(0                 PQ

which provides one measure of the differences in returns to investment faced by different firms

           Under any specification, the key parameters are f(I) and e~I. The goal of our model is to

use standard behavioral assumptions for firms and regulators to derive a minimal set of

parametric restrictions for estimating f(I).



2. Equilibrium       interpretation.

           We assume that the regulator and the company play a Nash game. The regulator chooses

price, while the company chooses the level of infraswcture.                      Each player chooses its optimal

strategy holding constant the strategy of the other. In equilibrium,                   each is a best response to the

other. We msurne that the regulator maimizes                 a weighted average of consumer and producer

surplus (current cash flow), while the firm maximizes the present value of the profit stream

associated with investment.           For pedagogical convenience,            we also assume that digital

infrastructure     only enhances demand and does not change operating costs. This is plausible since

most modernizing        infrastructure investment has negligible influence on the marginal costs of

providing telephone service, but does involve substantial                   installation expenses.’ 1

           Regulators choose prices to reflect the political disposition of the state and the locality.

               Regulatory optimization - as in (4) - implies that the equilibrium        price -P* - is a @ction

of 0 and X. The intuition is that regulators choose a price to achieve a desired elasticity of

demand (in line with political demands as represented by 6).]; Finally, substituting                 in (4) revenue

for price (P=R/f(I)g(X,P))         we obtain


                                         R = - flfl(e      - 1) ‘(X’P)2                                          (4a)

               From (4a), then, we obtain that revenue is a function of I, 0,X and P. But from (4), P is a

function only of X and 0, making R also a function only of I, 0 and X. Equation (4a) implies also

that the Nash equilibrium assumption is not necessary to estimate the revenue equation (4a).

Thus, the estimation of (4a) is robust to any type of investment model assumed.14 That is, the

estimation of (4a) can be done simply by (non-linear) two stage least squares, instrumenting                      for P

and I. As we explain below, most of our estimates are simply various specifications                   for (4a).

Thus, most of our analysis only requires implementing               two stage least squares methods.

3. Regulation,       prices, andpo[itical     constraints.

             Prices, regulations,   and political constraints vary across states. We modi& the generic

model in equation (4a) to account for such heterogeneity.             Following quantitative models of

telecommunications          regulation, we make two assumptions           (see, for example, Smart [1995]).

First, regulators set prices based on 6 and XL, where the latter represents a vector of economic

and demographic         factors at the level of the LEC. Second, the bias towards customers, 0, arises

from a complex political process, taking place partially at the state level and partially at the LEC

level. We measure several factors influencing this process. We label them economic and

demographic        variables at the LEC level, XL, economic and demographic             vmiables at the State,

Xs, and other (partially observable) political variables at the state, S. That is,

                                                                                                              (5)


Thus, substituting       (5) into (4a), we can rewrite (4a) to obtain

                                     log (R*) = log fl~        + J(XSJL,S)


4. Functional       Form

            If we let f(.) be Cobb-Dougl=,        then

                                                 log ~~)     = y log (~


implying that the elasticity of consumer surplus with respect to infrastructure,             e~I, is given by y.

If we let f(.) be translog then


                                      log tin)     = y, log (n + Y* [log-(D]*



implying that e~[ varies for different levels of I. ~~, is then given by y, + 2yz log (I).

            With the Cobb-Douglas       assumption the revenue equation (4b) becomes:

                                      log   (R*) = ylog (z) + J(xLJ~,s)                                       (4C)


With the translog resumption the revenue equation becomes:

                                 log    (R*)     = yllog (~ + y2(log (~)z + J(XLJ~>S)



5. Econometric       considerations.

            We first propose to estimate our model using a two stage least square estimation of (4c),

which allows us to obtain the returns to infras~cture                     deployment without imposing cross

equation restrictions arising from a particular investment model. We start by specifying J(X~, X~,

S)= 5’X~ + 6zX~ + 5;S + ~. Thus, we estimate the Cobb-Douglas                             specification   as


                          log (R*)         = ylog (~ + 61XL + b2X~ + 63S + El                                         (4d)



In equation (4d) XL, X~ , arid S are exogenous, while R and I are endogenous.                             We instrument for

I with w, where w is a vector of exogenous LEC-specific                       infrastructure    installation cost factors.

y is the object of interest and is econometrically                 identified in the above. A similar and obvious

argument holds for the translog specification for f, where two coefficients for y will be

estimated.

           Some related observations: First, estimating (4d) requires that prices not be a function of

infrastructure,    as we have assumed all along .15Second, price elasticities are not identifiable from

(4d), because X, plays a role in the determination                   of 6 and in the determination         of final

demand.]b Third, the constants in XL,X~ and S or W are not identified.                          Fourth, the argument

leading to (4d) suggests that the list of control variables in XL, X~ , and S should be extensive,

trying to capture factors influencing regional variation in telephone demand in the absence of

digital itiastructure.      Further, the factors measuring our basic demographic                      instruments must be

exogenous to both the determination of R and I. Fifth, the Cobb-Douglas                            function assumes that

all LECS face the same infrmtructure elasticity. This assumption is virtually a necessity for this

study, since the data are not sufficiently rich to allow the estimation of LEC specific

infrastructure     elasticities. Sixth, there is no econometric             guarantee that the estimate for y will be

positive, though there is a presumption in the model that it is positive. ” Thus, a natural test for

the infrastructure     fiction         is whether the estimated coefficient differs horn zero. Seventh, the

above specification presumes positive Is, as we use the expression log(I). 1sFinally, under the

usual data limitations we cannot argue that we filly measure all infrastructure investment, and

that our estimates imply that investment in fiber-optic cable by itself leads to some percent

increase in revenues at all LECS. We can argue, however, that investment in fiber, which is one

necessary part of digital infrastmcture,     positively correlates with investments in a whole range of

digital technologies     which are revenue enhancing. This precaution informs the interpretation

below.



6. Investment      bejzavior

            To explore some of the features of investment we solve for the profit maximizing level of

infrastmcture      under the assumption that the features of the environment which influence LEC

investment do not change. This is the most natural model (of the many possible) for illustrating

the determinants      of cost. This is sufficient for our purposes since we do not use this investment

model for any welfare inferences.                                                                 r
            At time t, firms maximize the net present value of profits given by



                                                                                                         (6)    .




where b is the firm’s discount rate and W are LEC-specific          factors that influence the cost of

installing infrastructure.     Assuming stationarity of X and (3over time, and that W is known, then

by (4) P is then stationary, and we can solve (6) to obtain an optimal I at time t.’g

            The firm’s first order condition with respect to I is then given by


                                                                                                         (7)



where A is a term including discount rates and other factors. By substituting           revenue for price,

and performing other manipulations,        equation (7) can be remanged      to yield

                                                                                                                    (7a)



                From (7a), the equilibrium level of infiastmcture,         I*, is a function of W, ~~,, X, and P and

discount factors. Assuming a Nash equilibrium, then, I = I* and P = P*. By equation (4), P* may

be solved independently               of the value of I*, while I* must account for P* by equation (7). Hence,

assuming a unique solution from combining (4) and (7) and solving for I* and P*, I* becomes an

implicit functions of ~~,, W, (3and X, while P* is an implicit function only of only (3and X,

                Although this model may be too simple to describe actual regulator/firm interactions,                  it

is useful for estimating some of the bmic determinants                  of installation costs. It also highlights

identification         issues in our econometrics estimation.        If we wish to estimate (4d) simultaneously

with an investment equation, then by (7a) it follows that we must estimate an investment

equation of the form


                            log (I*) = log (R*) + log (y) – log (W) + constant                                   (7b)



where the above has assumed a Cobb-Douglas                    specification   for f~). Letting W = aw + ~, we use

non-linear three stage least squares to estimate (4d) and

                           log (I*)     = log (R*)   + log (y) – ~W + constant            + E2                       (7C)


            If we estimate a WO equation system consisting               of (4d) and (7c), we not only improve the

efficiency of our estimate of y, but also, given the functional form and investment model

~surnptions,           estimate the distribution of costs across firms, and their evolution.          These additional

benefits, though, come at a price because of the limited flexibility of equation (7c).



7. E.rtensions to multip[e inpufi.

            Since many infrmtructure technologies are complement~,                      it is important to measure

infrastmcture          investment in several technologies       simultaneously.     Assume that NO types of

infrastmcture,          1, and Iz, influence demand. Let Q=f(I, ,Iz)g(X,P) and Wi = Cost of installing a

unit of     Ii, I= 1,2. T’hen the investment decision has two first order equations,



                                                                                                                  (7)




Assuming a Cobb-Douglas            formulation for f(.), and after performing various substitutions we

obtain the system of equations which easily generalizes to more than two infrastmcture variables:


                   log (R*)   = yllog (Ilj    + yzlog (lz”) + 61X~ + 62X~ + 53s + ~1                            (4e)


                   log (~,”) = log (R*)      + log (y) – awi +    COnStUnt   + E2,     i=1,2                     (7d)


We only estimate the Cobb-Douglas              specification of the infrastmcture    function for multiple

inputs ,20

                                                                                                        r

8. Sltmmary.

            Our estimates will provide a measure of the impact of infrastructure deployment on

consumer welfare. There are two key identification            conditions. First, the determination          of price,

by whatever political and regulatory process, must occur independently                of the level of

infrastructure      -- though the investment in infiastmcture      may be a function of price level. Second,

telephone demand must be multiplicative             in (almost) any function of infrastructure    in order to

lead to closed, simple and ultimately measurable relationships between revenue levels and

infrastructure      levels. These observations are useful for choosing instruments.



9. Specl~cation.

            We estimate three specifications      of the basic system. Our basic specification for (4d), and

(7c) when applicable, will assume a Cobb-Douglm               benefit function and use the following

variables:



XL= {constant, log total LEC population, fraction LEC urbanized, fraction rural, log LEC per
August 31.1996                     lVELF.4REBE.VEFfX FRO.\l 1.VFR4~R tiCTCRE                                Page 14


          capita income, year dummies, small LEC (state employment               in this LEC less than 10

          percent), log population density, city of half million, city of quarter of million, fast

          growing area}.

X~ = {constant, state GNP growth, log state/local per capita income, fraction of state

          employment in finance, insurance, and real estate}.

S = {constant, non-elected regulator, democrat majority of regulators, interaction of not-elected

          and democrat majority, vote for Dukakis in 1988, governor democrat, legislature

          democratic, legislature republican, governor and regulator from same party, governor and
          regulator and legislature from same party}.

w = {constant, log of LEC construction wages, log of LEC level of construction employment,

          LEC growth in level of employment in construction,         year dummies, holding company

          dummies, log of stock of fiber in 1986, translog in population          and land }.



          In our second specification of the Cobb-Douglas       benefit finction      we include qine holding

company dummies in XL. These dummies stand in for holding company specific differences in

the growth of revenues, In our third specification we use the same covariates as listed above

(without the holding company dummies), and estimate a translog. We only do this for fiber-optic

cable, where the larger sample size describing firms’s deployment              of fiber yields sufficient

degrees of freedom. For reasons explained below, each specification              will be estimated on two

different measures of revenue. One measures only local telephone revenue within the LEC. The

other includes access charges horn long distance telephone calls, which forms a significant

fraction of many LEC’S revenues. ~is        results in six specifications      for the estimation using only

fiber optic cable and four specifications for the estimation using fiber, ISDN and SS7 together.

We employ this number of specifications in order to explore the robustness of the inferences to

different specifications.



IV. Data

         We undertake our analysis at the local exchange company at the sub-state level. Every

RBOC has a state company and many states divide its telephone franchise territory between one

of the RBOCS and other national and local companies.                    We use three main sources of information

to understand these firms. For local-exchange company specific information&d                          data on

infrmtmcture              we use an augmented version of the data developed by Greenstein, McMaster and

Spiller [1995] (GMS) and Greenstein and Spiller [1995]. For data on political and regulatory

v~ables            we use the Book of the State published by the Council of State Governments, and we

use the Yearbooks of the National Association of Regulatory                    Utility Commissioners.

                 GMS gathered demographic characteristics for each of the LEC’S territories in each state

for the period since divestiture.            Because demographic       information     is available until 1992, and

most of the relevant digital infrastmcture data start to be reported in 1986, the GMS data set

covers the period 1986-1992.               GIMS also gathered infrastructure       statistics for all those LECS that

file annually with the FCC. They file using forms M and ARMIS 43-03,43-04                          and 43-07

(Alaska, and Hawaii were excluded). There are 101 local exchange carriers in each year of the

GMS data,z’ which results in a data set with a m~yimum of 707 observations.                       The demographic

information              was collected at the county level, and was then assigned to the dominant parrier

within its boundaries according to maps showing the local exchange carriers’ territories in each

state.p The county data are then aggregated to the company level within each state.2; The main

source of the demographic (county level) data is the Annual Estimates of tie US Bureau of

Economic Analysis, Department of Commerce, “Regional Economic Information Systems

tiual            CD,” and the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Employment            and Earning Annual Reports.



1. Infraslructlire.

                 We construct our sample from the largest local exchange companies (LECS) within the

United States at the sub-state level.z’ Data on miles of fiber optic cable covers 1986 until 1992

and is available for all companies -- RBOC, GTE, Contel, and many independents.z5 Data on

number of ISDN Iines,zb and SS7 switches covers 1988 until 1992 and is ordy available for the

RBOCS, GTE, Contel and very few independents.z7 As described in the three previous footnotes,

each of our infrastmcture variables measures increasing digitalization                   of a modem telephone

network.

                 All three of these infrastructure variables grew rapidly over our sample period (if
August 31.1996                    lVELF.4REBE.VEFITSFRO.111.VFR4STRCC~RE                             Page 16


somewhat unevenly across companies and across time) and continues to grow today. For

example, the median number of fiber miles for all 101 LECS in 1992 was 22,371. Most LECS

increased the number of miles of fiber in their networks, with many smaller LECS starting from

very low levels in the mid 1980s. The median multiple increase was four times from its level

from 19S8. me total number of fiber miles (this includes both “lit” and “dark” fiber) at the 101

LECS was 6,385,578 in 1992.



2. Revenl[e.

          We supplement these data with information on LEC revenues, as reported to the FCC.

This data are also collected as far back as 1986, but contain irreconcilable    changes in definitions

between 1987 and 1988.28 ~is      is the most binding constraint on our sample. It begins with 1988

and ends in 1992. Many small independent LECS do not report revenue at all and a few do not do

so until the later years in our sample.z9

         As a measure of a LEC’S revenue we collected net operating revenue (“category 550” in

the FCC reports), which contains both revenue for local calls and access charges. We also

collected revenue for basic local service (“category 520” in the FCC reports), which contains no

access charges but does contain several other miscellaneous       categories of revenue. The first

category of revenue more closely fits our model of LEC revenue. However, access charges form

a significant fraction of LEC revenue and have recently been changing as they come under

greater regulatory scrutiny and competitive pressure. We test the sensitivity of our results to the

definition of revenue.

         For each specification we will report ~o    different estimates, one using all revenue and

one using only local revenue. Among the balanced panel, casual inspection shows some variation

in revenue from one year to the next, but on average very little change in inflation adjusted levels

of revenue at most LECS over the five years. About half the sample saw an increme while the

other half saw a decrease -- usually this was not more than 5-10 percent in either direction, but a

few LECS did experience as much as 20% change in revenue.

            Local and state demographic and economic variables come from the BEA reports for

economic activity at the county level. We matched these reports against LEC territory maps, as

explained in GIMS [1995]. This provides data on total population, their composition,                wages,

employment           and other economic activity at the LEC level.

            For the instruments    in the two-stage least square estimates and for our marginal cost

equations we use different features of construction markets -- their size, level of wages and recent

growth. The memure of size controls for scale, construction             wages controls for construction

costs, and construction        employment growth controls for capacity constraints or downturns that

either raise or lower expenses. We include time dummies to reflect widely reported declines in

the costs of inputs and installation, particularly among fiber and ISDN. We include holding

company dummies to reflect differences in the ability of firms to install digital equipment. We

exclude the independent         company dummies in the full sample and Contel and the independent

dummies in the partial sample. We include multiplicative             specifications    of costs in land and

population,         reflecting both economies and diseconomies      in network configuration.     Th,ese scale

economies and diseconomies           are associated with population size and geographic scope of sewice

territory. We also estimate an equation with inherited fiber in 1986; this stands in for inherited

costs advantages in installing digital equipment.

            For our revenue equation, we include total population and some of its features from BEA

estimates. The US census distinguishes between urbanized, suburban and rural population.

Suburban population lives in cities between five and fifty thousand total population.              We include

the fraction of the population of each type and exclude the fraction suburban. From BEA data we

include local per capita income, state per capita income, population density, state growth, and the

fraction of the state economy devoted to FIRE (finance, insurance and real estate). All these

measure the propensity of population and regional economy to use more telephone services and

political pressure to increase or decrease prices, We also include a dummy for whether a LEC is

very small (covers less than 10 percent of the state’s employment);                we expect these small LECS

to be predominantly         rural and protected by the regulatory process with higher prices or higher

access charges. We include time dummies, omitting the initial year.

            We also add a dummy for whether the LEC contains a city within its boundaries with a

population over half a million, according to the 1990 US Census.;o While these areas are

geographically     minute relative to a typical LEC geographic territory, they play a central role in

many regional economies, drawing population from surrounding territory daily for work, serving

as the hub and coordinator of much outlying economic activity in the periphery. We also use a

dummy for whether the LEC contains a city over a quarter million. Finally, we add a dummy for

whether the LEC covers an area designated as one of the fifty fastest growing SMSAS in the US

in the 1980s, again from the US census.~l



4. Po[iticai variables.

          For every year we collected the political Wlliation of all state regulators in the state
agency in charge of telecommunications,       if known; othewise      we report the political party of the

governor that appointed the regulator. The source is the Yearbooks of the National Association

of Regulatory Utility Commissioners.       We used the Book of the States (VOL 25-29), Tables 2.1

and 3.2, for counts for the political affiliation of every legislator in the house and sen~te, as well

as the governor. We dropped Nebraska and Washington DC from the sample because neither

contains a bicameral legislature .32We include dummies for whether democrats are a majority in

tie state regulatory agency or not.;3 We also include dummies for whether the regulators are

elected on not (appointed = 1), as positive political theory predicts that the method of

appointment      should influence telecommunications     regulatory behavior (See e.g., Smart [1995]).

We also interact regulatory majority with election/appointment.

         We further include the fraction of the popular vote for Dukakis in 1988 as a measure of

the political leanings of the state. Further, we include three dummies for the political affiliation

of the governor (Democrat = 1) and also for the legislature when both houses are from the same

party. The omitted category is any non-aligned legislature.        Finally, we include NO dummies for

political alignment, which may influence the ease with which political institutions        make changes

and commitment       to regulatory policy and indirectly determine a firm’s revenue (see Sm~

[1995], and Levy and Spiller [1994]). One dummy takes on the value of one when the regulatory

agency and the governor me from the same party, the other takes on the value of one when the

regulatory agency, the governor and the legislature are from the same party.;~

5. Final data set.

            Afier applying the selection criteria described above, the full sample (containing

information only about fiber) has 458 observations for 1988-1992. The partial sample

(containing information about fiber, ISDN and SS7) has 308 observations for 1989-1992. Both

are unbalanced panels, with complete obsemations            for the RBOCS and GTE, and many

incomplete observations for other independents. Table 1 reports descriptive statistics for all

endogenous and exogenous variables, putting the instruments              in the same category as local

demographic variables. We also report the infrastmcture            variables for the partial sample. Since

there were no significant differences between the descriptive statistics for the exogenous

variables for the full and partial sample (except in the firm dummies, as noted), we only report

the results for the full sample.



X Estimation        and results                                                                 r

            Since the two and three stage estimates of the revenue equation are not that different, we

focus on the two stage least square estimates for most of the discussion and present the three

stage least square results at the end to discuss the cost side. The larger sample (N=458) is used

for the model using only fiber. The smaller sample (N=308) estimates the model using fiber,

ISDN and SS7. Since we estimate the model on these unbalanced panels we interpret the

estimates accordingly, We view each year’s cross section of data as providing independent

observations on the same underlying relationship. Each Table presents four sets of estimates, WO

different specifications     of revenue equation for two different revenue variables. Thus, all of our

conclusions about welfare results from itirastructure         are supported by either set of the revenue

equation estimates. Only the conclusions about cost indexes require the cost equations in the

three stage estimates.



1. Revenue equation estimates

            In Table 2 the infrastructure coefficient (only on fiber), which we interpret as the

elasticity of demand with respect to fiber, is significant and large. The estimates range from 0.06
~U:US[31.   1996                      JVELF.4RE BE.VEF~   FRO.\f 1.YFR4STRtiCTURE                           Page 20


to 0.11. The coefficients on fiber are always positive and significant.              The first two columns of

Table 1 in the appendix presents translog estimates for the basic specification and we summarize

the results in the bottom of Table 4.;5 The range of the estimates do not differ much horn their

values in Table 2, where the elasticities were assumed constant across all specifications. Hence,

we conclude that the translog specification for fiber adds little additional information in this

specification.

            We now ~       to the multiple infrastmcture     estimates, found in Table 3 and summarized in

Table 4. Table 3 contains even higher estimates for elasticity for fiber than in Table 2, ranging

from 0.08 to 0.18. The coefficients on ISDN are always positive and only significant when we

include the holding company dummies.             Their low value is zero and their high is 0.16 in column

3 of table 3. The coefficients on SS7 are always negative except in column 4. This may indicate

that investment in SS7 is too positively collinear with investment in ISDN and fiber to be

informative.       These results may also indicate that the bulk of the diffision        of SS7 and ISDN takes

place too late in our data to have much effect on revenue. Updating this to more recent years

could yield quite different estimates, if recent publicity is to be believed. Further explorations

with translog specifications       did not yield any additional insight and are not shown.;b In the

discussion below we explore the implications of the magnitude of these estimates and their

interpretation.     A consemative    conclusion so fti is that fiber infrastructure      contributes to

enhancing demand, but that the others, by themselves,              do not do so at all or not greatly.

            We now discuss the estimates of the coefficients on the controls, which do not largely

differ between Tables 2 and 3. The control variables help predict revenue, largely in the predicted

direction. We first briefly review local demographics.            Total population does increase revenues,

but at an elasticity less than one. Higher fractions of urbanized and rural populations do lead to

higher revenues (relative to suburban populations),           but the coefficient magnitudes are usually

higher for the rural arem in most estimates; in other words, trading a set fraction of urbanized for

rural population, holding constant population size, increases revenue. However, trading either

one for a moderately small town will decrease revenue significantly.                Small territories have higher

revenue, probably reflecting higher prices going to small rural areas. Population density is never

significant. The time dummies and sometimes the city hubs dummies (city with one quarter
~U:USl31.    1996                    IFELF.4REBE.YEF1~ FRO.\[ 1.VFR45TRCCTURE                         Page 21


million) generally have the expected signs and are ofien significmt.            me time dummies indicate

a secular decline in revenue over time in the absence of other changes, though they vary widely

in their rates from one set of estimates to another. It is also difficult to make any robust

inferences from the LEC dummies in the revenue equation.

            Of the state demographics,   the log of state to local per capita income keeps its sign and

significance, though it varies in range. It says that the LEC benefits most when its per capita

income is much higher than the state average, and benefits least when the LEC is much lower

than the state average. When they are roughly the same, as when one LEC dominates most

territory within a state, then there is little effect. This coefficient perhaps indicates that the LEC

with much higher per capita income for the state contains concentrations           of high-income

generating economic activity for the state, such as would be found in the major city within a

state. The coefficient on finance, insurance and real-estate activity (FIRE) also tends to be

positive and significant in most specifications,      as expected. The difference between being in the

high and low FIRE state can have a large influence on LEC revenue.;’ State GNP gro~h                does

not matter.

            The coefficients on political variables contain several interesting estimates. First,

revenues are lowest when elected republicans are in charge of the regulatory commission, when

revenues may be lowered by as much as 30% or more. In all other situations (including

appointed republicans), the commission has roughly the same effect on revenues. Revenues are

also lower in states with high votes for Dukakis, but the magnitude of the effect is not too large

except between the extremes. Beween          the extremes revenues carI vary as much as 40°i0 (from

0.34 to 0.56, Utah and Massachusetts,       respectively).   None of the remaining political variables are

statistically significant in Table 2 and 3, though we note hints of several intriguing pattems.;s

Summarizing the state political variables, it seems that the regulatory agency and the political

leanings of the state have the largest effect on revenue, but the political affiliation of the different        .

state actors also plays a role in some circumstances.        We have more to say in the analysis below,

but we conclude tentatively that the political variables are important control variables to include

in the specification.

2. Calculating    buyer and seller benefits from infrastructure        investment

          We now use our coefficient estimates to calculate the benefits to producers from actual

infimtructure    investment.   We calculate the change in a period’s demand attributable to (actual)

infimtructure    relative to some bme demand year. We calculate this for every LEC in our sample

and then present summaries of these calculations. This calculation assumes that prices do not

change (e.g., because regulators compel it), which makes these estimates too optimistic if post-

investment prices fall or too pessimistic if they rise (from the LEC’s perspective) .39As noted in

the earlier section, this is not a true profit calculation, since we are not accounting for costs of

infras~cture     deployment, nor are we accounting for anticipated changes in prices (i.e.,

anticipated by the firm) in response to infrastmcture      deployment.

          We also noted above that we may use the same measure to calculate the benefits to

consumers from actual infras~cture       investment. This same measure provides the change in

consumer surplus attributable to infimticture       deployment     relative to a base year. For consumers

this calculation is too pessimistic if post-investment     prices actually fall or too optimistic if they

actually rise.

         Table 5 presents estimates of the welfare benefits from infrastmcture        investment, using

the estimates from Table 2 and Table 3. These are consewative            estimates, using the low

estimates from each table. In each case, we show the estimates we use. Since we have data on

fiber investment for all 101 LECS who report to the FCC, we use the whole sample (which is

slightly larger than the sample used for estimation of the coefficients).do This table compares

1992 with 1988. The next set of calculations uses a midrange estimate for fiber and a low

estimate for ISDN. We exclude SS7 since it is rarely significantly different from zero. We have

less data on ISDN for the 101 LECS. We are only able to make these calculations over 82 LECS

(which is also slightly ltiger than the sample used for estimation).”        These two sets of

calculations compare 1992 with 1989.

         In all the simulations in Table 5, the percent demand due to infrastructure       investment is

substantial. Table 5’s estimates show 10 percent of LEC demand on average was due to

investment in fiber. The median percent was 9 percent, indicating little skewness in the benefits

across LECS. In the simulations using two infrastructure        estimates, the estimates of the gain from
~U:US[   ~ 1.1996                       IVELFARE BE,\’EFm FRO.\[ I,VFR4STRCC~RE                                 Page 23


infrastructure        investment are much higher than in Table 2. This is partially a result of the higher

coefficient estimate for fiber (.11 vs .07), but also due to the addition of one more type of

infrastmcture,         ISDN. me mean and median increase in demand is 13 percent, with considerable

range of experiences across the LECS (s.d. = .08).

            These are large estimates.     As a consequence,        we can not reasonably argue that

investment          in ISDN and fiber-optic cable by   themselves      were responsible    for over ten percent of

revenue enhancement at all LECS. It is more likely that activity in a whole range of digital

technologies         accompany investment in fiber and the totality of all this investment was demand

enhancing.          Moreover, we cannot say how much demand enhancing investment was or was not

captured by the LEC due to regulated changes in prices. However, our estimates do appear

consistent with industry consensus that in the absence of LEC investment in new technologies,

revenues would have fallen in many localities.

            We now discuss the implications of Table 5 for inferences about consumer welfare. In all

the estimates, the enhancement to consumer surplus from infrastructure                    investment is the same as

the demand elasticity, which is large. Thus, we conclude that a high percentage increase in

consumer surplus, as much as a ten percent or more, is due to recent investment in digital

infrastructure        investment and the inves~ent     activities correlated with it.

            Since an estimate of the percentage surplus attributable to infrastructure           is scale free, it is

difficult to interpret without any base estimate for total consumer surplus, which is not

recoverable in our model. For expository ease we translate our estimate of the elasticity of

consumer surplus to ifiastructure          into its price-equivalent     change. More specifically, for a

constant elasticity of demand -- that is, Q = Af(I)P= -- we calculate the extent to which prices

must have declined to provide the same consumer surplus change as provided by actual

infrastmcture         investment, fixing I at its later value. If the estimated percentage increase in

consumer surplus due to ifiastructure           investment is given by O/OdC,then the percentage price

decline that provides the same amount of consumer surplus is given by %dP = [1 - %dC] {l/[]<Jl-

1, where e >1 is the elasticity of demand.~z Since we do not know the value of the elasticity of

demand, we calculate %dP under different resumptions                  about demand elasticities (i.e., e = 1.5,2

or 2.5). This is sufficient for our purposes, which is to illustrate the degree of the welfare changes

implicit in the estimates.

             These calculations are also in Table 5. Not surprisingly,         as demand becomes more elastic

a smaller price decline achieves the equivalent amount of consumer surplus.                     At most LECS the

increase in consumer surplus is equivalent to a decline of prices on the order of 12 and 8 percent

if demand elasticities are 2.0 and 2.5. The median is smaller, 10 and 6 percent respectively. The

estimates from Table 5 lead to higher gains to consumers than the estimates from table 2. Once

again, looking at the conservative estimates that exclude SS7, we see that the price equivalent

declines are 15 and 10 percent if demand elasticities are 2.0 and 2.5. For the elasticity of 1.5 the

equivalent price declines are much larger, but are not shown.~; No matter how we calculate it,

these gains are equivalent to substantial price declines. Since these are conservative methods we

conclude that the welfare benefits from infiastmcture               investment during the 1988-1992 period

were large.



3. Tile marginal retnrns from infrastrl[cture investment                                                ,

             Our model also provides insight into the diffusion of advanced digital infrastructure ,by

quantifying the LEC’S incentives to invest in more infrastructure.                 We can use our static model to

examine the marginal benefit to the LEC from more infrastructure.                   Under the Cobb-Douglas

specification       dR/dI =   (~)~QI,   where we estimate    ~Q[.   A Similar calculation for tie translog also

can be done. While investments in sunk assets are not entirely a static problem for the LEC, this

“as if’ exercise still yields usefil insight into the incentives influencing the diffusion of digital

infrastmcture.       This exercise only requires estimates of y and not cost estimates.

             Table 6 presents the estimates for different values of the elasticity of demand with respect

to fiber. The first three estimates show different values for y that span the lower range of

infrastructure      elasticity estimates found in tables 2 and 3. The last shows a comparison with the

translog estimates from Table 1 in the appendix. The table calculates the returns to one year’s

revenue from an additional “fiber-mile”, standardizing               in 1987 dollars. The table only examines

the LECS owned by the Regional Bell Operating Companies, who did most of the investment in

fiber in the United States.

             The table shows that for a low estimate of the el~ticity        to infrmtructure     by 1992 the
~U:USt31.    1996                      IVEI!F.4REBE,VEFI~ FRO.1[1.YFR45TRCCTCRE                             Page 25


median marginal return on another fiber mile was $662 in current revenue for our lowest

estimates of alpha. Even among the RBOCS there wm considerable variation in these returns.

The first quartile received $472 and third $835. The mean is slightly higher than the median,

showing a slightly skewed distribution. For the higher estimates of y, the same patterns holds

with all values increasing proportionately.

            The Table shows a dramatic the change over the five year period. The median marginal

return falls rapidly over the period. By 1992 it is at one quarter its level of 1988. This pattern

does not depend on the estimate for y (partly due to the Cobb-Douglas               assumption we use for

f(I)), The variation also declines sharply across all the LECS over the same period, again

irrespective of the estimate of y we use. This change largely reflects the reduction in the amount

of skewness in marginal returns. The LECS are becoming more alike over time.

            In the bottom we present the same simulations        using the most consemative      translog

estimate (where the mean elasticity is 0.6 over the sample and growing slightly over time). The

results do not differ much from the Cobb-Douglas             specification   in their main qualitative features.

The marginal returns to infrastmcture fall dramatically           over time and the range across firms also

falls, though the magnitudes do differ somewhat. Hence, we conclude that these patterns are not

a feature of the functional form we resume for the benefit function.

            These estimates are consistent with a relatively straightfomard         diffusion model. As the

user-costs of installing infrastmcture fell rapidly over the period, phone companies installed the

lower cost input deeper into their network, into places where its marginal return was lower. It is

reasonable to conjecture that the narrowing marginal returns are being driven by learning,

experience and knowledge spillovers. As all companies became fmiliar                  with the new

technology,         the oppo~nities   for investment necessarily narrowed be~een         companies.



4. TJte ‘~riend[iness” of different states

            The final interesting feature of the revenue estimates is associated with the political

variables. In our simple model of revenue, the factors associated with political factors measure

the state’s regulatory stringency. This stringency then influences prices and revenue, This line of

causation is distinct from economic and demographic             factors, which influence both the political
~UgUS[   31.1996                     11’ELF.4REBE.VEFITS FRO.L[1.vFR4STRL’CWRE                           Page 16


motivation for setting a level of prices and the aggregate quantity demanded at a certain price

level.

            The theoretical model suggests that we may break out the component of revenue

associated with the political factors in the state. Table 7 shows our implementation           for 1988 and

1992.Using table 2, we compute the sum of the “political” coefficients multiplied times the

variables for each state.~g We then take the difference be~een             this sum and the maximum for

that year, standardizing     the “friendliest” state at zero. We determine the rank of the state in that

year by the average of the estimates from the two columns. We do this for all jurisdictions             except

Nebraska and Washington D.C.’j For comparison, we also show the lMerrill-Lynch rankings for

regulatory friendliness towards electrical utilities, as used by Joskow, Rose and Wolfram [1996].

            These estimates show large differences be~een         states in the degree of friendliness. The

difference between the minimum and the maximum is as much as -.5 in some estimates, which

translates into over a 30% decline in revenues due to political variables. The mean is generally

around -.25, which translates into a 16°/0decline in revenue. These differences will have a large

influence on infiastmcture      investment behavior and the returns to infrastmcture       undei any,

investment model. Under the investment model proposed in (7b), for example, the effects of

regulatory friendliness would be quite pronounced.qb We conclude that this index is indirect

evidence that the regulatory environment has an important quantitative effect on company

investment in infrastmcture.

            The Tables shows stability in the ranking of states over these five years. Most of the

changes reflect changes in the state political actors. The states that stay in the top fifieen in both

samples are Alabama, California, Delaware, Idaho, Illinois, Maine, Mississippi,            Nevada, South

Carolin~ and Utah. The states that stayed in the bottom fifteen in both years are Colorado,

Louisiana, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, and South Dakota. No states

moved from the bottom to the top. The states that move from the top to bottom include North

Carolina and Oklahoma. This relative stability in state rankings, combined with the effect the

regulatory environment       can have on investment -- as shown above -- is intriguing empirical

evidence for the commitment        to regulatory policies by potentially changing political institutions.

As a related aside, we have generally found that in any given year our index does not correlate

with the Merrill-Lynch      index for electrical utilities.~’

           These results, while admittingly a crude measure of regulatory friendliness, do suggest

the importance of political factors in shaping the environment            in which firms invest. We suspect,

however, that we are reaching the natural limits of our reduced form approach to variation

befiveen political institutions. With more time-variation         or perhaps more structure on the model

of regulatory mechanisms,      Ner      research may be able to identi~ the influence of political

actors and institutions with more precision.



5. Cost eq[latio~r estimates

          Several different estimates of the investment equation were estimated. Appendix 2 and 3

contain the revenue and investment equations for the Cobb-Douglas                 specifications   shown

previously. Appendix 2 estimates this only for fiber on the full sample. Appendix 3 shows

estimates for a multi-input specification using only fiber and ISDN, not S S7. SS7 was excluded

based on the results in Tables 3, which indicated that the elasticity on SS7 was rarely positive or
                                                                                         .
non-zero. h       investment equation was also added to the basic specification of the translog

benefit function. These are shown in columns 3 and 4 of Appendix 1 along with the other

translog estimates. Table 8 summarizes the main findings.

          The firm dummies identi~ large differences in the costs of installing fiber. The results

are summarized in Table 8 where the coefficient estimates have been transformed into their

corresponding      cost index values. ~ese    indexes do not represent the full cost of installing

infrastructure,   only the costs that are not otherwise accounted for by other variables, but vary

over time or across firms. We present a range of estimates, reflecting the extreme highs and lows

among the variety of specifications.

          Table 8 does not indicate that the RBOCS (Regional Bell Operating Companies) have

much lower costs than the Contel, GTE or the independents.             The firm dummies differ too much

across specifications    to draw such a conclusion. However, among the RBOCS, Bell Atlantic,

Nynex and Pacific Bell all have lower costs for installing fiber than the remaining firms. The

degree of cost advantage, however, differs widely across specifications and samples. For ISDN,

the RBOCS have much lower costs than either GTE or Contel.
~U~US[31.    1996                       J!-ELF.4M BE,VEF~ FRO.11I,VFMSTRL’CTCRE                                Page 28


            The     time dummies, as expected, indicate a large secular decline in the cost of installing

fiber. Table 8 shows an 80% decline in costs over five years when the full sample is used, while

it shows over a 64°/0 decline over four years from the partial sample. This accords with the

obsemed behavior and publicity about some of the large investment programs recently

undertaken by LECS. It is also consistent with the results in Table 6 showing a decline in

marginal revenue over time. In addition, Table 8 shows a decline in the costs of ISDN of over

85V0 over four years, also consistent with the recent gain in momentum                 to difise    ISDN to

business users.

            Certainly the rapid fall in these estimates partly reflects that the true economic costs of

installing digital technologies,       including the costs of material and construction,           came down

dramatically in the late 80s, However, since the price of materials associated with fiber optic

cable and related technologies         (such as repeaters) was not falling as rapidly over this time

penod,~s material prices alone cannot form the entire explanation. Thus, we conjecture that our

estimates reflect the joint workings of many secular factors that influence the costs of

installation, including, but not restricted to the cost of materials, like declines in the costs of

acquiring knowledge on how to install new technologies              efficiently and quickly; experience in

solving installation problems; costs of training, and other factors that influence the user cost of

installation. Further, we suspect that this reflects a well-known          feature of fiber in the local loop --

the first strands are the most dificult       to lay along any given route, but once these initial costs are

sunk, additional fiber miles me much emier.

            Despite these dramatic changes, secular declines in cost ue not the only factor at work

explaining heterogeneity         on the cost side. Other implications    about costs come directly from

appendix 2 and 3. In virtually every estimation the land and population variables are significant.

In fiber there are increasing costs in larger territories and decreasing costs in larger populations

(over the relevant ranges of the data). However, these scale effects eventually slow at very high

population levels or large terntones         and definitely interact. ISDN shows weak diseconomies in

large population areas, though no sensitivity to geographic size.

            The performance of the remaining cost variables is mixed.             Overall the variables on

construction markets does not predict the costs of laying fiber except in appendix 2’s estimates.
Au~u5t31,   1996                     IVELF.4M BE.YEFITS FRO.L[1.VFRJ5TRUCTURE                         Page 29


There, higher wages raise the cost of installation, as does recent growth in construction markets

(perhaps reflecting capacity constraints).      Construction    market variables also do not predict the

costs of installing ISDN. It is also interesting to note that the inherited experience from a high

stock of fiber in 1986 does seem to provide advantages across all the types of infrastmcture

investment. According to Appendix 2, it seems to lower the costs of installing fiber. According

to appendix 3, it does not seem to influence the costs of installing fiber, but it does lower the

costs of installing ISDN.



VI. Conclltsion

            When economic policy focuses on information        infrastructure, the presumption has been

that more is better. While this may be right to the first order, in this paper we claim that whether

it is right or not will only be known from detailed case studies.

            In this study we examined investment in fiber optic cable, ISDN lines and signal seven

software, infrastmcture which plays an essential role in bringing digital technology to local

telephone networks. We chose to study local telephone service because these are an important set

of users and investors in the burgeoning “information          super highway.” We estimated a model

composed of a regulator and an LEC, that allowed us to estimate the elasticity of final user

demand for infrastmcture       investment by their LEC, controlling for factors such as local

economic activity and the political disposition of state regulators.

            In all our estimates we find that consumer demand is sensitive to investment in modem

infrastmcture      as represented by fiber optic cable. We find that, as of 1992, fiber-optic cable

enhances LEC demand. Sometimes our estimates show that ISDN lines do as well, but SS7

generally does not. The estimated elasticity of consumer surplus to fiber optic deployment is

never less than 6 percent and much higher in some estimates. me elasticity of demand for ISDN

ranges widely between zero and 16 percent. The elmticity for SS7 is rarely robustly estimated. In

all our estimates these magnitudes lead to the conclusion that infrastmcture        investment is

responsible for a substantial fraction of the growth in consumer surplus and business revenue.

            As far as local telephone markets are concerned, we see many research aspects to develop

further. We have subsumed the regulatory behavior into our reduced form estimates and not used
AU:USt31.   1996                   }}’ELF.4ti BE.VEFITS FRO.111.YFR4STRUCTURE                               Page 30


reported information on the diffision of regulatory reforms and their adoption by state agencies.

Nor have we filly modeled the complex dynamic bargaining that goes on between state

regulators and LECS over infrastructure and pricing. Infrastructure             expenses are (literally and

figuratively) sunk, while regulatory agencies might offer only weak commitments                 to LECS to

recover revenue on these investments. Finally, in this paper we have only characterized consumer

heterogeneity      in a reduced form way. Providing more structure could help us identi& the

different effects of infrastmcture deployment on business and residential consumers, urban and

rural customers, etc. Separating these effects should help us identify the magnitude of the welfare

returns to consumers and producers from infrastructure          investment, and sharpen the policy

implications.

            Besides local telephone networks, many related information technology markets are

potential subjects for the study of the benefits associated with new digital technology.             It is well

known that the long distance telephone companies and the competitive access providers have

made extensive investments in fiber optic cable and related digital technologies.             It is also well

known that private fires are also making large investments           in user-owned networks, which

combine computing and communication           technology    in user-customized       arrangements. These

digital networks are both complementary       and substitute to the public infrastmcture         network,

further increasing the complexity of any welfare analysis. Only such careful studies will reveal

whether the results we found for local telephone markets hold for other modem digital

infrastructure in a wide array of markets.

1. There is a relatively developed literature on the influence of telecommunications
infrmtructure investment on developing and rural economies. This literature is usually
concerned, however, with the level of penetration rates and quality of basic service. See, for
example, Hardy [1980] or Saunders et al [1983]. Reviews of earlier work in telecommunication
are usually about modernizing the post-lWI     US telephone system. See Mueller [1993] for a
“skeptical” review. Also see Roller and Waverman [1994] for a cross-country comparison closer
to our focus on modem telecommunications networks.

5. DRI used an input/output approach to measure the contribution of telecommunication to
economic efficiency, in particular, improvements in sectoral total factor productivity. DRI
estimates that there wm a $46.5 billion dollar resource saving (in 1990 dollars) due to increased
efficiency in the supply of telecommunications equipment and semice (see Cronin et al [1993a,
1993b]). They find that about 25V0of productivity growth over the late 1970s to 1990s was
attributable to improvements in telecommunications productivity and consumption efficiencies.
These effects are especially pronounced in finance, transportation, trade, real estate and
petroleum refining. Cronin et al [1993a] perform a similar analysis for a more disaggregate
sample, a cross section of counties in Pennsylvania, and confirm the findings made with more
aggregate data.

6. Dholakia and Harlam [1994] examine variation in telecommunications quality across the 50
states. They find a positive relationship between investment in telecommunications and
economic activity, controlling for other factors such as state education, energy consumption, and
other inputs to the local economy. In a predecessor to this paper’s study, Greenstein and Spiller
[1995], using the same unit of analysis as in this paper, examine the influence of
telecommunications infrastmcture on local economic activity in nvo sectors, finance, insurance

and real-estate (FIRE) and manufacturing. They find that modem infrastructure is associated with
large increases in FIRE, but not manufacturing. Their interpretation is that administrative activity
tends to use the public network intensively while manufacturing does not.

7.The increase in price sensitivity may arise from two complementary effects: Increases in
infrastmcture brings to the network users who are more price sensitive. Second, increases in
infrastmcture brings about higher volume uses of the network, making the demand more elastic
overall. Both occur when the installation of digital infrmtructure enables new services, or when
modem infrastmcture permits the trmsmission of data with greater speed and reliability,
inducing higher volumes of traffic.

8. For reasons explained below, short of directly estimating demand functions, this assumption
is needed to be able to estimate the aggregate effect of infrastructure deployment at the LEC
level.

9. Comparing consumer surplus growth to last period’s levels rather than first period’s levels is a
more consewative measure, particularly when infrastructure is growing rapidly.

10. Notice that this is not a profit calculation, as we have not considered installation costs.

11. As noted below in several footnotes, most of our inferences are robust to the assumption
about the minor effect on operating expenses. Relaxing the assumption, however, unnecessarily
complicates the exposition of the model and adds little additional insight.

12. Note that if operating expenses are reduced in proportion to investment then these additional
savings will be equivalent to a lower per-unit cost of infrastructure, i.e., a lower W.

13. Notice hat ~~p, the negative of the elasticity of demand, must be positive by definition.
Hence, 0 must be greater than 1 in equilibrium.

14. Our estimation strategy for learning the degree of revenue enhancement due to infrastmcture
investment would be unaltered even if infrastructure lowers operating expenses. That is, if
equation (3) were modified to include an additional term related to operating expenses, we would
still end up with a bmic relationship in the form found in (4).

15 ,If P were functions of I, then we would not be able to perform the move from (4a) to (4b), and
hence, y would not be identifiable from (4d).

16.We could only identifi price elmticities from (4) under the strong restriction that XL is not an
underlying determinant of political objectives, 6, which seems implausible.

17.This restriction becomes difficult to satisfy with more complex specifications    of the benefit
function (e.g., such as translog or multiple inputs).

18 .Sorne infrastructure variables in a few LECS violate this msurnption, particularly in the early
years of the data. Thus, we add one unit of fiber to all LECS fiber levels.

19. We assume a firm that ma..imizes the present value of profits, while regulators area

multiperiod firms being regulated by single period regulators, see Lewis andSappington(1991     ).
See also Spiller and Urbiztondo (1994) for analyses of the endogeneity of regulators’ horizons.

20. The complexity of the translog estimation, and the requirement        to impose positive
elasticities, would make such an extension extremely complex. As we found with this study’s
data, the additional complexity of the translog for a single input generated little additional
insight.

23 .Although it is often the case that more than one carrier is operating in a county, over the entire
state these discrepancies tend to average out, thus eliminating any major biases.

24. Though GTE and Contel merge during 1991, we continue to treat them as separate
obsemations every year in our sample.

25. Fiber optic cable enables high volume traffic and is widely considered to be an essential part
of the modem digital telephone system. Fiber optic cable is a high speed, high quality
transmission mechanism that is limited in capacity only by the available terminal and repeater
technology. It is purified silica glass using laser chips. Erbiurn-doped fiber amplifiers enhance
the capacity to tens of thousands of gigabit-kilometers per second. Further digital technologies,
deployed in conjunction with fiber, enable a variety of new services and more reliable as well as
higher quality data senices over phone lines. We measure the deployment fiber in “fiber-miles”,
which is the equivalent of a strand of fiber laid over one mile (For further discussion, see
Kraashaur [1995]). In practice, many strands are laid over the same routes, so one thousand miles
of fiber optic cable does not cover one thousand geographic miles. This should be thought of as a
measure of the carrying capacity along communication lines. The typical patterns of deplo yment
at an LEC occurred first beween “feeder plants”, i.e., between central office and a business or a
remote terminal, where the volume of use is largest. Even as late as 1992, very little had yet been
deployed directly to residences,

26. Integrated Services Digital Nelsvork, ISDN, involves installing lines and switches using a
series of technical specifications designed to eme the movement of data traffic between two
points over telephone lines. At its simple technical level ISDN is an international standard that
allows voice, data, text, and video communications to travel simultaneously down the same
transmission path. More practically, its use will be facilitated by the implementation of other

digital technology and the adoption of SS7. It is an engineering concept that contemplates a
public, end-to-end switched digital network in which time division switches and digital
transmission paths accommodate multiple services originating at subscriber locations. While
ISDN has been proposed for many years, its diffusion within the United States did not accelerate
until the late 1980s and early 1990s. Even then, there were large differences across LECS due to
widely-reported inter-company differences in efficiencies, regulatory-imposed rules on prices for
installation and service, and regional differences in the demographics of local demand.

27. SS7 is a type of software for routing calls and data. It uses the existing backbone and switch
network more efficiently, allowing greater use of the telephone network for data traffic. At a
technical level, Signaling System 7 (SS7) is an CCITT standard for out-of-band signaling that
conforms to ISDN standard specifications. More to the point, it is software that facilitates the
use of ISDN, creating two channels within a single line. This improves the efficiency of a
network because less capacity is tied up in the process of comecting a call.

28. The changes are due primarily to the treatment of revenue from cellular services.

cmot easily construct this variable directly from BEA statistics.

belt communities, which were the fastest growing areas in the 1980s.

political affiliations. These features make their political situation not easily comparable.

33. Due to the presence of independent regulators in a few regulatory agencies in a few years, a
non-majority of democrats does not necessarily imply a majority of republicans. We tried
standardizing on either party and found that it did not influence our inferences.

34. In this data set, this is about the most one can identi~ about political alignment. The
alignment of governor and legislature occurs virtually at the same time as alignment with the
regulatory agency. Similarly, the alignment of the legislature and the regulator occurs virtually
always with aligrunent with the governor. For further discussion of these issues, see Greenstein,
Sosa and Spiller [1996].

35. The range of estimates are computed over all years over the entire sample, including
Washington DC and Nebraska. Since the amount of fiber grows over time, so too does the
elasticity, but not greatly since the coefficient is so small.

36. These are available for the authors on request. In general, only the coefficients on fiber
yielded consistently positive itiastructure  elasticities.

37. The high FIRE states include W, CA, CT, DE, FL, IL, MA, NJ and NY.

38. The sign on democratic governor is always negative and the coefficient on republican
legislature is always lower than the coefficient on democratic legislature (and sometimes
significant). Also, phone companies seem to be worse off when all the legislature and the
governor are aligned instead of split (sometimes this is also significant).

39. In other words, we calculate [f(12) - f(I 1)] / [f(12)], where fo is given to us by our elasticity
estimates and 11 and 12 is given to us by actual investment by LECS at different time periods.
Period one is either 1988 or 1989, depending on the sample, and period two is 1992.

40. This is partly because we can include Nebraska and Washington DC in the welfare
calculations, but also because we do not need to exclude observations due to the absence of
revenue data, as was necessary for the estimation.

41. For the same reasons described in the previous footnote.

42. If the elmticity of demand is constant, then the percentage of consumer surplus attributable to
a recent decrease in price is 1 - (P1/Pz)( 1=), which leads to the fomula stated in the text.

43. Some of the simulations using 1.5 price elasticity stretch the realm of credibility since it is
difficult to imagine that the elasticity of demand will stay constant for very large changes in
prices.

44. This list includes eve@ing   in the category of S. The results were not especially sensitive to
the set of two-stage estimates we used. We did not use the estimates with LEC dummies because
these dummies will also partly reflect political expectations.

45. As noted, both are excluded due to their unusual political institutions. It is interesting to note,
however, that if we treat Nebraska as a “unified Republican legislature and governor” and
compare it with other states, it generally rises to the near the top in our friendliness measure. This
is consistent with perception that the state government goes to g-rest lengths to encourage the
telemarketing industry within the state.

46. Combining the estimates of y from (4d) with (7c) yields an equilibrium sensitivity of
infrastructure to political friendliness (PF) as follows: d(log(I”))/d(PF) = PF/( 1-y), where PF
equals the estimates of&S horn equation (7c). For example, for y = 0.1, d(log(I”))/d(PF) =
1.15;S. For a political friendliness index of -0.25, this derivative is -0.28.

47. Note that in the M-L index, a lower number is friendlier, while in our index a higher number
is fiendlier. Hence, if they were to provide the same measure they \vould be negative correlated.

us and bringing this to our attention.
