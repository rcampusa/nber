                                  ABSTRACT


     The paper makes two points as to how standard international

trade theory is modified when an endogenous degree of capital

utilization is introduced. The first point is that, if capital

utilization during a period is less than full because of an exogenous

time—dependent   variation in productivity within the period, there
is no modification of the standard theory. In particular, there
is no need to adjust capital—intensity estimates according to the
degree of capital utilization. This is in contrast to what has been
argued in the literature. The other point is that, if capital

utilization is less than full because of higher wages during part of
the period, the night of a day and night, say, the required modification

of trade theory is that of introducing several kinds of labor and

endogenous labor supply, or, equivalently, of introducing nontraded

goods.

1. Introduction

     The degree of capital utilization, appearing for instance as the number of shifts

working, varies considerably between sectors and countries.1 Recently, there has been

some work on how different degrees of capital utilization would modify the standard

international trade theory.2 For instance, Winston (1979) argues that the usual way

of measuring factor intensities in Leontief—type tests of the Heckscher—Ohlin theory

is wrong. Instead of just taking capital stock per manyear, or capital stock per

employee, one should adjust the factor intensities for the degree of capital utili-

zation. Then, given the considerable variance in capital utilization between sectors,

the errors in the usual measurements might be large, and Winston argues that they may

indeed explain the Leontief Paradox.

     In this paper, I wish to make two points as to how standard international trade

theory is modified when an endogenous degree of capital utilization is introduced.

The two points refer to two polar extreme assumptions concerning the source of the

endogenous degree of capital utilization. The first point refers to the extreme situ-

ation when the degree of capital utilization during a period may be less than full, not

because wages or other factor prices are higher during part of the period, but because

there is, for some reason, a time—dependent variation in a firm's (or an Industry's)

technical productivity during the period. As an example, we can think of a fishing

industry where the productivity of a given number of fishermen and boats are subject

to seasonal fluctuations during the period, a year say, because the availability of

fish varies exogenously during the period.

     Under these circumstances we show that the firm's production per period can be

considered to be a function f(K, L, u), of its capital stock, K, labor input during

the period, L, and the degree of capital utilization, u. It follows that the behavior
                                             —2--




of a profit maximizing firm can then be described as a two—stage procedure.        In

the first stage, the firm, for each capital stock and labor input, simply chooses the

output—per-period maximizing degree of capital utilization, u*(K, L).        This results

in an "indirect" production function F(K, L) =      f(K,   L, u*(K, L)). In the second stage,

for given factor prices, i.e., capital rental and wage rate, the firm chooses the

optimal level of capital stock K and labor input L so as to maximize profits, subject

to the indirect production function. To the extent the indirect production function

is a well—behaved neoclassical production function, it is clear that the whole stan-

dard Heckscher—Ohlin trade theory applies. In particular, it is clear that the

relevant factor intensity is K/L, capital stock over labor input, and not u*K/L,

Winston's adjusted capital intensity.

     The second point refers to the other extreme situation, when different

capital utilization is due, not to any time—dependent variation in productivity during

the period, but to a variation in wages within the period. For concreteness, let the

period be a day and night, i.e., 24 hours, and let the night wage be higher than the

day wage. The wage differential between day and night time labor then reflects

workers' relative preferences between working day and working night. Many examples

of ordinary manufacturing industries would seem to correspond to this case.

     It is argued below that day and night labor should then be regarded as different

factors. Hence, this situation differs from the standard 2 x 2 Heckscher—Ohlin case

in that   there   are three factors rather than two, namely capital, day labor, and night

labor. Furthermore, to make endogenous the total capital utilization in an economy,

night labor (or both kinds of labor) should be in variable supply, which is formally

equivalent to introducing production and consumption of non—traded goods.

     Thus, the modifications of the trade theory which follow from introducing variable

capital utilization with a wage premium on overtime are thus exactly those that follow

from the introduction of more than two factors of production and of non—traded goods.

Once this is realized, the existing results on these modifications in the trade litera—
                                             —3--




 ture can hence, suitably interpreted, be directly applied to the variable capital

 utilization case.

       The first point is developed in Section 2, and the second in Section 3.

 Section 4 presents some conclusions.


 2.   Constant wages through period

      Let the period be denoted by the unit interval, 0             t    1. Consider a firm,

whose technology is described by the instantaneous production function g(k(t), Z(t), t),

which gives the instantaneous flow of output at time t as a function of the instanta—

neous flow of capital services, k(t), and labor services, £(t), at time t. Let the

instantaneous production function be a well—behaved neoclassical production function of

k(t) and R(t),3 and assume that the productivity of capital and labor services is de-

creasing over time within the period, i.e., gt          0.

      Let the firm own the capital stock K, and let one unit of capital stock, when

used, give rise to one unit of instantaneous capital services. Assume that for

technological reasons the flow of labor services is constant when the firm produces.4

The firm will produce only during the subperiod 0            t    u, where u, 0   u   1, denotes

the degree of capital utilization. Let L =          2.(t)dt      denote labor (services) input

per period. It follows that the instantaneous flows of capital and labor services

fulfill

      k(t) =
                K for 0<t<u,                 and         (t) =          L/u for O<t<u,
                                                                                               (1)
                0 for u<tl,                                             0 for

Production per period will be a function, f(K, L, u), of the capital stock, the labor

input per period, and the degree of capital utilization, defined by
                   U
     f(K, L, u) = I g(K, L/u, t)dt.                                                            (2)
                   0
The indirect production function, F(K, L), will be given by

      F(K, L) = max {f(K, L, u): 0    u   1] =   f(K,   L, u*(K, L)),                          (3)

where u*(K, L) denotes the optimal degree of capital utilization.

      If the instantaneous production function is a well—behaved neoclassical product:. i

function,   so is the production—per—period function f(K, L, u) for given u. Then it
                                                       —4—




can be shown that         the   indirect production function F(K, L) also is a well—behaved

neoclassical production function.

       Let us consider a special case: Let the instantaneous production function be

g(k(t), £(t),    t) =      (l—t)(k(t))((t)),          O<c<1. That is, it is a Cobb—Douglas

function in k(t) and 9.(t), and productivity decreases linearily.              It follows from (2)

that

       f(K, L, u) =       /(1   —   t)dt K(L/u)3 =    A(u)   K L1,                                (4)


where A(u) =     (u   —   u/2).         The optimal degree of capital utilization, u, maximizes

A(u) and hence fulfills the first order condition                u*)" — (a+l)(u*)I2    =   (u*)(cz_
(ct+1)u*12)   = 0, which        implies5 u = 2cL/(l+c).      In this case the optimal degree of


capital   utilization is independent of the capital stock and labor input. The indirect
production function is
                                                                                                  (5)
       F(K,   L) = A(U*)Ka       L1,
which   is Cobb—Douglas in capital stock and labor input.
       Assume that the wage, w, is the same            during the period. For a given rental per

capital good per period, r, and a given price of output, p, we clearly get the stan-
                                                               — wL, where output is
dard neoclassical profit maximizing problem, max pF(K, L) — rK

given by the indirect production function. In particular, the relevant factor inten-

sity is K/L, the unadjusted capital stock over labor services per period. It is not

Winston's adjusted u*K/L, accumulated capital services per period over labor input

per period, which equals instantaneous capital intensityk(t)/9(t) during production.


3. Higher wages during the night

        For concreteness, let the period be a day and night, i.e., 24 hours. Consider

a firm    that can    operate with the same technology during the day as during the night.

This is, the firm         is    not subject to any   variation in technical productivity during the
day and night. It however faces one wage rate during the day, and another (higher)
                                   own a capital stock K, and let L and N denote
wage rate during the night. Let it

labor input during the day and the night, respectively.                Production per day will be
                                                      —5—


given by f(K, L), a well—behaved neoclassical production function. Production per

night is f(K, N). Hence, production per day and night is given by

     F(K, L, N) =   f(K,   L) + f(K, N).                                                               (6)

     Let w denote the day wage per day, and let s denote the night wage per night.

Profits per day and night will be given by ir =             pF(K, L, N) — rK   — wL —   sN.   Assume

that the firm can choose one factor intensity during the day and another during the

night. Then, for a given capital stock, the profit maximizing day labor input and

night labor input, L(w/p, K) and N(s/p, K), are given by the equality of marginal

product and the product wage,

     L (K, L) = w/p and fN(K, N) =         s/p.                                                        (7)

The two labor input levels can be illustrated in a familiar way in Fig. 1:

                                                                          ___.      L, N
              N(s/p, K)                    L(w/p, K)


    It is obvious, that from the point of view of the firm, as long as day and night

wages differ, day and night labor are different factors. It is also clear that, if a

higher night wage reflects workers' relative preference against working nights, day and
                                            —6—


night labor cannot be perfect substitutes from the point of view of workers, and are

hence different factors also from the supply side. Furthermore, to make endogenous

the total capital utilization in an economy, day and night labor cannot both be

fixed in supply. We conclude that a proper treatment of these issues requires the

introduction of variable supply of labor.

     It is clear that a model of an open economy incorporating these aspects would

differ from the standard 2 x 2 Heckscher—Ohlin model of a small country in two

respects. First, it has two different kinds of labor, in addition to capital. Hence,

there are three primary factors instead of the standard two. Second, the supply of

one of the labors is variable rather than fixed. Formally, introducing variable

supply of labor in a Heckscher—Ohlin model is identical to introducing non—traded

goods. This is so, since leisure can be interpreted as a non—traded good.


4. Conclusions

     First we have looked at the extreme situation when a variable degree of capital

utilization results solely from a technical variation of productivity within the

period and not from variations in wages. We have found that the behavior of the firm

can then be represented by an indirect production function of capital stock and labor

input per period, where the degree of capital utilization is chosen optimally and

hence does not appear in the indirect production function. For given factor prices

the firm then chooses capital stock and labor input per period so as to maximize

profit per period.

    The conclusions are straightforward: If the indirect production function is well-

behaved, the standard Heckscher-Ohlin theory applies directly. If it is not, the

standard theory does not apply. With regard to empirical work, in the former case the

relevant factor intensity is capital stock over labor input per period, without any

adjustment according to the degree of capital utilization. In the latter case, the

question of which factor intensity is relevant may not be meaningful.

     In the other extreme situation, the variable capital utilization is the result

of different day and night wages, and not of any technical variation of productivity
                                             —J —




between day and night. The difference in day and night wages is due to workers'

relative preference for working day rather than night. Both for firms and workers,

day and night labor are not perfect substitutes but different factors. The required

modification of the standard trade theory is that of introducing more than one kind

of labor, at least one of which is in variable supply and hence enters workers'

utility functions. As is well known, this is exactly analogous to introducing produc—

tion of non-traded goods in trade models. The results in the existing literature on

problems with non—traded goods can then, suitably interpreted, be applied to the case

of variable capital utilization.

       In this other extreme situation, what are the conclusions relevant to empirical

work? Rigorously, day and night labor should be regarded as different factors. In

most   empirical work in the trade literature there is aggregation of heterogenous
kinds of labor into one labor input (or a few labor inputs). In that context, the
error    in aggregating day and night labor may be relatively small. Hence, in less

rigorous empirical work, the relevant factor intensity may again be capital stock over

total labor input per period, the latter aggregate including both day and night labor.

Again, there is no adjustment of the capital stock according to its degree of utiliza—

tion.6    The other alternative is to explicitly disaggregate labor into day and night
labor.

       services ratio, k(t)/Z(t), subject to the technological constraint that the rat
       must remain the same during the period of production.

5. We note that we have an inner solution, 0 <     u    <   1.
6. Suppose that workers' marginal rate of substitution of day labor for night labor
    is constant and equal to 1 + , where       is a positive constant. In an equilibrium
    the day and night wages would fulfill $    = (1 ÷   )w,      that is, there is a constant

    (proportional) premium      on night labor. From the point of view of firms, the
    relative price between day and night labor is constant. Hence, a composite
    Hicks aggregate labor N = L + (1 + 8)N can be constructed with the indirect pro-
    duction function G(K, N) = max F(K, L, N): M = L + (1+ )N}. The wage rate
    corresponding to the labor composite is w, and the firm will maximize pG(K, H) —
    rK —   wM.   It is clear that the relevant factor intensity is K/M, capital stock over
    the labor composite.
           We note that from the point of view of workers, we can also aggregate labor
    into a labor composite, with the same weights. The model essentially collapses
    into a one—labor model.
