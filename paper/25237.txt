We study the importance of discretion in antitrust enforcement by analyzing the response of asset
prices to the sudden accession of Theodore Roosevelt to the presidency. During McKinley’s term
in office the largest wave of merger activity in American history occurred, and his administration
did not attempt to use antitrust laws to restrain any of those mergers. His vice president, Theodore
Roosevelt, was known to be a Progressive reformer and much more interested in controlling
anticompetitive behavior. We find that firms with greater vulnerability to antitrust enforcement
saw greater declines in their abnormal returns following McKinley’s assassination. The transition
from McKinley to Roosevelt caused one of the most significant changes in antitrust enforcement
of the Gilded Age—not from new legislation, but from a change in the approach taken to the
enforcement of existing law. Our results highlight the importance of enforcement efforts in
antitrust.

1 Introduction

Over the past 40 years, the level of concentration within many sectors of the American economy has increased

substantially. This rise in concentration has been associated with a decline in competition and labor’s share

of income, and a slowdown in aggregate output (Barkai, 2016; Autor et al., 2017; De Loecker and Eeckhout,

2017; Grullon et al., 2017).1 The failure of antitrust authorities to restrain these developments has provoked

concerns that existing antitrust statutes may no longer offer regulators adequate tools for policing anticom-

petitive behavior.2 Yet government agencies often hold significant discretion over regulatory enforcement,

and some have argued that stronger enforcement of existing statues could have gone a long way towards

reigning in anticompetitive forces (Baker et al., 2018). Disentangling the effects of the substance of exist-

ing statutes from the efforts exerted to enforce them is quite difficult, in no small part because enforcement

efforts are typically not easy to measure or even observe.

    We study an extraordinary episode from the Gilded Age in which the enforcement of antitrust statutes

was suddenly strengthened, and show that political discretion over antitrust enforcement can have meaningful

consequences for the economy. No period in American history witnessed a more significant consolidation

of economic activity into large firms than the Great Merger wave of 1895–1904 (Nelson, 1959; Lamoreaux,

1985). William McKinley, who was elected president in 1896, was generally friendly towards business

interests, and did not attempt to use the Sherman Act to challenge these mergers. His assassination by an

anarchist in September 1901 presents a unique opportunity to study the effects of a change in the president’s

attitude towards enforcement of antitrust laws at a time when all other institutions remained unchanged. In

contrast to McKinley, Theodore Roosevelt, who succeeded him as president, had been openly critical of

big business. The sudden accession of a well-known Progressive reformer to the presidency likely shifted

expectations regarding the aggressiveness with which antitrust laws would be enforced.

    We use the stock market’s reaction to the McKinley assassination to measure the expected impact of this

change in preferences over antitrust enforcement. The quasi-random nature of the assassination enables us

to estimate the market’s reaction in a way that election outcomes, which were generally well anticipated, do
   1
      Though the recent rise in concentration is well documented, there is an active ongoing debate on the degree to
which market power has changed in recent decades. See, among others, De Loecker and Eeckhout (2017), Gutierrez
and Philippon (2017), Traina (2018), and Hall (2018).
    2
      For example, an influential piece in the New York Times argued that “The century-old antitrust laws do not seem
up to the task. Perhaps it is time to create laws for a new Gilded Age and provide regulators the power to determine if
megadeals are truly good for America” (“Changing Old Antitrust Thinking for a New Gilded Age,” 22 July 2014.) A
2016 report by The Roosevelt Institute, a think tank, also called for new antitrust laws (Abernathy et al., 2016).


                                                          1
not (see Rhode and Strumpf, 2004). The assassination did not coincide with any other major changes; the

composition of Congress, the courts, and even the attorney general remained unchanged. But a president who

wanted vigorous antitrust enforcement unexpectedly replaced one who had not. In response to the shooting

of McKinley, the value of NYSE-traded firms fell by an average of 6.2 percent. To put this magnitude

in perspective, the stock market declined by only 1.6 percent on average over the six other presidential

assassinations and nearly successful assassination attempts we have identified. Importantly, the change in

aggressiveness with which antitrust laws were expected to be enforced meant that firms that had engaged

in mergers prior to the assassination were more likely to be vulnerable. We find that following McKinley’s

shooting, firms involved in recent mergers saw declines in their abnormal returns that were 1.5 to 2 percentage

points greater than those of other firms. We also identify a group of firms that were likely to have been

expected to benefit from stronger antitrust enforcement and show that the decline in their abnormal returns

was about 2 to 3 percentage points smaller than that of other firms. These results suggest that investors

expected a change in antitrust enforcement, and that they anticipated that these new policies would have

meaningful impacts.

    A possible source of concern regarding these estimates is that the effects of the change from McKinley

to Roosevelt may have been confounded with the effects of a presidential assassination. The fact that an

anarchist shot the president, for example, may have been perceived as a sign of rising political instability.

Yet the experience with McKinley offers a unique opportunity to address this concern. President McKinley

initially survived the shooting, and three days later his doctors announced that they expected him to make

a “full recovery.” When that prognosis was announced, the losses experienced following his shooting were

largely reversed, and firms particularly vulnerable to antitrust enforcement saw differentially large gains.

Then, seven days following the shooting, it was suddenly announced that McKinley was in fact near death.

Upon receiving this news, the market reversed again, with an overall fall in share prices of similar magnitude.

Since the effects from political unrest should have been reflected in prices on the day of the shooting, this

latter decline in stock prices suggests that investors instead reacted to expected policy changes that would

result from Roosevelt becoming president. Finally, Roosevelt’s statements when he ultimately took the oath

of office defied expectations and signalled that he would follow McKinley’s policy agenda; these resulted in

differential gains for firms that would have been more likely targets of renewed efforts to enforce antitrust

statues.

    An additional source of concern is that the transition from McKinley to Roosevelt may have been re-

                                                      2
garded as harmful to particular firms for reasons unrelated to antitrust enforcement. For example, Roosevelt

may have been perceived as less friendly to corporations affiliated with major donors to McKinley’s cam-

paign, such as those connected to J.P. Morgan & Company, or the founders of Standard Oil, and to be more

friendly towards firms whose executives or directors were personally connected to him. If those firms were

also more likely to be part of mergers or cartels, this could explain the effects we observe on firms that had

engaged in recent mergers. Yet our results are robust to controlling for affiliations with those donors, or to

ties to Roosevelt. It is also possible that Roosevelt’s policy agenda may have differed from McKinley’s on

issues beyond antitrust enforcement. We show that the two most plausible policy differences—on tariffs and

labor relations—are unlikely to be the main drivers of our results.

    Once in office, Roosevelt violated his pledge to follow McKinley’s agenda and began to enforce the

Sherman Act more aggressively. To validate our approach to estimating the role of antitrust issues in the

market’s reaction to the assassination, we use an event study methodology to analyze the stock market’s

response to the announcement of his first antitrust suit. On February 19, 1902, Roosevelt’s attorney general

announced that he was going to file suit against the Northern Securities Company, an enormous holding

company formed by J.P. Morgan in 1901 that controlled several major competing railroads. Plans for this

suit were kept secret, which enables us to observe the market’s assessment of the expected change in antitrust

doctrine that would result from the suit. Our analysis indicates that many of the firms whose shares performed

worse in response to bad news regarding McKinley’s health also suffered differentially low abnormal returns

following the announcement of the suit.

    The analysis of stock market returns only allows us to study the effects expected by investors over a very

short horizon. To provide insights into the longer-run effects of stricter enforcement of antitrust statutes, we

construct a panel of accounting data for NYSE-listed railroads, and investigate whether the profitability of

those most likely to have been affected by Roosevelt’s policy changes declined differentially.3 The results

suggest that the railroads that were differentially vulnerable to stricter antitrust enforcement did indeed see

their profitability fall, by about 10 percent more than that of other firms. Although we cannot use this

difference-in-difference approach to assess the welfare impact of the change in policies, our findings at

least suggest that stronger enforcement of antitrust laws may have had strong and persistent redistributive
   3
    We restrict this analysis to railroads for two reasons. First, many of the industrial companies in our sample were
formed in the years immediately prior to 1901, meaning that there would be little or no “pre-period” for the analysis.
But more importantly, as we will see below, many industrial firms disclosed very little accounting data regarding their
operations, whereas railroads were required to do so by the Interstate Commerce Commission.

consequences.

    Our results highlight the importance of enforcement efforts in antitrust. Recent years have witnessed

growing interest in reforms intended to reinvigorate antitrust (see Shapiro, 2018, and the references cited

therein). The transition from McKinley to Roosevelt had a significant impact on firm valuations, and resulted

in a large number of antitrust suits by the federal government that almost certainly would not have been

initiated under McKinley. The structure of antitrust enforcement is much more institutionalized today than it

was in 1901 (Crane, 2011), and recent presidential administrations have exhibited a high degree of continuity

in their approaches to the issue (Crane, 2012). Nonetheless, scholars interested in designing strategies to

address the growth of economic concentration should not neglect the role of enforcement efforts. One of the

most significant changes in antitrust enforcement of the Gilded Age resulted not from new legislation, but

from a change in the approach taken to the enforcement of existing law when Roosevelt became president.

    More generally, our findings imply that, in at least some circumstances, discretion over the enforcement

of the law may be just as important as the substance of the law itself. A substantial literature has analyzed

the choice between rules and discretion in a variety of policy contexts.4 The results of this paper suggest

that the adoption of rules may not eliminate or even significantly constrain discretion. Our paper also relates

to the literature on the effects of policy uncertainty or political risk on economic activity and equity markets

(Baker et al., 2016; Pástor and Veronesi, 2012). Although that work has primarily focused on aggregate

sources of risk, Hassan et al. (2017) have shown that exposure to political risk varies considerably across

firms, depending on how likely they are to be the target of regulatory efforts. We advance this literature

with our analysis of a historical episode that demonstrates that discretion over the enforcement of existing

regulations may be an important source of political risk for firms.

    This paper also contributes to an older literature that has utilized stock prices to evaluate the effects

of antitrust regulation on American companies. These studies often find modest to negligible effects of

antitrust enforcement (Binder, 1988; Bittlingmayer, 1993), merger activity (Eckbo and Wier, 1985), and

forced dissolution of trusts (Burns, 1977).5 One potential limitation of these studies, however, is that they
   4
      The classic example is monetary policy (Friedman, 1948 is an early contribution), but some of the other contexts
in which the choice has been studied include financial regulation (Tarullo, 2001; Brunnermeier et al., 2009), loan
rate setting (Cerqueiro et al., 2011), emergency liquidity provision (Hauck and Vollmer, 2013), and bank supervision
(Lastra, 2013).
    5
      In contrast, Prager (1992) finds that various decisions related to the Northern Securities case had a significant legal
precedent effect on the value of other railroads from 1901 to 1905. Mullin et al. (1995) find large positive effects on
the value of downstream customers of US Steel following the initiation of the (unsuccessful) suit for its dissolution in
1911.


                                                             4
focus mostly on events that were likely to have been anticipated by the market, and were therefore largely

priced in during the period under analysis. In contrast, we study unanticipated events and find larger negative

effects of antitrust enforcement on potential targets.

    We also add to a literature that uses the deaths of national leaders to study their effects on institutional

development (for example, Jones and Olken, 2005; 2009). In contrast to theories that hold that social and

economic forces, rather than particular individuals, determine the course of history, this literature finds that

individual leaders do matter and emphasizes the role of historical contingency in economic development.

The results of this paper are consistent with that literature in that they imply that the accession of Roosevelt

to the presidency resulted in significant changes in economic policy. The accession of Roosevelt may in

fact have marked a significant turning point in American history, making a total consolidation of power by

plutocratic interests, or a rise to the presidency of a radical populist, less likely.

    Finally, our results also shed some light on the longstanding debate among historians regarding the

McKinley and Roosevelt presidencies. Whereas McKinley is traditionally viewed as a puppet of plutocrats

(Josephson, 1934), a revisionist view has argued that he had shifted toward a more reformist orientation

by the time of his assassination and would have acted against the trusts had he served out his second term

(Phillips, 2003; Morgan, 2003). Likewise Roosevelt is often portrayed as a bold reformer (Morris, 2001;

2002), whereas others have argued that he was in fact quite conservative (Kolko, 1967), and that he “might

not perhaps have been a progressive at all if it were not for the necessity of fending off more radical threats”

(Hofstadter, 1955). The large stock price movements documented in this paper around McKinley’s assassi-

nation imply that the market perceived Roosevelt to be quite different from McKinley in his stance toward

business.



2 Historical Background: McKinley, Roosevelt, and the Assassination

2.1 McKinley and Antitrust

William McKinley’s rise to the presidency in 1896 was largely due to the efforts of political entrepreneur

Mark Hanna, who engineered McKinley’s campaigns for Governor of Ohio, Congress, and President of

the United States. A businessman with interests in banking, newspapers, and several other sectors, Hanna

became active in politics as a representative of “the business interest” in the Republican Party (Croly, 1912:

145).

                                                         5
    Hanna’s success as the chair of the Republican National Committee was due in part to his abilities as a

fundraiser. He appealed directly to the wealthiest industrialists and financiers for contributions, and quickly

amassed unprecedented sums to finance the 1896 presidential campaign (Pollock, 1926). The political plat-

form of the Democratic Party also aided Hanna’s fundraising efforts. Whereas the Republicans endorsed the

gold standard, the Democrats nominated William Jennings Bryan, a populist who advocated for free coinage

of silver at an overvalued rate and for the regulation of trusts. Hanna obtained significant contributions from

the financial and industrial interests that were most threatened by the prospect of a Bryan presidency, such

as Standard Oil and J.P. Morgan, and raised at least $3.5 million (Eichengreen et al., 2017), whereas the

Democrats’ campaign budget was just over $400,000 (Croly, 1912: 220).6

    During McKinley’s presidency, the greatest wave of industrial mergers in American history took place.

Its onset was triggered by a variety of forces (Lamoreaux, 1985), including an unintended consequence

of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, the first federal antitrust statute. As interpreted by the courts, the

Sherman Act prohibited anticompetitive practices such as price fixing and pooling arrangements. Yet in its

E. C. Knight decision of 1895, the Supreme Court held that since manufacturing itself was not commerce,

the monopolization of manufacturing capacity through horizontal mergers was not subject to the federal

government’s constitutional power to regulate interstate commerce.7 This decision was widely interpreted

as holding that mergers among competitors did not violate the Sherman Act (Bittlingmayer, 1985). Thus

competing firms would run afoul of the law if they formed a cartel, but apparently would not if they simply

merged. A massive wave of industrial mergers followed during the years 1895–1904; these were largely

horizontal mergers, and many of the new combinations individually controlled more than 70% of the national

market for their goods (Moody, 1904; Nutter, 1951). Appendix Section A.3.3 presents a detailed description

of the history of antitrust legislation during that time.

    Although not as large, a significant wave of railroad mergers also occurred during McKinley’s presidency,

particularly in 1900 and 1901. The Supreme Court’s Trans-Missouri and Joint Traffic Association decisions

held that the Sherman Act applied to railroads and that price-fixing arrangements among railroads were

      As a constant share of GDP, the Republican budget in the 1896 campaign is equivalent to $4.2 billion in 2016, much
more than the estimated $2.65 billion spent in total on the 2016 presidential campaign. In contrast, the Republicans had
raised only $1.6 million for the presidential campaign of 1892 (C. N. Bliss, Jr., in Senate Subcommittee on Campaign
Finance (1913: vol 1, p. 204); data for the 2016 campaign reported in www.cbsnews.com/news/election-2016s-price-

illegal.8 Although a number of different factors contributed to the subsequent mergers, and although the

E.C. Knight decision did not directly address the issue of whether the merger of competing railroads would

violate the Sherman Act, these decisions likely contributed to subsequent railroad merger activity.

    The McKinley administration made no attempt to enforce the Sherman Act against any of these firms;

during his presidency, “antitrust enforcement reached a low-water mark equaled during no other period”

(Thorelli, 1955: 405). McKinley’s attorneys general explained this inaction by stating that the E. C. Knight

decision tied their hands, as it held that mergers were not reached by the Sherman Act (Letwin, 1965: 137-

42). Yet this ignored the possibilities presented in the subsequent Trans-Missouri, Joint Traffic and Addyston

Pipe decisions, and the fact that the government’s strategy in the E. C. Knight case was poorly conceived.9

A presidential administration hoping to restrain anticompetitive mergers could have at least tested these

possibilities; that McKinley’s attorneys general never did reflects a policy preference.


2.2 Vice President Roosevelt

McKinley’s Vice President, Theodore Roosevelt, was quite different. As Governor of New York, he enacted

important Progressive reforms, including a corporate franchise tax, and successfully opposed the reappoint-

ment of a corrupt “machine politician” as the state’s regulator of insurance companies (Roosevelt, 1920:

285-304). His annual message as governor in 1900 focused on the trust problem, and detailed many abuses

perpetrated by large corporations, including “unfair competition,” “raising of prices,” and the “crushing out

of competitors who do no act improperly.” As a state governor, he did not specifically comment on federal

antitrust enforcement, but he did call for corporation laws to include stricter disclosure requirements, to help

with the design and enforcement of business regulations (Roosevelt, 1926).

    Following the battle over the choice of insurance commissioner, representatives of New York’s insurance

companies urged Senator Thomas C. Platt, boss of New York’s Republican machine, to find a way to remove

him from office. Since Roosevelt was an extremely popular politician, challenging his renomination for

governor would have been folly. Instead, a plan was devised to add him to the national ticket, to replace

ation, 171 U.S. 505 (1898).
    9
      As Letwin (1965: 161-67) notes, if the government had focused on the commercial activities of the firm, it would
likely have been decided differently. One of the authors of the Sherman Act, Senator George Edmunds, was more
forceful: “if the famous Knight case had been instituted and carried forward with suitable allegations of the precise
nature and history of the Knight affair, and had been supported, as it could have been, by adequate proof of the facts
it set forth, I believe the Supreme Court of the United States would not have had the least difficulty in preventing the
carrying on of the combination under consideration, and putting an end to it ...” (Martin, 1908: 156).

the recently deceased Vice President Hobart. Although neither Hanna nor McKinley publicly opposed the

nomination, behind the scenes Hanna tried to build support for other candidates. In one heated outburst,

Hanna presciently exclaimed: “Don’t any of you realize that there’s only one life between that madman and

the Presidency?”10 But the support Roosevelt received at the Republican convention proved impossible to

resist; Hanna quietly withdrew his objections, and Roosevelt himself accepted.

    Privately, Roosevelt had expressed concerns regarding the McKinley Administration’s extreme forbear-

ance with respect to antitrust enforcement, and its electoral consequences for the Republican Party.11 In

public, however, he aggressively defended the McKinley Administration’s achievements.


2.3 The Assassination and Roosevelt’s Accession to the Presidency

On Friday September 6, 1901, President McKinley was shot twice by an anarchist while attending the Pan-

American Exhibition in Buffalo, New York. The best qualified surgeon available to treat him was a gyne-

cologist with no experience with bullet wounds. The surgery was only partially successful, and one of the

bullets was not found (Rauchway, 2003).

    The shooting occurred at around 4 PM, just as the stock market closed. That evening, in the hotels

where traders gathered after hours, “the air was filled with rumor and speculation” regarding the shooting

and its consequences for financial markets.12 Journalists asked prominent figures for comments regarding

the possible consequences of Roosevelt becoming president. Many praised Roosevelt’s essential “ability and

integrity” and predicted that becoming president would make him “conservative and cautious,” perhaps in

an attempt to calm investors.13 Yet some commentators were openly (if tactfully) pessimistic, and reported

a “belief that Roosevelt is somewhat adversely inclined towards corporations,” and that under a Roosevelt

presidency, “all manufacturing and financial interests will suffer, and, of course, railroads will be seriously

affected.”14 One prominent commentator argued that a Roosevelt presidency would be bad for merger ac-

tivity, stating that “plans for combinations in the railroad world will, however, have to wait until the news
  10
      Quoted in Leech (1959: 537). Morgan (2003: 376) presents a slightly different version of this quotation.
  11
      For example, Roosevelt wrote to Henry Cabot Lodge: “Around the State of New York I am surprised to find
how many of the workingmen who were with us three years ago, are now sullenly grumbling that McKinley is under
Hanna’s dictation; that Bryan is the only man who can control the trusts; and that the trusts are crushing the life out of
the small men, etc., etc.” (10 August 1899, in Roosevelt, 1951a).

from Buffalo is definitely more reassuring.”15

    On Saturday September 7, the market declined sharply, with stocks falling 6.2 percent on average. Fear-

ing runs by depositors, the New York Clearinghouse Committee authorized a series of emergency measures

to support the commercial banking system, and prominent financiers resolved to support prices on the stock

market. Over the following days, the treasury also supported market liquidity through open-market purchases

of federal debt securities.16

    Following his surgery, McKinley’s condition improved, and his physicians offered optimistic assess-

ments of his chances.17 When the markets reopened on Monday, September 9, firms’ valuations largely

recovered, with an average increase of 3.3 percent. Still, financial markets continued to follow the daily re-

ports of McKinley’s condition very closely. “The prevailing opinion,” according to the Chicago Tribune, was

that “the stock market will be controlled largely during the coming week by the nature of the bulletins sent

from the President’s bedside.”18 These remained consistently favorable, and by September 10 physicians

declared that McKinley was “practically out of danger.”19

    In the early morning hours of Friday September 13, however, McKinley’s condition suddenly became

grave.20 The market opened on the 13th with heavy declines, and by the time it closed, prices had fallen by

an average of 5.1 percent. This magnitude is similar to the decline experienced on September 7 in response

to the shooting. But the decline on the 13th was purely a response to the expected transition from McKinley

to Roosevelt; any adverse consequence of the shooting itself, such as expectations of greater social conflict

due to the rise of anarchism, should have already been reflected in asset prices following the 7th.

    President McKinley died at 2:15 AM on Saturday the 14th, and the NYSE was closed in mourning on

that day. After taking the oath of office, Roosevelt announced: “In this hour of deep and terrible national

would retain McKinley’s entire cabinet. This dispelled fears that he would break with McKinley on key

policy issues and was interpreted as a sign that “the president’s death would not be disturbing” to financial

markets.21 When the market reopened on Monday the 16th, prices increased 4.9 percent on average.

    Our empirical analysis, therefore, utilizes the four most relevant dates described above to discern the

effects of a change in policy between McKinley and Roosevelt: September 7 and 13, dates when the market

received negative news about McKinley’s health, and September 9 and 16, when the market was told that

McKinley would survive and that Roosevelt would continue with McKinley’s agenda, respectively.22


2.4 Impact of the Assassination in Historical Perspective

One way to gauge the magnitude of the expected change in policy resulting from the sudden transition from

McKinley to Roosevelt is to compare its effect on stock prices to those associated with other assassinations

and assassination attempts made on U.S. presidents. Table 1 presents the stock market’s one-day reaction to

assassination attempts in which someone actually fired a gun at the president.23

    It should be noted that the variation of the timing of the different shootings relative to the opening hours

of the NYSE, and the variation in the institutional response of the NYSE to the news of the shooting, limits

comparability across events. For example, trading on the NYSE was halted shortly after President Kennedy

was assassinated, which may have curtailed the decline in prices on that day. Nonetheless, some sugges-

tive evidence on the perceived significance of the transition from McKinley to Roosevelt relative to other

assassinations can be found in the table.

    Excluding McKinley’s, the shootings resulted in an average decline in share prices of 1.6 percent, sug-

gesting that the transition from the president to the vice president typically does not signify a dramatic change

in policy. Yet the stock market’s decline in reaction to the shooting of McKinley was nearly four times as

large as the average for the other events, and about twice as large as the decline in prices when President

Garfield was shot, the second-largest stock market reaction of record. McKinley’s was also the only pres-

idential assassination that produced elevated economic policy uncertainty in Baker et al.’s (2016) study of

twentieth century data.

  22
      One concern regarding stock market data is that they could reflect other sources of volatility, for example related
to seasonal effects. Yet the standard deviation of daily returns of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and Dow
Jones Transportation Average (DJTA) over September 6–16, 1901, was 0.030 and 0.025, respectively, nearly four times
larger than it was on average over those same days in the years 1898–1904 excluding 1901 (0.009 for the DJIA and
0.007 for the DJTA); the p-value of the difference is less than 0.0000001 in both cases.
   23
      Table 1 excludes an attempt made on the life of President Andrew Jackson on January 30, 1835, as it occurred
prior to the invention of the telegraph, making the arrival of news in New York difficult to time.

was the heart attack suffered by President Eisenhower on the evening of Saturday, September 24, 1955. On

the following Monday, shares on the NYSE fell by an average of 6.6 percent.24 The market reacted strongly

to Eisenhower’s heart attack because it came so late in his first term that it was believed he would not be able

to run for reelection and a Democrat would likely win the presidency in 1956.25 Thus, the stock market’s

response to the accession of Roosevelt to the presidency was roughly comparable in magnitude to the effect

of a transition from a Republican to a Democrat at the height of the Cold War.

    The strong stock market reaction to McKinley’s assassination suggests that Roosevelt was perceived to

be quite different from McKinley, and less friendly toward business interests. It contradicts the arguments

of some revisionist historians that Roosevelt’s administration is best understood as a continuation of trends

that developed under McKinley (for example, Phillips, 2003). In particular, Roosevelt’s antitrust agenda was

expected to differ significantly from McKinley’s.

    Some evidence that the market’s assessments were correct is found in Figure 1, which presents the annual

number of antitrust cases pursued by the federal government from the introduction of the Sherman Act in

1890 until the end of Roosevelt’s second term. McKinley’s administration initiated just three antitrust cases,

a historically low number, whereas 43 were begun during Roosevelt’s presidency. These counts of cases

actually understate the difference across the two administrations, since they do not distinguish among the

economic importance of the defendants. Whereas McKinley’s administration pursued cases against coal

dealers in California, and livestock dealers in Kansas City, Roosevelt initiated suits against some of the

largest corporations of the time, including Standard Oil, American Tobacco, Du Pont, and several major

railroads.

    The strong aggregate reaction of the stock market to news relating to Roosevelt becoming president,

however, could have reflected investors’ views about a variety of other policies. To determine the effects of

a sudden change in the expected enforcement of antitrust laws, our analysis compares the variation in market

values for firms more and less likely to be directly affected by such changes in policy.

1955).

3 The Effect of McKinley’s Assassination on Firms

3.1 Construction of the Sample

Our analysis focuses on the variation in market values of publicly traded firms in response to the assassi-

nation. In this section, we present a brief description of the sources and methods used to construct a new

dataset containing a variety of firm characteristics, while the Appendix presents more detailed information.

   Our initial sample includes all railroads and industrial firms with shares listed on the NYSE in 1901. To

calculate these firms’ stock returns, we collect daily closing prices of common shares and information on

dividend payouts from the New York Times from September 3 to September 21. At the time, the stock market

was relatively illiquid; we observe prices on at least one date for only 99 of the 134 companies we identify

as having common stock listed on the NYSE.

   We focus on abnormal returns to remove the effects of general stock market price movements. We

estimate the market-model parameters over the 75 trading days prior to September 3, and exclude from the

analysis those companies for which we observe returns on fewer than half of those dates. In addition, we

collect whatever accounting data and firm characteristics are available from contemporary sources such as

Moody’s Manual. Our main sample consists of 48 firms (28 railroads and 20 industrial firms) for which

we observe abnormal stock returns and basic firm characteristics. Appendix Section A.3.1 shows that our

results are robust to instead using unadjusted returns, which allow us to include in the sample a total of 71

firms.

   It should be noted that many firms whose values were likely to have been quite sensitive to changes in

antitrust enforcement, such as Standard Oil, are not included in our data because they were not listed on the

NYSE. Our estimates may therefore understate the true impact of Roosevelt’s accession to the presidency.


3.2 Hypotheses and Main Variables

3.2.1 Vulnerability to Antitrust Enforcement

If investors expected Roosevelt to act more aggressively than McKinley toward anticompetitive behavior,

the market values of firms that were likely to become subject to antitrust enforcement would have suffered

disproportionately on days of bad news concerning McKinley’s health. By contrast, we would expect these

firms’ valuations to gain disproportionately on the days that doctors said McKinley would recover and that



                                                     12
Roosevelt stated he would follow McKinley’s agenda. Yet identifying the firms that were particularly vul-

nerable to stronger enforcement of the Sherman Act presents a challenge. It may not have been clear, for

example, which strategies Roosevelt’s administration would have been most likely to pursue, or how recep-

tive the courts would have been to those strategies.

    We argue that firms that had participated in merger activity in the years leading up to the assassination

would have been considered more likely targets of renewed efforts to enforce the Sherman Act. This insight

allows us to propose two characteristics of firms that were likely correlated with expectations of differential

sensitivity to stronger antitrust enforcement.

    First, firms formed through recent mergers were likely among the most vulnerable to antitrust enforce-

ment. The Supreme Court’s 1895 E.C. Knight decision was generally interpreted as holding that the Sherman

Act did not apply to mergers, and the McKinley Administration validated this interpretation by not attempt-

ing to enforce the Sherman Act against any mergers. The industrial consolidations undertaken during the

great wave of mergers that followed the Supreme Court’s decision were likely conceived with the expec-

tation that they were exempt from antitrust law, and their design, and conduct, likely reflected this belief.

These mergers also attracted a great deal of attention in the press, partly because of their massive scale, but

also because in some cases firms that had participated in cartels to restrain competition were consolidating

to protect their rents. If Roosevelt had been expected to strengthen enforcement of the Sherman Act, these

firms would have been among some of the most likely targets. Therefore, we construct an indicator variable,

Merger, for industrial firms that were incorporated in 1895 or later as a product of consolidations, since these

firms would have been differentially vulnerable to antitrust enforcement.

    Among the railroads in our sample, there was no equivalent post-1895 merger wave, because many of

these firms were in receivership in the wake of the Panic of 1893. However, some significant merger activity

among railroads did occur in 1900 and 1901, after the industry had recovered, and after the Supreme Court’s

Joint Traffic Association and Trans Missouri decisions, which held that cartels among railroads were illegal.

These mergers included some very large, high-profile firms, and may have also been undertaken with the

expectation that they were unlikely to be subject to antitrust enforcement.26 Thus, we identify railroads that
   26
      Among these mergers was the joint acquisition of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy by the Northern Pacific
Railroad and the Great Northern Railroad. This latter merger was subsequently cemented through the formation of the
Northern Securities Company, which owned all three railroads. The legal actions of Roosevelt’s government against
this holding company are the focus of our analysis in Section 5. Contemporary commentary emphasized the role of ac-
quisitions in the industry during this period in bringing competitive railroads together and highlighted their importance
for the railroad valuations (see, for example, Sage et al. 1901).


                                                           13
were involved in merger activity in the 1899–1901 period from various editions of the Moody’s Manual and

the Poor’s Manual, and designate them as differentially vulnerable to antitrust enforcement.

    Our second measure is based on firms that would likely have benefited from stricter antitrust enforce-

ment: those that had recently planned, or announced, mergers that ultimately failed to occur. These included

competitors of dominant firms in their industry and relatively weak firms that sought to strengthen their

positions through mergers, but failed.27 If these firms faced competition from larger or more efficient ri-

vals, they would have benefited from stricter antitrust enforcement. We create an indicator variable, Merger

Fail, that identifies any firm in our sample that was mentioned in the year preceding the assassination in the

Commercial and Financial Chronicle, one of the major business news outlets at that time, as considering,

announcing, or being rumored to engage in a merger that failed to occur. While we show that our main results

are robust to this alternative measure, we can only observe those failed mergers that progressed enough to

be reflected in the press. Thus, our analysis focuses primarily on the recent merger variable.

    In Appendix Section A.3.3, we present a brief description of the history of antitrust doctrine to further

validate our approach to identifying firms that were differentially vulnerable to more aggressive antitrust

enforcement, and also perform robustness analyses to evaluate the importance of alternative measures related

to antitrust, such as the degree of concentration of business activity in the firm’s industry.


3.2.2 Other Firm Characteristics

Firms that engaged in merger activity, or those that failed at it, may have differed from those that did not in

other respects. Thus, an important concern for our analysis is that our main variables of interest may reflect

the effect on stock market valuations of other firm characteristics correlated with mergers but unrelated

to antitrust enforcement. Our analysis, therefore, includes a variety of firm characteristics that may have

resulted in differential stock price responses following the assassination.

    The first is the amount of accounting data that the sample firms actually disclosed to investors. In 1901,

NYSE-listed firms were subject only to weak disclosure requirements, which were not rigorously enforced

by the exchange. Many industrial firms published little detail in their income statements, and some produced

no income statements at all.
  27
     For example, Glucose Sugar Refining, a smaller and weaker competitor of the dominant American Sugar Refining,
announced in June 1901 that they had begun negotiations with National Starch and other glucose producers to merge
into a larger and stronger firm. However, several directors opposed the initial proposal, and the merger initially failed.
It was ultimately consummated in 1902 (Dewing, 1914; p. 87).



                                                           14
    As governor of New York, Roosevelt advocated for stricter disclosure requirements for major corpo-

rations, and made them the centerpiece of his discussion of the trust problem in his 1900 annual message.

Roosevelt argued that a requirement for more detailed disclosures would address the problem of “misrepre-

sentation or concealment regarding material facts,” which he considered to be among the “chief abuses” of

the trusts. He also regarded disclosure as a necessary first step for the design of a policy program to restrain

the trusts: “there may be other remedies, but what these are we can only find out by publicity” (Roosevelt,

1926: 46–47). Financiers with ties to major trusts were concerned about the possibility that Roosevelt would

impose new disclosure requirements, and met with him immediately after he took office to try to persuade

him against doing so.28

    Corporations that had chosen to disclose little accounting information, perhaps to evade regulatory

scrutiny, may have been expected to suffer under a Roosevelt presidency. In order to address this possibil-

ity, we obtained the financial statements of all sample firms published in their most recent annual reports, as

reproduced in Moody’s, and measure the detail of their income statements by counting the number of lines.29

At the time, railroads were subject to standardized disclosure requirements imposed by the Interstate Com-

merce Commission (ICC), so there was no variation in the number of income statement lines among those

firms. To account for the fact that our measure of income statement detail will be correlated with being a

railroad, which itself may have been perceived to be differentially affected under Roosevelt, in all of our

regressions we include an indicator for railroads interacted with the relevant event dates.

    The second set of characteristics capture political connections to McKinley or Roosevelt. A significant

body of work has shown that the political connections of firms may affect their market valuations, both

in modern economies as well as in the past (see, for example, Fisman, 2001; Ferguson and Voth, 2008;

Fisman et al., 2012; and Braggion and Moore, 2013). Firms managed by individuals who had personal ties

to McKinley or Hanna, or who had contributed to McKinley’s campaign, might have been perceived to lose

political influence in the event of McKinley’s death, for example. In contrast, firms with ties to Roosevelt
   28
      In early October 1901, two J.P. Morgan & Company partners, George W. Perkins, who had known Roosevelt since
he was governor of New York, and Robert Bacon, one of Roosevelt’s Harvard classmates, met with Roosevelt. Of the
meeting, Roosevelt wrote: “Perkins wanted me to ... accept the publication of what some particular company chose to
publish, as a favor, instead of demanding what we think ought to be published from all companies as a right” (Letter
to Douglas Robinson, 4 Oct 1901, in Roosevelt 1951b).
   29
      We focus on income statements because they presented information of the greatest value to antitrust enforcement,
such as revenues, costs, and profits. Many industrials published income statements of only a few lines, with no infor-
mation at all on revenues or costs, and some published no income statements at all. In contrast, nearly all sample firms
published at least a rudimentary balance sheet.



                                                          15
may have differentially benefited when the likelihood of the transition increased. As such firms may also

have engaged in merger activity, it is important to control for such ties in the analysis.

    To measure ties to McKinley and/or Hanna, we construct an indicator variable, Donor, for firms owned

or managed by major donors to the McKinley campaign. Although no comprehensive list of donors exists,

the two largest donors were J.P. Morgan and Standard Oil. We identify firms affiliated with J.P. Morgan,

Standard Oil, or the Rockefellers (the major owners of Standard Oil), as indicated in Moody (1904). If those

donations were perceived to buy influence with McKinley, but not with Roosevelt, the affiliated firms could

have suffered differentially in response to the assassination.

    To study the role of personal ties to Roosevelt, we identify whether any director of a firm had a connection

to Roosevelt while he was a student at Harvard. Specifically, we identify the names of graduates of Harvard

in 1880 (Roosevelt’s class) and the names of members of clubs of which Roosevelt was also a member that

were in the graduating classes of 1877 to 1883. We create an indicator variable, Roosevelt, that takes the

value one for companies that had a director or officer (as listed in the Moody’s Manual) who was in one of

these clubs or graduated from Harvard in 1880. Approximately 17% of the firms in our sample had such a

connection.

    By contrast, McKinley did not have such personal connections to directors of major corporations because

he was from a modest family in Ohio, did not attend prominent educational institutions, and was not a member

of elite social organizations.30 An attempt to link members of McKinley’s Civil War regiment, the 23rd Ohio

Infantry, to corporate directors and officers produced no matches. Thus, we cannot assess the role of personal

connections to McKinley, and focus solely on ties with campaign donors.

    Finally, the assassination of McKinley may have introduced greater uncertainty regarding the outlook

for future economic policy and conditions in the market for reasons other than changes in antitrust policy.

If the rise in uncertainty differentially affected the valuations of larger or more profitable firms, which may

have been more likely to engage in mergers, we may erroneously attribute the effects of the assassination to

antitrust enforcement. Unfortunately, the lack of consistent financial statements precludes us from obtaining

reliable measures of cash flow, profitability, or total assets for a large fraction of our sample. Therefore, we

use the log of the book value of total capital, which we can observe for all firms in the sample, to control for
  30

Haven and Hartford Railroad, and Goodwin Stoddard, future director of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company.
While these two companies were listed on the NYSE in 1901, their shares were illiquid and did not trade on days of
interest surrounding the assassination of President McKinley.

3.3 Summary Data

Table 2 presents summary statistics for the 48 firms with data on abnormal returns, which are the main focus

of our analysis. A detailed tabulation of firm characteristics for the individual firms in this sample is provided

in Appendix Tables A.1 and A.2.

    An indication that merger activity was quite common during McKinley’s presidency is that our sample

is evenly split between firms that had recently engaged in a merger, presented in column (1), and those that

had not, shown in column (2). These two groups of firms were remarkably well balanced along several

important characteristics—for example, each group was composed of 14 railroads and 10 industrial firms,

and contained four firms with connections to Roosevelt. Column (3) shows that there were also no noticeable

differences in firm size, or in the export share of the firms’ products. We also find no statistically-significant

differences in the disclosure of information in the firms’ income statements, both when we focus on the entire

sample and when we restrict the data to industrial firms. However, recent-merger firms were more likely

to be connected to major donors to the McKinley campaign and were younger. These characteristics may

have made these firms more vulnerable to higher economic uncertainty or to a transition from McKinley to

Roosevelt, independent of any changes in antitrust policy. We therefore control for firm characteristics and

political connections in our empirical analysis.



4 Impact of the Assassination on Firm Values

The daily abnormal return of NYSE-listed stocks on the dates surrounding the assassination are illustrated

in Figure 2, with those of recent mergers presented separately from other firms. The recent mergers exhibit

sharp declines on September 7 and 13, the dates when the market responded to McKinley’s shooting and

expected death, which are offset by strong increases on September 9 and 16, the dates when the market was

told that McKinley would survive, and that Roosevelt would continue with McKinley’s agenda. In contrast,

the other firms’ returns exhibit much more muted changes on those dates. This is a clear indication that the

transition to Roosevelt was expected to reduce the value of the firms we designate as vulnerable to stricter
  31
    We do observe dividend payouts, a measure imperfectly correlated with profitability, for all firms in the sample.
Reassuringly, controlling for the firms’ dividend payout rates prior to the assassination does not materially affect our
main estimated effects for recent mergers (results not shown).

antitrust enforcement. In what follows, we explore these differences in greater depth.


4.1 Baseline Specifications

We estimate regression models in which we interact our variables for sensitivity to antitrust enforcement

with indicators for the four dates when the market responded to significant news regarding the transition

from McKinley to Roosevelt: September 7, McKinley’s shooting; September 9, the prognosis that McKinley

would survive; September 13, McKinley’s expected death; and September 16, Roosevelt’s statement that he

would continue “absolutely unbroken” with McKinley’s agenda.

    Our panel data regressions for the 14 trading days the NYSE was open between September 4 and Septem-

ber 21, 1901, take the following form:


              ARit = λ1 (Mergeri × Sept 7t ) + λ2 (Mergeri × Sept 9t )

                          +λ3 (Mergeri × Sept 13t ) + λ4 (Mergeri × Sept 16t ) + γi + δt + ϵit ,              (1)


where ARit is firm i’s abnormal return on day t; Mergeri is our indicator for firms that were differentially

vulnerable to stricter antitrust enforcement; γi are firm fixed effects; and δt are fixed effects for each trading

day in the sample. The parameters of interest are λ1 to λ4 , which capture the differential effect of negative

or positive news on McKinley’s condition for firms that were particularly sensitive to a stronger antitrust

regime. To control for the effects of ties to the Presidents or other firm characteristics, we interact those

variables with the same four event dates. In all specifications, we control for firm size and an indicator for

railroads (interacted with event dates), and cluster standard errors by firm.

    Table 3 presents the results for specifications that analyze the effect of the recent merger variable on

abnormal returns. Consistent with the replacement of McKinley by Roosevelt being harmful to the valuations

of firms that were sensitive to greater antitrust enforcement, the estimates in column (1) indicate that the

recent mergers in our sample saw their abnormal returns fall by an additional 175 basis points (bps) on

September 7, a sizable effect relative to the average decline of 103 bps on that date. When the stock market

rose in response to good news on McKinley’s health on September 9, the abnormal returns of recent merger

firms differentially increased by a similar amount, 197 bps.

    When McKinley’s health took a turn for the worse, on September 13, the abnormal returns of firms that

had engaged in mergers declined relative to others by 141 bps, and they increased by 197 bps on September


                                                       18
16, when Roosevelt reassured markets. Importantly, any impact of the assassination attempt, rather than the

change in the identity of the president, would already have been reflected in prices on September 7 and 9.

The remarkably similar estimated effects on September 13 and 16, therefore, suggest that the presidential

transition itself was the primary concern of investors. The pattern of stock returns is consistent with recent

merger firms losing about 1.4 to 1.9 percentage points of their value relative to other firms in the sample in

response to an increase in the perceived likelihood of stronger antitrust enforcement.

    Next, we investigate whether the effects we ascribe to antitrust enforcement were due to other firm

characteristics that may have been correlated with our antitrust variables. In column (2), we allow the returns

to vary on the relevant dates by the level of firm disclosure, as measured by total income statement lines.

The estimated parameters indicate that, relative to a firm with no income statement (0 lines), a firm reporting

5 lines (the median length for industrial firms in the sample) saw its value rise by about 90-125 basis points

on days of increased probability of a change in administration, and decline by 70-110 basis points when

McKinley’s policies were perceived to be more likely to continue. To the extent that a lack of disclosure

of financial information facilitated collusion or abuses by the trusts, we would expect those firms that were

more transparent to have been less impacted by a transition to Roosevelt. Our findings are consistent with

this interpretation, although the estimated magnitudes are smaller and not quite as consistent as that of the

parameters associated with the recent merger variable. More importantly, the estimated effects on recent

mergers are unaffected by including these controls, suggesting that our baseline results are unlikely to be

driven by characteristics associated with firm transparency, or a perception that Roosevelt would strengthen

corporate regulation on issues unrelated to antitrust.

    To rule out the possibility that our results are driven by political or personal connections to the presidents,

in column (3) we include interactions for firms controlled by major donors to McKinley and add an indicator

for firms managed or controlled by individuals with personal ties to Roosevelt. And the specification in col-

umn (4) adds log firm age as a measure of more mature or stable firms. The estimated parameters associated

with these variables (presented in the Appendix) are generally imprecise, but more importantly, the effects

of Merger are robust to the inclusion of these additional controls, which include those that differed across

the two groups of firms in Table 2. The magnitudes of the estimated coefficients are quite stable across the

different specifications, and most of them remain statistically significant.

    Two points should be noted about the interpretation of our baseline results. First, as in any event study

design, the estimated effects are based on expected values. That is, we measure the effect of a new antitrust

                                                         19
regime on firm values, weighted by the probability of such change actually occurring. To the extent that the

probabilities were seen as relatively low for the typical firm engaged in recent mergers, our results suggest

that a change in antitrust enforcement was expected to have sizable effects on the value of prosecuted firms.

    A second and more important point is that we cast the interpretation of our findings as reflecting the

expectations of investors of stronger enforcement of existing antitrust statues. An alternative interpretation

could be that investors may instead have expected a change in the law. The historical context of our event

suggests that this was unlikely. At the time of the assassination, both houses of Congress were controlled

by the Republican party, which included a substantial, strongly pro-business faction that had traditionally

opposed new antitrust legislation. Between 1881 and the assassination of McKinley, in fact, 45 separate

pieces of antitrust legislation had been proposed in Congress, most in the 1890s (Mitchell, 2007: 122).

Nearly all of them had been defeated in Congress, usually stalled in committee. Roosevelt’s accession to

the presidency did not change the composition of Congress, which ultimately controlled the fate of any new

legislation. Indeed Roosevelt repeatedly sought new antitrust legislation during his presidency, and was met

with little success (Crane, 2008).

    In Table 4, we focus instead on the Merger Fail variable, an indicator for firms that would benefit from

stronger antitrust enforcement. The specifications replicate those in Table 3. Consistent with these firms

benefiting from a Roosevelt presidency, their valuations were more resilient on the two days of bad news

regarding McKinley’s health, when the stock market tanked, but rose by less on the days when it seemed

that McKinley would survive or that Roosevelt would follow McKinley’s agenda. Although the estimated

magnitudes vary somewhat more across the four days, they are all statistically significant, and robust to the

inclusion of our various controls for firm characteristics.


4.2 Alternative Policy Preferences

Roosevelt’s policy agenda may have been expected to differ from McKinley’s on issues beyond antitrust

enforcement. An important source of concern for our empirical approach is that the firms we designated as

vulnerable to antitrust enforcement may also have been vulnerable to changes in other policies Roosevelt

was expected to enact.

    On what was likely the most important economic policy issue of the time, commitment to the gold

standard, Roosevelt did not in fact differ from McKinley. However, Roosevelt’s preferences differed from

McKinley’s on another important issue, tariff policy. Whereas McKinley favored tariffs quite strongly, and

                                                      20
had been a sponsor of tariff legislation while in Congress, Roosevelt was more of a free-trader. Businesses

that had previously benefited from tariff protection may, therefore, have seen their valuations fall in response

to Roosevelt unexpectedly becoming president. To address this possibility, we control for the trade exposure

of our sample firms, measured as the share of output that was exported at the industry level for the industrial

firms in our sample. For railroads, we construct data on the share of revenues accounted for by export

products.

    In Panel A of Table 5, we include our measure of exposure to exports in regressions otherwise identical

those presented in columns (1) and (4) of Table 3. The signs of the estimated parameters for this variable are

generally consistent with the notion that Roosevelt’s agenda would benefit exporters. But including these

interactions does not meaningfully change the estimated magnitudes associated with the antitrust variables.

    McKinley and Roosevelt may also have differed on their views on labor issues. McKinley was not as

anti-labor as some of his contemporaries, and unlike President Cleveland before him, he did not pursue any

Sherman Act cases against unions. Nonetheless, Roosevelt was relatively friendly towards labor interests,

and he helped to enact several important pieces of labor legislation as governor of New York. Firms that

were differentially vulnerable to labor activism would perhaps have seen their valuations fall in response to

Roosevelt unexpectedly becoming president. Unfortunately, there is no firm- or industry-level data on labor

strife available for our period. We instead use an event study analysis of a major labor strike that occurred

during Roosevelt’s administration to assess whether our results could be related to changes in expected labor

relations policy.

    Specifically, in Panel B of Table 5 we analyze the market’s reaction to Roosevelt’s intervention in an on-

going coal strike among miners in Pennsylvania’s anthracite coal fields. Previous presidents had generally

intervened on behalf of employers in labor relations disputes, if they intervened at all. As the strike dragged

on, mine operators called for Roosevelt to end the strike by deploying federal troops to ensure the safety of

those miners who desired to work and their families. The operators argued that the president was granted the

authority to do so under the Sherman Act of 1890, as they viewed the union as a unlawful cartel. Roosevelt

disagreed; only in response to concerns that the coal strike, which began in May 1902, might substantially

raise coal prices for households over the winter did Roosevelt decided to intervene, but he did so in a rel-

atively neutral way. On October 1, 1902, Roosevelt announced that he would meet with representatives of

government, management, and labor at the White House in order to facilitate a resolution to the dispute. This

marked a substantial change from historical precedent.

                                                      21
    If recent mergers were correlated with sensitivity to a change in labor relations policy, then those firms

should have performed differentially worse in response to the announcement of the conference. Panel B

of Table 5 presents the results of regressions similar to those reported in columns (1) and (4) of Table 3,

but using cumulative abnormal returns during an eight day window around the October 1 announcement.

The estimated effects are, on average, positive, and not statistically significant, but the coefficients are too

imprecisely estimated to confidently rule out a sizable negative effect. These results, therefore, provide

some suggestive evidence that, at least as indicated by this event, the effects on firm valuations that we

estimate around the presidential assassination are unlikely to be primarily driven by expectations of changes

in policies to favor workers.



5 Litigation against Northern Securities

Our analysis of the events surrounding McKinley’s assassination suggests that investors believed that the

replacement of McKinley by Roosevelt would result in more aggressive antitrust enforcement. To test this

interpretation of our results, and the validity of the recent merger variable as an indicator of sensitivity to

antitrust issues, we study the stock market’s reaction to an event that revealed new information on Roosevelt’s

approach to antitrust: the announcement of Roosevelt’s first antitrust suit. Unlike the assassination event, this

one was unquestionably an indication that more aggressive antitrust enforcement was in store. Other suits

filed subsequently by Roosevelt potentially revealed additional information about the enforcement strategy

he chose to pursue, but only the first suit was kept secret before its announcement, and is therefore suitable

for an event study.

    In November of 1901, just after Roosevelt had become president, J.P. Morgan created an enormous

holding company, the Northern Securities Company, to jointly own the capital stocks of two major competing

railroads, the Northern Pacific and Great Northern, as well as third that connected them to Chicago, the

Chicago, Burlington and Quincy. The shear scale of the firm, with $300 million in capital, along with

its potential to monopolize rail transportation in a large area of the country, concerned Roosevelt. Recent

Supreme Court decisions, such as Trans Missouri and Joint Traffic, held that the Sherman Act applied to

railroads, and that collusive behavior among them violated the act. However, on the theory that the E. C.

Knight decision indicated the Sherman Act did not apply to mergers, these firms had been joined together

via a holding company. Roosevelt asked Attorney General Philander Knox to quietly study the possibility


                                                       22
of pursuing an antitrust action against the company, explaining in his autobiography that he felt “It was

necessary to reverse the Knight case” (Roosevelt 1920: 443). Knox studied the matter carefully, ultimately

concluding that the Knight case had been poorly argued and a different strategy was possible in a suit against

Northern Securities, which had a reasonable chance of success (Morris 2002: 88).

    On February 19, 1902, after the stock market closed, Knox made the following announcement regarding

the forthcoming legal actions against Northern Securities: “Some time ago the president requested an opinion

as to the legality of this merger, and I have recently given him one to the effect that, in my judgment, it violates

the provisions of the Sherman Act of 1890, whereupon he directed that suitable action should be taken to

have the question judicially determined” (quoted in Meyer, 1906: 258).32 The actual suit was filed on March

10, 1902.

    The timing made it quite a shock. The Supreme Court was then considering a case filed by the attorney

general of Minnesota against the railway combination, and was expected to announce its decision on Monday,

February 24, 1902.33 Contemporary reports suggest that the market expected the Supreme Court to reject

Minnesota’s suit, and the announcement of a federal suit just before the Supreme Court’s decision generally

came as a surprise.34

    The announcement confirmed that Roosevelt would indeed attempt to pursue a more aggressive antitrust

agenda. In its effort to obtain a judgment that a merger of competitors violated the Sherman Act, the suit

sought to expand the boundaries of antitrust doctrine, with potentially far-reaching consequences. Yet, on

February 20, it could not have been clear whether the suit would be successful, or if it were, how broad

and applicable the decision would ultimately be. The implications beyond railroads, or even beyond the

three railroads included in the merger, would not have been so clear. We therefore study the effect of the

unexpected announcement of the federal case against Northern Securities on the market values of firms that

we designated as differentially sensitive to more aggressive antitrust enforcement.
  32
      In response, on February 23 J. P. Morgan himself went to Washington to meet with Roosevelt and Knox, bringing
then-Senator Mark Hanna and Senator Chauncey Depew with him. Unaccustomed to policy decisions that concerned
his interests being made without his consultation, Morgan said, characteristically: “If we have done anything wrong,
send your man to my man and they can fix it up” (Quoted in Bishop, 1920: 184). Over the subsequent weeks, Mor-
gan conferred repeatedly with Hanna regarding the case, but the case against Northern Securities followed its course
(Strouse 2000: 442).
   33
      On January 7, 1902, the attorney general of Minnesota, on behalf of his state and with the support of several other
western states, moved for leave to file a bill of complaint against the company before the U.S. Supreme Court (Meyer,
1906).
   34
      The Washington Post, for example, stated that the “announcement from Washington was therefore a rude shock to
all of this optimistic sentiment that has been carefully nurtured in the financial district” (February 21, 1902).



                                                           23
    Figure 3 shows average cumulative abnormal returns separately for the firms that had engaged in recent

mergers and those that had not, for all trading days from February 14 to March 1, 1902. We normalize the

returns to zero for February 14, and cumulate them forward from that date. The returns of merger firms were

similar to those of other firms until February 19, when they began to decline. Since the announcement that

the government was going to challenge the merger happened late in the day, the filing primarily impacted

stock prices on February 20.

    It is possible that Roosevelt may have unintentionally revealed that a suit was forthcoming, which may

explain the decline in abnormal returns among recent mergers on February 19. On the 18th, Roosevelt met

with Mark Hanna and asked his opinion regarding the combination. Hanna, who was a shareholder and a

close associate of some of the Northern Securities insiders, expressed enthusiastic support for the firm. It is

not clear whether Hanna interpreted Roosevelt’s question as a sign that an antitrust suit was in the works,

and when the suit was actually announced Hanna is said to have been “thunderstruck” (Morris 2002: 89).35

But if Hanna had mentioned his conversation to others, or if Roosevelt had any other conversations about

the firm on that day that are not known to historians, this could explain the fall in returns in anticipation of

the announcement.

    In any case, following the 20th, the returns of merger firms remained below those of non-merger cor-

porations for at least a week. Importantly, this pattern was not driven by any direct effects on the shares of

Northern Securities, as this firm is not included in our sample. Thus, the figure presents suggestive evidence

that the revelation of the stronger stance of Roosevelt’s administration against trusts differentially affected

those firms that we characterize as ex-ante more sensitive to more aggressive antitrust enforcement.36

    To more formally analyze the effect of the Northern Securities litigation on the market values of NYSE-

listed firms, we employ an event study methodology. For each firm in the sample, we calculate cumulative

abnormal returns from February 20 to March 1, 1902, and relate them to our measure of the threat of being

subjected to antitrust suits. Our empirical strategy consists of estimating:


                                      CARi = α + βMergeri + δXi + ϵi                                                   (2)
  35
    This may indicate that Hanna did not anticipate a suit, but it may also indicate that he did not expect one so soon.
  36
    Prager (1992) studies, instead, the effects on railroad valuations of the circuit courts’ decisions that sided with the
government’s case in 1903. He finds that stock prices declined during those dates, and suggests that Northern Securities
was an important development in antitrust policy because it established new precedent for railroad mergers.




                                                            24
where CARi is firm i’s cumulative abnormal return from February 20 to March 1; Mergeri is an indicator for

firms that were more likely to be targets of antitrust litigation due to recent merger activity; and Xi includes

controls for firm-specific characteristics.

    Table 6 presents the results; we modify the specifications presented across the different columns from

those of Table 3 above, in response to the different character of the information revealed by the filing of the

suit. In column (1), we include minimal controls. The results indicate that recent mergers lost about 1.3

percent of their value relative to other firms, a magnitude that is generally consistent with those associated

with days of bad news regarding McKinley’s health. In column (2), we include our measure of accounting

disclosure, and find that it has little effect on returns. This is consistent with our interpretation of that variable

as highlighting companies that would be affected by stronger disclosure requirements, the likelihood of which

was not affected by the Northern Securities suit. As the suit was filed against a railroad, and the potential

impact of any decision on firms outside the railroad industry could have been seen as ambiguous, in column

(3) we add an indicator for railroads. This has little impact, and does not affect the magnitude of the merger

variable.

    Finally, in column (4) we add an indicator for firms affiliated with J.P. Morgan & Company. Morgan

had engineered Northern Securities and was the most influential financier of his era. Roosevelt and Morgan

saw each other partly as rivals (Wiebe, 1959), and one concern about the results could be that they reflect the

expectation that Morgan firms would receive greater regulatory scrutiny. Although imprecisely estimated,

the coefficient on the Morgan variable is negative. More importantly, however, the estimate on the merger

variable is unaffected by the inclusion of the Morgan control.

    By focusing on returns cumulated from February 20, our results are conservative and exclude the po-

tential impact of anticipation effects. In the appendix, we show that our results are robust to performing the

event study over different windows around the announcement of the administration’s action against Northern

Securities, and that they double in size when we begin the analysis on February 18 or 19. We also show that

the estimated effects are similar when we focus instead on unadjusted returns and when we include controls

for various measures of market concentration and coordination through common ownership.

    The relative decline in abnormal returns for recent merger firms is consistent with the suit being inter-

preted as a sign that stricter antitrust enforcement was likely, and recent mergers were among those likely

to face greater antitrust scrutiny. It is important to note that these coefficients likely understate the overall

effect of the suit, because none of the railroads involved in the Northern Securities combination had shares

                                                         25
of common stock that traded on the NYSE at the time, and thus are not included in the sample.



6 Accounting Returns of Railroads

Our focus on stock market returns enables us to measure the impacts of expected changes in policy, since

we can measure returns at a high-frequency immediately as events unfolded. These results are by nature

short run and based on expectations, and therefore do not allow us to address whether stronger antitrust

enforcement actually had consequences on the economy over a longer time span. To provide some insights

into this question, we next investigate whether Roosevelt’s agenda actually affected the financial outcomes

of the firms we designated as vulnerable to stronger antitrust enforcement. Specifically, we study whether

the profitability of those firms fell relative to others in the years following Roosevelt’s ascension to the

Presidency. We focus our analysis exclusively on railroads because industrial firms did not consistently

produce detailed financial statements at the turn of the century.

    To perform these tests, we collect annual accounting data for all sample railroads from 1895 to 1905.37

We measure accounting profitability as return on assets (defined as net income divided by total assets), and

use it to estimate regressions of the following form:


                                 πit = θMergeri × Post1901t + γi + δt + ϵit ,                                          (3)


where πit is the return on assets of railroad i in year t; Mergerit is our firm-specific measure of vulnerability

to stricter antitrust; Post1901t is an indicator for the years following 1901, when Roosevelt was president;

and γi and δt are railroad and year fixed effects, respectively. The coefficient of interest, θ, is the post-1901

difference-in-differences in the profitability of railroads that were recent mergers relative to others. To avoid

confounding the estimated effects with differences in railroad size, all our regressions control for the lagged

value of log assets, a more precise measure of size than the value of capital used in the analysis of stock

returns. Standard errors are clustered by firm.

    The results are presented in Table 7. The estimated effects in column (1) indicate that the profitability of

those railroads engaged in mergers prior to McKinley’s assassination experienced a decline of 0.5 percentage
  37
     We stop the analysis in 1905 because the Hepburn Act passed in 1906. This law strengthened the powers of the
Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), the agency in charge of regulating railroads. Any subsequent changes in rail-
road profitability may, therefore, have been caused by stricter ICC regulation, rather than stricter antitrust enforcement.



                                                            26
points more than others on average from 1901 to 1905, relative to the difference in ROA between these

two groups of railroads in prior years. The economic magnitude of this effect is quite significant, as it

represents about 10.2 percent of the mean 1901 profitability rate in the sample. This result is robust to

allowing for differential post-assassination effects by firm size (in column (2)), as well as in the level of

financial leverage and firm age (in column (3)). These results suggest that firms engaged in recent mergers

were not only expected to suffer under Roosevelt by investors, but that they actually did so. It is important to

note, however, that our difference-in-difference design does not allow us to determine the aggregate effects

of the policy change on the railroad industry, or its welfare effects on the economy more broadly.



7 Conclusion

We study the assassination of President William McKinley in September 1901 to estimate the potential scope

of political discretion in the aggressiveness of antitrust enforcement. The news of McKinley’s shooting

provoked a significant fall in stock prices. This decline was reversed when doctors subsequently announced

that they expected McKinley to recover, and this reversal was itself reversed when McKinley’s condition

suddenly became grave. The latter fall in stock prices in response to the expectation that McKinley would

die was purely a response to the transition from McKinley to Roosevelt, and not a reaction to the fact that

an anarchist shot the president, which had occurred 7 days earlier. These swings in market values were

borne differentially by firms that were particularly sensitive to changes in antitrust enforcement, as were the

declines in the market associated with the surprise announcement of Roosevelt’s first antitrust suit.

    At the time Roosevelt took office, antitrust enforcement was at a historic low point, and the Supreme

Court’s E.C. Knight decision seemed to foreclose any possibility of pursuing a more aggressive approach. Yet

when he unexpectedly became president, asset price changes indicated that there was considerable discretion

available to him in antitrust enforcement, and that he would utilize that discretion. As one of the authors

of the Sherman Act, Senator George Edmunds, stated, “What is needed is not, so much, more legislation

as competent and earnest administration of the laws that exist” (quoted in Letwin, 1965: 141). Perhaps

something similar is true today, in the sense that recent administrations may have not been as aggressive and

innovative as they could have been in enforcing existing rules.

    The longer-run consequences of the assassination, relative to the counterfactual of McKinley serving

out his second term, are not easy to infer. At the end of his term as vice president in 1904, Roosevelt may


                                                      27
have run for president and won, in which case his accession to the presidency in 1901 simply accelerated

changes that would have occurred anyway. Yet it is possible that a different Republican, one more sym-

pathetic toward the trusts, may have prevailed in 1904. Growing economic concentration may have been

accompanied by growing political influence of big business, potentially threatening both economic growth

and democracy (Zingales, 2017). Roosevelt was no radical, and indeed the Tillman Act of 1907 prohibiting

direct contributions from corporations to political campaigns was enacted partly in response to the funding

that his own 1904 campaign had received from plutocratic interests. But Roosevelt’s independent, reform-

minded presidency may have prevented some developments that could have been quite harmful for American

democracy.

 Note: Franklin D. Roosevelt was President-Elect at the time of the shooting attempt on his life. For shootings prior
to Roosevelt, the percent change in share prices computed as an equal-weighted index from closing NYSE prices
reported in the New York Times. For the subsequent shootings, the percent change in share prices is calculated from
closing NYSE prices as reported in CRSP. The number of securities for which prices were observed on the day prior to
the shooting, and also on the day when trading reflected the news of the shooting, was 16 for the Lincoln assassination,
63 for Garfield, 79 for McKinley, 311 for Roosevelt, 1,144 for Kennedy, 1,468 for Ford and 1,520 for Reagan. All

 Panel A Notes: This panel presents versions of the regressions presented in Table 3 in which we control for the
export share of the sample firms’ products interacted with the assassination event dates. The variable Merger indicates
differential vulnerability to more aggressive antitrust enforcement. All regressions include log capital and an indicator
for railroads interacted with the event dates (September 7, 9, 13, and 16). Standard errors adjusted for clustering by
firm are reported in parentheses.
 Panel B Notes: This table presents results of an event study of the announcement on October 1, 1902, that Roosevelt
would intervene in the anthracite coal strike, a significant departure from historical precedent in the approach to labor
relations taken by the president. The dependent variable is abnormal returns cumulated from October 1 to October 8,
1902. All regressions also include log capital and an indicator for railroads as controls. Robust standard errors are in
parentheses.

A Data Appendix
A.1 Variable Definitions
Stock Returns: The main focus of our analysis are abnormal returns, calculated using daily stock price data
   and dividend payout information hand-collected from the New York Times on the days surrounding Pres-
   ident McKinley’s assassination. For each stock, returns (R) are calculated as
                                                      Pt + Dt
                                               Rt =           − 1,
                                                       Pt−1

   where P represents price, D represents the dividend on days the stock goes ex-dividend, and t indexes
   trading day. Alpha and beta are estimated for each security using Dimson’s (1979) method with three
   leads and three lags on the market index to address liquidity concerns. The estimating equation follows:

                                                    ∑
                                                    3
                                        Rt = α +          βk+4 ∗ It+k + ϵt ,
                                                   k=−3

   where I represents the relevant market index. For industrial firms we use the Dow Jones Industrial
   Average and for railroads we use the Dow Jones Transportation Average as the market index. Abnormal
   returns (AR) are then calculated for each firm as follows:

                                                            ∑
                                                            3
                                        ARt = Rt − α̂ −            β̂k+4 ∗ It .
                                                            k=−3

   Pre-period price data was collected for the 75 trading days between May 29 and August 30, 1901, from
   the New York Times in order to estimate α̂ and β̂ for each stock. Due to low liquidity, however, prices
   are not observed on many days for some firms in the pre-period. Thus, our sample is restricted to stocks
   for which at least 38 returns are observed in the pre-period. Furthermore, we restrict the sample to firms
   with an r-squared greater than or equal to 0.32 for railroads and 0.24 for industrial firms in the estimation
   of α̂ and β̂. These cutoffs represent the 25th percentile of r-squared within each sector after imposing
   the restriction on the number of returns available in the pre-period. Those firms excluded by this second
   restriction are missing returns for 22 days of the pre-period on average, while those that pass are missing
   returns for 8 days on average. These restrictions are made to exclude companies from the analysis for
   which we cannot obtain reliable estimates of α̂ and β̂.

Merger: This indicator identifies firms that engaged in merger activity in the years prior to the assassination.
  The variable takes the value one for industrial firms that were incorporated after 1895. We utilize the
  historical record to verify that all of these firms were the product of consolidations of various smaller
  firms during the Great Merger Wave. For railroads, this variable takes the value of one for firms with
  merger activity during the period 1899–1901. This captures mergers occurring after the Supreme Court’s
  1898 decision on United States v. Joint Traffic Association, which one could argue were more likely
  to have been enacted to avoid antitrust scrutiny. To identify merger activity we consulted the Moody’s
  Manual and Poor’s Manual of the Railroads of the United States and noted railroads that acquired a major
  stake in another railroad and railroads in which a controlling stake was purchased.

Merger Fail: An indicator variable that takes the value one for firms for which a clear rumor of or plan for
  a merger with a specific company was announced in The Commercial and Financial Chronicle between
  July 1, 1900, and June 30, 1901, but the merger had not been completed by December 1901, and zero


                                                      43
   otherwise.

Community of Interest: An indicator variable that takes the value of one for subordinate (or controlled) rail-
  roads in ‘communities of interest’ (that is, groups of railroads with common ownership stakes or board
  seats that could be used to coordinate actions), as identified by Moody (1904). We verify Moody’s cate-
  gorization utilizing The Moody’s Manuals, and add the Canadian Pacific railroad, which had controlling
  shares in several American roads that were not part of other groups, as an additional community of inter-
  est. We set the variable to zero for industrial firms in the sample.

Donor Firm: An indicator variable that takes the value of one for firms affiliated with J. P. Morgan, the
  Rockefellers, or Standard Oil (the largest donors to McKinley’s presidential campaign), and zero other-
  wise. The firms designated as affiliated with Morgan are those listed by Moody (1904) as being under
  “Morgan domination” or “Morgan control,” a subset of those with J.P. Morgan & Company partners on
  their boards. The Standard Oil firms include a number of firms founded by or strongly affiliated with
  the Rockefellers or Standard Oil as noted by Moody (1904). We include firms connected to the Rocke-
  fellers because William Rockefeller, brother of John D. Rockefeller and an executive at Standard Oil, also
  assisted Hanna in raising funds from other wealthy donors for the McKinley campaign (Rhodes, 1922).

Export/Output: Eysenbach (1976) provides estimates of “exports as a percentage of gross output” for 17
  industries for American firms in 1899 in Appendix Table 15. Industrial firms in our sample are matched
  to these industries using their descriptions in the 1901 edition of the Moody’s Manual. For railroads, we
  calculate the percentage of revenues associated with export products among railroads within each of the
  ICC’s ten geographical regions. We first use data from the 1901 Annual Report of the ICC, which details
  the proportion of different categories of railroad freight by geographical division. We then use tables from
  the Historical Statistics of the United States to calculate the percentage of each type of product that was
  exported. For each railroad, the export measure is calculated as: the percentage of revenues accounted for
  by freight multiplied by the sum of the percentages of freight that was accounted for by different products
  multiplied by the percentage of each product category that was exported.

Income Statement Lines: A count of the number of substantive lines provided in the income statement of
   each firm, excluding lines containing intermediate items such as ‘subtotals.’ Railroads were required to
   report standardized, detailed income statements to the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), which
   were then published in the ICC’s annual reports. Thus, for all railroads this variable takes the value 33, the
   number of lines on the ICC income statements. For industrial firms we checked the Moody’s Manual, the
   Manual of Statistics Stock Exchange Handbook, and the New York Times guide to investors published in
   September 1901 for income statements. When income statements were present in more than one source,
   this variable is a count of the number of lines in the most detailed statement. For firms that did not report
   an income statement in any of these publications, the income statement lines takes a value of zero. One
   NYSE company, American Locomotive, was founded in June of 1901, and therefore does not appear in
   the sources we relied on for financial statements. We have been unable to determine whether investors had
   access to an income statement at the time of the assassination (or what was known about their dividend
   rate at that time), and therefore exclude the company from the analysis.

JP Morgan Firm: An indicator variable that takes the value of one for firms affiliated with J. P. Morgan,
   and zero otherwise. These firms are listed by Moody (1904) as being under “Morgan domination” or
   “Morgan control,” a subset of those with J.P. Morgan & Company partners on their boards.

Leverage: Book value of leverage (long-term debt/total assets). Long-term debt includes bonds and other


                                                       44
   long-term interest-bearing liabilities (e.g. mortgages and equipment trusts), as reported in the firms’
   balance sheets.

Log(Age): The natural log of one plus 1901 minus the year of incorporation for each firm. The year of
  incorporation was collected from the 1901 edition of the Moody’s Manual.

Log(Assets): The natural log of total assets, as reported in the firms’ balance sheets.

Log(Capital): The natural log of the sum of the preferred and common shares outstanding multiplied by
  their respective par values. Preferred shares outstanding, common shares outstanding, and the par value
  of each were collected from the firm’s capital stock description from the 1901 edition of the Moody’s
  Manual.

Market Concentration: The relative extent of monopoly by 2 digit SIC codes. Source: Table 39, p 144-147,
  for Manufacturing and Table 41, p 151, Table 9, p 40, and Table 10, p 41, for Mining, Transportation,
  Communication, and Public Utilities, Nutter (1951). This variable takes a value of zero for railroads.

Market Share: The percentage of the market controlled by the largest firm in the sector in which the firm
  operates, where sectors are defined at the 3 and 4 digit SIC codes. Source: Table 37, p 129-141, Nutter
  (1951). This variable takes a value of zero for railroads.

Railroad: An indicator variable that takes the value of one for firms that are listed in the “Eleventh Section:
   Steam Railroad Securities” of the 1901 Moody’s Manual beginning on page 1161, and zero otherwise.

Return on Assets: The ratio of net income to total assets, obtained from the firms’ income statements and
   balance sheets.

Roosevelt: An indicator variable that takes the value of one for firms with directors or executives who
  attended Harvard with Theodore Roosevelt. Roosevelt matriculated at Harvard in the fall of 1876 and
  graduated in 1880. While attending Harvard he was a member of the following clubs: Alpha Delta Phi,
  Delta Kappa Epsilon, Hasty Pudding, Phi Beta Kappa, and Porcellian. We collected the names of the
  members of these clubs for the graduating classes of 1877–83, who would likely have overlapped with
  Roosevelt, from club catalogs. We also collected the names of those in the graduating class of 1880
  from the Harvard University catalog. Using these lists and a listing of executives and directors of firms
  collected from the 1901 Moody’s Manual, we identified firms with connections to Roosevelt.


A.2 Full Results from Main Tables
The tables of results in the paper suppress a number of parameters, to keep the tables from becoming too
lengthy. In Appendix Tables A.3 and A.4 we show specifications previously presented in Tables 3 and 4,
respectively, displaying coefficients on additional variables of interest.

A.3 Robustness Checks
A.3.1 Baseline Effects—McKinley’s Assassination
In this section, we present additional tests to assess the robustness of our main estimated effects for recent
mergers discussed in Section 4.1 of the paper.



                                                      45
    Our main analysis takes into account differences in firm stability by allowing for differential effects of
log capital, a proxy for firm size, on each of the four relevant dates around McKinley’s assassination. Here,
we replicate this analysis by also including in the regressions other relevant firm characteristics. In Appendix
Table A.5 we include log assets. This measure is arguably a more precise proxy for firm size than the log
capital variable that we use in all our specifications, but unfortunately we do not observe it for those firms
that do not disclose balance sheets. Despite the loss of observations, the estimated effects when we include
controls for the value of assets are similar to when we do not.
    In the paper, we focus the analysis on abnormal stock returns to avoid confounding our estimates with
cross-sectional differences in price co-movement with the overall market. This approach reduces the number
of observations significantly because it limits the sample to those firms that traded frequently enough to be
able to estimate their CAPM betas prior to the assassination, as described in Appendix Section A.1. In
Appendix Table A.6 we replicate our main analysis utilizing instead unadjusted returns as the dependent
variable. To ensure a minimum level of liquidity, in column (1) we restrict the sample to the firms whose
common stocks traded at least 100 shares—the minimum requirement to observe a traded price in The New
York Times—on each of the four event days. The estimated coefficients get a bit smaller and imprecise,
reflecting the fact that low-volume stocks tended to have relatively small unadjusted returns. However, the
patterns across dates remains similar—returns of recent merger firms declined on dates of bad news about
McKinley’s health, and increased when there was positive news about the continuity of his policies. In
columns (2) to (5), we restrict the sample to the 48 firms that we include in our baseline specification, but we
focus on unadjusted returns instead. The estimated effects are similar to those obtained when using instead
abnormal returns, as shown in Table 3.

A.3.2 Baseline Effects—Northern Securities
In Section 5 of the paper, our event-study analysis of the Northern Securities litigation, presented in Table 6,
focuses on abnormal returns cumulated from February 20 to March 1, 1902. Here, we show that the results
are robust to defining the event over alternative windows. For ease of comparison, column (1) of Appendix
Table A.8 reproduces column (4) of Table 6. In columns (2) and (3), we allow for anticipation effects, starting
to cumulate returns on February 19 or February 18, respectively. The estimated effects become larger and
more precise when we allow for the potential leakage of information to the market prior to Attorney General
Knox’s announcement.
    A potential concern with our main analysis in Table 6 is that other news may have differentially affected
firms over a period of nine trading days following the announcement of the suit. To address this problem, we
again define the start of the event period on February 20, but instead cumulate returns over shorter windows—
eight trading days in column (4) and five trading days in column (5). In both cases, the estimated effects
are remarkably similar to those obtained in the baseline estimation, revealing that our main results are not
highly sensitive to the window of the analysis.38
    In Appendix Table A.9 we replicate the baseline event study for the Northern Securities event utilizing
instead cumulative unadjusted returns as the dependent variable, which allows for a larger number of firms
to be included in the analysis. To ensure a minimum level of liquidity, in column (1) we restrict the sample to
those NYSE-traded firms for which we observe common stock prices on at least three of the nine trading days
following, and at least one of the eight trading days prior to, February 19, 1902, (inclusive). The estimated
coefficient is a bit larger in magnitude and slightly less precise; still, the results are remarkably similar to the
cumulative abnormal returns results presented in Table 6. In columns (2) through (5) we restrict the sample to
the 48 firms that we include in our baseline specification, using cumulative unadjusted returns. The estimated
  38
     One firm, American Cotton Oil, is excluded when cumulating from February 20 to February 25 (as shown in
Appendix Table A.8 column [5]) because no shares of this firm’s common stock are traded during the cumulation
period.


                                                        46
effects for firms that engaged in recent mergers are negative and statistically significant, consistent with the
main results presented in Table 6.

A.3.3 Legal History and Measures of Sensitivity to Antitrust Enforcement
Our hypothesis is that McKinley and Roosevelt differed in their stance toward antitrust enforcement. Thus,
we would expect changes in the probability of a transition from President McKinley to Roosevelt to dif-
ferentially affect the market performance of firms that could be subject to antitrust suits, or that could be
differentially affected by new antitrust precedents. A significant challenge for our analysis is to identify
these firms. In this section, we expand the paper’s description of the history of antitrust doctrine to provide
further justification for our variable, which is based on recent merger activity. We also provide evidence that
our analysis is robust to considering alternative indicators based on more modern views of anticompetitive
behavior, such as market concentration.
    Antitrust doctrines were changing rapidly at the turn of the twentieth century. In the 1880s, as industrial
interests organized in large combinations, or “trusts,” state attorneys first used quo warranto suits—legal ac-
tions against a corporation incorporated in the state for violating their charters or engaging in illegal acts—but
trusts sometimes evaded state courts by reincorporating in friendlier states or adopting different organiza-
tional forms. Between 1888 and July 1890, thirteen states passed antitrust statues. These laws typically
included stronger penalties than those later introduced by the Sherman Act, and gave most state courts the
power to effectively terminate a trust in that state by revoking its charter (Troesken, 2000).
    The states’ ability to efficiently restrain “bad” combinations by applying common law and their own
antitrust laws was limited because the constitution gives Congress the authority to regulate interstate com-
merce. In July 1890 Congress passed the first federal antitrust law, the Sherman Act. The act banned any
contract in restraint of trade, but the broad terms of the law allowed sufficient leeway to distinguish between
beneficial forms of cooperation that promoted economic growth and those that suppressed competition (Ko-
vacic and Shapiro, 2000). Which specific practices (such as predatory pricing, price fixing, and many others)
were considered violations of the law was evolving over time as the courts were confronted with interpreting
the Act. The Addyston Pipe decisions by the Court of Appeals (in 1898) and the Supreme Court (in 1899)
helped establish that the Sherman Act would be governed by a rule of reason. In this case, six pipe makers
engaged in bid rigging to guarantee that one of the members in the agreement would win projects adjudi-
cated by municipalities using an auction system. The Court of Appeals stated that if the primary purpose of
an agreement was to restrain trade, then the agreement was invalid under the law, even if the combination
charged reasonable prices. In his opinion, future President Taft argued that the association had acquired the
power to charge unreasonable prices, even if they had yet to do so. In Addyston Pipe and Steel Company
v. United States (175 U.S. 211 [1899]), the Supreme Court further argued that purely private contracts that
directly restrain commerce were in violation of the law. By the time of McKinley’s assassination, the courts’
interpretation of Section I of the Sherman Act made clear that anticompetitive practices that could restrain
trade would be found to be in violation of the law.
    The Act, however, did not seem to prohibit large concentrations of market power per se. In United States
v. E. C. Knight Co. (156 U.S. 1 [1895]), the Supreme Court ruled that a series of mergers that gave the
American Sugar Refining Company (the Sugar Trust) 98% of the nation’s sugar refining capacity did not
constitute interstate commerce, and was therefore not a violation of the Act.
    The Knight case was generally interpreted to hold that it was pointless to attempt to utilize the Sherman
Act against anticompetitive mergers. For example, Attorney General Griggs in his 1899 annual report,
written at the peak of the Great Merger Movement, presented a detailed discussion of the Knight case and
the jurisdictional problems it posed for suits against mergers, and then stated:
      In all instances the Department has been governed only by a sincere desire to enforce the law
      as it exists and to avoid subjecting the Government to useless expense and the law officers

                                                       47
       of the Government to humiliating defeat by bringing actions where there was a clear want of
       jurisdiction.... (Griggs, 1899: 29)

     Given this precedent, it is unlikely that a policy maker concerned with anticompetitive behavior would
attempt to prosecute firms simply because they enjoyed large market shares–though clearly these firms would
have been at risk if they had employed any illegal tactics in protecting their market shares or exploiting them
in other markets.
     Our main strategy is, therefore, to focus on firms that had engaged in mergers in the years prior to the
assassination, as firms that could no longer collude given the interpretation of Section I often chose instead
to merge to be able to preserve monopoly power. The legal history, therefore, validates our choice of focus
on merger activity to identify those firms that may have been perceived to be more likely to suffer dispro-
portionately from stronger enforcement of antitrust rules. In what follows, we further validate our analysis
by showing that our results are robust to including controls for various measures of market concentration.
     Unfortunately, there is no systematic information on the market shares for the individual firms in our
sample at the time of the assassination. Instead, we rely on industry-level measures constructed by Nutter
(1951).39 Appendix Table A.7 replicates the results from Table 3 in the paper but adds as well controls
for market concentration interacted with the relevant event dates. In columns (1) and (2), our measure of
concentration is the percentage of the market controlled by the largest firm, where markets are defined at the
3 and 4 digit SIC codes as in Nutter (1951: Table 37, p 129-141). In columns (3) and (4), we use instead
Nutter’s measure of the ‘relative extent of monopoly’ (Nutter, 1951; Table 39, p 144-147, Table 41, p 151,
Table 9, p 40, and Table 10, p 41). Relative extent of monopoly is defined at the two-digit SIC level as the
percentage of total value-added accounted for by monopolistic industries at the four-digit SIC level, where
monopolistic industries are those in which the four-firm concentration ratio is greater than one half. In both
cases, including our measures of industry concentration does not affect the estimated coefficients for recent
mergers.
     Finally, in columns (5) and (6) we take into account that the inability to collude on rates in the aftermath
of the Sherman Act led some railroads to form ‘communities of interest,’ by which a group of investors either
individually or through a major railroad would take ownership shares or board seats in other railroads to help
coordinate policies. We create an indicator variable for those firms in such a community that were not the
dominant firm. These subordinated firms had likely the most to lose from stronger antitrust enforcement, as
they would otherwise have to compete with the dominant firms in the group. Again our results show that the
inclusion of this variable does not affect our main estimated effects for recent mergers.
     In Appendix Table A.10, we use a similar strategy to investigate the robustness of the estimated effects for
the Northern Securities event study to the inclusion of the three alternative measures of market concentration
and firm coordination. None of these variables have on their own a significant or sizable differential effect
on the cumulative abnormal returns of railroads following the announcement of the suit. Moreover, their
inclusion does not affect our main estimated effects for recent mergers. In combination with the results
presented in Appendix Table A.7, these results suggest that operating in industries where the dominant firms
had large market shares, or utilized common ownership to coordinate policies, was not per se sufficient for
being affected differentially by the changes in policies between the two administrations.
     The case against Northern Securities Corporation that we analyze in the paper indicates the Act was
initially used by Roosevelt’s government to forestall mergers that conferred monopoly power, and that in-

     To establish the industrial code for the manufacturing firms in our sample, we use the code assigned to each of
these firms for the year 1917 by Chandler (1990). When a firm in our sample is not listed by Chandler, we match
the industry description provided in the Moody’s Manuals to the definitions of standardized codes provided by the
U.S. Department of Labor (http://www.osha.gov/pls/imis/sic_manual.html). For firms that Chandler scored, the two
methods produce the same codes.

of recent mergers is a reasonable indicator of the investors’ perception of firms’ differential vulnerability to
changes in antitrust enforcement at the time, we next relate the our measure to firms that were actually pros-
ecuted for antitrust violations. Specifically, we identify the firms in our sample that were defendants in
antitrust cases initiated under Roosevelt. It is important to note that only a small number of firms were sub-
ject to legal action, and that some prominent ones, such as Standard Oil, are not included in our sample due
to the lack of stock price data. For the sample of 134 railroads and industrial firms that traded on the NYSE
after June 1, 1901, and were still listed by the NYT as either active or inactive in September, the likelihood
of actual antitrust prosecution was significantly higher (16.7%) for those firms that we categorized as having
engaged in merger activity, relative to a much lower 5.8% for those firms with no recent mergers (p-value
= 0.072 from univariate regressions with clustered standard errors). The pattern is relatively similar (20.8%
versus 8.3%) for the smaller sample of 48 firms for which we can calculate abnormal returns, though the
difference is no longer statistically significant.

 Notes: This table presents estimates obtained from different versions of Equation (2). We study the effects of the
announcement on February 19, 1902, that an antitrust suit would be filed against the Northern Securities Company.
The dependent variable is abnormal returns cumulated from February 20 to March 1, 1902. Specifications in columns
(1) and (2) include a measure of market share. Specifications in columns (3) and (4) include a measure of market
concentration. Specifications in columns (5) and (6) include an indicator for being a subordinate member of a railroad
community of interest. All regressions also include log capital and log age as controls. Robust standard errors are
reported in parentheses.
 *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.
