                                          ABSTRACT

We examine the effects of aid on growth in cross-sectional and panel data—after correcting for
the possible bias that poorer (or stronger) growth may draw aid contributions to recipient
countries. Even after this correction, we find little robust evidence of a positive (or negative)
relationship between aid inflows into a country and its economic growth. We also find no
evidence that aid works better in better policy or geographical environments, or that certain forms
of aid work better than others. Our findings suggest that for aid to be effective in the future, the
aid apparatus will have to be rethought.

                                         INTRODUCTION

One of the most enduring and important questions in economics is whether foreign aid helps

countries grow. There is a moral imperative to this question: it is a travesty for so many

countries to remain poor if a relatively small transfer of resources from rich countries could

set them on the path to growth. In fact, in the Millennium Declaration adopted in 2000, world

leaders state, “We will spare no effort to free our fellow men, women and children from the

abject and dehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty, to which more than a billion of them

are currently subjected” and they resolve “to grant more generous development assistance,

especially to countries that are genuinely making an effort to apply their resources to poverty

reduction.” As a result, the effort is on to mobilize billions of dollars of aid to help poor

countries, especially those with good policies and institutions.



Yet, the question of whether aid helps poor countries grow in a sustained way is still mired in

controversy. In this paper, we will re-examine (yet again!) whether aid leads to growth. 1




1
    There is a voluminous literature on aid effectiveness, which is very nicely surveyed in

Clemens et. al. (2004). Some key papers, in addition to those cited below, include, Alesina

and Weder (2000), Bauer (1971), Burnside and Dollar (2000), Collier and Dollar (2002),

Dalgaard, Hansen, and Tarp (2004), Friedman (1958), Hansen and Tarp (2000), Roodman

(2004), Svensson (2003), and World Bank (1998). Our reading of this literature, and hence

the rationale for this paper, is that the existing evidence is mixed.
                                             -3-




What does this paper add to the voluminous literature on aid effectiveness? Essentially two

things. First, most papers in the literature examine aid-effectiveness in a typically narrowly

defined setting. We attempt to examine the aid-growth relationship under a variety of

settings, using one common framework. Second, we examine carefully the issue of

endogeneity—the possibility that aid flows could go to countries that are doing particularly

badly, or to countries that are doing well, creating a spurious correlation between aid and

growth.



More specifically, the cross-country aid-growth literature has typically examined particular

aspects of the possible relationship. Burnside and Dollar (2000), for example looked at the

impact of aid on growth conditional on the quality of economic policy. Hansen and Tarp

(2001) examine the relationship in a panel framework, and more recently, Dalgaard, Hansen,

and Tarp (2004) focus on aid’s impact conditional on the country’s location (geography).

Recently, Clemens et. al. (2004) disaggregate aid into what they term short- and long-impact

aid. We examine under one framework, the robustness of the relationship across time

horizons (medium and long run) and periods (1960s through 1990s), sources of aid

(multilateral and bilateral), types of aid (economic, social, food, etc.), timing of impact of aid

(contemporaneous and varying lags (from 10-30 years)), specifications (cross-section and

panel), and samples (including and excluding outliers).



One reason to try and take a more comprehensive perspective is that the aid-growth literature

has sometimes followed a cycle in which one paper finds a result, and is followed by another

paper with a twist, either overturning or qualifying the previous result, followed by another,
                                             -4-




and so on. This has had some undesirable effects on policy with advocates selectively using

results to bolster their preferred view on aid. Thus, our aim is not to target any particular

result or paper. 2 Rather, our approach is to say that if one were starting de novo to examine

the aid-growth relationship and attempting to do it in a comprehensive and transparent

manner, based on a reasonable (but by no means perfect) specification and mindful of the

pitfalls, what would one find. We are, no doubt, informed by the literature about where to

look.



The existing literature also may have gone down some paths that are worth re-examining.

For example, the practice of estimating growth regressions over four year periods is quite

common (see, for example, Burnside and Dollar (2000), Collier and Dollar (2003) and

Clemens et. al. (2004)). Four-year growth regressions are prone to be affected by cyclical

factors, which are hard to control for, even if the attempt is made. Moreover, the issue of key

interest is the long-run impact of aid: aid could mechanically increase output and growth in




2
    This is why we do not attempt an exegesis of individual contributions as in Easterly, Levine

and Roodman (2004), Roodman (2004), or Subramanian and Kumar (2005).
                                               -5-




the short run but this is not what economists care about. 3 If estimations without country fixed

effects are to be done at all, the appropriate horizon is long.

In particular, aid can contribute to development in two ways. It can take a capital starved

country to its ultimate steady state potential growth rate faster. Aid can also improve a

country’s ultimate steady state growth rate (for example, because foreign capital brings

know-how or encourages better governance or practices). Clearly, as we examine longer

horizons, we will incorporate more spillover effects, and effects that take time to emerge.

Since both the positive and adverse effects of aid may stem precisely from these effects (see

Rajan and Subramanian (2005)), it is hard to see how we can escape examining the long run.

No doubt one could debate what “long run” means, which is why we examine different

horizons for the cross-sectional regressions.



But cross-sectional regressions have their well-known problems. Apart from concerns about

endogeneity, outliers, model uncertainty, and measurement error, a key drawback is the

problem of unobservable heterogeneity or the omitted variable problem. In cross-country

regressions, we can never be sure whether we are controlling for all possible ways in which


3
    Short-run growth regressions suffer from the problem of extra “noise” induced by cyclical,

demand-related, factors (see Kraay, 2004). See Hauk and Wacziarg (2004) who argue, based

on Monte Carlo simulations, that taking account of all the advantages and limitations of the

different estimation procedures, the pure cross-section OLS estimator that averages data over

long-periods might be the least inefficient.
                                            -6-




countries might differ. Panel estimations have the virtue of addressing, albeit partially, the

problem of unobservable heterogeneity by incorporating country fixed effects, which means

that we essentially ask whether changes in aid over time for a country contemporaneously

affect its growth (see Hansen and Tarp, 2000). The inclusion of country fixed effects is,

however, not typical in the literature even when the focus is on four year horizons. For the

panel estimations, we report results using the Arellano-Bond and Blundell-Blond GMM

estimators, which address the potential endogeneity of the regressors, and incorporate

(implicitly) fixed effects.



Let us now turn to the second main contribution of the paper. As is well recognized, aid

flows are influenced by a country’s situation. Aid may go to countries that have just

experienced natural disasters—which would explain a negative correlation between aid and

growth. It may also go those who have used it well in the past—implying, if growth is

persistent, there will be a positive correlation between aid and growth. Since neither of these

relationships is causal, it is important to isolate the exogenous component of aid. While a

number of prior studies have attempted to “instrument” aid, we will explain later how our

methodology adds some value.



In sum, despite lying squarely in the tradition of cross-country and panel growth regressions

with all their well-known shortcomings (see Rodrik, 2005), our objective is to lay out in a

transparent and structured manner the different ways of looking at the aid-growth

relationship so that particular claims about it can be evaluated. In some ways, therefore, this

paper is an attempt at encompassing, or generalizing, past work on aid and growth. It seeks to
                                             -7-




answer the question, “even though the cross-country regression framework may be flawed,

what does it really tell us about the impact of aid on growth?”



Our findings are relatively easy to report. We find little evidence of a robust positive

correlation between aid and growth, and this despite the fact that our instrumentation strategy

corrects the bias of conventional (ordinary least squares) estimation procedures against

finding a positive impact of aid. We find little evidence that aid works better in better policy

or institutional environments, or that certain kinds of aid work better than others. We do find

weak (and mixed) evidence that aid works better in some geographical settings, but it is hard

to see a strong rationale for this finding—and therefore are skeptical whether anything can be

generalized from this. Our broad findings hold both in cross-section and panel estimations,

across time horizons, and do not depend on whether outliers are included or excluded from

the sample.



One explanation may simply be that the effects that even the theory would predict are too

small to detect against the background noise, at least using the standard cross-sectional

technique. Certainly, the simple theoretical exercise we present later suggests that the

predicted positive effects of aid inflows on growth are likely to be smaller than suggested by

advocates, even if inflows are utilized well. If noise in the data plagues all findings, then

strong claims about aid effectiveness based on cross-country evidence are unwarranted, and

aid policies that rely on such claims should be re-examined.
                                             -8-




However, the effects of other interventions (such as good policies) on growth are indeed

discernible in the data and are robust. If noise in the data is not the entire explanation for the

lack of a robust finding, the interesting question then is not “whether” but “why?” That is,

what is it that offsets the transfers and subsidized credit inherent in aid and prevents it from

having a robust positive effect on growth? Further research of this kind is essential to

improve aid effectiveness. This is the focus of Rajan and Subramanian (2005), in which we

move beyond the cross-country framework.



This paper is structured as follows. In Section I, we spell out in detail our strategy for

constructing plausibly exogenous instruments for aid, which we use in the subsequent

analyses. In Section II, we use these instruments to revisit the question of aid-effectiveness in

a cross-sectional framework. In Section III, we examine the key issues in a panel context,

using GMM estimation methods. In Section IV, we compare the magnitude of the aid

coefficients derived from theory with those obtained in the empirical literature, and conclude

in Section V.



                I. TACKLING ENDOGENEITY: AN INSTRUMENTATION STRATEGY


We present in Table 1 the basic descriptive statistics for the data we use in our analysis.

Let us start with OLS cross-country regressions in Table 2. The dependent variable in all

cases is the average annual growth rate of per capita GDP of a country over the relevant

period. The explanatory variable of interest is the average ratio of annual external aid to GDP

over that period to that country. Our sample comprises all developing countries which have
                                              -9-




received aid during the post-war period and for which data are available (see Appendix 3).

Because we include all countries that received aid, we do not have any sample selection

biases due to countries dropping out of the sample in later time periods because they have

graduated from aid-recipient status.



The immediate question is what other explanatory variables should we include? The aid and

growth literature includes explanatory variables that are somewhat different from the cross-

country growth literature (see for the example, the contrast between Burnside and Dollar

(2000), Collier and Dollar (2003), Clemens et. al. (2004), Hansen and Tarp (2001), and

Dalgaard, Hansen, and Tarp (2004), on the one hand and Bosworth and Collins (2003),

Sala-i-Martin et. al., 2004, on the other). In the working paper version (Rajan and

Subramanian, 2005), we followed the broader cross-country growth literature. In this paper,

however, we follow the aid and growth literature to enhance the comparability of our results

to the related literature. The results are qualitatively similar.



The next question is which particular explanatory variables to choose because even within

the aid-growth literature there is variation. We chose the four most recently published papers-

-Burnside and Dollar (2000), Collier and Dollar (2003), Hansen and Tarp (2001), and

Dalgaard, Hansen, and Tarp (2004)—and take the intersection set of the variables in these

four papers. This comprises: initial level of per capita income; institutional quality; financial

depth measured as the ratio of M2 to GDP; assassinations; ethnic fractionalization; trade

policy; inflation; and the ratio of budget balance to GDP. We replace assassinations by

revolutions only because the latter appears to be more robustly significant. We then add two
                                             - 10 -




measures that are likely to be important correlates with growth; a measure for geographical

location from Bosworth and Collins (2003) (which is a combination of the average number of

frost days per month in winter and the fraction of a country’s area in the tropics) and a

measure of health (which we proxy for with life expectancy). We stress here that our results

on the aid coefficient are virtually identical even if we don’t add these two covariates: adding

them gives us a more stable and general specification. Note that one difference between our

covariates and the papers cited above is that some of them include a composite policy

measure that combines trade policy, inflation, and budget balance. It seems more general to

include them separately, rather than force a pre-specified relationship. 4



A final concern before we report results. Easterly (2004) makes the argument that many

cross-sectional regression results are driven by outliers. We tested for outliers according to

the Hadi (1992) procedure as implemented in Roodman (2003), using the instrumental

variable specifications, which constitute the core results of the paper. This procedure yielded

two outliers for one time period (1980-00) and none for the other periods. For the sake of

comparability across specifications, throughout the paper we report results for the samples

excluding these two outliers for the period 1980-00.


4
    To minimize endogeneity in the cross-section regressions, the values of the potentially

endogenous explanatory variables are for the beginning of the relevant time period. Details of

how these initial values and other averages over time are constructed are presented in

Appendix 1.
                                            - 11 -




We report OLS results in Table 2 for the following four time periods: 1960-2000; 1970-2000;

1980-2000; and 1990-2000. We therefore cover the long run (40 and 30 year horizons) as

well as the medium term (10 and 20 year-horizons). The differing estimation periods could

also give us a sense of any changes in aid effectiveness over time.



The results are quite clear. In all four cases, the estimated aid coefficient is negative and

statistically significant at conventional levels in three (1960-2000, 1970-2000, and 1980-

2000). The magnitude in these cases suggests that an increase in aid of 1 percentage point of

GDP is correlated with lower long-run growth of approximately 0.1 percentage points per

year.



One cannot take these estimates seriously as evidence of causality because of the problem of

endogeneity. If donors are Good Samaritans and motivated by suffering in the recipient

country, the lower the growth (and the more the suffering), the greater will be the desire to

give aid to alleviate it. Thus there might be a negative correlation between aid and growth but

this does not reflect causation from aid to growth. Conversely, if donors are motivated to

give to successful recipients, one might see a positive correlation between aid and growth,

and this again would not reflect causation from aid to growth.



This problem is well recognized in the literature as is a possible solution, instrumentation, but

the instrumentation strategy typically used has limitations. Take for example, the instrument

sets used in the papers by Burnside and Dollar (2000), Hansen and Tarp (2002) and Clemens

et. al. (2004).

A variable such as arms imports could be a proxy for strategic reasons for giving aid, and

thus is plausibly orthogonal to motives for giving aid that relate to the underlying economic

situation of the recipient. Not all variables are so plausibly exogenous. For variables that are

some transformation of current or lagged endogenous (aid) and possibly exogenous (policy)

variables, the economic motivation is more difficult to understand. Moreover,

econometrically, the problem with using lagged values of endogenous variables is that they

might be predetermined but still not exogenous, especially if there is serial correlation in the
                                             - 13 -




dependent variable. And in all these papers, the possibility of serial correlation is high

because growth is measured over a fairly short interval (i.e., growth today is depressed

because of the same shock that depressed it four years ago, which prompted aid flows four

years ago). 5



More questionable is the use of the lag of a right hand side variable (policy) as an instrument.

This amounts to claiming that contemporaneous policy affects growth directly but lagged

policy does not. For example, the exclusion restriction underlying the use of lagged policy is

that trade reform (and macroeconomic stabilization) in a time period has an important




5
    Assessing the validity of the instrumentation strategy in many of these papers is rendered

difficult by the fact that first-stage results are seldom reported, nor are the exclusion

restrictions discussed. Roodman (2004) only tests the robustness of recent results reported in

a number of papers, but does not discuss endogeneity or instrumentation issues.
                                              - 14 -




effect on growth in that time period (four years in the case of the standard specification in the

literature) but absolutely no effect four years later. 6



It is to address some of these limitations that we attempt a different instrumentation strategy,

where we construct instruments for aid. We exploit the fact that aid is often extended for

non-economic reasons. Our main identification assumption is that non-economically-

motivated aid is unlikely to be driven by economic outcomes. This notion is far from new. A

number of papers have used this to explain aid flows (Alesina and Dollar, 2001; and Barro

and Lee, 2004). But we are not aware of papers that have taken the obvious next step of

exploiting it to systematically develop instruments for aid which could be used in aid-growth

analyses.



Our key idea for instrumentation is to model the supply of aid based on donor-related rather

than recipient-specific characteristics. In other words, we base our instrument on

considerations that drive individual donors to give aid to a country other than those related to

a country’s level of income or growth. So, our construction of instruments starts from the


6
    Put differently, a rationale for not using lagged policy as an instrument is that the process

which generates lagged policy may involve error terms which are correlated with the error

terms on growth in the future. Intuitively it means that countries which experience positive

policy shocks may also be experiencing positive growth shocks 4 years from now (because of

good leadership, for instance).
                                             - 15 -




bilateral (donor-recipient) relationship and aggregates up (as Frankel and Romer (1999) have

done in the trade literature). This is in contrast to the literature that picks instruments directly

at the level of the recipient country.



Start first with how a donor would choose to allocate aid across recipients. If we make the

plausible assumption that in a fair world a donor wants to induce similar growth rates in per

capita incomes of all poor recipients then, provided the technologies of production of

recipients and capital shares are similar, the donor (as we show later in section IV) should

allocate similar amounts of aid (relative to recipient GDP) for each recipient. Of course, most

donors are likely to depart from this allocation for at least two reasons: history and

influence. The greater the extent of historic relationships between a donor and a recipient the

more likely that a donor will want to give aid. We capture historic relationships through

colonial links and commonality of language.



To capture to the effects of influence, we make the plausible assumption that donors are more

likely to want to give aid the more they expect to have influence over the recipient. One way

to proxy for influence is through the relative size of donor and recipient. The bigger the

donor is relative to the recipient, the more influence the donor is likely to have, so the ratio of

the donor population to that of the recipient could be a good proxy for influence. 7 In addition,


7
 The assumption here is that the donor wants influence over the development process in a
country, a perfectly reasonable motive. It may also be that the donor seeks to guide the
political actions of a country (such as its votes in the United Nations). If, however, the donor
wants to bolster its influence over the world, there might be a tradeoff – between acquiring
smaller influence over a larger, and more powerful, developing country, and greater
                                                                                      (continued)
                                            - 16 -




a donor’s influence is likely to be particularly pronounced if it is relatively large when it has

close links with the recipient (so that it not only understands the pathways of influence but

also potentially scares away other donors from seeking influence). We capture this channel

by including the interaction between relative size and colonial links. 8



An example should help fix ideas; the United Kingdom should be willing to give more aid

per capita to Uganda than to India; but it will be more willing to give aid to Uganda than to a

similar-sized country in Africa, say Senegal, because France is likely to have a significant aid

presence in the latter, thus diluting any possibility of British influence.



The aid supply decision from a donor (d) to a recipient (r) can be expressed by the following

model:

influence over a small developing country. If this last motive is important, it would reduce
the importance of our instrument in helping to predict aid flows.
8
  The inclusion of the influence variables is important for generating strong instruments for
aid; the use of historic relationships alone does not yield strong enough instruments.

where Adrt is the aid given by donor d to recipient r in time period t. GDPrt is the recipient

country’s GDP. 9 The first three RHS variables capture historic factors: COMLANG is a

dummy that takes a value of one if the donor and recipient share a common language;

CURCOL is a dummy that takes a value of one if the recipient is currently a colony of the

donor. COMCOL is a dummy that takes a value of one if the recipient was ever a colony of

the donor. The next four variables simply disaggregate the colonial variable to capture

difference across donors in the susceptibility of their giving to colonial ties (COMCOLUK,

COMCOLFRA, COMCOLSPA, and COMCOLPOR refer in turn to colonial relationships

involving respectively France, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom).



The next set of variables relate to relative size. Donor size relative to the recipient is

measured by the ratio of the logarithm of the populations of donor and recipient

( log( POPd / POPr ) ) 10 . Donor influence relative to other donors is additionally measured by




9
    In order to estimate equation 1, we need to compute the country’s total (i.e. bilateral and

multilateral) aid that goes to any particular recipient. To do this, we obtain a decomposition

of multilateral aid into its underlying bilateral constituents. The OECD DAC database

contains a series called “imputed” bilateral aid, which does precisely this.

10
     To minimize endogeneity-related problems, we use the initial rather than the

contemporaneous value of population.
                                             - 18 -




the interaction of the relative population size and the colonial dummy

( log( POPd / POPr ) * COMCOLdr ).



The estimated equation is then aggregated across donors to yield a level of the fitted value of

aid-to-GDP for the recipient for that period.

In Table 3, we present estimates for the model in (1). 11 Virtually all the instrumenting

variables are significant for all the time horizons, and between them the variables account for

a reasonable share (between 33 and 42 percent) of the variation in the donor allocation

decision. All the colonial relationships are significant as are the two measures of influence.

The larger the donor relative to the recipient, the greater the aid given; and this effect is

magnified, as conjectured, in cases where the donor had a colonial relationship with the

recipient. For example, for the period 1960-00, a 1 percent increase in the ratio of donor size

relative to recipient is associated with a 0.1 percent increase in the ratio of aid to GDP given

by the average donor, an amount which is increased by 0.2 percent for a U.K. colony (which


11
     Throughout the paper, instruments vary according to the time horizon of the analysis. For

example, in growth regressions for 1960-2000, we estimate model 1 for the period 1960-

2000; for 1970-2000, the equations are re-estimated for the period 1970-2000; and so on.
                                            - 19 -




is the sum of 0.6 percent for the average colony minus 0.4 percent for the U.K. colony

dummy), 1 percent for a Spanish colony; 1.9 percent for a French colony and 3.3 percent for

a Portuguese colony. Thus, influence seems to matter a lot for donors, especially for Portugal

and France.



How much information about aid is contained in our instrument? In Chart 1, we depict the

first-stage relationship between actual and fitted aid calculated from the estimates of model 1

for the period 1960-00 after partialling out the effects of other covariates included in the first

stage. The relationship between actual and fitted aid is strong, with a t-statistic of about 5.

Our instrument appears to contain a lot of, hopefully exogenous, information about actual

aid.



            II. AID AND GROWTH: REVISITING THE CROSS-SECTION EVIDENCE


In this section, we revisit the cross-country evidence with two aims. First, we examine

whether instrumenting for aid affects the results on aid effectiveness. Second, we explore

if the aid-growth relationship varies across time horizons and periods, sources of aid, types

of aid, episodes of growth, and specifications.



The basic IV results
                                                - 20 -




We now present estimates for the cross-sections presented earlier in Table 2, with the
                                          12
difference that we instrument for aid.         In Tables 4A, we present the second-stage of the

core instrumental variable (IV) specifications, which is representative of the results we obtain

more broadly. The equations are reasonably well specified as many of the standard covariates

are significant and have the expected sign. The coefficient on the aid term is not significantly

different from zero in three of four periods, while it is negative and significant in the period

1990-00. We should not put too much weight on this last result because, as we will see from

later tests, the instrumentation strategy is least reliable for this period.



The magnitudes of the estimated coefficient of aid are generally quite small, suggesting that

aid has a very small effect—positive or negative—on growth. Also, for the first three

columns, instrumenting seems to make the impact of aid less negative or more positive

(compare the aid coefficients columns in Table 2 columns 1-3 with those in Table 4A

columns 1-3). In other words, the IV strategy tempers the tendency of the OLS to magnify

the negative impact of aid. 13


12
     The standard errors are affected by the fact that the instruments are estimated. The standard

error correction we used to estimate the correct standard errors is based on Frankel and

Romer (1999). The results were virtually unaffected by this correction.

13
     As indicated in Table 4B, the coefficient estimate for the instrument is significant at the 1

percent significance level for all estimation periods. In the three long horizons, the F-test for

excluded instruments comfortably exceeds the weak instrumentation threshold of ten

                                                                                        (continued)
                                           - 21 -




Robustness

Let us now turn to possible concerns about our instruments. First, do they satisfy the

exclusion restriction—that is, are they plausibly exogenous? As Durlauf et. al. (2004) point

out growth theory is so broad and all-encompassing that it is always possible to find a story

about why an instrument merits inclusion in the second-stage regression, invalidating

instrumentation. In our framework, the colonial and influence variables may be correlated

with growth other than through the endogenous variable. For example, proximity to donors

(say through a common language) might be bad because donors require bad policies or

support bad leaders or require greater defense-related spending. Alternatively, proximity to

donors might be good because they impose good conditionality. Also, certain colonial

relationships may imply a certain quality of current institutions with impacts on growth. In

each of these cases, the exclusion restriction might not be satisfied. One response to this

concern is that by including measures of policies and institutions we control for the different

ways in which historical variables can affect growth.



A crude way of testing whether our colonial variables pass the exclusion restriction is to

simply include the colonial variables for France, Spain and the United Kingdom directly in

the second stage. When we do this (Table 5A), the magnitudes of the coefficient estimates on

aid are not significantly altered across periods (compare Table 5A and Table 4A) and we do

suggested by Staiger and Stock (1997) for the case of one endogenous regressor. For the

1990_2000 horizon, the F-statistic is about 8.5.
                                             - 22 -




not find a consistent pattern of the colonial variables being significant. This suggests that a

direct relationship between colonial variables and growth is not responsible for our results.



A second check is to see if our instrument passes over-identification tests. For this, of course,

we need a second instrument. As is well-known, it is very difficult to find such instruments,

especially one that is very different from the instrument that we have proposed in this paper.

But to the extent that over-identification tests have merit, a possible candidate is country size;

for example, even if donors did not care about influence, economies of scale (in dealing with

recipients, monitoring programs, etc.) might, a priori, suggest recipient size as a factor

determining aid decisions. Given our use of population as a scaling variable for measuring

influence in our preferred instrument for aid, we use the logarithm of recipient area as the

second instrument. So, we re-run the growth equation, this time using as instruments in the

first stage both our instrument derived from model (1) as well as the log of area. The results

are presented in Tables 5B (second-stage) and Table 5C (first-stage). 14



The first thing to note is that the coefficient on the aid variable is insignificant (Table 5B),

establishing the robustness of the core result. Second, the p-values for the Sargan test for

over-identifying restrictions are greater than 0.1 in three out of four cases, suggesting that our

preferred instrument at least passes these minimum requirements. The over-identification test




14
  When the log of area is used as the sole instrument, it yields good first-stage results (results
available from the authors).
                                              - 23 -




is, however, not met for the 1990-2000 horizon, which is why the IV strategy (and the

negative and significant coefficient) for this period should be viewed with caution.



Third, adding area as an additional instrument serves to shed light on our preferred

instrument. It is interesting to note in the first-stage results (Table 5C) that area is not

significant in the three long horizons while our preferred instrument is. This suggests that our

instrument contains a lot of information over and above that relating simply to recipient

size. 15 Finally, we present in Table 5D, an intuitive way of illustrating the exclusion

restriction (as suggested in Acemoglu et. al., 2001). We estimate the first stage,

instrumenting aid with log area and in the second stage also introduce our preferred

instrument directly. The instrument is insignificant in three out of four cases (and only

marginally significant in the 1990-00 horizon), again suggesting that it has no independent

effect on growth.




15
     While a measure of country size could in itself be a plausible instrument, the reason not to

make it the preferred one is that there is uncertainty whether it can satisfy the exclusion

restriction; that is, a number of reasons can be advanced as to why a recipient’s size would

have an independent effect on growth. Our instrument, on the other hand, contains

information that is not just based on recipient size, and the finding in Table 5C is consistent

with that.
                                            - 24 -




Of course, none of our attempts at addressing endogeneity through instrumentation is fool-

proof. Another, albeit rough way of doing this is simply to use initial or lagged values of aid

instead of instrumenting for contemporaneous values. We do this in Table 6, attempting to be

comprehensive by encompassing all possible timings of impact. Moving across the table are

columns representing the different growth horizons: 1960-00, 1960-90 etc, etc. In all, there

are nine such horizons. Moving down the table, we use different lags for the aid variable. So

the first row represents the impact of aid given in 1960-70 on growth in 1960-70 (column 1),

1970-80 (column 2), and 1960-80 (column 6) and so on. The table thus presents the OLS

estimate for lagged aid in the standard growth regression for different horizons, time periods,

and lags for aid. In no case is the estimated coefficient on lagged aid positive and significant.

Fully 32 of 37 coefficients are negative, of which 11 are statistically significant. Typically,

the estimated coefficient is small (below 0.1 in magnitude). 16



Non-linear and conditional effects

Let us turn to concerns about specification. In Panel A of Table 7, we ask whether there are

diminishing returns to aid. To test this, we include a squared aid term in the regression. All

the aid terms are insignificant as are the aid-squared terms. There is no consistent pattern in

their signs (a negative squared term would imply diminishing returns).



16
  Since the covariates we used in the working paper version were a little different, we
repeated the exercise in Table 6 by including those covariates. Our results are very similar to
what we report here: in particular, in none of the 37 cases is aid significantly positive; in 10
cases, the aid coefficient was negative and significant at the 10 percent level (results
available from the authors upon request).
                                             - 25 -




Burnside and Dollar (2000) and Collier and Dollar (2003) suggest that aid, even if it does not

unconditionally help growth, is helpful in those countries that have good policies and

institutions. In Panel B, we examine whether aid is more effective in better policy

environments. We interact aid with two measures, first, the Sachs-Warner measure updated

by Warcziarg and Welch (2003). We find that the coefficient on the aid-policy interaction

terms is never significant. This is consistent with the results in Easterly, Levine, and

Roodman (2004). We find similar results when we interact aid with the World Bank’s CPIA

ratings.



Recently, Dalgaard et. al. (2004) have argued that aid’s effectiveness depends on geographic

location. In fact, Roodman (2004) concludes after testing the robustness of a number of prior

results on aid effectiveness that “if there is one strong conclusion from this literature, it is

that on average aid works well outside the tropics but not in them.” Though there are

plausible stories for why growth may be higher outside the tropics, the rationale for the

effectiveness of aid outside the tropics (or its ineffectiveness within) is unclear. But in the

absence of a strong theoretical rationale, any such result might simply be an (ex post) way of

characterizing countries where aid has “worked” from countries where it has not, without
                                             - 26 -




offering an explanation. 17 The underlying policy conclusion is also a little bleak because aid

and aid effectiveness are especially important inside the tropics, where most of the poorest

countries are situated.



But does aid conditional on geography show up in the cross-section? In Panel C of Table 6,

in addition to the standard covariates, we introduced a term, interacting aid with the measure

of geography due to Bosworth and Collins (2003). 18 While geography itself usually has a

positive correlation with growth, the aid-geography coefficient is never significant.




17
     Put differently, there will always be a sample of countries where the aid growth correlation

is positive, even if the true average effect is zero or negative. Given that there are many

characteristics by which we can sort countries, it is not hard to find a characteristic that lines

up with the countries for which the correlation is positive. However, it is not clear what

conclusion one can draw from such a finding.

18
     The Bosworth and Collins (2003) geography measure is a combination of the average

number of frost days per month in winter and the fraction of a country’s area in the tropics,

whereas the Dalgaard et. al. (2004) measure is just the latter but the two are highly correlated

(correlation of 0.92 in our sample).

Categories of aid: “Good” and “bad” aid

One of the increasingly popular strands in the aid-growth literature is to examine the impact

of different categories of aid. That is, researchers are moving from analyzing the impact of

aggregate aid to analyzing different components. Four different basis of distinguishing aid

are:

       •   Motives for granting aid (why?)

       •   Donor type (who is granting aid?)

       •   The use to which aid is put (for what: health, social sector, technical assistance?)

       •   The timing of impact (when?)



A general problem with making distinctions between aid categories is fungibility.

Earmarking of aid is not easy, especially for small donors, and even if it is, governments can

divert traditional sources of financing to other uses, undermining the earmarking objectives

of aid (that is for fungibility to be violated, two conditions need to be fulfilled: it should be

possible to earmark aid for particular uses and it should not be possible for the government to

then divert other expenditure that would otherwise have gone to those uses). Devarajan and

Swarup, (1998) present evidence that aid is indeed fungible.



If aid is fungible, then dividing aid into sub categories of “good” and “bad” aid as above is

hard to defend. If a donor wants to encourage a recipient to buy inappropriate irrigation

equipment from its manufacturers in return for the aid, the case must be made that the

recipient simply cannot free any budgetary room as a result of this expenditure (that is, the
                                            - 28 -




expenditure would not have been made by a self interested recipient), and that the

expenditure is a negative net present value one for the recipient, taking into account any grant

elements in the aid. In other words, the recipient has to be complicit for aid to be “bad”.

Otherwise, while the magnitude of the coefficient on aid in explaining growth may be

attenuated, it should be positive.



Thus fungibility implies that how well aid gets translated into growth may not depend on the

specific purpose aid is given for, or the intent behind it, but how well the recipient translates

all expenditure to growth. The quality of the recipient--its policies and institutions—is thus a

good indicator, albeit not a full determinant, of the recipient’s ability and willingness to use

aid. This implies that some recent papers (see Bourgingnon and Sundberg (2007), for

example) that dismiss strategic aid as “bad” aid, and thus emphasize there should be no prior

expectation of beneficial effects from that kind of aid, are perhaps excessively harsh towards

strategic aid. To characterize strategic aid as “bad” aid is mixing motives and consequences.

Indeed, for strategic aid to be “bad” aid (as in badly used aid leading necessarily to bad

growth outcomes) two things would have to be shown; First, that strategic aid is

systematically given to countries with bad policies or institutions; Second, it would also have

to be shown that in some way researchers are not taking into account the effect of these bad

policies and institutions that mediate aid into outcomes.



The second factor is relatively easy to dispose because typically, most growth regression

control for a host of policies and institutions—macroeconomic, structural, openness and

property rights etc.—that potentially affect growth. In other words, our regressions suggest
                                            - 29 -




that aid has no systematic effect even after controlling for any effect of strategic aid on

policies and institutions.19



On the first point, it should be noted just as an empirical matter, that while aid was given for

strategic reasons to Mobuto in Zaire and Marcos in the Philippines and to Egypt, it was also

given to Suharto in Indonesia, Pinochet in Chile, military regimes in Korea and Israel, all of

which seem to have flourished. Equally, a lot of well-intentioned aid was given by the Nordic

donors to Tanzania, Ghana, Kenya and a host of other African countries that do not seem to

have grown strongly. Thus strategic aid is not synonymous with badly used aid.




Another way of checking whether our instrument for aid proxies for “bad” aid is to see if the

variables that we used to explain total aid also help explain “good” aid. Appendix Table 1

reproduces the estimation in Table 3 but this time with bilateral social aid as the dependent

variable (and social aid is typically thought of as “good” aid). It is remarkable how similar

the two equations: all the variables have the same sign and significance (although the

magnitudes of the coefficients vary) and both equations explain a similar share of variation.

We now proceed to the other distinctions.




19
   Policies and institutions may not be sufficient conditions for determining the aid-to-growth
transmission mechanism and hence the growth specifications could be missing a variable that
can capture the other determinants. But it is hard to see how the motives for giving aid
(strategic aid) or donor type can possibly proxy for this omitted variable.
                                              - 30 -




A second basis for distinguishing “good” or development aid is by type of donor. Reddy and

Minoiu (2006) argue that aid given by a set of countries—mostly Scandinavian—is good aid,

or better than that given by others and they similarly argue that multilateral aid is better than

bilateral aid. 20 We test these propositions. One can indeed make the argument that

multilateral aid is less explicitly “political” than bilateral aid and should therefore have a

different, and presumably more favorable, impact. The argument for a possible differential

impact between multilateral and bilateral aid could also relate to the type of aid given or to

the nature and effectiveness of conditionality. But we find no difference between the effects

of multilateral and bilateral aid (Table 8A); both sets of coefficients are insignificant. We

also ran the specifications in Table 6, using another Reddy and Miniou definition of good

donors (both the top 5 and the top 10). As can be seen from Table 8B (aid is that from the top

5 donors), in only 13 of 37 cases is the aid coefficient positive, and in only one is it

significant at conventional levels. 24 of 37 coefficients are negative, and significant in 3

cases. If anything, even after a careful selection of donors, the weight of evidence is towards

a slight negative effect of aid. 21


20
     One additional problem of distinguishing aid simply by donor type is that it is then difficult

to understand why one should expect similar consequences if it is given to two very different

types of policy regimes. Why should aid by Norway to Tanzania produce the same result as

aid by Norway to Zaire under Mobutu?

21
     We estimate these using OLS because there is no variation for the top 5 donors in historic

and language links. The results are similar when we use the top 10 good donors.
                                             - 31 -




The third basis for distinguishing aid is by purpose. This basis is particularly prone to the

fungibility/earmarking problem. If donors cannot individually or collectively alter the plans

and priorities of recipient governments, then it is hard to justify slicing aid. 22 In Table 8C, we

try to see if two different categories—aid for social uses and aid for economic uses have

significant positive effects. 23 This does not turn out to be the case.



Finally, Clemens et. al. (2004) claim that aid needs to be distinguished by the timing of its

impact—early versus late impact. Clemens et. al (2004) argues that the effect of early-impact

aid will be easier to detect in the data than late-impact aid. Subramanian and Kumar (2005)

contain a critique of their framework and findings. We re-run our specifications using their




22
     One category of aid that might avoid the fungibility problem is technical assistance

because of the manner in which it is provided: essentially, donors pay foreign consultants to

provide some service to recipient governments. But technical assistance too does not seem to

have any impact on growth either.

23
     The categories come from the OECD’s DEC database that provides data on ODA

commitments by purpose (CRS). Social sector aid includes education, health and population,

and water supply and sanitation; and economic aid includes energy and transport and

communications.
                                             - 32 -




aid categories and find that there is no significant effect (Table 8D). 24 In fact, our result in

Tables 6 and 8B where we estimate the impact of aid over different lags (and hence is a more

general test) also bears on the point made by Clemens et. al. (2004) about the timing of aid’s

impact. We see in these tables that regardless of when aid’s impact can be thought to be felt,

there seems little evidence that aid affects growth.



In general, what we find, however, is that no sub-categories have any significant impact—

positive or negative—on growth. There is, however, a more general concern with slicing and

dicing up aid; it could become a fishing expedition where the researcher hunts for any sub

category that has a positive (or negative) correlation with growth, and then finds an (ex-post)

rationale to focus on that sub-category, depending on the researcher’s biases. This is why the


24
     We need to instrument for early impact and late impact aid. In the Clemens et. al. (2004)

categorization, the former contains many of the economic aid categories and the latter the

social aid categories. So in our specifications that use the Clemens et. al. (2004) variables, we

instrument for early impact aid with our instrument for economic aid and for late impact aid

with the instrument for social aid. Recall that our instrument for economic aid is derived by

running an equation explaining bilateral economic aid flows between donors and recipients

(as we did for bilateral total aid in Table 3). We then constructed a series for fitted economic

aid by aggregating across donors for each recipient. Similarly, we develop the instrument for

social aid. The first-stage results (available from the authors upon request) show that these

instruments work well.
                                              - 33 -




a priori theoretical rationale for focusing on a particular sub-category is important.

Unfortunately, fungibility renders most such rationales suspect.



                   III. AID AND GROWTH: REVISITING THE PANEL EVIDENCE


In this section, we revisit the aid-growth evidence based on panel estimations. Much of the

literature, with the exception of Hansen and Tarp (2002) and Dalgaard, Hansen and Tarp

(2004), employs either OLS or 2-stage least squares estimations procedures without fixed

effects.



An alternative approach that addresses the potential endogeneity of all the regressors and also

incorporates fixed effects is to use panel GMM regressions. 25 These come in two flavors.

There is the difference-GMM estimator due to Arellano and Bond (AB, 1991) and the

system-GMM estimator due to Blundell and Bond (BB, 1998). In both, identification relies

on first-differencing and using lagged values of the endogenous variables as instruments.




25
     It is important to stress that fixed effects are not a panacea and come with their own

problems: first, they do not help inference if there are time-varying omitted factors affecting

the dependent variable and correlated with the right hand side variables. They may also

exacerbate measurement error by removing a significant portion of the variation in the right

hand side variables.

In the AB estimator, lagged levels are used to instrument for the differenced right hand side

variables, whereas in the BB estimator the estimated system comprises the difference

equation instrumented with lagged levels as in the AB estimator as well as the level equation,

which is estimated using lagged differences as instruments. Each estimator has its limitations.

The AB estimator often leads to a weak instruments problem because lagged levels are

typically not highly correlated with their differenced counterparts. On the other hand, the

BB estimator generates large upward biases in the right-hand side variables (see Hauk and

Wacziarg, 2004). The BB estimator has another deficiency: the instruments for the level

equation, namely the lagged differences of the RHS variables, are valid only if they are

orthogonal to the fixed effect. Given neither estimator is perfect, we report the results using

both procedures.



In Tables 9 and 10, we report the results of the GMM estimations corresponding to the core

specifications in Tables 4 and Tables 7A-7C (the specifications in Table 9 use the Arellano-

Bond procedure while those in Table 10 use the Blundell-Bond procedure). In all these

specifications, we report the results of using the unrestricted lags of all the endogenous

variables as instruments. The results do not change when we use fewer lags (available from

the authors).



The results are easy to summarize. In all the GMM specifications, which we would

emphasize are really fixed effects panel versions of the cross-section regressions reported in

tables 4 and 7, the results on aid remain broadly unchanged. In column 1 of Tables 9 and 10,

we report the core specification corresponding to Table 4. In column 2, we test whether there
                                             - 35 -




are diminishing returns by adding the squared aid term (compare with Table 7, Panel A).

Column 3 is the counterpart of Table 7, Panel B, which tests whether aid works better in

better policy environments. Finally, in column 4 the aid-geography interaction is examined

(compare with Panel C of Table 7). In no case, does aid have a positive and significant effect

(the coefficient is negative and significant in Table 9, column 1 and in Table 10, column 4).

There is no evidence of aid working in better policy environments (see the coefficients of the

interaction between aid and policy in column 3 of Tables 9 and 10). There is some evidence

for aid working better in better geographic environments using the AB estimate (Table 9,

column 4) but the sign of the coefficient estimate for the aid-geography interaction is

reversed (and significant) in the system GMM BB estimate in Table 10. 26



In Appendix Tables 2 and 3, corresponding respectively to the AB and BB procedures, we

examine the impact of different categories of aid as in Table 8. Only early impact aid is

significant at the 10 percent level (and it has diminishing effectiveness as suggested by the

negative coefficient for the squared term). However, in the system GMM BB estimates in

Appendix Table 3, the signs of the coefficient estimates are reversed, and they are no longer

significant. It is hard to argue that even in the panel estimates, there is a robust effect of aid

on growth.




26
  We ran all the regressions in Tables 9 and 10 using one-period lagged aid instead of using
contemporaneous values. In all cases, the aid-GDP coefficient was insignificant (results
available from the authors upon request).

                 IV. QUANTITATIVE IMPACT OF AID: THEORY AND EMPIRICS


What should one expect? Suppose the primary channel through which aid worked was by

increasing public investment. 27 What then would be the quantitative impact on growth? A

theoretical estimate of this impact can be obtained from a simple growth model. This model

yields the conclusion that, even under the most optimistic assumptions about the use of aid

(optimistic in the sense that all aid is invested and none of it is wasted or consumed), the

impact of aid should be positive but relatively small in magnitude.



Specifically, the relationship between aid inflows and growth is captured by the following

equation (see Appendix 2 for details):



                                         δγ y             Y
                                                   = αβ
                                           Aid            K
                                      δ(       )
                                            Y



where γy is the rate of growth of output per worker, Aid/Y is the ratio of aid to GDP, α is

capital share in income, β is the fraction of aid that is invested, and Y/K is the output capital

ratio (Y/K). Assuming that all aid is invested (β =1), and using a value of capital share in

income of 0.35 computed by Bosworth and Collins (2003), and a value of 0.45 for the



27
     Of course, aid by financing schooling and increasing human capital accumulation could

also lead to total factor productivity growth. We discuss this channel below.
                                             - 37 -




output-capital ratio for the average developing country in our regression sample, the

magnitude of the regression coefficient suggested by theory is 0.16; that is, a 1 percentage

point increase in the ratio of aid to GDP should at most raise the long-run growth rate by

0.16 percent, even on the most optimistic assumption that all aid is usefully invested. More

realistically, if half of all aid is wasted or consumed, the coefficient value should be close to

0.1. Of course, if the public investment financed by aid has some spillover effects and hence

an effect on productivity growth, the impact of aid could be slightly higher.



It is worth noting here that the coefficients on aid should be close to those on investment.

Barro and Martin (1995, Chapter 12), in summarizing the cross-section growth estimates,

suggest that a plausible coefficient on the investment to GDP ratio is about 0.03, that is a 1

percentage point increase in the ratio of investment to GDP should increase per capita growth

rate by 0.03 percent, even less than the (crude) theoretical estimate of 0.1 that we derive. In

sum, even in theory – unless one postulates significant non-linearities in the relationship

between investment and growth – it is unlikely that resources for investment by themselves,

no matter how well used, will lead to substantial increases in growth, unless accompanied by

policies that increase total factor productivity.

                                 V. CONCLUDING REMARKS


This paper had a simple objective: to present in one place and using one framework results

on the different aspects of the aid-growth relationship and to do so both in cross-section and

panel contexts and by addressing the problem of the endogeneity of aid.



Our central conclusion is there is no robust positive relationship between aid and growth in

the cross-section, and this despite the fact that our instrumentation strategy corrects for the

bias in conventional (ordinary least squares) estimation procedures of finding a negative

impact of aid on growth. This conclusion holds across:



   •   time horizons;

   •   time periods;

   •   cross-section and panel contexts

   •   types of aid distinguished by:

           o what it is used for (economic, social, food, etc.);

           o who gives it (multilateral donors, bilateral donors, good donors and others);

           o who it is given to (those with good policies and institutions and others);

           o who it is given to (those in the tropics and outside); and

           o how long it takes to have effect (contemporaneous versus lagged ).



In sum, we find that it is difficult to discern any systematic effect of aid on growth.

One implication may simply be that the entire enterprise of running cross-country growth

regressions may be plagued by noise in the data, which makes it hard to establish any

relationship even if they actually exist. This possibility is strengthened by a simple

theoretical exercise, which suggests that the effects of aid, even if well utilized, on growth

are likely to be positive but much smaller than suggested by previous studies. If noise in the

data plague all findings, then strong claims about aid effectiveness (or equally, on aid

ineffectiveness) based on cross-country evidence are unwarranted, and aid policies that rely

on such claims should be re-examined.



If noise is not the entire explanation (there are robust findings in the cross-country growth

literature, such as the importance of institutions and policies for growth), one has to ask what

aspects of aid offset what must be the indisputable growth enhancing effects of resource

transfers. We then have to move away from the traditional cross-sectional analysis, and focus

on more direct evidence of the channels through which aid might help or hinder growth. Such

further research is essential to improve aid effectiveness. We attempt some answers in Rajan

and Subramanian (2005).

All standard errors are robust and reported below coefficient estimates. ***, **, and * denote significance at 1,

5, and 10 percent, respectively. All specifications include dummies for sub-Saharan African and East Asian

countries. For descriptions of the variables and their sources, see Appendix 1. The sample decreases for the

1980-00 and 1990-00 time periods because data on budget balance becomes sparser for the 1980s and 1990s, so

the initial value of budget balance cannot be computed for these periods. Outliers are excluded based on the

Hadi (1992) procedure on the core IV specification in Table 4, which results in two countries being dropped

from the 1980-00 horizon in all the results that are presented.

All standard errors are robust and reported below coefficient estimates. ***, **, and * denote significance at 1,

5, and 10 percent, respectively. All specifications include dummies for sub-Saharan African and East Asian

countries. The instrument for aid corresponds to that in (1) and (2) in Section II of the paper. All specifications

include dummies for sub-Saharan African and East Asian countries. Other covariates in the first-stage

regression are omitted for presentational convenience. Throughout the paper, the values of the potentially

endogenous covariates are for the beginning of the relevant time period (or strictly speaking the first available

value closest to the initial year of the relevant time period). Outliers are excluded based on the Hadi (1992)

procedure. For descriptions of the variables and their sources, see Appendix 1.

     Appendix 3. Prediction of the Standard Growth Model of the Quantitative Impact of

                                               Aid 28

In this appendix we derive a theoretical estimate of the impact of aid on growth based on the

standard Solow-Swan Growth model. The model assumes that a fraction of aid goes toward

financing public investment, which has an impact on long-run growth via capital

accumulation.

                                         Y = AK α L1−α                                        (1)

Equation 1 is a simple Cobb-Douglas production function, with α representing the share of

capital in income, and A the technology parameter. In per worker terms, equation 1 can be

re-written as:

                                            y = Ak α

Where y = Y/L and k = K/L



The equation for capital accumulation is:

                             .
                             K =I − δ ( K ) =Ig + Ip − δ ( Kp + Kg )                          (2)

where the subscripts refer to the private and government sectors, and δ the depreciation rate.

Assuming that a fraction β of aid is invested by the government, with the rest representing

consumption or waste, equation (2) can be re-written as:

                                    .
                                   = β Aid + Ip − δ K and
                                   K

The rate of growth of output per worker γy can be expressed in terms of the rate of growth of

capital stock per worker:

                                                  .            .   .
                                             y   k A
                                          γ=
                                           y = α( + )                                           (4)
                                             y   k A

Substituting equation (3) in (4) yields

                                                                              .
                                     Iβ Aid                A
                          γ y α(
                          =         + P ) − α (n + δ ) + α                                      (5)

The coefficient in cross-country growth regressions measures the change in growth with

respect to the change in the ratio of aid to GDP. We need to convert equation (5) into one

that expresses aid in terms of GDP on the right hand-side. Thus (5) can be re-written as:

                                                                                  .
                                αβ Aid Y              α IP        A
                       =γy                   +   − α (n + δ ) + α                               (6)
                                      Y     K kL                  A

Differentiating equation (6) with respect to aid-to-GDP yields:



                                             δγ y                  Y
                                                           = αβ                                 (7)
                                              Aid                  K
                                           δ(     )
                                               Y

Equation 7 implies that the coefficient of aid in a cross-country growth regression should be

related to the capital share in income (α), the fraction of aid that is invested (β), and the

output capital ratio (Y/K).
                                             - 62 -




Assuming that all aid is invested (β =1), and using a value of capital share =0.35 computed

by Bosworth and Collins (2003), and the average value of the output-capital ratio for the

developing countries in our regressions sample which is about 0.45, the magnitude of the

regression coefficient amounts to 0.16; that is, a 1 percentage point increase in the ratio of aid

to GDP should raise the growth rate by 0.16 percent, even on the most optimistic assumption

that all aid is usefully invested. More realistically, if half of all aid is wasted or consumed,

the coefficient value should be 0.08 or close to 0.1.



It is possible that equation 7 underestimates the value of aid because it ignores the fact that

the public investment financed by aid has spillovers and hence economy-wide productivity

impacts. Incorporating this would yield the following variant of equation 7:

                                                        .
                                   δγ y   Y δ ( A/ A)
                                    = αβ +                                                      (7)’
                                    Aid   K δ ( Aid )
                                 δ(     )
                                     Y           Y

The last term on the right hand side captures the effect of aid on productivity growth. It is

difficult to know whether and to what extent public investment has had such productivity

impacts in aid-receiving countries. The IT revolution in the US since the mid-1990s added

about 0.5 percent per year to productivity growth. Extrapolating from this, it seems that an

upper limit for the impact of aid on growth would be about 0.2-0.25 percent per year for

every 1 percentage point increase in the received aid to GDP ratio.
