       Economists attempting to explain the widening of the black-white wage gap in the late
1970's by differences in school quality have been faced with the problem that recent data reveal
virtually no gap in the quality of schools attended by blacks and whites using a variety of
measures. In this paper, we reexamine racial differences in school quality. We begin by
considering the effects of using the pupil-teacher ratio, rather than the school's average class size,
in an education production function since the pupil-teacher ratio is a rough proxy, at best.
Second, we consider the importance of using actual class size rather than school-level measures
of class size.
        We find that while the pupil-teacher ratio and average class size are correlated, the pupil-
teacher ratio is systematically less than or equal to the average class size. Mathematically, part
of the difference is due to the intraschool allocation of teachers to classes. As a result, while the
pupil-teacher ratio suggests no black-white differences in class size, measures of the school's
average class size suggest that blacks are in larger classes. Further, the two measures result in
differing estimates of the importance of class size in an education production function. We also
conclude that school level measures may obscure important within-school variation in class size
due to the small class sizes for compensatory education. Since black students are more likely
to be assigned to compensatory education classes, a kind of aggregation bias results. We find
that not only are blacks in schools with larger average class sizes, but they are also in larger
classes within schools, conditional on class type. The intraschool class size patterns suggest that
using within-school variation in education production functions is not a perfect solution to
aggregation problems because of non-random assignment of students to classes of differing sizes.
However, once the selection problem has been addressed, it appears that smaller classes at the
eighth grade lead to larger test score gains from eighth to tenth grade and that differences in class
size can explain approximately 15 percent of the black-white difference in educational
achievement.

I       Introduction

        For decades before the 1970's the difference in the average wages for black and white workers

had been decreasing, but in the mid-1970's this trend slowed and then reversed. Authors such as Smith

and Welch (1989), and Juhn. Murphy, and Pierce (1991) have suggested that the lower quality of

schooling for black students relative to white students may account for lower acquired skills of black

workers,   If the price of skills then increases, the gap in wages for blacks and whites will widen.

However, most national data, such as the Common Core of Data Surveys, the High School and Beyond,

and the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972, report no discemable difference

in the quality of schools attended by blacks and whites.' For example, in the Common Core the mean

pupil-teacher ratio in schools attended by blacks, whites, and hispanics is 18.16, 18.36, and 20.33,

respectively (Boozer. Krueger, Wolkon (1992))2. It is only in more "exotic" measures of school quality,

such as levels of computer usage, that differences between the races begin to appear

        In this paper, we re-examine racial differences in school quality. In order for school quality to

explain the black-white gap in achievement two relationships must hold: black students must attend

schools of inferior school quality, and school quality must matter for achievement. We look for this

pattern and implication in two ways. First, we consider the effects of using the pupil-teacher ratio. rather

than the school's average class size, in an education production function since most researchers, lacking

data on actual class size, use the pupil-teacher ratio, and because most admit that it is a rough proxy, at

best. Second, we consider the importance of using actual class size rather than school-level measures of

class size in an education production function.




      For example, see Boozer (1992), Boozer, Krueger, Wolkon (1992), and Grogger (1994). It is
important to note that we only address one component of school quality, namely class size. These papers
also report there are no discernable differences in other measures, such as teacher quality.

    2 The larger pupil-teacher ratio for hispanics is largely attributable to the fact that they reside in the
West where class sizes are larger.
                                                                                                            2

        We find that while the pupil-teacher ratio and average class size are correlated, the pupil-teacher

ratio is systematically less than or equal to the average class size. Mathematically, part of the difference

is due to the intraschool allocation of teachers to classes. As a result, while the pupil-teacher ratio

suggests no black-white differences in class size, measures of the school's average class size indicate that

blacks are in larger classes. Further, the two measures result in differing estimates of the importance of

class size in an education production function. We also find that the pupil-teacher ratio obscures important

within-school variation in class size due to the small class sizes for compensatory education.3 Since black

students are more likely to be assigned to compensatory education classes, a kind of aggregation bias

results. We find that black students are in schools with larger average class sizes and are in larger classes

within schools, as well, conditional on class type.

         Our results have important implications for estimating education production functions in general,

and black-white gaps in achievement or labor market outcomes in particular. Within-school class size

patterns indicate that using within-school variation in production functions is not a perfect solution to

aggregation problems because of non-random assignment of students to classes of differing sizes.

 However, once the selection problem has been addressed, it appears that smaller classes in         grade lead

 to larger test score gains and that differences in class size can potentially explain approximately 15 percent

 of the black-white difference in the gain in test score between gth and 10" grade. Our results also suggest

 that a class size intervention at a later grade would have a smaller effect, at least in terms of black-white

 differences, a result perhaps due to relatively greater drop out activity by black students relative to white




      In this paper, we use the term "compensatory education" to refer to special (or special needs),
 remedial, and bilingual education. "Special Needs" refers to classes for students with disabilities. The
 categories includestudents who are: hard of hearing, mentally retarded, multihandicapped, orthopedically
 and/or other health impaired, seriously emotionally disturbed, specific learning disability, speech impaired,
 and visually handicapped (Staff to Student Ratios: Class Size/Caseload, 1986). Remedial education is
 designed to compensate for past economic or environmental deficiencies, and bilingual education to
 facilitate the learning of English.

students. And, we find that a smaller class size at    or 10th grade would have no discernable impact on

subsequent dropout rates from high school.

        The next section of the paper describes the data, sections three and four consider the patterns and

implications of using the school's average class size or actual class size in education production functions,

section five considers the implications for the black-white difference in school achievement, and section

six concludes.




II.     The Data

        In order to examine the importance of intraschool variation in classes, we need data that measure

the overall pupil-teacher ratio, average class size, and individual class sizes within schools. We therefore

rely on two data sets: a survey of teachers that we conducted in New Jersey and the National

Longitudinal Survey of 1988 (NELS).



        The New Jersey Survey of Teachers

        Much of our descriptive data come from a telephone survey of a random sample of 500 teachers

in NJ that we conducted in June, 1994. We asked the te?chers about the sizes of their classes, the average

class size in the school, the numbers of students and teachers in the school, and the racial compositions

of both their classes and of the school.4 We also asked the teachers for the name, district, and county of

their school in order to merge these data with data from the NJ Department of Education and the Common

Core. In all, the surveyed teachers and their schools appear representative of teachers and schools in the

state. (See Tables 1 and 2 in the Data Appendix for the mean characteristics of teachers in the NJ Survey

and all classroom teachers in New Jersey and the mean characteristics of the schools in the NJ Survey

compared to the mean characteristics of all schools in New Jersey.)



      The survey instrument is available from the authors upon request.
                                                                                                        4
       We merge these data with data from the Common Core of Data Surveys and the New Jersey

Department of Education. The Common Core is a national survey of schools that provides information

on the racial composition of most schools in the U.S., as well as the student enrollment figures and the

number of full-time equivalent instructional staff (FTE's) from which we can construct a pupil-teacher

ratio. The data from the NJ Department of Education's administrative records are individual data on all

certificated teachers in New Jersey.5 The data identify each teacher's school and class subject. We also

have the total enrollment and the racial composition for each school in New Jersey as of October, 1992.




        The National Education Longitudinal Survey of 1988 (NELS)

        The NELS is a national, stratified sample of eighth-graders in 1988 who were followed-up in 1990

and 1992. In addition to surveying the students, the U.S. Department of Education also surveyed school

administrators (creating the schools survey) and two teachers (each of whom taught from one of the four

main academic subject areas: mathematics, science, reading, and history) for each student in the survey.

These teachers were asked questions about the student's class, including the class size. Because

approximately 20 students were sampled within each school, we can use these data to estimate school level

averages for measures not provided by the school survey. Further, since students were given tests in each

year in history, math, reading, and science, we can create student-class records in which we match the

class size with the test score gain for that particular subject.




      The data are from the 1992-1993 school year, the most recent year for which we have been able
to obtain data. We thank Howard Bookin of the NJ Department of Education for making these data
available to us.
                                                                                                           5

        We use two basic samples.6 To study the first follow-up (10th grade) outcomes, we use a sample

that includes public school students with complete data who participated in both the base year and first

follow-up surveys, resulting in 20.131 observationswhich comprises 10,499 individualsfrom 751 schools.

To model the second follow-up (12th grade) outcomes, we include public school students who participated

in all three waves resulting in 10,369 observations comprised of 6,692 students from 698 schools. We

use the appropriate first or second follow-up panel weights supplied on the NELS data. The means of

our basic samples are in Appendix Table 1.1




III.    The Pupil-Teacher Ratio vs. Average Class Size

         We begin by considering whether previous researchers have found no difference in black and

white school quality because they have used the pupil-teacher ratio, rather than the school's average class

size in the education production function. Figures Ia and lb illustrate that the pupil-teacher ratio and the

school's average class size, while correlated, may reflect different aspects of the school's teaching

resources.' Figure Ia graphs the average class size and the pupil-teacher ratio against the percentage of



      We use slightly different samples when studying drop-out behavior since students who had dropped-
out were disproportionately likely to be missing class sizes and test scores, and since we averaged the class
sizes and test scores resulting in only one observation per student. The means of these samples are
available from the authors upon request.

    The sample size as of the second follow-up is about one-half the size as of the first follow-up,
because we do not require that all students in the first follow-up also be participants in the second.
Further, not all students continued to be enrolled in the same (two) subjects in the 10th grade as they were
in the 8th grade, a requirement for our second follow-up analysis. Comparing the (appropriately) weighted
means of region, race, and family income variables in the two follow-ups to the (weighted) initial base
year sample reveals that the panel weights aid in reducing the non-comparability of results from the
different follow-ups. That said, when we restrict the sample used in the analysis of test score outcomes
in the first follow-up to members in the second follow-up, we find a different result in one of the four
cases, as we report in Appendix Table 3. Thus, we are somewhat worried about the large amount of
attrition from the sample as of the second follow-up, and tend to have relatively more confidence in the
first follow-up results than the second follow-up results.

     'The correlation between the pupil-teacher ratio and the average class size is relatively low at 0.13
in the NJ Survey, and 0.26 in the NELS.

the school's enrollment that is black using the NELS data. Figure lb graphs the average class size and

the pupil-teacher ratio against the school size, also using the NELS. In Figure Ia. the pupil-teacher ratio

is uniformly smaller than the average class size and the lines diverge slightly as the percentage of students

in the school increases.9 Note that the divergence appears primarily driven by the extremes in the racial

composition distribution. The two measures widen as school size increases in Figure lb.

        One potential explanation for these patterns comes from the mechanical relationship between the

two measures.'Â° One can describe the relationship by taking a Taylor series expansion of average class

size around its mean, and then taking expectations of both sides to get:

                                                           02(7)
                                     E(CS)5=PT,{1+                  +R}                                  (1)
                                                          (E(1))2


where E(CS), is the average class size for school s, PT is the pupil-teacher ratio of school s, &(T), is the

variance of the number of teacher per class within school s, T is the number of teachers assigned to each

class, and R is a remainder term.

        The average class size will be greater than or equal to the pupil-teacher ratio, and the two

measures will diverge as the variance in how teachers are distributed across classes within schools

increases. If there is only one teacher per class in a school, the pupil-teacher ratio will equal the class

size, if only classroom teachers are included in the pupil-teacher ratio. On the other hand, if some of the



      Other researchers having access to both pupil-teacher ratios and average class sizes have noted that
the average class size is larger than the pupil-teacher ratio (Blinder (forthcoming), Flyer and Rosen
(1994)). For example, in the NELS the average class size is 24 compared to an average pupil-teacher
ratio of 18. However, this, alone, need not mean that the pupil-teacher ratio captures a different
dimension of school quality than the average class size. Even if the pupil-teacher ratio is constructed with
only classroom teachers, the average class size will be greater than or equal to the pupil-teacher ratio by
Jensen's Inequality; see equation (1).

     tO It is also possible that measures of the pupil-teacher ratio in national data mis-represent average
class size because either the number of students or teachers are mis-counted. We have explored this
possibility to some extent and found evidence that the number of teachers may be inflated, perhaps due
to the inclusion of "non-regular" teachers among the teaching staff.
                                                                                                              7

classes are team taught and others are not, the average class size will diverge from the pupil-teacher ratio.

One factor that contributes to such variation is the number of remedial and special education classes since

they are more likely to be taught by more than one teacher." If classes are more likely to be team taught

in predominately black schools, thereby increasing the variance of teachers within the schools, then the

pupil-teacher ratio will diverge from the average class size more in black schools than in white schools.'2




Patterns and Implications

        To determine if the pupil-teacher ratio gives a different description of school class size than does

the average class size, we regressed the pupil-teacher ratio and average class size on the racial composition

of the school using the three data sets on schools in New Jersey and the NELS data for base year schools

in the northeast only.'3 The results are in Table I. Regression coefficients using the Common Core, the

NJ Department of Education, and the NELS data suggest that blacks and hispanics are in schools with

marginally smaller pupil-teacher ratios, although these differences are not statistically significant at

conventional levels. In the NJ Survey, we find that blacks and hispanics are in schools with marginally

larger pupil-teacher ratios, although again the differences are not significant. Thus, according to the pupil-

teacher ratio, blacks and hispanics do not attend schools of inferior quality. The conclusion reverses for

the average class size. En both surveys, blacks attend schools with larger average class sizes. The

magnitudes of the coefficients are remarkably similar between the two surveys and the coefficient

estimates are statistically significant. The results for hispanics are mixed. In the NJ Survey, it appears




     " Authors' calculations from the NJ Survey.

    12 It is not clear which measure better reflects the resources of the school. A class of 30 students with
two teachers may not be so different from a class with 15 students and one teacher.

    ' For the school level analyses we only use the base-year school information since the first and
second follow-up schools are not a random sample of schools (National Education Longitudinal Study
of 1988. Second Follow-Up: School Component Data File User's Manual (1994)).

that hispanics attend schools with larger classes while in the NELS the coefficient is positive, but

insignificant.

        We further assess the effects of using the pupil-teacher ratio rather than the average class size in

an education production function using all base year schools in the NELS in Table 2. These regressions

use school-level data and control for school characteristics and average family background characteristics

of the students. Once again, we find that the pupil-teacher ratio does not (statistically) increase in schools

with a larger proportion of black students, but that the average class size does. In addition, the pupil-

teacher ratio suggests that hispanic students are in schools with significantly smaller pupil-teacher ratios

while the gap is smaller in magnitude and statistically insignificant in the average class size.'4 The second

two columns assess the effect of using the pupil-teacher ratio instead of the average class size in an

education production function. Here we regress the average 8th grade to 10th grade test score gain by

students in the school on school and family background characteristics. We find that the pupil-teacher

ratio has essentially no effect on the test score gains of students. On the other hand, students in schools

with larger average class sizes have significantly smaller test score gains.'5

        Boozer, Krueger, and Wolkon (1992) and Grogger (1994) use the pupil-teacher ratio arid report

that, if anything, black students attend schools with smaller average pupil-teacher ratios than white

students; Grogger (1994) therefore concludes that school quality cannot explain the recent divergence in

the black-white wage gap. However, we find that the pupil-teacher ratio and average class size have

differing patterns (at least in recent data) that can generate contrasting descriptions across schools and can




     The coefficient on percent hispanic is negative in this table because we control for the junior high
school's region of the country.

   ' This result is similar to that found by Blinder (forthcoming) who used the average class size of the
school as an instrument for the actual class size of the school. Since this procedure sweeps out the within
school source of variation in class size, her IV procedure is very similar to doing OLS across schools.

also affect education production function estimates." Thus, using only the cross-school variation j class

size we find that it satisfies the two requirements for explaining the black-white gap in achievement: black

students are in larger classes than are white students, and smaller class sizes are associated with larger test

score gains. In the next section we address the importance of the within school variation in class size in

describing the racial patterns and the selection problem it creates for measuring the implications.




IV.      The Role of Class Type: Aggregation Bias

         The fact that school average class size matters, but pupil-teacher does not suggests a second reason

that researchers may not have detected racial differences in class size: the pupil-teacher ratio (more than

the average class size) may obscure important intraschool variation in class size. To see this, let CS, be

the class size of student i in school s (assuming for the moment only one class size for each student to

keep notation simple), and let , be the (sample) average class size in the school. The question is whether

the regressor     (or its proxy, the pupil-teacher ratio) captures variation in school quality that is important

in the education production function. If , is a noisy measure of CS,, such that

                                                   = CSiI+ ci,
where c,, is an error term which is negatively correlated with CS, then using               as a regressor in a

schooling production function introduces downward bias in the estimated coefficient on class size. In this

case, using school-level measures would not bias estimates of, for example, the black-white difference in

educational outcomes. On the other hand, if c,, is correlated with other explanatory variables, then using

school-level measures will generate misleading production function estimates. For example, if black


      16 In contrast, Card and Krueger (1992) use state-level measures of pupil-teacher ratios and find that
blacks were historically in schools with larger classes. While we can only speculate, part of the
explanation for why this pattern does not appear in more recent data may be that during the period in
which they measured school quality (the early part of this century), the average class size and pupil-
teacher ratio were more closely correlated. This might be true if, for instance, the intraschool allocation
of teachers did not vary widely across schools which the growth in compensatory education programs
(since the 1960s) may have generated.
                                                                                                              l0
students are assigned to larger classes within schools, and whites to relatively smaller classes, then a study

of the black-white gap in school quality using only the cross-school variation ,vill tend to understate the

magnitude of that gap.

        One potential source of error is the distribution within schools of gifted. remedial, and special

education classes. If the number, or proportion, of students classified as remedial (or special education)

across schools varies (i.e. so it is not always the bottom one-third of students in the test score distribution),

then schools with a higher proportion of remedial classes will have smaller average class sizes. In

addition, school-level measures may aggregate across heterogeneous production processes (Hanushek

(1979)). It is possible that remedial or special education classes produce test score gains with a different

production technology than above-average or gifted classes. If remedial and special education classes have

smaller class sizes and generate lower test score gains for a given class size than do high achieving

classes, then the fitted regression line that ignores these differences will estimate an upward sloping

relationship between class size and test score gains. This presents a serious problem for estimating

education production functions.

         Theoretically, if one has within-school class sizes, then a regression including school fixed effects

and allowing different slopes for the remedial and high-achieving classes should recover the hypothesized

negatively sloped relationship between test score gains and class size. However, even within these

classifications, students are likely allocated to classes according to ability so that one must also account

 for the allocation mechanism.

Although blacks represent 14% of the students overall, they represent 23% of the students enrolled in

special needs classes. Hispanics, though 11% of students overall, comprise 28% of those in remedial

classes. These racial differences have implications for the class sizes experienced by students since the

average class size varies by type of class. For example, a "regular" (or average) class has 22 students on

average, compared to 9.7 for students in special needs classes and 10 students in remedial classes. To the

extent that black and hispanic students are disproportionately represented in these smaller classes, the

average class size (and the pupil-teacher ratio), may not accurately reflect their schooling inputs,

particularly for the "average" student.

        Table 4 estimates the importance of the type of class on the class sizes of black and white

students. In the first two columns, we use the NJ Survey and regress the teacher's class size on the

percentage of the class that is black and hispanic, whether the teacher is at an elementary or junior high

school, and whether the teacher teaches alone (as opposed to having teachers' aides or team teaching).

There is no statistically significant difference in the class size at the level of the school and, in column

(1), teachers who teach alone do not have substantially smaller classes." And, there is little or no

difference in the class sizes of blacks and hispanics.

         In column (2) we condition on the type of class ("regular" classes are the omitted category). The

large increase in the R2 indicates that the type of class is a big determinant of the class size. Conditional

on the type of class, teachers who teach alone have almost 2.5 fewer students, and remedial and special

needs classes have 13 fewer students than regular classes. We find no difference between the class sizes

of gifted and regular classes, however. The racial differences are now pronounced. En particular, as the




        "Boozer, Krueger, Wolkon (1992) report that the pupil-teacher ratio in elementary and junior high
 schools is larger than in high schools. The negative signs on the coefficients for school type in Table 4
 suggest just the opposite when using the average class size. Interestingly, if we regress the pupil-teacher
 ratio on the type of school using the NJ Survey we get results similar to Boozer, Krueger, Wolkon. The
 difference may be due to increased use of team teaching and teaching specialists in elementary schools.

Notes: Standard errors are in parentheses. All regressions also include a constant. The regressions
using the NELS are weighted by the panel weights.

race of the student.

percentage of hispanic or black students increases by tO percentage points, the class size increases by 0.25

to 0.3 students.

        We performed a similar analysis using the base year NELS. The survey does not report the racial

composition of each class, so we regress the student's class size on his or her race. Further, the teachers

do not report whether the class is "remedial", "gifted", or "regular" although they do report their

assessment of the overall achievement level of the class.1 We find that blacks and hispanics are in

slightly larger classes than non-minority students. Controlling for the achievement level of the class again

increases the coefficients by almost 50% for black students and by 25% for hispanics. It is not surprising

that controlling for the type of class in the NELS does not change the coefficients on race as dramatically

as in the NJ Survey because the achievement level is an imprecise measure of the type of class. As

evidence, the magnitudes of the coefficient estimates of "high" and "low" achievement are not as large

as the coefficients on class type in the NJ Survey.

         We decomposed the effect of the type of class on class size to understand whether it was the

characteristics of students or the school policies that were generating the differences by race.t9 If black

and hispanic students had the same distribution of characteristics as white students, they would be in

schools with slightly larger average class sizes. More importantly, if black and hispanic students were in

schools with the same class size patterns as white students, they would have lower average class sizes than

white students. It appears that the patterns within the schools matters slightly more than the characteristics




       We get similar results when we use the more detailed descriptions of class types that exist for the
 10th and 12th grade classes.

    ' We modeled the relationship between class size and type oflass weighted by either the number
of black, white, or hispanic students in the class using both the NJ Survey and the NELS. We then
computed the mean class size using the coefficient estimates based on the white students and the means
of the independent variables for the black or hispanic students, and then calculated the mean using the
black or hispanic coefficient estimates and the means of the independent variables for the white students.

of the students. Thus, to some extent the seemingly similar class sizes between minority and white

students at the school level is the result of class type.




B.       implications

         Our results suggest that, conditional on class type, blacks are in larger classes than whites.

However, we must still test whether actual class size matters in an education production function leaving

an opportunity for school quality to account for part of the black-white gap in labor market outcomes.

Unfortunately, given that class size is largely determined by the type of class, one cannot simply interpret

OLS coefficients of actual class size on educational outcomes as causal. In particular, one must address

the fact that students are not randomly sorted into classes of different sizes.         In this section, we use

within-school variation in class size to estimate education production functions. In section five, we then

estimate the implied effect of class size on the black-white gap in educational attainment.



I.       Modeling Education Production Functions

         In the following analysis, we model the effect of class size on academic achievement as measured

by test scores and the likelihood of dropping out.2Â° Consider, first, a simple cross-sectional model,


                                         T = a + Xb + gC           +                                        (2)




where      is the test score of the student in period T, X is a vector of individual and school characteristics,

Cfl.I is the class size of the student in period t-l, and e, is an error term. We have in mind an experiment

in which we "treat" a student at time t-l with a class of a given size in the relevant subject for the




        20 See, also, Hanushek (1979) and Hanushek and Kain (1972) for discussions of the issues involved
in choosing a functional form for an education production function.
                                                                                                              14

duration of period t-i, and then observe the impact on his/her test score at time t?' In this specification

we assume that the class size in the previous period is all that is relevant for the current test score, or that

the class size at time t-l is a sufficient statistic for the entire past history of the educational production

function since educational production processes are inherently cumulative.

        However, it is more realistic to assume that the current school quality (class size) does not fully

summarize the student's school quality history and that previous school quality also matters for current

school achievement. In this case, if we do not control for past schooling quality then the effect of class

size on test scores, if measured as late as the 8th grade, will be more reflective than causal, even if

students were initially randomly assigned to classes. In this case, the education production function has

the following form,


                                   T   =    +       +          +          +                                  (3)




where current educational achievement is a function of last period's class size as well as previous class

sizes (the assumption of only one extra lag is for expositional convenience only â in reality we may take

C.2 to be a vector of the entire past history, or a scalar summary statistic that serves as its proxy). If we

 assume that      and C,2 are correlated, so that C,1 = p C.2 + v112 , then plim = [y1 + ( y2/p)] (where

   is from equation (2)). If class sizes are positively correlated over time (i.e., p > 0), and y1 and y2 have

 the same sign, then     will overstate the role of C1 in determining test scores, but should still give an

 indication of the sign of the effect of class size as well as an estimate of the cumulative effect of class




       2tIn reality, however, we observe the data at two year intervals, although we suppress this feature
 in our discussion of the choice of appropriate functional form.
                                                                                                               15

size on academic achievement, assuming, of course, that students are assigned to classes of varying sizes

conditionally independent of the error term.22

        One way in which we address the lack of data on the past history of schooling inputs is by

estimating an equation of the form.


                                  7". = a + X(3 + yC,        +
                                                                 6T1    +                                (4)




where we include       as a regressor in order to hold constant the determinants of the test score at time

t-l, which would include the entire vector of past schooling inputs. We include T,, precisely because

we lack a true experimental situation at the 8th grade. A constrained version of equation (4) sets 5 = 1,

and involves regressing the test score gain on the class size level,




                                       â T1    =   a +       + yC1     +                                (4')




which estimates the value-added from a given class size treatment administered at time t- I. In addition,

since T,.1 is determined by the past history of school quality and individual attributes not included in the

X's, specification (4') partially controls for a person-specific fixed effect (in terms of the test score levels,

but not the gains). Another way in which we address this problem is by estimating equation (3) for the

 12th grade outcomes for which we partially observe the past history of class size inputs (from the 8th and

 10th grades). We are somewhat agnostic as to whether the equations using the test score levels or the gain

should be preferred, and therefore report results based upon both specifications.




       22 In the NELS, the correlation between the 8th and 10th grade class sizes is 0.27.
                                                                                                            16

         In the presence of a "true" randomized experiment, whereby students are assigned to classes of

varying sizes, equations (3) and (4) (or (4')) would clearly identify the impact of class size on school

achievement. Without a true randomized experiment, however, we must assume that students are assigned

to classes of varying sizes in a way that is uncorrelated with test scores at time t, conditional on the

included X's. Thus, while OLS regression applied to equations (3) and (4) (or (4')) will address the

problem of omitted schooling histories, they will tend to yield positive estimates of g. However, these

estimates are clearly not causal.23 They are driven by the selection problem, noted above, that lower

"ability" students tend to be assigned to smaller classes, on average, and these lower "ability" students also

tend to score lower on achievement tests. As a result, one must employ either a true randomized

experiment, or an instrumental variables strategy.




2.        Evidence from the NELS: Using State Policy as an Instrument

          Given the non-random allocation of students into classes of differing sizes, in order to estimate

an education production function we need an exogenous factor that determines class size, but is orthogonal

 to unobserved determinants of educational outcomes. We use state special education policy to instrument

     -class size which draws upon the growing importance of special education to the variation in class size.

 pecial education has become an increasingly prevalent program in schools over the past twenty years.

 In 1976, 8.3% of total enrollment was classified as "special needs"; the percentage had grown to 11% by

 1988 (Digest of Education Statistics, 1991).24 The largest growing component is those labelled "learning



            Indeed, if schools seek to maximize test scores (subject to cost constraints), then were these
 positive estimates in fact causal, given that smaller classes are more costly for schools, we should expect
 to see schools increase class sizes. The fact that we tend to see richer school districts set lower class sizes
 than poorer class sizes is, thus, prime fade evidence that the causal impact of class size is not positive,
 although it might well be zero.

       24 We have not found similar figures for remedial education. We suspect this is because states do
 not regulate "remedial education" as they do "special needs" leaving districts to design their own policies.
                                                                                                          17

disabled" which grew from I .8% to 4.9% over the same period. As noted in Table 2. the class sizes of

special needs (and remedial classes) are roughly one-half those of other types of classes. This time-series

trend could be responsible for the aggregate reduction in the average class size noted by researchers such

as Flyer and Rosen (1994).

        Actual class size will be correlated with the state regulations to the extent that schools base the

entire structure of their class sizes on such State policy.25 The relationship between the state maximum

policies and actual 8th grade class size are illustrated in the regressions in Table 5 below:

Notes: There are 20,131 observations. See note to Table 6 for other regressors.




        As the maximum state class size for special education classes increases, the student's class size

initially decreases, but begins to increase after reaching a minimum of approximately two students.

(Overall, the instruments are positively correlated with the actual class size.) Further, the F-statistics



      25 Our state policies come from Staff to Student Ratios: Class Size/Caseload (1986) and Staffi
Student Ratios: Class Size/Caseload SuÃ¸lement (1989) from the National Association of State Directors
of Special Education, Inc. Washington, D.C.
                                                                                                          18

suggest that these instruments are highly correlated with the endogenous variable (Bound. Jaeger. Baker

(1993)). In our analysis we include the logarithm of the maximum class size, the logarithm of the

maximum class size squared. and dummies indicating that the state does not regulate the maximum class

size for five of the seven special education categories, generating 15 instruments!6 All of the first-stage

coefficients are presented in Appendix Table 2.

        Using state regulations has the disadvantage of potentially reflecting the preferences of the

residents (voters) of the state towards education rather than exogenously determined maximum class sizes.

We control for this possibility, to some extent, by including four region dummies, state average income

per capita, state expenditures per student, and the percentage of the state population twenty-five years and

older with four or more years of college.2' A second disadvantage is that the identifying information only

varies at the state level. As the analysis reveals, the fact that we have on average 800 students per state

may confound the interpretation of our diagnostic statistics.




Effects on Test Scores

        Our basic results are presented in Table 6. This table shows the estimates from regressions of

 10th and 12th grade test scores on a variety of explanatory variables, including the class size for the

student's class for the subject of the test. Columns (2), (4), (6), and (7) also control for the student's

previous test score(s) to account for previous school quality. The OLS results in Table 6 suggest that class

size has a positive and significant effect on test scores. Increasing the class size by one student in the gLh

grade increases the 0Â°' grade test score 0.05 points above and beyond the student's 8th grade test score

 in the sam subject (using the results from column 2), which is almost 10/0 of a standard deviation of the




       26 We use the logarithm, although we get similar results using a quadratic in the levels.

        27 Expenditures are for the 1987-1988 school year and are reported in the Digest of Education
 Statistics (1991), state educational attainment is from the Statistical Abstract (1993).

overall test score gains. The coefficients, however, change sign once we instrument for class Size. In the

first five columns the coefficients on class size are negative and significant. When both the 8th and 10th

grade class sizes are included, the coefficient on the 10th grade class size is negative and statistically

significant; and while the coefficient on the 8th grade class size is often insignificant, the coefficients on

both class sizes are jointly significant.2' Such results suggest that students are not randomly allocated to

classes and that students in larger classes have lower test scores. Our results are qualitatively similar to

those found by Blinder (forthcoming) who also uses the NELS and instruments for actual class size using

the average class size in the school.29

        We also present the           statistic for the generalized-method-of-moments (GMM) test of

overidentification (Newey (1985)). The test involves regressing the residuals from the second-stage

equation on the first-stage instruments. The R2 of this regression times the number of observations is

distributed as a x2 with k-q degrees of freedom where k is the number of instruments and q the number

of endogenous variables. The null hypothesis is that the instruments give a consistent set of IV estimates.

in all but two cases, we reject the null hypothesis. It is possible that because there are so many

observations per state, even instruments that are only weakly correlated with the second-stage residual will

 generate an R2 large enough to reject the null hypothesis. Unfortunately, the 800 observations per state




       21 Because 92% of the first follow-up and 55Â°/a of the second follow-up samples have two records,
 there is an individual component to the error term, and the stratified sampling results in a school
 component to the error term. We have accounted for neither of these effects in the reported standard
 errors. Our best guess (based on random- and fixed-effects) is that the effect of the individual component
 on our standard errors is negligible, but that the failure to account for the school effects may downward
 bias the reported standard errors by as much as 100%.

      29 Blinder presents results for test score levels rather than gains. However, the cross-school variation
 in class size may be contaminated by Tiebout sorting of "good" students into schools with smaller average
 class sizes. We argue that modeling test score gains (or including the lagged test score as an explanatory
 regressor) rather than levels helps to mitigate this source of bias.
                                                                                                          20

may also have generated the relatively large F-statistics in the Iirst-stage equations. Consequently, we

interpret our results as suggestive, but not conclusive.30

        We turn to the results of a "true' experiment of the effect of class sizes on test score outcomes

in an effort to corroborate our IV estimates. A statewide experiment was conducted in Tennessee in which

students in kindergarten and first grade were randomly assigned to small classes (average size of 15

students), regular classes (average size of 23 students), and regular with an aide (also an average size of

23 students, but with a teacher's aide). The results are reported in Finn and Achilles (1990). Finn and

Achilles compare "small" classes with "average" classes (where "average" includes all classes of size 22-25

with and without a teacher's aide) when reporting their findings for the cross-sectional results for the end

of Grade I reading and math test scores (Table 6 of their paper).3' Finn and Achilles found that for

minorities, a reduction of 8 students per class, on average, resulted in an increase of 0.35a for reading

(where a is the standard deviation of the minority reading test score distribution) and O.23a for math. For




    Â° We also exploited the panel structure of the NELS data and estimateda first-differenced version
of equation (2) which nets out any time-invariant individual level heterogeneity. Specifically, we
regressed the change in the test score on the change in the class size, and included other X's to control
for observable heterogeneity in the changes. As usual, the standard errors from this type of differencing
were greatly magnified relative to OLS on the levels (they increased by about a factor of 6). The
coefficient magnitudes were positive, about 2 to 3 times larger than those from OLS, and quite
insignificant. While the first-differenced specification is appealing in that it differences out the previous
history of school quality and any time-invariant individual heterogeneity, it still suffers from the non-
random assignment of students to classes. If 8th grade classes are not randomly assigned and 8th grade
class size interacts with unobservables in affecting achievement, the first-difference will not solve the
selection problem. Thus, we were not surprised to obtain results generally consistent with those from OLS.

      The longitudinal analysis at the end of their paper does not report the effect sizes in terms of the
standard deviation of the gain scores, and so do not allow for direct comparison with our outcome in terms
of its standard deviation. The longitudinal results lead, however, to the same qualitative conclusions as
the cross sectional results.
                                                                                                            21

white students. the effects were smaller. 0. I 3a for reading and 0.1 5c for math, but still statistically

significant.32

         We compare our results to the Tennessee experiment by estimating the implied effect of lowering

the average class size by S students using our estimated coefficients. We obtain an implied increase in

the average test score gain of(O.2)*(8) = 1.6 or approximately 0.29a. where           is the standard deviation

of the entire test score gain distribution." Thus, our findings from the IV strategy suggest an effect size

that is comparable to those derived from a "true" experiment using actual class size.34




Effects on Dron Out Behavior

         In Table 7 we examine the effect of class size on another academic outcome, the event of

dropping out between 8th and 10th grade and between 8th and 12th grade. We follow the structure of

reporting results used in Table 6, and again include a lagged test score as an attempt to capture the entire

past history of schooling inputs. The OLS results reveal a statistically significant negative relationship

between class size and subsequent drop out activity, suggesting that a reduction in class size would

actually increase drop out activity. The IV results indicate that the causal effect of class size on dropout

activity is essentially zero, although the fact that the standard error is so much larger than that for the OLS

estimates leads us to interpret the insignificance of the point estimates in columns (2) and (4) with caution:




   32 The larger effect sizes for minorities may be partially due to the fact that these results do not
condition on family background because the randomization was not within racial strata. If it had been,
we might expect more similar effect sizes for the two races.

     " The standard deviation is approximately 5.6; the -0.2 estimate is roughly the average point estimate
of the effect of class size after controlling for the base year score.

     " We can also compare our results to Card and Krueger's (1992) study of the effects of statewide
differences in pupil-teacher ratios on differences in earnings of black and white workers educated in those
states. They found that a statewide reduction in pupil-teacher ratios of 8 pupils would lead to an implied
effect size of O.16a (using the results in their Table X) where a is the standard deviation of the difference
in mean log earnings for blacks and whites.

the causal effect may still be negative, even though our IV strategy cannot detect it. But by either set of

results it is difficult to make the case that a larger class size leads causally to more dropout activity.

        Since most students turn age-eligible to drop out in the 10th grade, the students who drop out

between 8th and 10th grade are perhaps best thought of as constrained (by the legal age requirement) in

their decision to drop out of school. It is therefore plausible that a class size reduction in 8th grade would

not suffice to discourage a student from dropping out, given that the intervention occurs at such a late

date." Put differently, there may be treatment effect heterogeneity for class size interventions, and

students at the bottom of the achievement distribution may not be affected much by their 8th grade class

size. The fact that the OLS coefficients are quite significantly negative is probably due to the fact that

the causal treatment effect is either zero or slightly negative, and so the OLS coefficients largely reflect

the selection effect." On the whole, we probably could not learn much about the effect of class size on

dropouts, unless we were to have access to early school and class quality measures.




V.      Implications for Black-white Achievement Differences

        Our results indicate that one cannot use actual class size without accounting for the selection

process into the classes of differing sizes and that once addressed, there is evidence of a negative effect

of larger classes on test scores. Furthermore, blacks appear to be in larger classes conditional on class

type. In this section we attempt to gauge the extent to which using actual class size could account for




   " See Boozer (1992) for evidence that age-at-grade is a quite significant indicator of dropout status,
and some further evidence from the HiRh School and Beyond that this age measure is substantially
determined by early schooling environments.

     36 Interestingly, Boozer (1992) found that a school's pupil-teacher ratio was in most cases positively
 associated with a student's greater propensity to drop out of school; a school's fraction black enrollment
 was also highly associated with dropping out activity. if school level averages are more highly correlated
 over time than are the individual class sizes, such a result may not be surprising since early schooling
 appears crucial for drop out behavior. In this case, school level averages would serve as a better proxy
 for early schooling than the individual class size.
                                                                                                           23
differences in black and white educational achievement. In Table 8 we estimate separate IV regressions

for black, white, and hispanic students and then estimate the test score gains of each using the average

class size for blacks, whites, and hispanics, keeping the other variables at their original values. Estimating

separate regressions by race reveals that the result in Table 6 for the I 0d grade test score is primarily

driven by the effect of class size for black students. However, the results for the gain in scores between

10th and 12tk grade suggest that white students experience more of an increase in test score gains for a

given reduction in class size than do black students.

         The IV results indicate that moving blacks into the average class size of white students in the gth

grade (i.e., decreasing class size by about one student) would increase their test score gains in 10th grade

by about 6%, thereby closing the black-white test score gap (of gains) by about 15%. The effects for the

gains from 10th to 12w' grade are considerably smaller in that a one student decrease would lead to a 1%

increase in gains for black students which is only 4% of the black-white gap.



VI.      Conclusion

         In our analysis we only address differences in class size and, as such, cannot speak to school

quality more generally." Nevertheless, our results indicate that some of our conventional wisdom

regarding school quality may be misleading. We use measures of average class size and actual class size

and find that black students are in larger classes than white students. We also find that while, ideally,

researchers should use actual class size in education production functions, using actual class size in an

OLS regression exacerbates non-random allocation of students to classes of differing sizes.3 When this




      " That said, 21% (a plurality)   of teachers in the NJ Survey reported that hiring more teachers      to
reduce class size should be the highest priority were the school to receive additional funds. Buying more
computers was a close second with 18.6%.

      " On the other hand, actual size may also be subject to more classical measurement error than
aggregate measures (Card and Krueger (1994)).

 source of selection is addressed, we find and report on evidence that smaller classes can increase

 educational achievement and can account for some of the black-white differences in educational

 achievement.

         Unfortunately, our resu Its cannot directly assess the impact of class size on labor market outcomes.

 However. Grogger (1994), using the High School and Beyond (HSB) and the National Longitudinal Study

 of the High School Class of 1972 (NLS-72), estimated a significant relationship between test score levels

 and wage outcomes. He found that math, vocabulary, and perception test scores accounted for 1/3 to

 almost 1/2 of the black-white wage gap. Although the age of our sample prohibits such a direct

 investigation as this, the similarity of the testing instrument in the NELS and the HSB data suggests that

our results for test scores may well have labor market implications. Due to differences in specifications,

however, we cannot gauge the potential magnitude of the impact.39

        Finally, our results suggest that the growth of special education merits greater attention. For

example Boozer, Krueger, Wolkon (1992) report a monotonic fall in the black-white difference in the

pupil-teacher ratio since 1915 suggesting that the variation in pupil-teacher ratio may have decreased since

the first half of this century. Flyer and Rosen (1994) note that only about one-half of the decrease in the

pupil-teacher ratio from 1961-1991 can be accounted for by average class size, and that the discrepancies

are "impossible" to resolve (p. 37). However, smaller special education classes (and compensatory

education, in general) combined with larger "regular" classes may explain such trends, especially if the

growth of special education has been unevenly distributed across schools.




     Grogger's specifications are the log wage on the !J of the test scores, whereas we work with the
impact of class size on the test score      In addition, the test subject areas only overlap in mathematics.
Thus, while the dramatic effect of the inclusion of test scores on the black-white
                                                                                      wage gap (documented
more recently by Neal and Johnson (1994) using the AFQT scores in the NLSY) is highly suggestive that
the effects we find of class size on test scores would translate to effects of class size on earnings, we
cannot quantitatively assess the magnitude of such an effect.

               Assessing the Reliability of Teachers' Responses in the NJ Survey


         We are able to assess the accuracy of the teachers' responses, particularly with regard to
school level characteristics, such as the total number of teachers and total enrollment because in 76
of the 389 useable schools, more than one teacher was surveyed.40 Thus, we are able to compute
reliability ratios for several variables using these multiple measures. Let x1 and x, be two reports of
the true value x and let x1 = x + c and x2 x + r2 where e and r2 are the measurement errors in
the reports. We assume that e and e2 are uncorrelated with the x and with each other, and that
var(x1)=var(x2). Under this model, we calculate the reliability ratio, X, as the correlation between the
two reports of the variables so that X       cov(x1,x2)/[var(x1) var(x2)] = var(x)/var(x1), or the
proportion of the variance in the reported measure that is accounted for by the true variation in x.
The results are presented in Table 3, below:

                      Percentage (School) Hispanic                  0.918


        These estimates suggest that about 20% of the measured variance in average school class size,
28% of the measured variance in total number of teachers, and 15% of the measured variance in total
enrollment is error. The reliability ratios for the racial composition of the school are much higher,
5-8% of the observed variance being attributable to mis-measurement. On the other hand, when the
total school and enrollment and the number of teachers are combined to generate the pupil-teacher
ratio, fully 99% of the observed variance is due to error. The large change in the reliability of the
ratio of the two measures is due to the fact that the measurement error in the pupil-teacher ratio is
a function of the measurement errors in the number of teachers and enrollment weighted by the



     Â° There were 58 schools in which two teachers were surveyed and 18 schools in which three
teachers were surveyed.

variances of these two measures.4' Small amounts of measurement error in the individual
components of the pupil-teacher ratio can have devastating effects on the ratio. Thus, while the
teachers appear to have reasonably accurate perceptions about the school characteristics, the pupil-
teacher ratio in the NJ Survey may be severely mismeasured.




      '   The reliability ratio for the pupil-teacher ratio is:

                                       -   aXvar(P1)-2bcov(P,7)+c)var(T1)

         ), is ththethability ratio for total enrollment, X,. is the reliability ratio for the number of teachers,
P, and T, are observed measures of total enrollment and the number of teachers respectively, and P and
T are the true values; a(l/(E(T))2), b(E(P)f(E(T))3), and c=((E(P))2/(E(T))4) (using the true values), and
a,, b,, and c, are similar constants using the observed values.
