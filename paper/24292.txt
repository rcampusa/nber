We show that online prices can be used to construct quarterly purchasing power parities (PPPs)
with a closely-matched set of goods and identical methodologies in a variety of developed and
developing countries. Our results are close to those reported by the International Comparisons
Program (ICP) in 2011 and the OECD in 2014, and can be used to obtain more up-to-date
estimates of real consumption across countries without the need for consumer price index
extrapolations. We discuss advantages and limitations associated with the use of online prices for
PPs, including issues of representativeness and limited coverage of product categories and
countries.

   International income comparisons such as the Penn World Table (PWT) rely on data provided
by the International Comparisons Program (ICP) at the World Bank, which collects prices from
thousands of comparable goods and services all over the world to calculate purchasing power
parities (PPPs). While ICP continually improves its methods, its reliance on traditional data
collection through National Statistical Offices (NSOs) causes many problems, including the low
frequency of data collection (every 6 years), long delays in publication (results for the 2011 round
were published in 2014), issues affecting the comparability of products and methods across
countries and time (see e.g. Deaton and Heston (2010), Inklaar and Rao (2017)), as well as the
need to rely on the efforts of individual countries that can refuse to participate (e.g. Argentina for
ICP 2011) or lack transparency regarding their data and methods (see Feenstra et al. (2013)).
   The availability of new (big) data sources provides hope for improvements along several of these
dimensions. In particular, we show that online prices can be used to construct quarterly PPPs
published in real-time, with a closely-matched basket of goods and identical methodologies in a
variety of developed and developing economies. At a more fundamental level, the ability to
remotely collect online prices provides more control and transparency to the data and
methodologies used to compute PPPs across countries.
   Our data cover eleven countries in three major consumption categories, Food and Beverages,
Fuel, and Electronics, from 2011 to 2017. In a validation exercise, we find that PPPs constructed

with online prices are close to those reported by ICP in 2011 and the OECD in 2014. Next, we
illustrate the potential of the new data to provide quarterly estimates of real consumption across
countries for the fourth quarter of 2017.
   While promising, we also highlight many potential problems associated with the use of online
prices for PPP calculations, including the lack of representativeness and limited coverage of
product categories and countries.

                                                    II. Data and Methodology

   We use micro data available at the Billion Prices Project (BPP) at MIT, including daily web-
scraped prices from 2010 to 2017 for all products sold by some of the largest multi-channel
retailers in eleven countries: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, China, Canada, Netherlands, Germany,
Japan, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States. 2 These prices include taxes and
exclude shipping costs. 3
   In constructing price comparisons across countries, one is confronted with the challenge of
matching products and comparing “like-with-like”. Product codes that are attached to the online
goods cannot be used because they tend to be retailer or county-specific. Moreover, identical
products are seldom available across countries, except for global branded products, which
constitute a relatively minor share of expenditures. So to ensure sufficient coverage, local goods
have to be grouped before matching is possible.
   We therefore mimic the procedures followed by ICP 2011, starting with the creation of our own
list of “items” (narrowly-defined product categories) to which individual products will be
matched. 4 Our item list consists of 267 narrow definitions that cover all subsectors of the UN’s
COICOP classification system for Food and Beverages, Fuel, and Electronics. 5 This is slightly
higher than the number of items for these categories in ICP 2011, as shown in Table 1.


   2
      The data were collected by PriceStats, a private company associated with the BPP, which also matched the products for 9 of the 11 countries
in our sample. See Cavallo and Rigobon (2016) for details on the data and methodologies. Alberto Cavallo is a co-founder of both the BPP and
PriceStats.
    3
      For countries where the sales tax is not included in prices shown to customers online, we add a standard sales or VAR tax to scraped prices as
follows: US Food 0.952%, Electronics 5.08%. Japan Food and Electronics 5% before 3/2014 and 8% afterwards; Germany Food "7% and
Electronics 19%; Canada Electronics, Chocolates and Sodas 12%. The Canadian average is computed from state-level rates weighted by state
population
    4
      See World Bank (2014) for a description of ICP methodologies, and World Bank (2013) for an extensive motivation of why these methods
are applied.
    5
       See https://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regcst.asp?Cl=5. Our “Food and Beverages” sector corresponds to COICOP code 01, the “Fuel”
sector is COICOP 07.2.2, and “Electronics” covers COICOP codes 09.1.1 to 09.1.4.

These items were chosen to strike a balance between comparability and representativeness. We
have a mix of narrowly-defined global products (e.g. “Decaf Ground Illy Coffee”) and broader
item definitions for unbranded products or local brands (e.g. “Basmati Rice” or “Decaf Ground
Coffee, all other brands”). Our item definitions tend to be more narrowly defined than those in
ICP’s 2011 list, particularly in electronics. 6
  The matching of individual products to each item definition is a labor-intensive process. The
micro data contains detailed descriptions for millions of products. Searching this database, we find
those products that best match the item descriptions in each country, and enter their package sizes
so that we can calculate unit prices (e.g. price per gram). A total of 99,028 individual products
were matched, with a mean of 30 products per item in each country. We concentrated our matching
efforts in recent years, when the micro data become more abundant, so our coverage of consumer
expenditures improves considerably after 2012.

  Once the individual products are matched, we average all unit-price observations (across
products and time) for each item, country, and quarter, implicitly assigning more weight to those
products that are available to consumers for a longer time within the quarter. Average prices are
then aggregated to the level of a “basic heading”, such as ‘Rice’ or ‘Coffee, Tea, and Cocoa’. Not
all items within each basic heading are priced in every country, so we follow ICP and run a Country
Product Dummy (CPD) regression for every quarter and every basic heading 𝑘𝑘:

                                                               𝑘𝑘

                                                                                          𝑘𝑘

PPPs are expressed as national currency per unit of the base country (in our case the US dollar).
To ease interpretation to facilitate the comparison across countries and samples, we also compute
price level indices (PLIs), dividing the PPPs by the country’s nominal exchange rate with the US
dollar. PLIs are unit-free and reflect whether prices are higher (> 1) or lower (< 1) relative to the
reference country.

                                             II. Comparison to ICP

  We now compare our PLIs with those of ICP for 2011, the most recent global price comparison.
  In principle, there are many reasons to expect differences. First, our prices are collected online
for large branded retailers selling in mostly urban locations, while ICP data is collected in physical
stores in many kinds of retailers and geographical locations. Second, online prices are collected
every day, while ICP prices are obtained once (or a few times) per year. Temporal aggregation
obscures the comparison because PPPs can vary significantly within a year (particularly in high
inflation countries). Third, there are methodological details in ICP that we cannot replicate. This
includes the use of an “importance” weight for each item in the CPD regression, as quantity
weights are only available at the basic heading level.
   Despite these differences, Figure 2 shows that PLIs computed with online data align well with
those calculated from ICP data (US = 1). These are results for grouped items within Food, Fuel
and Electronics, using basic heading expenditure weights (see Appendix Figure 1 for comparisons
at basic heading level). The PLIs are closest for Fuel, where the item definitions are identical across
ICP and BPP. In Food and Electronics there is more dispersion but no evidence of PLIs being
consistently higher or lower with online data.

                          country. 45-degree line in black, linear fit line in gray. All axes on log scale.



  Multilateral PLIs for each country are compared in Table 1. On average, online and ICP PLIs
for 2011 differ by 15% in absolute value across the eleven countries. In some cases, such as
Australia, the results are nearly identical, while in others, such as Japan, the difference is as high
as 28%.
  We repeat the comparison in 2014 for OECD countries, for which PPPs are published every
three years. The average difference is much smaller in this case, likely because our coverage of
basic headings with online prices is nearly complete at this time. 8

                Notes: Multilateral GEKS PLIs covering all basic headings available in Food, Fuel, and Electronics.
               BPP numbers are yearly averages from quarterly PLIs excluding those quarters for which there are less
               than 50% of basic headings covered. No ICP data is available for Argentina in 2011 because the country
               refused to participate.



  Beyond the comparison with ICP, a major advantage of using online data to measure PPPs is
that we can provide more frequent and timely estimates of real consumption across countries. For
example, the first column in Table 2 shows a cross-country comparison of the real household
consumption of Food, Fuel and Electronics for the last quarter of 2017.

             Sources: Total household consumption expenditure in local currency units, total population, the consumer
             price index and the exchange relative to the US dollar is taken from the OECD Main Economic Outlook, no.
             102 (November 2017). For China, household consumption expenditure is from the UN National Accounts
             Official Country Data for 2015, extrapolated to 2017 using the growth of GDP at constant prices and the
             consumer inflation rate for 2016 and 2017 from the IMF World Economic Outlook of October 2017. The share
             of food, fuel and electronics in total household consumption is from ICP 2011.
             Notes: ‘Extrapolated’ figures are based on the 2011 BPP price level index, extrapolated to 2017Q4 using the
             difference in (overall) consumer price inflation from 2011 to 2017Q4 between each country and the United
             States minus the change in the exchange rate. Estimates of for Argentina, Brazil, China and South Africa are
             for 2017 as a whole, rather than the fourth quarter of 2017. The ‘Actual’ figures are based on the BPP prices
             for 2017Q4.
   The measurement of PPPs on a quarterly basis can replace current nowcasting procedures that
rely on extrapolation of benchmark PPPs with relative CPI movements. These extrapolations are
prone to cause biases that distort the PLIs (Deaton and Aten (2017)). In fact, online PPPs could
help avoid extrapolation “surprises”, particularly in countries where CPI data and methods do not
match well with the ICP comparisons framework. Comparing column 2 (based on extrapolated
2011 PPPs) with column 1 reveals that these surprises can be large and occasionally more than 50
percent (as for China, Argentina and Canada).

                                                              III. Limitations

   While helpful, online data have many limitations. First, given that prices are mostly from large
retailers with an online presence, the resulting PPPs may not be representative for national
averages, especially in countries with a fragmented retail sector or (for Food) where the local diet
relies heavily on regional products. Furthermore, the prices in websites of these retailers can be
different from the prices found in their physical stores, where most retail transactions take place
(at least for now). Cavallo (2017) shows these differences are small on average, but they could still
meaningfully affect price-level comparisons in some countries. 9
      Second, most retailers that sell online tend to have a single price for all locations within a
country. This seems at odds with existing ICP data that shows significant regional price dispersion
(such as urban areas having higher prices of food, especially in poorer countries). 10 This lack of
spatial price differences can be resolved by scraping more localized retailers, whose online
presence is improving over time.
   Third, online data do not have expenditure weights for individual products, so it is hard to know
which products are more important for the comparison. In ICP this is decided upon by the NSO
data collectors, who arguably have more information to make the choice. While scanner or other
expenditure data sources could potentially be used as a complement in some categories, the
question of which matched individual products are more representative of actual consumption
remains.



   9
     To control for persistent online-offline differences, ICP can periodically estimate an average difference and adjust local prices accordingly.
See Cavallo (2017) for a discussion.
   10
      Some of this price dispersion could be explained by data collected from different retailers, as there is growing evidence that firms use uniform
pricing policies within countries. See DellaVigna & Gentzkow (2017) for the US, and Cavallo (2017) for some other countries.
  Fourth, online data only cover a limited number of product categories and countries. The three
sectors included in this paper represent only between 13% and 23% of the share of household
consumption in these countries. While more categories with online prices can be potentially added,
there are hard-to-compare areas of consumption, such as housing, personal services or health
services, that will likely remain a challenge until more data are available online. Similarly, online
prices are currently available in a small number of countries. We have matched data in 11 countries
out of approximately 60 for which the BPP has some price information. While matching can
improve, our approach is not yet viable in countries where there is still little price data online.

                                           IV. Conclusions

  We have shown that online prices can be used to enhance ICP data, dramatically improving the
frequency and transparency of PPPs compared with traditional data collection methods. We have
also identified many challenges and limitations of online data.
  We further note that the process of selecting (“matching’) products across countries remains a
challenge, even with “Big Data”. Online data enlarge the universe of products from which
comparable goods are chosen, and potentially improve the transparency and similarity in methods
used across countries, but selecting individual goods continues to be a labor-intensive task that
cannot be easily performed by automated procedures due to the lack of standardization in product
identification numbers and descriptions.
  Future work could address some of these issues, as well as explore other potential uses of online
prices in the context of PPP measurement, such as the computations of standard errors for national
average prices, the use of retailer dummies and other product characteristics in CPD regressions,
and better ways to account for entering and exiting products and items across countries.
