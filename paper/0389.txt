          A MODEL OF TRADE AND EXChANGE RATE PROJECTIONS




                              ABSTRACT


         This paper develops and applies a model of world trade and

exchange rates to analyze dynamic interaction of the current account and

exchange rate. The model is designed to concentrate on the determination

of trade flows, prices and exchange rates for the OECD member countries

but it also covers oil exporting countries, other developing countries

and Centrally Planned Economies.

         The model contains exchange rate equations, based on the asset

market approach, for major OECI) countries and   adjustable   pegging rules

for small OECD countries and for non—oil LDOs.    These provide the link
from asset accumulation through the current account to the exchange rate.

With the integration of exchange rate equations into the trade model, it

can be used to analyze outcomes of different exchange rate regimes and

alternative growth prospects in the OECD area.

         Simulation results indicate that the model produces a smooth and

slow adjustment process for exchange rates and current accounts. They

also show that with the higher growth target for an individual country

large current account deficits may occur or large changes in real exchange

rates are needed to reach the external equilibrium.

I.   Introduction

        This paper develops and applies a model of world trade and exchange

rates to analyze dynamic interaction of the current account and exchange rate.

The model is designed to concentrate on the determination of trade flows,

prices and exchange rates for the OECD member countries but It also covers oil

exporting countries, other developing countries and Centrally Planned Economies.

        The model contains exchange rate equations, based on the asset market

approach, for major OECD countries and adjustable pegging rules for small OECD

countries and for non—oil LDCs. These provide the link from asset accumulation

through the current account to the exchange rate. With the integration of

exchange rate equations into the trade model, it can be used to analyze outcomes

of different exchange rate regimes and alternative growth prospects in the

OECD area.

         Simulation results indicate that the model produces a smooth and slow

adjustment process for exchange rates and current accounts. They also show that

with the higher growth target for an individual country large current account

deficits may occur or large changes in real exchange rates are needed to

reach   the external equilibrium.
         It must be, however, emphasized that the projected changes in market
shares and exchange rates reflect the growth assumptions and the introduction
of   different exchange rate regimes as well as historical income and price
elasticities   in international trade. That is why they are conditional and

should not be interpreted as forecasts of future develpments of trade flows and

exchange rates.

         The paths for potential and actual GDP in the OECD countries are generated

by a small model which projects output based on growth in productivity and

labor force and which projects investment requirements for ten major OECO countries.

       Table 1 illustrates a few results of a model simulation. For this

run the growth rate of actual German GD? was increased by on percentage point

for the 15—year run. Germany, of course, runs a larger current account deficit

and its exchange rate depreciates and its inflation rate increases. Strong

effects are seen for the other European countries: all appreciate and experience

reduced inflation rates. While the smaller countries gain market shares and

improve their current accounts, the larger countries lose market shares and

have worsened current accounts. The non—European countries are little affected.

       The macro model for each country takes as inputs the following time

series; male and female working age population, level of armed forces, full

employment" level of the unemployment rate, sector—specific equilibrium capital—

output ratio, depreciation rates, and shares of total output. Using these time

series as inputs into a small econometric model for each country, levels of gross

domestic product, employment, capital stocks and investment requirements by

sector are generated for the 1976 to 1990 period. Different projections may be

made by either altering the time series inputs or by providing different values

for the parameter estimates used in the equations.

       The international model determines equilibrium trade flows, prices, and

exchange rates for the 26 regions. The GDP results from the individual macro

models are used as inputs into import—demand equations for three types of

traded goods: non—oil merchandise, oil, and non—factor services. Import

demand in each category is a function of domestic GD?, the import price, and

the domestic GD? deflator.

       Thw GD? deflator depends on an exogenously—specified production—cost

index and import prices. Export prices are a function of the domestic price

as well as all other export prices. The import prices are determined by a

trade—weighted average of export prices, and the exchange rate.

          Bilateral   trade flows are determined by import demands and a bilateral
import—share matrix. The share matrix is adjusted every period to reflect
changes    in   relative export prices and exchange rates.
          Several options for exchange rate determination are built into the model.

The first is to allow exchange rates to adjust to give Balance of Payments

flow—equilibrium for all regions. The second option is for fixed exchange rates;

treating changes in international reserves as a residual item to balance each

region's international payments. The third option is to solve for major

countries dollar exchange rate from empirical asset market equation. Then the

payments are balanced by additions to or subtractions from the region's net

foreign assets. Countries for which the exchange rate equations have been

estimated are Canada, France, Germany (Federal Republic), Italy, Japan, and the

U.K. The small countries exchanged rates are either fixed (OPEC, the LDC's, and

the Centrally—Planned Region) or are determined by a rule which pegs each region's

currency to a weighted average of its trading partner's currencies.

       The remainder of the paper is divided into three parts. Section II explains

the simple procedure used to project growth in real and potential output.

Section III covers projections for investment requirements in ten major OECD

countries. Section IV gives a brief explanation of the trade and exchange rate

model and presents results from several simulations.



II. Projections

       Potential output projections were performed for twenty—one OECD nations.1

The following paragraphs are a step—by—step description of the output projections.

 Employment

      The labor force is equal to the level of working age population multiplied

 by the participation rate. From this value a constant level of armed forces

 is subtracted to arrive at the civilian labor force.

      For each country, a "potential" or "full—employment" unemployment rate is

used to arrive at potential employment. These potential unemployment rates are

drawn from INTERFtJTURES internal studies. Table 3 displays the assumed potential

unemployment rates and       projected   growth rates for potential employment.

      The   projections show that the higher growth rates for employment will be
in   Australia,   Canada, Iceland, Ireland, The Netherlands, and the U.S. Low rates
of   growth are projected for Finland, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the U.K.

Productivity
     Historical trend growth rates of output per man—year was taken from

estimates of simple labor—demand equations for the twenty countries.      These

regressions   were run   using   data from 1960 through 1975. Due to the very

simple specification of the labor—demand equation, the estimated growth rate

of output per man year includes both a measure of technical progress and any

trend in the wage/rent ratio.

      For 1975 to 1980, the trend value was used to calculate potential

productivity. For the remaining years, the growth rates were changed to

represent a convergence of OECD productivity levels and growth rates.      We

assumed that productivity levels would not surpass those of the U.S. and that

the productivity rate of growth would equal that of the U.S. when the levels

were equal. For each country, we assumed that the convergence would occur

between the year 2000 (for Japan) and 2025 (for the lowest productivity countries).

These assumptions imply the path of productivity growth rates given in Table

4 (See page 8). The low productivity countries will have high rates of growth

and conversely for the high—productivity countries.



Potential Output

      Potential output is equal to full—employment times the level of potential

productivity. The projected growth rates are shown in Table 5. (See page g).

The rates of growth for Austria, the Netherlands, and Portugal seem implausibly

high. The implausibility lies in the paths of productivity growth rate assumed

 for each.


 Reaching Potential Output

       As of 1978, none of the twenty countries were at potential output. Moat

 of the countries have unemployment rates higher than the "full—employment" level

       This section presents a simple quantitative framework for analysis and pro-

  jections of fixed investment needs for a sample of OECD countries consistent with

  the output projection described in the previous section. Given the output devel-

  opment, a central question is what level of capital stock and thus which flow of

  gross fixed capital information are implied by such growth prospects. We could

  not do an all—inclusive study of capital requirements in the OECD area due to the

  data problems and time constraint; our intention i to cover eno'gh of the import-

  ant countries so as to be confident that
                                             any serious prospective problems or
  policy issues would come to our notice.

The projections span the years 1979 to 1990 and the countries included in the
exercise are:
    1. Belgium                         6. Japan
    2. Canada                          7. Netherlands
      3. France                                8. Sweden
      4. Germany (Federal Republic of) 9. United Xingdom
      5. Italy                         10. United States
For each of these countries the same methodology was used to project invest-
ment requirements. Although the nature of capital requirements is similar
in most of the OECD countries the problems In Southern. European labour sur-
plus countries may be different fran the problems of industrialised countries
in our sample and thus called for a different approach from ours • In order
to allow for different sectoral capital intensities each economy was divided
into four sectors. These are as follows:
      1. Agriculture.
      2. Industry (mining and quarrying, manufacturing, electricity,
             gas and water, construction).
      3•     Private services (including housing).
      4. Public services.
The following set of equations was designed to carry out projections.
III. B. The Model
      Assuming the           of a stable relationship between desired capital
                      existence
      stock (IC) and output (7) and a constant depreciation rate of capital (&),
      we can derive the following set of relationships between full employment
      output (1), full employment capital stock () and gross investment (I).


       (1)       1i•v                                      1—1,2,3,4
                                                           i—1,2,3,4
       (2)        GjICiKi
                     —                                     I —   1,   2, 3, 4
       (3)                — C1 (1979)   (T —   t)

                                         —12—




       Equation (1) projects the full employment stock () of sector i given
       the full employment capital output ratio (i), sector i's value added
       share (vj) and full employment CD? (5. Note that we have applied the
       same value—added share projections to both potential and actual GOP.
       Equation (2) gives the gap (C1) between full employment capital stock
       and actual capital stock. The actual capital stock appraoches the
       full employment path according to equation (3), where the gap is closed
       during   eleven years time of recovery (T        11, t    0, ....   11).
       Equation (4) simply expresses gross       Investment needs in each sector      as
       a sum of net investment and     replacement   investment, which is a constant
      fraction of capital stock. All the stock variables are beginning of
      period figures. The total investment and capital needs and the whole
      economy's capital gap are computed by adding up the relevant variables.
      All the variables are measured in constant 1975 U.S. dollars.

III C. Derivation and   Pro1ections   of the Parameters in   the Model
      The parameters to be estimated in the model are        equilibrium (full employ-
      ment) capital output ratios () and depreciation           rates (&) in      each sec-
      tor as well as value—added shares (vj) of each sector.

          Full employment   capital—output ratio
          We assume that   in   1973 the economies In our    sample   were In equilibrium
          in the sense that there was     just   enough fixed capital in each sector
          to fully employ the labour force given the development of relative
          prices of capital and    labour. This assumption      is based   on the fact
          that 1973                        most of these economies • More
                      was a cyclical peak in
          critical than the choice of the full employment year may be the
          assumption that in this year the labour—capital mix was optimal given
          developrent of   wage—rental   ratio. Nevertheless this assumption allows
          us    to calculate full employment capital output ratios which are also
          "desired" or equilibrium ratios, If there are no underlying forces               to
          change capital—labour-mix. These capital—output ratios by country
          and by sector are shown in Table

        Depreciation rates
        The long—term model of the United Nations Economic                Commission for
        Europe      (the exogenous variables of the SEM        Model: Past trends and
        projected     values 1977) provides estimates for sectoral depreciation
        rates    (agriculture, industry, private         services, excluding     residential
        and public     services)    by   European sub—regions (North, West and       South
        Europe). These were applied to corresponding               individual European
        countries in our sample. Depreciation rates for the United States
        were taken to be arithmetic means of European rates. In public ser—




      main      source for the sectoral capital stock series is a Rand
             data
 Corporation Study by Stein and Lee (1977) except for Sweden. For Sweden
 the capital stock data are available in the Swedish national income
 account statistics. Since capital stock data by sectors are very scarce
 and there are large differences between the various sources, we wanted to
 exploit one common source (Rand Study) as much as possible in order to
 provide comparability between countries. Also resources available for the
 study did not allow a more careful and refined treatment of the data. Conse-
 quently, the data and the projection results are suitable only to evaluate
 general trands and directions of changes. Sectoral output data for all coun-
 tries come from OECD national income accounts except for Sweden where corres-
 ponding Swedish national sources were used. Different sources of data for
 Sweden may also explain its highest capital-output ratio in the sample.

   vices the   depreciation rate for the United States        was expected   to be
   above European average and was taken to be 3 per cent per year. The
   same figures were also applied to Canada and Japan except that in the
   case of Japan the depreciation rate in agriculture was chosen to be the
   seine as in "North Europe." The values of U.S. depreciation rates were
   checked against the information provided by another ECE source (BCE:
   Capital Stock: Assessment of Past and Current Trends by Sectors and
   Countries, 1977), an OECD study, 'Measurement of capital (Ward 1976),
   and a U.S. growth model (Iiclonan and Coen, 1976). These shoved large
   variations between different sources and gave little indication as to
   which direction to adjust our estimates.

   Depreciation rates (Continued)
   Depreciation rate estimates for private service sector including
   housing were obtained by weighting together depreciation rates for
   private services excluding housing, and the depreciation rate for
   housing which was fixed to be 1.5 per cent for all countries except
   Italy, and the United Kingdom. For these countries a lower value of
   1.0 per cent was used on the basis of the average age estimates of
   buildings and structures given in Ward (1976). The relevant weights
   are relative capital stock shares       in 1973.

         Value added shares
         The projections of the compostion of output were obtained mainly by
         extrapolating the past trends. Value—added shares in each economy
         were projected up to 1985 and then kept at this level. This is more
         or less arbitary, but nevertheless allows us to have some kind of
         idea of future capital needs during the recovery period with
         structural cahnge.
              Projected value-added share changes imply a generalized decrease
         in the value-added share of agriculture. Industry's share is increasing
         in all countries except in the United States where it is slightly de-
         creasing. In general, the projected increase in industry's share is
         larger the higher the growth rate of total GDP during the recovery
         period. Government's share is assumed to stay more or less constant.

         The resi!ua1 item private services — shows a moderate decline in

         most of the countries, In the absence of any better information, value

         added share projections were applied to generate both potential and

         actual sectoral output paths.


III D. Generation of the capital gap at the beginning of 1979



         Given the potential GDP projections described in Section II to gen-
erate sectoral full employment capital stocks in each economy. The actual
sectoral capital stock figures at the beginning of 1979 were obtained by
cumulating investment on 1973 stocks allowing far capital retirement using
the sectoral depreciation rates given in Table 8 (See page 14). In the
absence of any quantitiative information, we did not try to take into account
possible increased scrapping proposed on the hypothesis that large shifts in
relative prices after the oil crisis made some of the existing capital obsolete.
Thus, our actual capital stock numbers in this sense can be interpreted to
represent a kind of upper baindary and thus they may underestimate the actual
capital gaps. Sectoral gross investment numbers come from OECD national income
accounts or from OECD Economic Outlook for the period 1973-1978. Where in-
vestment   in real terms was not available on sectoral level nominal investment
shares   are applied to split total real fixed investment which was available
for each caintry. Given these capital stocks, capital gaps are defined as the
difference between full employment capital stock and the actual
                                           —l 6-.




one. These gaps are shown         in    Table 9 (below) for industry and f or total

economy.    The capital gaps thus depend            on the growth of full employment capital

stock    and the investment flow (given depreciation rate), out of which two
the latter is more important in most cases.

           The results indicate varations In the extent of the present capital

shortfall across the countries in our sample but also large differences

within each country across sectors. At the aggregate level, the gaps are

insignificant in the cases of Belgium, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, and

the United States. At the other end of the list are the Netherlands, with

Sweden falling in between. In the case of Canada, the explanation Is

obviously the increase in energy investment projects. In France, the decline

In    private sector investment was compensated by increasing public Investment
in    electricity, and In Sweden the increase was delayed until 1975 by stimul-

ative fiscal incentives.
                                 —17—




There are good reasons to expect that the housing stock estimate in 1979

is too low due to the high depreciation rate used in the Rand Corporation

Study for housing. This implies that we possibly underestimate the aggregate

capital—output ratio in the service sector including housing which in turn

means a downward bias in capital requirement estimates. In order to have some

idea of the quantitative effects of different capital—output ratios, we

inereased the full employment capital—output ratio in the private—service

sector by 20 per cent and carried out the needed calculations.   The results

show that there is now a capital shortfall in each country. Also, at aggregate

level, increases in the gap vary between two and four percentage points but

in general, the ranking of the countries has not changed. This calculation

indicates that on the basis of the present analysis, it is difficult to

estimate whether at the aggregate level the capital stock in the "boundary

countries" (Belgium, Canada, Prance, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom) is

sufficient fully to utilise the labor force.

   At the industry level, there seems to be a capital shortfall in each country.

The relative gap exceeds the limit of ten per cent in all other cases except

 Canada, Italy, Sweden and the United States. Japan and the Netherlands are now

 the problem countries with capital gaps over 25 per cent. There is one obvious

 reason for the differences between gap estimates at the aggregate level and

 at the industry level: the inclusion of the housing sector into private services.


 III. E. Investment Returns


    The estimates of the current capital gap and the growth of full employment

 capital stock give a growth path for future capital requirements.   This path

 implies a stream of gross fixed tnvestment consistent with it. Table 10 (See

 page 17) shows such investment as a percentage of total GDP (in industry's

 case investment as a percentage of industry's value added.)

  The most critical assumption may be a constant equilibrium capital-
  output ratio. As the price of other inputs rise relative to the cost
  of capital, the optimum capital-output ratio in production will rise
  as       capital is substituted for the other inputs. Since 1973 the relative
  price       of energy has risen perhaps fourfold. The relative price of labour
  has also risen, especially in the continental European countries. The
      increase in relative prices of energy and labour, would increase the
  equilibrium capital—output ratios again raising the investment require-
  ments of Table 10.


             Moreover,   a number of other factors might call for an upward adjust-
  ment of our assumed equilibrium capital-output ratio suchas a shift
  towards a relatively greater share of large—scale projects in total
      investment activity (energy sector being a        prime example), an increase
      in   the share of investment directed to environmental protection, and
                                -.19—


competition from some fast—growing LDCs leading to potentially faster
rates of structural change, accelerated capital obsolescence and thus
increased full-employment capital output ratios. With this in mind the
investment requirement projections should be interpreted to represent
some kind of minimum alternative consistent with the growth path towards
full employment.
At the aggregate level a slight decrease in the investment share in
Belgim, Canada, France and Japan is projected. For the United States,
the United Kingdom and Italy, there is a minor increase in the invest-
ment share. A general conclusion might be that for these countries
capital requirement implies more or less stable investment shares out
of GDP. For Germany, Netherlands arid Sweden the increase in the invest-
mentshare is most striking. In the case of Germany the estimate may
be out of any reasonable projection range. For all countries, the
investment—value added ratios in industry are high historically. In
the projections, the only country with investment requirements in in-
dustry not significantly greater in the projections than during 1975-
78 is the United States. In general, simply filling in the shortfall
of investment since 1973 will require   high investment ratios during
the recovery period.

       The investment "requirements" of Table 10 are in a sense minimum
estimates, and thus give the most optimistic view of the potential
difficulty with capital formation to 1990. If the size of the capital
gap    has been underestimated, or if events since 1973 have increased
optimal capital-output ratios, then the investment requirements should
be adjusted upwards. There are several reasons to expect that the
Table 10 estimates are, indeed, low.

IV. A Model      for Trade and Exchange Rate Projections

IV. A. Introduction

This  paper outlines a model of world trade and exchange rates. The
modelling effort was not focused on producing original research in the inter-
national trade and financial fields, but on constructing a calculating machine
that would give us reasonable projections of trade volume and exchange rates,
given assumptions on alternative development in the OECD economies, developing
countries and centrally planned economies • The model covers 26 regions, of
which 23 are members of the OECD. The non—OECD world is covered by the last
three regions. The regions are:
I. AuBtralia                            14. Norway
2. Mstria                               15. Portugal
3. Belgium—luxembourg                   16. Spain
4. Canada                               17. Sweden
5. Denmark                              18. Switzerland
6•     Finland                          19. United Xingdcmi
7.     France                           20. United States
8. Germany                              21. Greece
 9. Iceland                             22. New Zealand
10. Ireland                             23. flirkey
11. Italy                               24. Non—oil LDCs
12. Japan                               25. OPEC
13. Netherlands                         26. Centrally Planned Economies


It can be used to project changes in the pattern of international trade in
goods and services •     The channels through which trade pattern change are
relative price changes and differential rates of growth in the domestic eco-
nomies. These changing patterns of trade will have important        consequences
 for bilateral economic relations and    a   country's balance of payments position.

 The model thus allows us to investigate possible balance of payments diff 1—
 culties arising from alternative domestic macro projections. Countries can-
 not indefinitely maintain large current account deficits or surpluses without
 experiencing some change in the exchange rate or an impact on the internal
 balance. The model will give indications of such payments pressure on any of
 the countries with alternative assumptions of the time paths of exogenous
 variables.
                                    —21—



The model is driven by time paths of several macroeconomic variables and
the values of the parameters in the equations forming the model. The list
of variables that control the external sector differ by region. For the
23 OECD regions the main exogenous variable is real CDP. Other exogenous
variables for the OECD regions are net labour incomes, net private trans-
fers from abroad and the initial value of net capital incomes from abroad.
For OPEC, imports of goods and services are exogenous •   Also exogenous are
the small current account items: the net labour incomes and private trans-
fers. The only difference for the Centrally Planned Economies region Is
that net capital flow is the main exogenous variable rather than imports.
The treatment of non—oil LDCe Is roughly similar to that of OECD countries.

Projections with the model can be carried out in several alternative modes.
First, the model could be used to project developments of current account for
each country and region with the assumption of fixed exchange rates • This
alternative means projecting world trade with exogenously projected import
market shares, because there are no endogenous changes in relative prices.
    the other hand the model lends itself easily to analysis of a case of
adlustable exchange rates. This approach assumes that exchange rates are
adjusted to maintain some target current account balances, and then calcu-
lates the necessary changes under the projection assumptions. The calcula-
tions use estimates of trade price elasticities to move the trade share matrix
through time.

The adjustable exchange rate projections are not the same as projections of
what would happen with flexible rates. Recently, the theoretical literature
has turned to the so—called asset market model of flexible exchange—rate
determination in which the key role of the exchange rate is the relative price
of national monies rather than national outputs. In this model, short—run
stability of the foreign exchange market depends on asset substitution, rather
than trade elasticities. This approach has been used to determine the six
key exchange rates and these equations are linked to the trade model. We be-
lieve that it is important to Integrate these on the empirical level In order
to study the dynamic stability of the exchange rate in the long—run because
this is one of the key issues for a flexible exchange rate regime. With this
integration the model can be used to analyse outcomes from choices of differ-
ent exchange rate regimes.

IV. B. Model Structure

In    the following sections 1—7 we   outline the   model's structure.   The append:Lx

gives the list of equations in the model and        describes in detail how the empiri-
cal estimates for the parameters of the model are obtained. Direct econometric

estimation of the model  is not tried and we do not provide any new empirical
evidence   here. Instead we try to exploit current theoretical knowledge and
empirical relationships including existing trade and exchange rate equations
for different countries or more comprehensive trade models used in OECD or IMP.
They help us to derive the empirical parameters estimates needed for the model.
We have, however, made several adjustments to the existing trade elasticities
and to the mathematical forms    of   equations in order to guarantee plausible long—
term   properties of the system. Section 8 gives the first projection results

and   concludes    the paper.




1. Import Equations
       In the import side we distinguish between imports of good and services and
       petroleum   Imports. In postulating an import demand function for goods and
       services we have taken imperfect substitution view of international trade
       in which domestic and tradeable goods are sufficiently non—substitutable
       In order to generate finite price elasticities: The share of real Imports
       of goods and services out of real GDP depends on the relative full employ-
       ment output gap and relative prices. This type of equation has the property
       that in the long—run when the economy is on its full employment output path
       income elasticity of imports equal unity and the long—run import /GDP ratio
       is constant if relative prices remain unchanged. We have aggregated imports
       of goods and services, because very few elasticity estimates for services
       are available and because in many cases it is plausible to assume that
       services import flows and goods import flows are closely related. This type
       of equation is applied to all OECD countries. Petroleum imports are re-
       lated to real GDP and relative price of petroleum (CDP prices divided by

       oil prices) for all importing regions. For non—oil LDCs the volume of im-
       ports is decomposed into two parts: an exogenously projected component
                                   —23—




   (which is equal to their real GDP growth) and a component which reacts
   to changes in LDCa import prices relative to their GDP prices. For
   Centrally Planned Economies value of total imports is a residual item
   in the current account equation.

2. Export Equat ion
    For our export block we have taken a market share approach. Given esti-
    mates of each country's imports by equations described above, exports
    of each country can be determined through import market share matrices.
    The market share approach is applied to the determination of exports of
   goods and oil. Services are treated differently, because we do not
   have the necessary data for bilateral services flows.
   The question is how best to obtain projections for the share matrix, be-
   cause market shares vary over time due to changes in relative competitive-
   ness which can result from changes in relative prices or other factors
   such as export promotion, delivery times etc. In the model Import market
   shares of goods are assumed to respond to changes in relative prices and
   to relative non—price competitiveness measured by the growth of the ex-
   porting country's potential output relative to a weighted average of the
   growth of its competitor's potential output, i.e. countries with rapidly
   expanding capacity relative to others are assumed to capture markets.
    Changes in oil import shares are determined exogenously.

   For exports of services we assume that there is a single international
   trade pool of services to which all exports are delivered. The relative
   change in each country's share depends on the relative change in its
   export price relative to the "world price" of services and on the relative
   change in its potential GDP relative to a weighted average (service export
   shares as weights) of the relative change in its competitors potential CDP.
   The relative output terms stands for non-price competitiveness as in the
    case of goods market share equation.
                                            —24—




3.   Export Prices
     With the assumption of imperfect competition in international markets
     the supply function of exports should be specified as some type of price—
     setting behaviour. For a small country with no market power in the export
     markets, the price of exports would be given in foreign currency. If
     the country has some market power its exports prices change less than
     competitors' prices or costs of production can be passed to its export
     prices to a certain extent. Assuming constant price elasticities of
     export supply and demand the relative change in export prices can be
     expressed as a weighted average of the relative change in competitors'
     price3 and the relative change in a variable measuring domestic cost
     developments. We have approximated this cost variable by domestic price
     level. This is carried out for later purposes in order to integrate
     domestic prices into the model.
     The relevant measure for the competitor's price variable is a doubly
     weighted export price index of country i's competitors in the export
     market..       First a competitor's price for the country i on the j'th
     market    is   calculated as a weighted average of all other supplier's
     price on that market. Then these indices are again weighted, the rele-
     vant weights being shares of exports of the country in question to each
     market country. The competitor's price in service export price equation
     reduces    to a coiimion "world   price." This type of equation is applied in
     the model to determination of the export prices of goods and         services.
     Price of petroleum is     treated exogenously.    It is one of   the key input
     variables of interest     in the model.


4.   Import Prices
     Given the detetmination of export prices, import prices for each region
     in the model can be easily determined as weighted averages of these ex—
     port prices with   market shares as weights. This applies to import prices
     of   goods and petroleum where the weights to be used are import shares of
     goods and petroleum    respectively. For services we have a common world         price
     equation    where the weights are world trade shares of services of each
     country.
                                          —25—



5•     Qirrent Account Equation
      In order to obtain current account equations for each region, the deter-
      mination of aid flows, factor Incomes and net private transfers in the
       current account are needed • The total amount of aid received by non—oil
       LDCa is projected exogenously. The Increase In total aid flow is allo-
       cated between donor countries according to constant 1975 shares • Net interest
       incomes from abroad are generated as a multiple of "world interest rate,"
       exogenous to the model, and cumulated current account of each country.

       Other terms in the current account, i.e., net private transfers and net
       labor Incomes from abroad are determined exogenously outside the model.
       Finally we have a current account equation for each region. For centrally
       planned economies current account balance is fixed outside the model and
       the value of imports is the adjusting item, i.e., we assume that this
       region uses all its foreign currency receipts to buy Imports. All the
       building blocks of the model are constructed in a way which automatically
       takes into account the world trade balance and current account constraints.
6.     The Effect of Import Prices on the Domestic Price    Level
       There   are several   ways through which the domestic price level can be
       affected   by international price developments. First, domestic prices
       may be changed if there is substitution between tradeable and    domestic-
       ally produced goods. Price effects from the tradeable goods sector can       a
       also channel through labour markets to the prices of non—tradeable goods.
       In                                      inflationary pressures may happen
            addition, the abosrption of external
      through prices of Imported raw materials and petroleum, which calls for a for-
      mulation of a cost—push model. Here we limit ourselves only to the latter
      approach. Pt this stage we also ignore inflation coming from domestic
      developments.!" Thus in the model variation in the domestic price level
      comes through changes In import prices of goods and petroleum. It should
      be noted here that we have assumed no change in relative prices between
      traded final and intermediate goods, and that is why Import price of goods
      (excluding oil) serves as a proxy for Import price of raw materials in the
      domestic price equation. This naturally means that the model shows only the
      inflationary effect of the pressure coming from Import price Increases. Never-
      theless, it adds one important link to the model and thus provides a more
      plausible approximation of reality than a purely exogenous treabnent of the
      domestic price level.
        work is In progress to capture effects of different money growth rates      on
             rates and exchange rates.

7.   Exchange Rate Block
     From the early 1970e onwards countries adopted a wide variety of exchange
     rate systems. Major        countries have had more or less floating ex—
     change rates since 1973 while several small OECD economies and developing
     countries chose to peg their currencies to some basket or a single currency)-j
     We have tried to capture some basic lines of the present policy-": the
     currencies of the big seven OECD countries are floating, smaller OECD
     countries and developing countries peg their currencies in an adjustable
     way to a trade weighted basket; oil trade and Centrally Planned Economies'
     trade with the rest of the world is In dollars. With the integration of
     exchange rate equations into trade model, it can be used to analyse out-
     comes from choices of different exchange rate regimes.

     The trade block of the model generates projections for the current account.
     The link from the current account to the exchange rate for floaters is
     obtained by applying the asset market approach (see e.g. Branson, 1977)
     to determine (dollar/local currency) exchange rates for Canada, France
     Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom. With flexible exchange rates
     the sun of balances on capital account and current account for these coun-
     tries is identically zero (central bank foreign reserves stay constant) e If
     the current account shows a surplus, the capital account remains in deficit
     and the private sector accunulates foreign assets. According to our equa-
     tions this moves the exchange rates in the short run. Changes in the ex-
     change rates will affect trade flows and change the current account which in
     turn moves the exchange rate. In the model, a current account deficit
     (surplus) of country i will cause its currency to depreciate (appreciate).
     This In turn improves (worsens) the current account •   The long—run dynamic
     adjustment thus happens through the interaction of exchange rate equations
     and the trade block. The effect of the exchange rate movement on trade
     takes time and enough time must pass to bring the current account to zero.
     However, In the projections we would not necessarily expect to see balanced
     current accounts as exports and imports are moved through growth rates of
     GDP which may differ from country to country. Smaller OECD countries and
     non—oil LDCs peg their currencies to a trade weighted basket in an adjustable
     1/ Branson and Papaefatiatiou (1978) offer an extensive discussion of criteria
        of choosing an exchange rate regime, see also Heller (1976).
     2/ The major drawback here may be that the present EMS is not ndelled. This
        is an important topic to be integrated into the model.

way. The value of country i's currency against its trading partners'

currencies   is changed according to a criteria which says that country     i

is   devaluing   (revaluing) its currency against other currencies when it is

running a current account deficit (surplus) by a certain amount of its

relative (current account over value of exports) current account deficit

(surplus). The devaluation (revaluation) percentage is, however, dependent

on last period's policy: if      a   country devalued (revalued) last period and

if it is still running a deficit (surplus) this period's devalution

(revaluation) percentage will be smaller.



IV. C. Trade and Exchange Rate Projections

         This    section compares three simulations with the trade—exchange rate
model described above. The simulations were designed to illustrate the
flexibility of the model and the type of information it generates.1


Exogenous Inputs

         For these simulations it is assumed that GDP follows the path described

in section II for the twenty OECD countries. For Greece, New Zealand, Turkey,

the non—oil LDC's, OPEC, and the CPE's, the GDP growth rate is arbitrarily set.

The aid inflow to the LDC's is taken from World Bank 1976 SIMLINK projections.

The capital inf low to the CPE's declines steadily from its 1976 value to zero

by 1990. The final exogenous time series are the price of oil and OPEC imports.

For these runs we set the oil price index equal to the actual for 1975 through

1979 (as of July 1980) and to the 1979 value for 1981 through 1990. The OPEC

imports are equal to actual from 1975 through 1979 and then increase so that

OPEC has a zero balance on current account by 1990.



    'The simulations reported here were carried out at NBER using the Harvard
Computing Center's ITEL/AS5 with a Fortran program written by Dennis Warner.

The Three Simulations

       Three simulations are compared here. First a flexible exchange rate

simulation is compared with a fixed exchange rate simulation. The fixed—rate

simulation is of no interest in itself. It is useful only in that it allows

an illustration of the importance of the flexible—rate model. The third

simulation is a flexible—rate run with an exogenous increase in Germany's

rate of growth of actual GDP. The comparison between this and the original

flexible rate run is meant to illustrate some aspects of the importance of

Germany as a "locomotive" in pulling the European train toward potential

output paths.


The Standard Simulation

       Tables 11 and 12 display some results from the standard flexible—

exchange rate run. The figures in Table 11 show differences between the flexible

rate and fixed exchange rate simulations. In this table the cumulative

current account figures show that impossibly large net foreign asset positions

would result if exchange rates were fixed. Germany, Italy, the U.K., and

the U.S. would accumulate very large net foreign assets without flexible rates

while the LDC's and several smaller OECD countries would have huge net

liabilities. In general, the fastest growing countries (the LDC's and the

smaller OECD countries), are forced to depreciate to reduce their foreign lia-

bilities while the relatively slow—growing major OECD countries appreciate and

decrease their foreign assets compared to a fixed rate regime.

       Table 11 shows also the changes in export market penetration caused by

the flexible exchange rate system. Countries which depreciate gain market share

and conversely for the appreciating countries.

        Table 12 gives further results for the standard flexible rate

simulation; the real exchange rates, world market shares, balance on petroleum,

and incremental inflation rates. All of the large OECD countries, except France,

and OPEC, CPES, Australia, and Switzerland have an increased real exchange rate

at the end of the simulation while the rest depreciate to varying degrees.

        Under a fixed exchange rate regime with high growth, the largest gainers

in   world market shares are the fast growing countries; at the top of the list
come Japan, OPEC and other LDC's. At the other end slow growing "mature" OECD

countries such as the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Switzerland,

Belgium, the Netherlands and Scandinavian countries are losing markets. These

changes are due to two types of effects. They can happen through market growth

depending on whether countries are exporting to the fast or slow growing markets

or through distribution effect: in the modela country with higher growth of

capacity output relative to that of its competitors means that the country in

question is capturing markets.

         The balance of payments difficulties arising from different growth rates

of outputs under fixed exchange rate regimes imply potential pressures on countries'

exchange rates or on internal balance in the longer run. The flexible exchange

rate run produces one possibility to look at the pressures on exchange rates

of different countries and also to look at the consequences of this on the

market shares of different countries through changes in relative price competi-

tiveness. The projection shows the orders of magnitudes of these changes (see

real exchange rate column in Table 12). Japan, German, the Netherlands, Switzer—

land, Belgium, and the United Kingdom are appreciating their currencies in

real terms mostly due to a tendency to run current account surpluses under fixed

exchange rates. Surpluses and thus appreciation would occur, however, for

different reasons.
                                     —32—



       Fast growing Japan is capturing markets but it also exports a remarkable

share to fast growing markets of LDC's. The latter is also true for Germany

being among major exporters to developing countries. The United Kingdom's

surplus is generated mainly due to slowly growing import demand but also to

fast growing markets for their exports in LDC's. The appreciation is also

reflected in market shares: in general, appreciating countries are losing

markets due to the weakening of their price competitiveness when compared to

the projection under the regime of fixed exchange rates. Scandinavian countries,

Mediterranean countries and non—oil LDC's are devaluing their currencies in

real terms as a consequence of running current account deficits with fixed

exchange rates. This is increasing their shares of world markets from what

they would be under the assumption of fixed exchange rates.

       It should be noted here that the good export performance of Japan and

non—oil LDC's in the model is due to different reasons. Japan's success

comes from a better non—price competitiveness measured by relative growth

of capacity output (i.e., expanding productive capacity is assumed to be linked

with rapid introduction of technological innovation, intensified export promo-

tion, etc.), while at the same time Japan is experiencing losses due to the

appreciating yen. In the case of non—oil LDC's, both better price and non—price

competitiveness are helping to increase market share. The channel through in-

crease price—competitiveness due to a large devaluation of LDC's currencies is

much more important as indicated by comparison between fixed and flexible ex-

change rate runs of Table 11; under fixed rate assumptions non—oil LDC's world

market shares increase from 11.1 percent in 1979 to 12.6 percent in 1990 but

jumps 4.4 percentage points from this to 15.5 percent due to the introduction

of the flexible exchange rate regime. It is obvious that the flexible exchange

rate run overestimates non—oil LDC's share.

         The final columns in Table 13 show the incremental inflation rates.

Since there is no money growth or excess demand for goods in this model there

are only two causes for an increase in the domestic GDP deflators: exogenous

oil price increases and exchange rate changes. The first of the two columns

shows the average increase in the inflation rate due to the exogenous oil price

increase while the second gives the changes in inflation rates due to changes

of exchange rates. For the appreciating countries there are deflationary pres-

sures while for depreciating countries there are inflationary pressures. The

effects of exchange rate movements on the domestic price level are more pro-

nounced for the smaller and more open economies.


Higher   Growth in Germany
         For this simulation it   was   assumed that   Germany's   growth rate of output
was, on average, one percentage point higher than in the standard run. Here
we compare the results of the two simulations to illustrate some of the cross—

country linkages present in the model.

         Due to the higher growth Germany's current account is lowered (see Table

13) and its real exchange rate depreciates by 23% by 1990. This depreciation

lowers the relative price of German exports, giving it an additional 1.4% of the

world's non—oil goods market by 1990 and causing a 0.4% increase in the average

domestic inflation rate.

         The countries affected most strongly are France, Italy, the United

Kingdom, Belgium, and the Netherlands. For all countries there are two

primary channels of influence; the exchange rate determination system and the

current account. France's, Italy's, and the U.K.'s exchange rates are linked

directly to Germany's current account. Initially Germany's current account

worsens due to higher import demand, while theirs improves because of higher

exports to Germany. This causes France's, Italy's and the U.N.'s exchange rates

to appreciate and Germany's to depreciate. In the longer run the appreciation

of the three currencies outweigh the direct stimulus from Germany's import

demand and the current accounts weaken. All three lose market shares and

experience a decline in their inflation rates.

       For the smaller European countries the effects are somewhat different.

With the exception of Ireland, whose exchange rate is closely linked to the

U.K.'s, all experience an improved trade, and, hence, current account balance

because of increased German demand. AU of their exchange rates appreciate

slightly and their inflation rates are lowered. Here it must be remembered

that output is always kept at an exogenous level so there is no labor market

pressure on costs, only pressure from the change In prices of imported goods.

       The effects on the non—European countries are relatively small. OPEC

does experience a significant increase in its current account due to increased

oil exports to Germany. The effects on Canada, Japan, the U.S., Australia,

and New Zealand are very small.
