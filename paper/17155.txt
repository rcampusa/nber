                                             ABSTRACT

Title I of the 1965 Elementary and Secondary Education Act substantially increased federal aid for
education, with the goal of expanding educational opportunity. Combining the timing of the program’s
introduction with variation in its intensity, we find that Title I increased school spending by 46 cents
on the dollar in the average school district in the South and increased spending nearly dollar-for-dollar
in Southern districts with little scope for local offset. Based on this differential fiscal response, we
find that increases in school budgets from Title I decreased high school dropout rates for whites, but
not blacks.

I.       Introduction

         Intergovernmental grants are widely-used tools that may preserve the efficiency benefits

associated with local provision of public goods while addressing equity concerns and cross-

jurisdictional externalities, as described in the theory of fiscal federalism (Musgrave, 1959;

Oates, 1972, 1999). However, the intent of the granting government may be undermined if

receiving jurisdictions crowd out intergovernmental grants by reducing their own fiscal effort or

spend the grant ineffectively. The latter requirement may be nontrivial in policy contexts in

which the production function for the outcome of ultimate interest is not fully understood.

         Perhaps nowhere are these issues more salient in the U.S. than in education finance.

Elementary and secondary education have long been provided by local school districts, but the

importance of intergovernmental grants has increased over the past 50 years as both states and

the federal government have contributed a larger share of total revenue. A large empirical

literature has explored how school finance regimes at the state level have affected school

spending (for example, Fisher and Papke, 2000; Hoxby, 2001). Per-pupil expenditure rose

dramatically in recent decades, and a largely separate empirical literature examines how school

spending during this era has affected student outcomes (see Hanushek, 1986, 1997 for reviews).

Far fewer studies have examined both issues simultaneously or using variation from their policy

origins.1

         We do so in this paper, analyzing how Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education

Act of 1965 (ESEA) affected school spending and high school dropout rates in the years

immediately following its introduction and the role of local institutional context in mediating

1
  Card and Payne (2002) use a national sample to examine how changes in the progressivity of school spending
induced by state school finance reforms changed the distribution of SAT scores by income at the school district
level. A related literature looks within individual states at effects of school finance reforms on local spending and
outcomes: see Clark (2003) on Kentucky, Guryan (2001) on Massachusetts, and Papke (2005, 2008) and Roy (2011)
on Michigan.

these effects.2 Title I ESEA had a dramatic effect on federal education spending: During the fall

of 1965, Congress doubled federal expenditure on education by appropriating almost $1 billion

to the new program, equivalent to $7 billion in 2009. The program was intended to assist school

districts in providing programs for “educationally disadvantaged” children, but limited

enforcement made the Title I grants highly fungible in practice, allowing them to take the form

of general education aid (Martin and McClure, 1969).

        We focus the present analysis on the impacts of Title I in the former Confederacy, which

we refer to as the South. The South benefited disproportionately from the program and received

grants that were relatively large, representing more than 20 percent of existing school spending

in the average district. There was also wide variation across districts in the capacity to

expropriate these large grants, making it possible for us to test whether the program affected

educational attainment only where it increased spending on schools. The effects of Title I on the

financing of schools and educational attainment are of particular historical interest for the South,

where vast racial inequities in school resources and educational attainment developed after

Reconstruction (Margo, 1990, Card and Krueger, 1992, 1996; Ashenfelter, Collins, and Yoon,

2006), and where education spending was quite low and educational outcomes poor by national

standards even for whites. It was stark inequalities such as these that Title I sought to remedy.

        We begin by evaluating the impact of Title I on school finance, combining the timing of

the program’s introduction with variation across school districts in its intensity, which was tied

to child poverty in 1960. Using newly-collected data and controlling for other local

characteristics, we estimate that Title I grants increased school spending by 46 cents on the dollar


2
 Our analysis contributes to a growing literature on the effects of the introduction of other “War on Poverty”
programs, including Medicare (Almond, Chay, and Greenstone, 2006; Finkelstein, 2007), Head Start (Ludwig and
Miller, 2007), and the Food Stamp program (Hoynes and Schanzenbach, 2009; Almond, Hoynes, and
Schanzenbach, 2011).

                                                       2
in the average Southern district and crowded out local revenue, not state aid. These findings are

robust to the inclusion of a wide range of controls, and the changes in the relationship between

child poverty and fiscal outcomes are closely timed with the introduction of Title I, supporting a

causal interpretation of the findings. At least in the South, the progressivity that characterizes

school finance today began to emerge well before the well-studied state school finance

equalization movement — albeit on a much smaller scale — in the mid-1960s as Title I went

into effect.3

         We next show that Southern institutions made crowd-out of Title I less than would have

been predicted based on the income elasticity demand for education spending alone. In

particular, Title I increased school spending significantly more — nearly dollar-for-dollar — in

districts where the Title I grant was large relative to pre-program local revenue. These districts

were arguably constrained by the large state grants and mandatory local contributions for

education characteristic of the South and unable to reduce local effort as much as they would

have liked, if at all. This finding demonstrates the importance of accounting for institutional

environments in predicting and evaluating the effects of intergovernmental grants. For example,

intergovernmental grants should only affect the ultimate outcome of interest in institutional

settings where they increase spending.4

         In this vein, we exploit the differential fiscal response by scope for local offset to identify

the effects of Title I-induced spending on high school dropout rates of 18 and 19 year olds. The

results suggest that "money mattered": each additional $100 of Title I-induced annual current

expenditure per pupil (2009 dollars) reduced white dropout rates by about 3 percentage points
3
  Margo (1990) and Goldin and Katz (2008) discuss the evolution of school finance earlier in the 20th century.
4
  In a different policy context, Baicker and Staiger (2005) estimate that in states with institutional features that
enabled expropriation, about half of federal Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital funding was crowded out by
state governments, but the program was still a cost-effective means of reducing infant mortality. Van der Klaauw
(2008), on the other hand, shows that "Title I schools" in New York City had no additional resources, so not
surprisingly, there was no effect of Title I revenue on educational outcomes.

                                                         3
over the 1960s. For blacks, by contrast, the estimates are statistically insignificant and wrong-

signed, and, though consistent with moderate benefits of Title I-induced increases in school

spending, precise enough to rule out effect sizes as large as those found for whites.

        Overall, our findings suggest that Title I can account for over 20 percent of the growth in

school spending and about one third of the decline in white high school dropout in the South

over the 1960s. Local control over the use of Title I funds may have limited their scope to

improve outcomes for blacks, possibly because there was little to prevent school districts from

directing Title I funds to schools attended by whites, which remained largely separate from those

attended by blacks in the South through 1968.5 Consistent with Reber's (2010) analysis for

Louisiana, however, we also find that, separate from the effects of Title I, spending increased

more and black high school dropout rates fell more in districts with higher black enrollment

shares, where blacks experienced larger improvements in school quality over the 1960s as a

result of desegregation.6

        The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section II provides background on

the Title I program. Section III describes a simple framework for analyzing intergovernmental

grants, incorporating important institutional features of Southern school finance. Section IV

analyzes the fiscal effects of the program, and Section V examines heterogeneity in these effects

across districts. In Section VI, we assess the impact of Title I-induced expenditure on high

school dropout rates by race. Section VII concludes.

II.     Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act



5
  In the 1968 Supreme Court ruling in Green v. New Kent County (391 U.S. 430), districts could no longer defend
racially-identifiable schools by nominally offering “freedom of choice” plans. See Cascio et al. (2008) for more on
the timing of Southern desegregation.
6
  This result is most analagous to Reber (2010), but a larger literature suggests that both desegregation and pre-
desegregation narrowing of black-white school quality gaps benefited blacks on a variety of outcomes (Card and
Krueger, 1992; Ashenfelter, Collins, and Yoon, 2006; Guryan, 2004; Johnson, 2011).

                                                         4
           Title I funds were first allocated to school districts in the fall of 1965.7 In keeping with its

policy origins as part of President Johnson’s “War on Poverty,” the Title I formula relied heavily

on child poverty counts in determining allocations to school districts. At the program’s start,

districts received a state-specific payment (the “state factor”) per eligible child. Eligibility counts

were largely determined by the number of 5 to 17 year olds with family income below $2000 in

the 1960 Census. The state factor was initially equal to 50 percent of statewide mean current

expenditures, net of federal revenue, per pupil, lagged two years. Starting in fall 1967, however,

variation in the state factor remained only for those states that spent above the national average,

and the allocation per eligible child in all other states (including all of the states in our sample

except Florida) was leveled up to the national average. In the South, this meant that child poverty

was essentially the sole determinant of Title I grants after 1967 (U.S. DHEW, 1969).

           The influx of federal funds to the South from Title I was unprecedented. Figure I shows

that the federal government was a negligible source of revenue for the average Southern school

district prior to passage of ESEA in 1965, with the limited federal funds largely disbursed

through Aid to Federally Impacted Areas and the National Defense Education Act. As shown in

the second column of Table I, in 1964, federal revenue in the average Southern district in our

sample only amounted to $65 per pupil (in real 2009 dollars) – about 3.5 percent of per-pupil

current expenditures. By the end of the decade, per-pupil federal revenue had increased

dramatically, by $420 (column (5)), and had come to represent 17 percent of per-pupil current

expenditure in the average Southern district.

           There was little about Title I’s enforcement that ensured the program would translate into

increased compensatory services for poor children. In the early years of ESEA, regulations

specified only that Title I funds should “supplement and not supplant” local funds; while the

                                                            5
Department of Health, Education, and Welfare conducted district-level audits, it did not require

districts to return funds that were misused. The program was criticized as a fungible supplement

to general revenue as opposed to a targeted and defined compensatory intervention, most

influentially in a 1969 report by the NAACP Legal Defense Fund (Martin and McClure, 1969).

Such criticisms sparked a series of regulations and legislative changes still embedded in the

system today, which is often criticized as being overly restrictive and compliance-focused. But

even today’s complex regulatory framework and serious enforcement efforts cannot prevent

districts from appropriating Title I funds, either for private consumption or for other educational

purposes.8

        Thus, Title I essentially took the form of a restricted block grant for education to a local

school district during the period of study. Accordingly, we consider current expenditure on

education to be the "targeted good" of the program. To the extent that Title I did raise current

expenditure, it could easily have been focused on instructional areas or groups of students other

than those nominally designated as its beneficiaries. This is particularly interesting for the South,

where prior to 1968, most districts operated racially identifiable schools and may therefore have

had some ability to direct additional funding disproportionately to whites.

III.    A Framework for Understanding Fiscal Responses to Title I Grants in the South

        How much Title I translated into higher current expenditure on education depends on

how much lower levels of government offset Title I revenue by reducing their own contributions

to education spending. Both local and state governments could have responded to the influx of

federal funding, so we consider each in turn.

III.A. Local District Responses to Title I Grants

8
  For example, see Gordon (2004) on how maintenance of effort requirements do not prevent crowd out of local
revenue and Roza (2010) on how comparability requirements do not ensure that Title I funds are concentrated in the
poorest schools within districts. Cohen and Moffitt (2009) discuss the range of implementation challenges.

                                                        6
         We begin with a standard neoclassical model where a local school district (presumably

the median voter) chooses its level of consumption of educational services and all other goods,

including private consumption.9 Districts can reallocate consumption by altering the tax rate. We

incorporate into the standard model two important institutional features of Southern state school

finance systems during the 1960s. First, state aid was significant, accounting for well over half of

the typical school district’s total revenue (Figure I and Table I), compared to about 30 percent

outside the South. The vast majority of this aid (typically upwards of 80 percent) was distributed

through minimum foundation programs (MFPs), which took the form of a restricted block grant

from the school district perspective.10 Second, school districts could not reduce local revenue

below some minimum, since state constitutions or MFPs in all states in our sample imposed a

minimum required contribution to education on local school districts. Both of these factors – the

magnitude of state education aid and minimum required local contributions to education – would

have limited the scope for Southern school districts to crowd out Title I grants.

         Figure II illustrates the choice problem for a Southern district before and after Title I

funds were distributed. The innermost budget constraint (BC1) shows the pure local finance case

where prices are normalized to one and the district could allocate total income I freely between

educational services (E) and all other goods (C), including private consumption. BC2 accounts

for state aid and the minimum local contribution with a parallel outward shift of the budget


9
  The median voter in the South would have been white and Southern school boards would have been controlled by
whites throughout this period in most or all of the districts in our sample (see U.S. Commission on Civil Rights,
1968). Schools were also largely segregated by race until at least 1969, raising the possibility that funding was not
allocated equally across schools within districts, particularly by race. This is important in interpreting the effects of
Title I on educational outcomes by race, and we return to this issue below. For simplicity, we do not incorporate race
into the model explicitly.
10
   Not all of the programs were referred to as MFPs, but those that were not had the same general structure. MFPs
contrast to many modern state school finance regimes which employ various forms of matching and therefore
change relative prices. Grants under state MFPs were not pure block grants in the sense that some district choices
(e.g. the distribution of teacher experience) could affect the amount of the grant. We abstract from these issues here,
since they likely had small effects and in any case are unrelated to the Title I grant.

                                                           7
constraint, and thus represents the scenario before Title I. A district had to spend at least as much

as the state grant plus the minimum local contribution on education, so the maximum spending

on C was I less the minimum local contribution; that is, the dashed part of the budget constraint

was inaccessible. The introduction of Title I caused a further parallel shift in the budget

constraint to BC3 (the figure depicts a large Title I grant for illustrative purposes). After Title I,

the district had to spend at least as much as previously required plus the Title I grant on

education, so the dashed part of the new budget constraint was inaccessible.

         The Title I grant produced only an income effect. School districts would have liked to

increase their spending on both E and C according to the relevant income elasticities, in which

case the increase in E would have been less than the size of the grant.11 A district would have

increased E more than this only if its optimal bundle was on the inaccessible (dashed) portion of

the budget constraint, in which case, it would have been forced to the corner (point Z). The

presence of state aid and minimum local contributions in the South increased the chances that

some districts were constrained and increased E more than the income elasticity would imply,

and this effect would have been larger when either the state grant or the minimum local

contribution was larger. The figure illustrates an extreme case where spending increases one-for-

one with Title I: the district at the corner before the implementation of Title I (point X), would

have liked to move to point Y on BC3, given the income elasticity of education demand, but was

restricted to choose the new corner, Z.

         Much of the literature on intergovernmental grants finds that grants increase spending on

the targeted good more than would be implied by the income elasticity of demand. This is

referred to as a “flypaper effect,” since the grant disproportionately “sticks where it hits.” In


11
  In the language of Bradford and Oates (1971), this assumes that a sole grant to the collectivity of individuals in the
school district has identical impact as a set of individual-level grants summing to the same amount.

                                                           8
some cases, these effects have been demonstrated to be statistical artifacts generated by omitted

variables, such as local preferences or other characteristics determining the magnitude of the

grant (Knight, 2002; Gordon, 2004). In others, the effect is attributed either to some disconnect

between the true preferences of voters and spending chosen by governments (e.g., due to

“bureaucratic capture,” when a constituency for a specific program develops and is able to

prevent voters from reducing spending), or to behavioral tendencies that lead voters to view

spending out of local taxes differently than spending out of intergovernmental grants (see Hines

and Thaler (1995) for a review). The framework above suggests that if institutional constraints

limit the scope for offset, grants should generate larger increases in spending on the targeted

good than predicted by the income elasticity even assuming the rational choices of the median

voter are not suppressed or altered by bureaucratic actions.12 We assess the importance of such

constraints in Section V by examining whether spending on education increased more as a result

of Title I among districts that were more likely to face constraints on local offset.

III.B. State Responses to Title I Grants

         The objective function of state governments is more complicated than that of a school

district due to its additional policy functions beyond education, and we do not explicitly model it

here. We can say, however, how a state government wishing to replicate the pre-Title I

distribution of total aid (state plus federal) across districts after Title I was implemented would

have responded. First, the state would have reduced the average grant to account for the fact that

on average districts were receiving more federal aid. Second, aid to poorer districts, which

received larger Title I grants, would have been reduced relative to aid to richer districts.


12
  Relatedly, Brooks and Phillips (2010) find that federal funds stimulate higher levels of expenditure in local
jurisdictions subject to tax and expenditure limits (TELs); they posit that TELs constrain such jurisdictions to
suboptimally low levels of spending prior to receipt of the intergovernmental grant, explaining the differential
responsiveness.

                                                          9
         Our empirical strategy allows for identification only of the latter type of response —

whether states changed how progressively they distributed funds. Allocation of funding under

the MFPs typical of the South during this period was formula-based, and the poverty rate did not

directly enter the funding formula in any state in our sample; thus, it might appear difficult for

states to significantly change the progressivity of funding without undertaking a major reform.

On the other hand, the formulas were complex, with inputs that may have been correlated with

poverty rates, and in the early 1960s state aid was indeed moderately progressive.13 Ultimately, it

is an empirical question to what extent states were able and willing to change the progressivity of

their funding formulas in response to Title I.

IV.      Fiscal Reponses to Title I

IV.A. Empirical Strategy

         Recall that Title I funds were initially allocated by a simple linear rule: districts received

a constant amount of federal funds for each Title I eligible student. Title I eligibility, in turn, was

determined primarily based on the number of 5 to 17 year-olds with family income below $2,000

in the 1960 Census. A transparent approach to estimating the fiscal impacts of Title I’s

introduction is therefore to explore how the gradient of a fiscal outcome in “initial” district child

poverty, defined using these eligibility counts, changed over the 1960s. The identifying

assumption is that, if the Title I program had not been introduced, there would not have been a

break in this gradient as of 1965.

         More formally, we begin with the estimating equation

(1)                             ydst =δd + γst + θt child_povertyd + x'd βt + εdst .



13
  Reber (2011) shows that the state of Louisiana was able to redistribute state aid substantially in response to
desegregation (directing additional funding to districts with higher black enrollment shares) by subtly manipulating
the parameters of the existing MFP.

                                                         10
The dependent variable ydst represents one of four fiscal outcomes, each measured in per-pupil

terms and in real 2009 dollars – current expenditure and revenue by source (federal, state, and

local) – in district d in state s in the fall of year t. child_povertyd is the initial child poverty rate in

district d, which we define as the ratio of the district’s Title I eligibility count in 1965, based

largely on the 1960 Census, to its 1960 enrollment. This measure captures the effective poverty

rate for distribution of Title I funds had district enrollment not diverged from its 1960 level. δd is

a district intercept, which accounts for unobserved differences across districts in school finance

that are fixed over time; γst is a state-by-year specific intercept, which accounts for any year-

specific shocks to fiscal outcomes common to all districts in a state; and xd is a vector including

other district characteristics. We estimate model (1) using annual school finance data from 1961

to 1969 collected from print publications from the nine Southern states where such data are

available.14 All the data and sources are described in detail in Appendix A.

         The coefficients of interest in model (1) are the θt ’s, which characterize the time path in

fiscal outcomes in initially richer versus initially poorer districts. If Title I raised school

expenditures, we would expect to see an increase in the poverty gradient in per-pupil current

expenditure — i.e., in the progressivity of spending per pupil — as of 1965. Note, however, that

model (1) does not force the effects of Title I to be isolated to the period in which the program

was in place or to be the same across all years after the program was implemented. Rather,

model (1) is a flexible specification that allows us to explore not only whether the poverty

gradient in school spending changed in 1965, but also whether the poverty gradient in spending




14
  These states are Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee,
and Virginia. Most districts in these states are included in our estimation sample, which is described in Appendix A.
We are not able to incorporate districts from Arkansas and Texas – the two other former Confederate states – due to
limitations in available data.

was already changing in the early 1960s. If Title I affected fiscal outcomes, pre-program changes

in the poverty gradient should be small relative to post-program changes.

        Model (1) allows for time-varying effects of a vector of other initial district

characteristics. We are most concerned about controlling for district characteristics correlated

with initial poverty and associated with changes in demand for school spending in the mid-

1960s. In this vein, the most important threat to identification stems from school desegregation.

The likelihood that the average Southern district had any blacks in school with whites increased

sharply between 1964 and 1966, in part because the Civil Rights Act (CRA) tied receipt of Title I

funds to desegregation (Cascio, et al., 2010). The desegregation required was limited, and most

likely did not change the (white) median voter’s demand for education funding, as racially

separate schools were maintained over this period. But between 1968 and 1970, the

desegregation required for CRA compliance and by federal courts quickly intensified, and

racially identifiable schools in the South were largely dismantled (Cascio, et al., 2008). The

elimination of separate black and white schools required a major reorganization of schools and

may have changed demand for school spending on public education. Demand may have fallen –

particularly if whites left the public schools in large numbers15 – or increased as whites

attempted to increase the spending in newly integrated schools to the level to which they were

accustomed in their schools before desegregation. Reber (2011) finds evidence in favor of the

latter in a study of Louisiana over this period.

        Following Reber (2011), our primary control for the effects of desegregation on district

finances is the district’s initial (1960) black enrollment share. Despite a half-century of progress

towards convergence, black-white school resource gaps remained larger in districts with higher


15
  See Clotfelter (1976), Reber (2011), and Baum-Snow and Lutz (2011) for evidence on white flight to private
schools as a result of desegregation in the South.

                                                       12
black enrollment shares at mid-century (Margo, 1990; Card and Krueger, 1992; Reber 2011). As

a result, maintaining whites’ school quality required larger increases in funding in blacker

districts. Reber (2011) shows that such funding increases began in Louisiana as early as 1966.

Because black enrollment share is positively correlated with child_povertyd , omitting it would

affect estimates of the θt ’s in model (1). However, once (linear) black enrollment share is

included in the model, controlling for it more flexibly or adding other controls for the intensity of

desegregation in the South during the 1960s does little to affect our estimates.

       In addition to 1960 black enrollment share, our main specification also controls for the

share of the vote cast for Strom Thurmond in the 1948 presidential election, a proxy for

segregationist preferences, and for 1960 enrollment, a measure of district size, both of which

predict the pace of desegregation in the South over the period of study (Cascio, et al., 2008). In

robustness checks, we also include controls for the share of whites enrolled in private schools in

spring 1970, the extent of school desegregation, and an indicator for whether the district was

desegregating under court order in fall 1970, each of which might be related to the intensity of

desegregation. Summary statistics for the independent variables are presented in Table II. In the

average district, the 1960 share of children in poverty and the black enrollment share were both

about one third, and average enrollment was just under 7,000 students. The average district was

in a county where 34 percent of the electorate voted for Thurmond in 1948.

       We also explore alternative hypotheses for changes in the poverty gradient in school

finances starting in 1965, including increases in black political power following the Voting

Rights Act (VRA) of 1965 and funding increases under Head Start, another program for poor

children implemented in the mid-1960s that sometimes channeled funds through school districts.

As a proxy for the former, we control for the black voter registration rate in the early 1960s, an


                                                 13
indicator for how suppressed the vote was before VRA (Alt, 1995).16 As a proxy for the latter,

we include an indicator for whether the district was in one of the 300 poorest counties, which

received special grant-writing assistance for Head Start in the 1960s (Ludwig and Miller, 2007).

Once the black share of enrollment is included in the regression, the coefficients of interest are

little affected by the inclusion of a wide range of controls.

IV.B. Graphical Evidence

         We first present the estimates of the flexible model graphically. Figure III plots year-

specific coefficients on child_povertyd from model (1) estimated for the key fiscal variables. In

addition to district and state-by-year fixed effects, our baseline specification includes the year-

specific effects of characteristics that were measured before the implementation of Title I and are

available for the full sample: the 1960 black enrollment share, 1960 district enrollment (natural

log), 1948 Thurmond vote share (quintile indicators), and whether the district is in one of the 300

poorest counties. The standard errors are clustered on county to account for possible correlation

in the error terms over time within county.17 The point estimates are represented by dots; the x's

denote 95% confidence intervals.18

         Panel A shows that the poverty gradient in per-pupil federal revenue was little changed in

the early 1960s but increased in 1965, the first year in which Title I funds were distributed. The

estimates for per-pupil current expenditure, shown in Panel B, follow the same pattern: the

progressivity of school spending trended little in the early 1960s but increased in 1965,

suggesting that Title I played a causal role in tipping the balance of school expenditure from


16
   The exact year black voter registration is measured differs across states subject to data availability.
17
   We cluster standard errors on county because we use county-level information to predict district-level poverty
rates (see Appendix A), and because Thurmond vote share is measured at the county level.
18
   Only the trend in the coefficients on child_povertyd , and not the level, is identified in model (1); we therefore
rescale the graph so that the 1961 coefficient is equal to the coefficient on child_povertyd in 1961 from a cross-
sectional regression including all of the same controls except district fixed effects.

                                                           14
richer to poorer districts in the South. However, the increase in the poverty gradient in per-pupil

school expenditure was less than the increase in the poverty gradient in per-pupil federal

funding: Title I funds did not translate one-for-one to higher spending on education. Panel C

shows that the distribution of state aid was somewhat progressive throughout the 1960s, but the

progressivity did not change after 1965, suggesting that state governments did not offset Title I

grants.19 On the other hand, Panel D shows that the poverty gradient in local effort became more

negative after 1965, suggestive of local effort declining in response to Title I.

         In sum, Figure III shows that, relative to richer districts, poorer districts experienced

larger increases in federal revenue and current expenditure per pupil and larger declines in local

revenue per pupil over the 1960s. These changes were closely timed with the introduction of

Title I in 1965, suggesting that the introduction of Title I increased spending on education, but

less than one for one, as local districts responded by reducing their own effort.

IV.C. Change Regressions

         To facilitate tests of statistical significance for changes in the poverty gradient associated

with Title I, to assess the sensitivity of the results to further controls, and to present results with

more interpretable scaling, we estimate regressions for changes in the school finance variables

around the time of Title I implementation. Differencing (1) across any two years, we arrive at:

(2)                               ∆yds = γs + θchild_povertyd + xd 'β + ∆εds .




19
   Our research design does not allow us to identify the effects of Title I on average state aid, but what evidence
there is suggests that state offset on this margin was likely minimal. First, as shown in Figure I, there is a strong
upward trend in state revenue over the late 1960s, although of course this trend may have been even steeper in the
absence of Title I. Second, if states that received more Title I funding responded by reducing average state funding,
we might expect to see a negative relationship between the state-level poverty rate and average state funding. In fact,
the state fixed effects in the model for changes in per-pupil state revenues — a measure of the average change in the
state — are uncorrelated with the state poverty rate. Ultimately, we do not have a credible source of variation with
which to identify the average state response, so we view this evidence as suggestive.

                                                          15
The state fixed effects, γs , account for trends in fiscal outcomes common to districts in the same

state, and the coefficients on the controls, β, give changes over time in the gradients of fiscal

outcomes in a district’s initial characteristics. θ is the coefficient of interest, indicating the extent

to which the gradient of fiscal outcomes in initial district child poverty changed over time. The

district fixed effect in (1) is absorbed in taking the first difference.

         We estimate model (2) for long changes around the introduction of Title I – one post-

program (1964 to 1969) and one pre-program (1961 to 1964). The post-program period is

sufficiently long to allow time for districts and states to respond to the new program, such that

the results might reflect a new equilibrium.20 In practice, the results are not sensitive to the

choice of end year. Summary statistics for the dependent variables are presented in the last two

columns of Table I.

         The first column of Table III presents estimates of model (2) for the post-program

change, using the same controls included in the regressions plotted in Figure III; the coefficient

on child_povertyd is thus simply the difference in coefficients for 1964 and 1969 shown in the

figure. In the model for the change in per-pupil federal funding, in Panel A, the coefficient on the

1960 child poverty rate – $929 (with a standard error of $74) – is, as expected, quite close to the

average state factor in the Title I grant formula as of 1969 – $954, shown in Table II.21 Per-pupil

current expenditure increased by $425 more between 1964 and 1969 in a district with only poor


20
   Gordon (2004) shows how local crowd-out of Title I in the 1990s phased in over a three-year period following
changes in grant amounts. An additional consideration is that 1969 was after the Nixon Administration stopped
enforcement of the federal-funds-withholding provisions of CRA (Orfield, 2000), breaking the explicit link between
desegregation and Title I receipt. We do not consider any later years because the federal government began
providing aid to desegregating districts in a way that appears correlated with child poverty in 1970.
21
   If all districts received their formula amounts under the Title I program, we would expect the change in the
poverty gradient from 1964 to any year from 1965 to 1969 to be roughly equal to the average grant received for each
eligible child (the “state factor”) in that year. The coefficients on child_povertyd in 1965 and 1966 are less than this
since some Southern districts did not receive Title I funds due to non-compliance with CRA. Data on the state factor
in the Title I formula was drawn from county-level data published in a series of Congressional reports. See
Appendix A.

                                                          16
children compared to a district with no poor children (Panel B). Rescaling by the corresponding

change in per-pupil federal revenue, these estimates imply that each additional dollar increase in

per-pupil federal revenue received over 1964 to 1969 generated a 46 cent increase in per-pupil

current expenditure.22

         We formalize this rescaling of the estimates into more intuitive “dollar-for-dollar” terms

in column (2), using child_poverty as an instrument for the change in federal revenue in a two-

stage least squares (TSLS) regression. Focusing on these estimates, there is little evidence of

crowd-out by state governments (Panel C), but local revenue declined by about 33 cents for each

additional dollar of federal revenue (Panel D). Thus, our estimates leave a statistically

significant 26 cents of federal revenue unaccounted for (Panel E): each dollar of additional

federal revenue increased current expenditure by 46 cents, but there was only 28 cents of total

crowd out (33 cents local less five cents state). This differential could represent an increase in

spending on capital and debt service, which are included in total, but not current, expenditure.

The data we have on total expenditure are incomplete and less reliable than the data for current

expenditure,23 but when we estimate the model for the subset of states for which we have data,

the results are similar to those for current expenditure but less precise, suggesting Title I did not

increase spending on capital and debt service. Technically, this implies that districts used some




22
   Feldstein (1978) provides cross-sectional flypaper estimates of Title I from 1970, and finds spending increases by
80 cents per dollar of grant. Gordon (2004) exploits formula-based changes in funding in the early 1990s and
estimates essentially full local crowd out and no impact on current spending, but with large confidence intervals
(Gordon, 2004). Our findings here thus fall between the extremely wide range of limited estimates in the literature.
23
   For two states (NC and GA), we were not able to obtain data on total expenditure. Reporting of total expenditure
is not as consistent across states as current expenditure and revenue by source, and because total expenditure
includes capital expenditure, it exhibits much more year-to-year variation. In addition, while in theory, total revenue
should be similar to total expenditure, at least on average and over longer time periods, in practice, this is not always
the case. Capital outlays (part of total expenditure) can generate substantial departures of total expenditure from total
revenue in a given year. Finally, at least some states do not count proceeds from bond issues as “revenue,” while the
capital improvements financed by bond issues are included in total expenditure; thus, revenue can be persistently
lower than expenditure.

                                                          17
of the new federal revenue to reduce debt or build up reserves, which would imply lower taxes in

the future and could therefore be considered another form of local crowd-out.

       Estimates of (2) for pre-program changes, given in column (3), largely confirm the visual

impression in Figure III that changes in the poverty gradient in the years leading up to Title I

implementation were small relative to the effects observed after. Per-pupil current expenditure

declined slightly more over the early 1960s in poorer districts, but the coefficient is not

statistically significant. There is some evidence of a small disproportionate shift from local to

state funding for poorer districts, as the coefficient in the state revenue regression is positive and

the coefficient in the local revenue regression is negative, significant at the 5 and 10 percent

level, respectively. As can be seen in Figure III, these changes were small relative to changes in

fiscal outcomes after 1964, and when we include separate controls for pre-program changes in

per-pupil state and local revenue, the results are unchanged (results reported below in column (8)

of Table IV). Still, the estimates in column (2) of Table III assume that there would have been no

trend in the poverty gradient between 1964 and 1969 in the absence of the program. If, similar to

the approach taken in Finkelstein (2007), we instead take the trend from 1961 to 1964 as the

counterfactual, our substantive conclusions that Title I increased school expenditure and reduced

local effort are unchanged, though the estimates from this exercise imply slightly larger

expenditure responses and slightly less local offset (results available on request).

       While our estimates do not account for every cent of Title I revenue, they have

confidence intervals that allow us to make economically meaningful conclusions about the

program’s fiscal impacts. We can rule out substantial reallocation of state funds, and the

confidence interval for local revenue suggests local districts engaged in economically

meaningful offset. The estimate for current expenditure (the targeted good) is significantly



                                                  18
different from both one and zero, and also significantly larger than existing estimates of the

income elasticity of education demand would imply – 12 to 19 cents per dollar in the average

district, according to our back-of-the-envelope estimate.24 This suggests that at least some

districts were either constrained to increase spending on education more than they would have

liked given income and prices, or that grants disproportionately “stuck” for other reasons. We

explore this in more detail in the next section.

IV.D.    Robustness

        As described above, the primary threat to identification in our empirical strategy comes

from desegregation-related changes to school finance. Our main control for the effects of

desegregation is black enrollment share. Before exploring how our estimates change with more

extensive controls, it is useful to confirm that the relationship between black enrollment share

and changes in fiscal outcomes align with expectations. To this end, we present coefficients on

black share from estimates of model (2) in Table III. Black enrollment share is positively related

to changes in per-pupil current expenditure over 1964 to 1969, consistent with the prediction that

demand for funding increased more in blacker districts due to desegregation and with the results

for Louisiana reported in Reber (2011).

        Table IV shows that the coefficients of interest are remarkably insensitive to the inclusion

of more controls or more flexible functional forms. Column (1) repeats the TSLS estimates in

column (2) of Table III. In column (2), the indicator for being in one of the poorest 300 counties

and the Thurmond vote share controls are removed; the estimates are little changed. Columns

(3) and (4) show the estimates under alternative specifications of 1960 enrollment and black


24
  Put differently, the income elasticity would have to be about 1.5 to explain our estimates of the Title I-induced
increase in education spending. Fisher and Papke (2001) review the literature and cite income elasticity of demand
for public education spending estimates that do not approach this, ranging from 0.40 to 0.65. See Appendix B for
details on this calculation.

                                                        19
share in a model that otherwise includes only state fixed effects: in column (3) black share and

enrollment are both interacted with state fixed effects, and column (4) is the same as (1) but

includes indicators for deciles of black enrollment share in lieu of the linear term. The results are

not sensitive to the functional form of black share and enrollment, so we use the baseline linear

specification.

         The next columns in Table IV add several sets of controls to further account for the

effects of desegregation and other coincident policy changes. In column (5), we include several

direct measures of desegregation by 1970 –the dissimilarity index and an indicator for whether

the district was desegregating under court supervision at that time25 –as well as the share of the

white population enrolled in private schools in spring 1970.26 Column (6) adds a control for the

1960 black voter registration rate to examine the hypothesis that increases in black political

participation after VRA changed the demand for school spending.27 Estimates from a

specification that controls for changes in federal spending on other programs at the county level

— including spending on Head Start, public assistance, retirement programs, and health

programs — are reported in column (7). Finally, we include controls for pre-program changes in

per-pupil local and state revenue (separately) in column (8). The estimates are quite similar to the

baseline estimates regardless of which additional controls are included.

V.       Heterogeneous Fiscal Responses to Title I Grants

         For the average Southern school district, each dollar of federal revenue distributed

through Title I in the 1960s increased current expenditure by about 46 cents – more than what

25
   Controlling for variables measured after the introduction of Title I raises the possibility of reverse causation, as
changes in financing could theoretically influence desegregation, so we do not include these variables in the main
specification. In this historical context we do not perceive this is a likely or influential mechanism, however. Prior to
the passage of ESEA, there was essentially no variation in these desegregation variables.
26
   Ideally, we would use the change in private enrollment, but these data are not available for 1960. Private
enrollment rates were historically quite low in the South but increased somewhat during the period of desegregation.
27
   Voting-related changes in blacks’ political power are likely also related to the black share of the population, which
is highly correlated with the black share of enrollment already included in the regression.

                                                           20
reasonable estimates of the income elasticity of demand for education would imply. What forces

underlie this finding? One possibility, highlighted in Section III, is that current expenditure

increased more – and local revenue declined less – in districts where the median voter wanted to

consume on the restricted portion of the budget constraint but was forced to the corner.28 We do

not have the data to identify the corner precisely, but we can test whether districts that were more

likely to have been constrained, given their prior local effort and Title I grant, increased current

expenditure more and reduced local funding less. In addition to furthering our understanding of

how fiscal constraints might shape responses to intergovernmental grants, this analysis of

heterogeneity provides a valuable internal validity check on our earlier estimates and the

foundations of our strategy for estimating the effects of Title I on student outcomes.

         To understand our measure of “scope for local offset,” it is useful to return to Figure II. A

larger Title I grant would have shifted out BC3 by more, increasing the probability that a district

preferred to consume on its inaccessible portion, and districts with low initial local revenue

would have had less scope to offset the Title I grant by lowering local revenue, all else equal.

Thus, the districts most likely to have been constrained were those that received large Title I

grants relative to the local revenue they would have raised in the absence of the program in the

same year. We cannot observe this counterfactual local revenue, but it is likely highly correlated

with local revenue prior to Title I. We therefore use the ratio of the district’s 1969 Title I grant to

1964 (pre-program) local revenue as a proxy for the scope for local offset. This proxy orders

districts by their scope for offset but has no natural scale. We split the sample at the 75th

percentile and consider the top quartile to encompass “low scope for offset” districts; our

findings are qualitatively similar but the differences less dramatic if we split the sample into two


28
  Differences in income elasticities would also generate differences in fiscal responses. We are not aware of
credible estimates of how the income elasticity of demand for education varies across districts.

                                                         21
equal-sized groups (available on request). Because low scope for offset districts received larger

Title I grants, these districts were poorer on average, but there is significant variation in the

poverty rate within each category.29

         Table V, Panel A shows how fiscal responses to Title I varied by scope for offset.

Instead of estimating separate TSLS models for each subsample, we estimate a pooled regression

so as to test whether fiscal responses to Title I were significantly different across the two groups.

We instrument for the change in per-pupil federal revenue and its interaction with the low scope

for offset indicator with the child poverty rate and its interaction with low scope for offset and

include interactions between low scope for offset and most controls in the baseline specification

(black share in enrollment, district enrollment, and state dummies). The estimates from a fully-

interacted model are very similar but slightly less precise, and the findings are similar when we

include the different sets of controls in Table IV (results available on request).

         The results suggest that current expenditure increased significantly more between 1964

and 1969 in districts with low scope for offset – 91 cents for each dollar of federal revenue,

compared to 23 cents for districts without low scope for offset (column (1)). There are no

significant differences across these two groups of districts in state revenue responses (column

(2)), though the standard errors do not allow us to rule out economically interesting effects. The

results for local revenue (column (3)) suggest that the quarter of districts with low scope for

offset did not reduce local revenue in response to federal funding, while the remaining districts

reduced local revenue by 58 cents for each dollar of federal revenue. The coefficients actually

suggest (marginally significant) crowding in among low scope for offset districts. As shown in

Appendix Figure I, the poverty gradients of per-pupil current expenditure and per-pupil local


29
  The standard deviation of the child poverty rate is 0.17 in the full sample (Table II). Significant variance remains
within each of the two scope for offset subsamples, with a standard deviation of 0.14 for each.

                                                          22
revenue for the two “scope for offset” groups diverged quickly after ESEA was passed, but

trended similarly – and changed little – in the early 1960s.

         In light of race relations in the South, we also examine heterogeneity by racial

composition. Variation in fiscal effects of Title I by black enrollment share may map to other

sources of a “flypaper effect,” such as the median (white) voter being more willing to spend on

blacks out of federal revenue than out of local taxes. Panel B shows estimates analogous to those

in Panel A, but stratifying districts by black share. The results suggest that current expenditure

increased by about twice as much per dollar of federal revenue in high black enrollment share

districts, due to less local offset.30 While this is consistent with whites being more willing to

spend on blacks out of federal revenue, racial composition is also correlated with scope for

offset, since high black share districts received larger Title I grants and had lower initial local

revenue. Panel C presents estimates of the specification with both interactions included to

determine whether racial composition or scope for offset is responsible for the differential

response. For current expenditure and local revenue, the coefficient on the interaction between

low scope for offset and the change in federal funding is similar to that in Panel A and maintains

significance at the one percent level, while the coefficient on the interaction between high black

share and the change in federal funding becomes statistically insignificant and is close to zero.

         The fact that the scope for offset interaction coefficients are relatively stable across

specifications, combined with the theoretical prediction that scope for offset should matter for

fiscal responses, suggests that institutional factors were an important mediator of fiscal responses

to Title I. However, we cannot rule out that districts we characterize as “low scope for offset”

were not legally constrained to the corner solution, but rather were disproportionately subject to

30
  Again, we divided the sample into quartiles and define districts in the top quartile (corresponding to at least
approximately 50 percent black enrollment) as “high black enrollment share.” Results are similar but less stark if we
define high black enrollment share as above the median.

                                                         23
bureaucratic capture or mental accounting. The point estimates can be squared with the

assumption of no other such sources of flypaper effects only if a non-trivial share of districts

faced significant institutional constraints on reducing local revenue.31 Unfortunately, we lack the

data (e.g., on the proxies for bureaucratic capture used in the literature32) to explore other reasons

why the effects of Title I on education spending are larger than the income elasticity of education

demand alone would generate.33

VI.      Title I and Educational Attainment

         The results thus far suggest that Title I raised school spending in the South, and more so

in districts where the grants were large relative to expected local revenue, where the ability to

offset Title I funds was likely constrained. Did these increases in school spending improve

student outcomes? Recall that there was limited enforcement of targeting during this era, so

Title I-induced increases in school expenditure could easily have benefitted children who were

not “educationally disadvantaged.” We therefore examine how Title I affected all students and

view our analysis as being more closely related to the literature on the effects of school spending



31
   Our measure of scope for offset does not have a natural scale, but the point estimates indicate one-for-one
increases in spending with federal revenue and no offset for low scope for offset districts, implying that a quarter of
districts would have consumed at the corner both with and without the Title I grant in the context of the neoclassical
model. Among the remaining districts, the increase in spending (21 cents per dollar) is consistent with an income
elasticity of demand for education spending of about 0.7. In some states, we have more detailed breakdowns of local
revenue, and based on the limited data we have, there do not appear to have been districts that were raising only the
required minimum contribution for participation in the state MFP, but we cannot be sure that this is the actual
required minimum contribution overall because we do not know the precise school finance rules in each state. On
the other hand, local offset did violate the rules of the program, so districts may have achieved local offset over time
by reducing the rate of growth of local revenue; it is easier to do this quickly when the grant is small relative to
initial local spending.
32
   Strumpf (1998) uses public spending on administrative overhead as a proxy for bureaucratic power, showing
municipalities with stronger bureaucracies exhibit larger flypaper effects; Lutz (2010) finds nearly complete crowd
out of education grants in New Hampshire, where voters — rather than bureaucrats — directly determine budgets in
town meetings; and Brooks, Phillips and Sinitsyn (2011) show that stickiness increases in city council size.
33
   Bureaucrats in the parent governments of dependent school districts (which do not raise their own revenue) may
have more scope and incentive to offset federal grants targeted to education by increasing spending in other policy
areas. Because our sample is predominately comprised of independent districts (all districts except in North Carolina
and Virginia), we do not examine this source of heterogeneity, nor do we distinguish among alternative (non-
education) uses of funds.

on student outcomes (see Hanushek (1986, 1997)) than on the achievement effects of Title I.34

We do, however, present separate estimates for blacks and whites to explore the possible

importance of race in the within-district allocation of funds. States discontinued publication of

spending by race by the mid-1960s, so we cannot examine this directly. But up to that time,

school boards did allocate state funding disproportionately to white schools (Margo, 1990;

Reber, 2011), so it would not be surprising if they did the same with federal funding before

schools desegregated.

         The outcome of interest in our analysis is the high school dropout rate of 18 and 19 year

olds. Obtaining data on student outcomes at a local level is difficult for this period. High school

dropout can be consistently observed at a local level both before and after Title I in the

Decennial Census and is also particularly relevant for the South at this time, as 30 percent of

whites and 43 percent of blacks aged 18 and 19 were high school dropouts in 1960. Public-use

Census microdata and published Census tabulations are insufficient to construct local dropout

rates, so we purchased the necessary tabulations, at the county level, from the Census Bureau.35

Throughout, we weight by race-specific county population of 18-19 year olds in 1960, so the

estimates represent the effect of Title I-induced expenditure increases for the average student.

         We exploit the heterogeneity of fiscal response documented above as a source of

identification. To set ideas, the first column in Figure IV shows the regression-adjusted

relationship between initial child poverty rates and the change in per-pupil current expenditure

between 1964 and 1969, separately in counties where all districts had low scope for fiscal offset

34
   Several major studies – the Sustaining Effects Study (Carter, 1984) and the Prospects study (Puma et al., 1997) –
attempt to estimate the effects of participating in Title I programs on student outcomes. Identifying these effects is
difficult, given the negative selection of participants by design. See also Borman and D'Agostino (1996), and van
der Klaauw (2008).
35
   There are 856 districts represented in the 655 counties in the sample. We restrict attention to counties where
districts in our estimation sample represent at least 90 percent of total county enrollment in 1960. Though all
discussion of impact on dropout refers to counties, recall that the relevant fiscal decisions are made at and
aggregated from the district level.

                                                          25
(Panel A) and in the remaining counties (Panel B). The underlying regressions were estimated

using county aggregates of the district-level finance data and are otherwise similar to the

reduced-form specifications that underlie the district-level estimates in Table V.36 The dot sizes

represent the (relative) size of the county’s white population aged 18 to 19 in 1960 to reflect

weighting of the regression fit. Consistent with our earlier findings, school spending became

much more progressive over the second half of the 1960s in the subsample of counties where the

scope for fiscal offset by districts was low.37 The finding is similar in the subsample of counties

with black populations and weighting by initial county black population, as shown in the first

column of Figure V.

         If “money mattered,” there should have been greater convergence of poorer counties to

richer counties in educational attainment over the 1960s in the subsample of counties where the

scope for local offset was low, or where Title I translated into higher spending at a greater rate.

We explore this in the second column of each figure using the same specification as in the first

column but replacing the dependent variable with the 1960 to 1970 change in high school

dropout rates of 18 and 19 year olds. For whites (Figure IV), the reduction in high school

dropout over the 1960s was much larger in poorer counties than richer counties in the subsample

with low scope for offset (Panel A), but not elsewhere (Panel B), suggesting that Title I-induced

spending increases improved white educational outcomes. This was not the case for blacks,

however (Figure V).

         In Table VI, we present TSLS estimates of the effects of changes in current expenditure

on changes in dropout, instrumenting for the change in per-pupil current expenditure with the
36
   The specification also includes the 1960 race-specific dropout rate of 18-19 year olds (also interacted with the low
scope for offset indicator) to account for the possibility that the trend in dropout rate depended on the starting point.
We unfortunately cannot examine trends in dropout at the county level during the 1950s. County aggregates were
generated from all district-level data weighting by 1960 district enrollment.
37
   The difference across the two groups in the change in the poverty gradient in spending is statistically significant
(Appendix Table I).

                                                           26
interaction of 1960 child poverty with the low scope for offset indicator.38 By using the

interaction of the 1960 child poverty rate and the low scope for offset indicator as the excluded

instrument, we can allow the 1960 child poverty rate to have an effect on dropout through

channels other than educational expenditure. We identify a causal effect of current expenditure

on dropout if, in the absence of the program, the relationship between the 1960 child poverty rate

and changes in dropout would have been similar in counties with and without low scope for

offset. Note that because spending was low and dropout rates high at this time — particularly in

the low scope for offset districts where the marginal students affected by the program resided —

the effects on educational attainment that we identify may be larger than would be expected from

modern-day spending increases.

         The first column of Table VI presents TSLS estimates for the baseline specification.39

The estimates imply that each additional $100 increase in current expenditure between 1964 and

1969 was associated with a statistically significant 2.9 percentage point reduction in the

likelihood of white dropout and an insignificant 1.7 percentage point increase in the likelihood of

black dropout over the 1960s. The change in spending was permanent, so these estimates should

not be compared to programs involving one-time expenditures. The cohorts in our analysis were

exposed to about 5 years of Title I-induced spending increases before we observe their dropout

outcomes in 1969. Title I grants were slightly smaller in the early years (and some districts did

not receive their grants due to non-compliance with the Civil Rights Act), so these effects



38
   This is equivalent to scaling the difference in the poverty coefficients, for high and low scope for offset counties,
from the regressions with the change in dropout rates as the dependent variable by the corresponding difference in
their poverty coefficients from the regressions with the change in per pupil current expenditure as the dependent
variable. Results are qualitatively similar, but somewhat smaller in magnitude, when we define low scope for offset
as having an above median ratio of the 1969 Title I grant to 1964 local revenue.
39
   As in Table V, we interact the low scope for offset indicator with most but not all of the controls in the baseline
specification. First-stage and reduced-form estimates that correspond to the specification shown in the first column
are in Appendix Table I.

                                                           27
correspond to exposure to somewhat less than $500 of additional cumulative spending between

1965 and 1969.

         It is difficult to compare these estimates to others in the literature, as most existing

studies that measure outcomes with educational attainment — studies which, like this one, focus

on individuals schooled before 1970 — measure school inputs directly (i.e., with pupil-teacher

ratios) rather than with educational expenditure.40 We can however think about the magnitudes

of the estimates in several ways. First, a back-of-the-envelope cost-benefit analysis focusing

solely on labor market returns to an additional year of schooling for whites implies that the value

of the social benefits were nearly twice as large as the spending increase (see Appendix B for

details). Second, the point estimate for whites implies that Title I explains 30 percent of the 10

percentage point reduction in their high school dropout rate over the decade.41 By contrast, the

point estimate suggests Title I had an adverse effect on blacks, but using the 95 percent

confidence interval, we estimate that at most, Title I can account for 22 percent of the 14

percentage point reduction in black high school dropout over the 1960s.

         The estimates are robust to several specification tests. For example, adding more controls

to the model reduces precision but does not qualitatively affect the estimates. In column (2), we

include changes in transfer payments to the county over the 1960s through other federal

programs, including Head Start and Medicaid. In column (3), we also add county aggregates of


40
   See, for example, Card and Krueger (1992a, 1992b, 1996) and Ashenfelter, Collins, and Yoon (2006). Such
studies find positive effects of measured inputs on educational attainment and wages, but it is difficult to compare
the magnitudes to our estimates. Reber (2010) estimates the effects of desegregation-induced changes in spending
on educational attainment for blacks and finds somewhat smaller effects. On the other hand, existing work
estimating the effects of educational spending tends to use test scores as the educational outcome of interest
(Hanushek, 1997).
41
   These calculations scale up the coefficient on the change in per-pupil funding (or its upper bound) in column (1)
of Table VI by the predicted change in per-pupil spending from Title I for the average child, then divide by the
(weighted) mean of the dependent variable. The predicted change in per-pupil spending from Title I is calculated
separately by race, weighting by the 1960 race-specific population of 18 and 19 year olds and controlling for their
dropout rate.

                                                         28
the two measures of desegregation as of 1970 introduced above and of the 1970 white private

school enrollment rate. Perhaps more compelling, we see no effect of spending on high school

dropout rates of an older group, whose secondary education would have been completed prior to

1965. We show this in column (5), using as a dependent variable the change in the percent of a

county’s whites (Panel A) and blacks (Panel B) aged 25 and older without a high school degree.

Presumably, unobserved shocks to educational attainment in the county population – through

migration, for example – would have affected this older age group as well.

       Thus, the estimates suggest that whites benefited from Title I-induced changes in

educational expenditure, but blacks did not. The estimates are sufficiently imprecise that we

cannot reject moderate beneficial effects for blacks, but we reject that the effects are the same for

the two groups. A larger effect for whites is plausible, given that even nominal targeting of Title

I funding to the most disadvantaged students within districts was weak at the time (Martin and

McClure, 1969), and that substantial desegregation occurred only after 1968, so districts may

have been able to continue targeting resources disproportionately to white students, as they had

done at least through the 1950s (Margo, 1990). If Title I-induced increases in spending were

directed to whites, it should be the case that whites in districts with more blacks benefited more

from Title I, as there would have been more Title I funding to divert to a smaller group of whites.

When we test whether the effect of changes in spending on dropout depended on the black

enrollment share, in column (4), the estimates are in the expected direction but quite imprecise.

       The estimates in Table VI nevertheless point to some benefit for blacks of desegregation-

related changes in school resources over the 1960s, consistent with the work of Reber (2010,

2011). Districts with higher black enrollment shares in 1960 saw larger increases in per-pupil

current expenditure over the second half of the 1960s (Table III), likely because this additional



                                                 29
funding in blacker districts was needed to “level up” quality in desegregated schools to that

previously available only in the white schools. Table VI, Panel B shows that there was a

corresponding disproportionate reduction in dropout rates among blacks in blacker counties.

Under the relatively strong assumption that the effects of initial black enrollment share on black

dropout worked only through such desegregation-related increases in spending, these estimates

imply a 3.75 percentage point greater reduction in black dropout for each additional $100

increase in per-pupil current expenditure growth.42 Increases in school spending through this

alternative channel would account for about 43 percent (6.1 percentage points) of the overall

decline in dropout among blacks during the 1960s. In this historical context, policies specifically

targeted to blacks, like school desegregation, appear to have been more effective in helping

blacks than policies targeted to poor children.43

VII.    Discussion

        This paper examines the impacts of the introduction of Title I of the Elementary and

Secondary Education Act in the South. Combining variation in the program’s intensity across

school districts with the timing of its introduction in 1965, we find evidence of an important role

for Title I in increasing the level and progressivity of funding for Southern schools during the

1960s. School districts responded to the influx of Title I funding by significantly reducing their

own fiscal effort, but only where institutions permitted this response. “Money mattered,” but




42
   The 3.75 figure comes from scaling down the coefficient on 1960 black enrollment share in Table VI, Panel B
column (1) by the coefficient on 1960 black enrollment share in a regression for the 1964 to 1969 change in per
pupil expenditure that weights by the 1960 population of black 18-19 year olds and includes their 1960 dropout rate
as a control ($387). We arrive at the 6.1 percentage point figure as 3.75×3.87×0.42, where 0.42 is the initial black
share for the average black 18 or 19 year old in 1960.
43
   A growing literature examining the effects of policy efforts to narrow black-white school quality gaps and
desegregate schools consistently concludes that such programs were beneficial for blacks on a variety of outcomes,
including educational attainment. See, for example, Reber (2010), Johnson (2011), Card and Krueger (1992a), Lutz
(2011), Ashenfelter, Collins, and Yoon (2006), Guryan (2004), and Weiner, Lutz, and Ludwig (2009).

                                                        30
only in places where the introduction of Title I increased spending on education and only for

whites.44 Despite this, the program appears to have been cost-effective overall.

         Our analysis makes important contributions to both our understanding of how

intergovernmental grants operate and the effects of Title I, but necessarily falls short of a full

assessment of the legacy of Title I. The program likely had other benefits – on other educational

or social outcomes, on other cohorts, or in the increased consumption of other goods that crowd

out represents – that are not easily quantified. Title I likely also had effects through other

channels, particularly for blacks. Combined with provisions of the Civil Rights Act prohibiting

the receipt of federal funds by discriminating school districts, Title I promoted voluntary

desegregation and reduced the burden on the federal courts in dismantling segregation (Cascio, et

al. 2010; Rosenberg, 1991). The spending response to desegregation, which also benefited

blacks, might have been smaller in the absence of the influx of Title I funds (Reber, 2011).

         Our findings illuminate the usefulness of examining the impacts of intergovernmental

grants on a jurisdiction’s finances alongside any evaluation of its impacts on the ultimate

outcome of interest and the importance of institutions in mediating these effects. In particular,

failure to find effects of grants on outcomes of interest should not necessarily be taken as

evidence that resources do not matter if the institutional context is one where grants do not

translate to higher spending. Grants should only affect outcomes where circumstances constrain

localities to use the funds on the targeted good. Indeed, the introduction of Title I only improved

education where it increased education spending.




44
   Our findings are in contrast to the existing literature on Title I, which has concluded the program is largely
ineffective. However, we ask a different question by estimating returns to increases in education spending induced
by Title I for all students in a district, rather than comparing outcomes of participants in whatever was called a Title
I program at a particular point in time to those for non-participants (as in Carter, 1984; Puma et al., 1997).

 Notes: Each column and panel represents a different TSLS regression, where county is the unit of analysis. In columns (1)-
 (3) and (5), we instrument for the 1964 to 1969 change in per-pupil current expenditure (2009 dollars) with the interaction
 between the 1960 child poverty rate and the low scope for offset indicator. In column (2), we also instrument for the
 interaction between the 1964 to 1969 change in per-pupil current expenditure (2009 dollars) and 1960 black enrollment share
 with the triple interaction between the 1960 child poverty rate, the low scope for offset indicator, and 1960 black enrollment
 share. Throughout, attention is restricted to counties where districts in our estimation sample represent at least 90 percent of
 total county enrollment in 1960. County aggregates were generated from the district data weighting by 1960 district
 enrollment. In cases where not all districts within a county have low scope for offset, we coded the county as not having low
 scope for offset. Standard errors (in parentheses) are heteroskedasticity robust. ***, **, * represent statistical significance at
 the 1, 5, and 10 percent levels, respectively.

Appendix A: Data

I.      Sources and Variables

I.A     School Finance and Enrollment Data

Our analysis of the fiscal impacts of Title I relies on district-level data on current expenditure
and revenue by source (local, state, and federal). These data were hand-entered from annual
reports of state departments or superintendents of education and are available on an annual basis
between 1961 and 1969 with several exceptions: Georgia data are missing in 1964 (use 1963),
1968 (use 1967), and 1969 (use 1970), and Louisiana data are missing in 1967 (use 1966).1 Real
per-pupil values of the finance variables were created by dividing by total enrollment from the
same year, drawn from the same source, then converting to real 2009 dollars using the CPI-U.

I.B     High School Dropout Data

Our analysis of the effects of Title I on educational attainment uses the 1960 to 1970 change in
the high school dropout rate of 18 and 19 year olds as the dependent variable. We constructed
this outcome using county-level tabulations of population characteristics by single year of age
(ages 15 to 19) and race (white, black/African American, other), produced for us by the Census
Bureau using the sample detail files from the 1960 and 1970 Censuses. The numerator of the
dropout rate in a given Census year is the number of 18 and 19 year residents of a county of a
given race who report not being currently enrolled in school and less than twelve years of
completed education. The denominator is the total number of 18 and 19 year residents of that
county of that race with education reported.

We perform a falsification check using the 1960 to 1970 change in the high school dropout rate
of county residents aged 25 and over, which we constructed in a similar fashion using published
Census tabulations of the total population (both years) and the non-white population in 1960 and
black population in 1970.2 Here, the numerator of the dropout rate in a given Census year is the
number of residents age 25 and over with less than twelve years of completed education, and the
denominator is the total number of residents age 25 and over with education reported. Data for
1960 was hand-entered from Table 83 and Table 87 of U.S. Census (1963). Data for 1970 was
downloaded from the National Historical Geographic Information System (Minnesota Population
Center, 2004).

I.C     Title I Eligibility Data

Our identification strategy relies on an estimate of initial district eligibility for Title I funds. Title
I funding allocations were made at the county level. States then allocated grants to districts

  Alabama Department of Education (various years), Florida State Superintendent of Public Instruction (various
years), Georgia State Department of Education (various years), Mississippi State Department of Education (various
years), North Carolina Education Association (various years), South Carolina State Department of Education
(various years), State Department of Education of Louisiana (various years), Tennessee Department of Education
(various years), Virginia State Board of Education (various years).

  Tabulations for the white population are the difference between total and non-white (in 1960) or black (in 1970),
when non-white or black is reported, and total, when non-white or black is not reported (due to small population).

                                                        51
within each county. We do not know data sources used for this purpose, but we do observe
district-level Title I allocations in the first fall of the program in 1965, t1allocd,1965 (U.S. Senate,
1967). We also observe county-level counts of 5-17 year olds eligible for Title I in fall 1965,
t1eligc,1965 (U.S. Senate, 1965). Using these data, we estimate district counts of Title I eligible
child for 1965, t1eligd,1965 as

                                                                      t1allocd,1965
                                     t1eligd,1965 ≈t1eligc,1965 × ∑                       ,
                                                                      d∈c t1allocd,1965


or with the 1965 county-level eligibles times the share of the 1965 county Title I allocation
received by the district.3 We then define the “initial” child poverty rate as t1eligd,1965/enrd,1960,
where enrd,1960 represents 1960 district enrollment. If the effective poverty rate for distribution of
Title I funds (based on current enrollment and current eligibility) were roughly equal to the
initial child poverty rate, the change between 1964 and any year from 1965 to 1969 in the
coefficient on child_poverty in regressions for per-pupil federal revenue should be equal to the
amount received for districts for each eligible child – the “state factor” – in the Title I formula.
We collected state factors for 1965-1967 and 1969 from congressional publications (U.S. Senate,
1965, 1967, 1970).4

I.D      Other District- and County-Level Covariates

      1. 1960 black enrollment share (district): For most states, this variable is constructed from
         1960 data on enrollment by race in the school finance publications cited in Section I.A of
         this Appendix.5 We estimated this variable for North Carolina using district-level data
         from Southern Education Reporting Service (1964, 1966).

      2. Thurmond vote share in the 1948 Presidential Election (county): The county-level
         percent of votes cast for Strom Thurmond in the 1948 Presidential election was drawn
         from ICPSR Study No. 8611 (Clubb, Flanigan, and Zingale 2006).

      3. Poorest Counties in 1960 (county): Data on whether a county was one of the 300
         poorest counties in 1960, which was expected to have received special grant-writing
         assistance for Head Start (Ludwig and Miller, 2007), was generously provided to us by
         Jens Ludwig and Douglas Miller. The poverty rate used in this determination was also
         provided to us, and is distinct from (but positively correlated with) that used for
         dissemination of funds under Title I (see section I.C of the Data Appendix).


3
  Note that, in reality, there were two categories of Title I eligibles in 1965: (1) children aged 5 to 17 in families with
incomes less than $2000 in the 1960 Census; (2) children in families receiving AFDC in excess of $2000. We refer
to all Title I eligibles as being from group (1) for ease of explanation, as the vast majority of eligibles are in indeed
in this group in our sample.
4
  Funding amounts per eligible child were ratably reduced by state-specific multiplicative constants after 1965, when
Title I was no longer fully funded.
5
  We use the enrollment measure most consistently reported within the state over time. All states except Georgia
and North Carolina report fall enrollment or registration or average daily membership. To make these states’
enrollment figures more comparable to those for other states, we multiply the enrollment concept reported (average
daily attendance, or ADA) by the statewide average ratio of fall enrollment to ADA reported in U.S. DHEW (1967).

                                                           52
    4. 1970 Dissimilarity Index (district): The formula for the dissimilarity index is given by:

                                                     id
                                                            enri %bl i  %bl d
                                               2  enrd  %bl d  1  %bl d 

         where enri is total enrollment in school i, enrd is the enrollment in district d (summing
         across all schools), %bli is the percent of total enrollment in school i that is black, and
         %bld is the black enrollment percent in district d. It can be interpreted as the share of
         students who would have had to change schools to replicate the racial composition of the
         district in each school. We construct a dissimilarity index for all available districts as of
         1970 using computer-coded microdata on enrollment by race at the school level from a
         1970 survey conducted by the Office for Civil Rights (OCR), housed at UCLA and
         converted from binary to ascii format by Ben Denckla and Sarah Reber (Denckla and
         Reber, 2006). Not all districts are represented in this survey, so we lose some districts
         when including the dissimilarity index as a control.6

    5. 1970 Court Supervision (district): We classify a district as having a court-supervised
       desegregation plan in 1970 if for the 1970-71 academic year, the district submitted a
       court order to comply with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and that court order was
       approved by HEW (its “assurance code” is equal to 3). This information was collected
       by OCR simultaneously with the computer-coded microdata on enrollment by race in
       each of a district’s schools in fall 1970, used to construct the 1970 dissimilarity index.

    6. White Private School Enrollment Rate (district): The 1970 white private school
       enrollment rate was constructed using district-level tabulations of the total population and
       the black population in the 1970 Census, reported in the 1970 Fourth-Count (Population)
       School District Data Tapes (U.S. Department of Education, 1970). The numerator is the
       sum of counts of (non-black) district residents (ages 3 to 34) enrolled in private school
       (kindergarten, elementary, or secondary). The denominator is the sum of (non-black)
       district residents in various age groups spanning 5 to 19. The Fourth Count school
       district data covers all districts with at least 300 students as of the 1969-70 school year.
       We lose very few districts due to this restriction given the typically large enrollments of
       Southern districts.

    7. Pre-VRA Black Voter Registration Rate (county): Available data on black voter
       registration rates in the early 1960s for all states represented in our sample except
       Virginia were generously provided by James Alt (Alt, 1995). Pre-VRA voter registration
       rates in Virginia were hand-entered from Table 12 in U.S. Commission on Civil Rights
       (1968).


6
 Most of these districts are smaller districts in Tennessee. The survey included all districts “eliminating racially
dual school systems under terms of voluntary plan agreements with [HEW] or under Federal court order regardless
of school district enrollment size” (with the exception of such districts in Tennessee and Texas). It also included all
districts with at least 3000 enrollment and smaller districts with the following probabilities: 75% for districts with
1200 to 2999 students, 50% for districts with 600 to 1199 students, 25% for districts with 300-599 students, and 0%
for districts with less than 300 students.

                                                             53
       8. Outlays on Federal Programs (county): Changes (1962 to 1969) in per-capita federal
          outlays to counties for public assistance (less food stamps), Medicare, Medicaid, and
          retirement and disability programs were constructed using data from the Regional
          Economic Information system, generously provided to us by Douglas Almond, Hilary
          Hoynes, and Diane Schanzenbach (Almond, Hoynes, and Schanzenbach, 2011). Federal
          outlays to counties for Head Start in 1972 were drawn from National Archives data and
          generously provided to us by Jens Ludwig and Douglas Miller (Ludwig and Miller,
          2007).

II.       Estimation Sample

School districts both consolidate and, less commonly, split apart during our sample period. We
use the state school finance data referenced above to establish a history of these reorganizations
and limit our working sample to districts that do not experience reorganization between 1961 and
1969 (1032 districts across nine Southern states). Our estimation sample includes all districts in
this sample with data available the fiscal outcomes and the controls in the main specification –
the 1960 child poverty rate, 1960 black enrollment share, 1960 enrollment, 1948 Thurmond vote
share, and whether the district was in one of the 300 poorest counties in 1960 (985 districts). We
also trim districts from the sample for which changes in any of the four key outcomes over 1961
to 1964 or 1964 to 1969 lies more than 3.5 standard deviations away from the state-specific
mean. Our final sample includes 922 districts.

Appendix B: Supplementary Analyses

I.     Cost benefit analysis

This section describes how we approximate the labor market returns to the additional educational
attainment induced by Title I spending. We view this calculation as providing a rough
approximation of the lower bound of potential benefits, as it ignores likely additional
unmeasured private and social returns to this schooling—for example, improvements in health,
reductions in criminal behavior, and increased civic participation.

Because we do not find a significant impact on educational attainment for blacks, the benefits in
this calculation come solely from whites; the costs include all expenditures including those
nominally allocated to black students. We estimate the benefits by applying the rate of return to
additional schooling to annual wage income over one’s career, and multiplying this present
discounted value by our estimated change in probability that one graduates from high school.
We assume a ten percent rate of return to an additional year of schooling, in the middle of the
range of estimates in the relevant literature, and a five percent discount rate. We calculate the
mean annual wage income from the 1970 Census, using white men and women ages 20-50 in our
sampled states who finished tenth grade but did not graduate from high school. This mean
($33,132 in 2009 dollars—all figures going forward are in 2009 dollars as well) is estimated
unconditional on labor market participation; the mean conditional on positive earnings is
$38,033. Our preferred specification for outcomes results (see Table VI, Column 3) estimates
that $100 in Title I-induced spending per pupil yields a 3.1 percentage point increase in the
likelihood of graduating from high school. For one year’s wages, the estimated expected
additional return from $100 of Title I revenue is $81 of annual wage income per person.

We estimate the costs of the program based on two different definitions of cost: (1) federal
dollars spent on intergovernmental grants to school districts (this includes transfers to local
consumption whose benefits we disregard but is what the federal government would use in
calculating returns on its grants); and (2) current educational spending by school districts
(relevant for the more general question of how money matters in educational production). The
estimates in Table VI, Column 3 correspond to the latter concept.

From the district (current expenditure) perspective:
In our sample, the typical white student lived in a district with 75 percent white enrollment.
Assuming that funds were distributed equally across students regardless of race, it would cost
approximately $132 per pupil to spend $100 per white pupil. We estimate this using data for
1969, so the cohort generating this result on average received Title I funding (low variance
across years) for five years to produce this attainment gain. We therefore compare our estimated
benefits (associated labor market return expected from additional $100 Title I revenue per pupil
per year) with a cost of $132*5=$660. After 12 years of work, the expected benefit ($692)
exceeds this amount; after 39 years of work, the expected benefit is double the cost.

From the federal (Title I revenue including crowded out funds) perspective:
We find that one dollar of Title I revenue per pupil increases current expenditure per pupil by
$0.46 (Table III, Column 2). $132 of spending per pupil (the cost of spending $100 per white

                                                57
pupil) therefore costs $287 per pupil in federal revenue (287=132/.46) per year or $1435 over
five years. Considering these higher costs, the five-year intervention would be cost-effective
only after 52 years of labor market returns to the additional education; again, this disregards all
other benefits of the increased education spending and increased consumption due to crowd out.

II.     Income elasticity calculation

We find that one dollar of Title I revenue per pupil increases current expenditure per pupil by
$0.46 (Table III, Column 2). We want to know how much spending would have been expected to
increase in response to Title I based on the income elasticity of demand for education spending.

The increase in spending on education due to the grant is

AddlSpendi ng  Counterfac tualSpendi ng    % IncomeDuet oGrant

where η is the (assumed) income elasticity of demand for education spending.

To estimate CounterfactualSpending for 1969 (what education spending would have been
without Title I), we assume that in the absence of Title I, spending per pupil would have
increased in line with income growth: We apply the assumed income elasticity of demand and
the observed growth in median family income in the county7 to pre-program (1964) per-pupil
current expenditure:

CounterfactualSpendingPerPupil69  SpendingPerPupil 64    %MedianFamilyIncome6469

We then multiply by enrollment to get total counterfactual spending:

CounterfactualSpending 69  CounterfactualSpendingPerPupil69  Enrollment 69

To estimate %ΔIncomeDuetoGrant, we divide the Title I grant by the number of families (to get
the additional income per family implied by the grant, as if the grant were distributed as cash)
and then divide by median family income in 1969:

                              TotalTitleIGrant 69
                                               NumberFamilies69
%IncomeDuetoGrant 
                                      MedianFamilyIncome69

We can then calculate the additional spending the Title I grant would be expected to generate for
each county. To compare that to our coefficients, which indicate how much additional spending
was generated for each additional dollar of Title I revenue, we divide the implied additional
spending by the total Title I grant. Using this method, we calculate the expected additional
spending for a range of income elasticities reported in the literature, 0.40 to 0.65 (Fisher and


7
 We assume that half the change in median family income at the county level (obtained from the County and City
Data Book) from 1960 to 1970 occurred from 1964 to 1969.

Papke, 2001). These estimates are consistent with spending increases of $0.12 to $0.19 per dollar
of Title I revenue.
