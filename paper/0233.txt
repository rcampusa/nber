               JOB MOBILITY AND EARNINGS OVER THE LIFE CYCLE



                                 Abstract



        The paper analyzes the effects of job mobility on earnings both

at young and at older ages. The model takes into account the discon-

tinuity of earnings across jobs, the decline of human capital investment

within the job and over the life cycle, and the effects of mobility on

the slope of the earnings profile. Careful attention to the functional

form of the earnings equation indicates why the coefficient of the

current segment is usually larger than the coefficient of the previous

segments. Findings from the NLS data include:

        1. Mobile individuals at all ages invest significantly less in

on—the—job training.

        2. Although job mobility is associated with significant wage

gains (across jobs), there is a substantial wage differential between

the mobile and the nonmobile at older ages.

        3. The explanatory power of the earnings equation is signif i-

cantly increased by accounting for the effects of job mobility; job

mobility is an important determinant of the wage structure.

I. Introduction

     The determinants of the earnings distribution have received widespread

attention in recent years. The main innovation of this renewed interest in

the determination of earnings has been the development of a human capital

framework to explain the characteristics of the income distribution.

Essentially, it is assumed that variations in earnings over time are caused

by changes in the individual's net human capital stock, the embodied knowl-

edge and skills useful in the labor market.

     Many studies have shown that the pattern of earnings over the life

cycle can be explained by the time profile of Investment in human capital.1

Mainly because of data limitations these studies have refrained from analyz-

ing the effects of job mobility on the life cycle distribution and volume of

human capital investments. The recent emergence of longitudinal data sets

allows the researcher to study the relationship between the job history of

the individual and the level of current earnings.

     The objective of this paper is to analyze the effects of job mobility on

the cross—sectional distribution of earnings. It will be argued that job

mobility has two effects on earnings. The first effect is on the level of the

earnings profile through wage gains due to job mobility. This effect has been

documented in the literature and is usually strongly positive for quits and

nonpositive for layoffs.2 A second effect, that of mobility on the slope of

the earnings profile, has been ignored in the literature. I will argue that by

creating disincentives for investments in human capital due to the fact that

some specificity exists in on—the—fob training, fob mobility will tend to

flatten the slope of the earnings profile. This paper can be viewed as an

attempt to empirically document this effect of job mobility on earnings. Part

II of the paper presents the theoretical framework as well as an expansion of

the human capital earnings function to allow for the estimation of this effect.

Part III gives an extensive empirical analysis using the National Longitudinal

Survey (NLS) of Mature Men. In Part IV, the empirical analysis is briefly

replicated on the NLS of Young Men. Part V summarizes the empirical findings

of the study.


II. The Specification of Work History
     in the Earnings Function

     Mincer (1974) has shown that the relationship between the individ-

ual's earnings capacity and his stock of human capital can be written as:



           mE t lnE S +
                             T
                                 ii
                             E r k
                            1o
                                                                            (1)




where:

           earnings capacity at time t; defined as what the individual's

           earnings would be if he did not invest in human capital.

         — the rate of return to human capital investment.

         — earnings capacity after completion of s years of schooling; if

           direct costs of school and student earnings are largely offsetting

           then in E —

          — the ratio of dollar investment costs, C, to earnings capacity E:

           i.e. a 'time—equivalent" measure of investment atiae t.

Note that in equation (1) the returns are summed over T years             of   labor force

experience.

      The main prediction of models of life cycle distributions of hmian capital

investment is that C will be declining over time.3 Dollar investment costs

decline   over   time for two reasons: given a fixed lifetime, the returns from

later investments are smaller; and investments that take          place later in      the

life cycle are costlier since the price of time is increasing due to the

accumulation of human capital investment. Since               is increasing over time,

the ratio kt •             can be expected to decline even if dollar investment costs
                   Ct/Et
are constant or rise at a smaller rate than E. Thus the assumption that kt will

be   declining over time is a    more general implication of these models. A simple

functional    form is:4


           kt.k0_Bt                                                                     (2)




where k0   is    the initial level of the investment ratio and B is       the rate of

decline   of human capital investment. For simplicity, assume a constant rate of
return for all post—school       investment. Rewriting equation (1) in         continuous
terms, substituting (2)       and integrating   yields the   simplest   form of the
earnings function:

             ln!t1.lnEs+rkoT_!T2                                                        (3)




       3See Ben—Porath (1967) and Becker        (1975).
     4See Mincer (1974) for empirical testing of some alternative functional
forms for the investment profile.
                                       4




      The specification of the earnings function given by (3) assumes a con-

 tinuously declining investment profile. For some subgroups of the population——

 for example, married women——such an assumption is clearly untenable.5 Less

 obviously, once specific training and job mobility are intrOduced in the analy-

 sis, the assumption of a continuously declining investment path must be modified

 since specific training and job mobility are likely to have additional implica-

 tions concerningthe optimal volume and allocation of investment activities over

 the life cycle. The major implications are:6

     1. The earnings profile is likely to be discontinuous across jobs. There

are two reasons for the discontinuity in earnings: First,
                                                            job mobility will

likely result in wage gains if the job switch has been voluntary. These gains,

in a sense, represent the returns to Investment in job search. Secondly, the

investment profile is likely to be discontinuous across jobs. The basic reason

for this discontinuity is that different jobs provide different learning options.7

Indeed, job turnover might be directly related to the search by individuals for

investment opportunities different from the ones offered in the current job. A

more subtle reason for the discontinuity is the fact that towards the end of the

job, incentives for investment by both employers and employees are diminished

as long as some specificity exists in the job training. In the beginning of the

new job, at least once some brief trial period has elapses, the incentives for

investment are likely to Increase. In fact, holding the marginal cost of



     51t should be clear that the discontinuity In labor force participation
experienced by married women creates discontinuities in both their investment
and earnings profiles. For a detailed analysis, see Mincer and Polachek (1974).

        formal development of these predictions is given by Polachek (1975).

     7This approach to the on—the—job learning process was first formalized
Rosen (1972).                                                               by
                                                 5



investment constant      across jobs, this would imply not only a discontinuous

investment profile, but one that has an upward shift as well.8

     2. If investment declines over the life cycle as the optimization models

predict, two separate implications for the investment profile can be deduced

when job mobility and specific training are introduced into the analysis. First,

investment will probably decline within the job. This decline, is more likely

to hold for longer jobs, since at the beginning of the job, while the match is

being investigated by both the individual and the employer, investment may

increase or remain constant (even at a zero level). A eecond implication is

that the level of investment in the job is likely to be higher the earlier the

job occurs. This prediction, too, must be qualified by the search for a proper

match, which is clearly most intensive at the early phase of the working life.

     One method of introducing these effects into the earnings function is by

incorporating   the work history of the individual into the equation. Generally,
suppose   there are it   jobs   in the individual's working life up to time t. Then

equation (1) can be generalized as:9

                                      e                          e
            in Et —    in   E5 + r1
                                      !   k11
                                                + . .   .+   r
                                                                     kin

where e is the duration of the th job and ktj is the investment ratio in

the th year of the              job. Note that the rates of return have been assumed

constant within the segment, but have been allowed to vary across jobs.

     The discontinuity in the earnings and investment profiles is reflected in

(4) by the fact    that the returns       to   on—the—job training have been broken up



     8These    arguments, of course, depend on the trial or "matching" period        being
relatively    short. A detailed model of the matching process is given in
Jovanovic    (1977).

     9This method of segmentation, in a sense, resets the counter of experience
at zero each time a new job is started. A detailed discussion of the relationship
among the different forms of segmentation is given by fiorjas (1975).
                                       6



into n terms. Each of these terms depends on the investment path for the

particular job. As wag argued earlier, we would expect that the investment path

be declining within the job. Thus an analogue of (2) is:


          ktj —   k1
                       —   t           (i—i,   ...   ,n)

     We also expect the level of the investment profile to be affected by the

timing of the job in the life cycle. That is, more investment is likely to

take place the earlier the job occurs. This prediction, of course, follows from

the fact that if some of the training is general (i.e., useful in other jobs)

the payoff is greater the earlier it occurs. If the training is partly specific,

however, a more important prediction for the slope of the investment (and hence

the earnings) profile can be derived: the level of investment in any job is likely

to be positively correlated with the completed duration of the job. In other

words, the earnings profile will be steeper in longer jobs. For example, suppose

only general training were produced on the job. Then dollar investment costs

in a given job would not be correlated to the completed duration of the job since

the only factor which can diminish the value of general training is depreciation.

If we allow for the existence of specific training, dollar investment costs are

positively correlated with job duration since higher levels of investment (due

partly to the existence of specific training) imply lower turnover rates,

ceteris paribus 10

    The correlation between investment and job duration clearly holds in terms

of dollar investment costs. However, the equations derived are in terms of

'time—equivalent" investment costs. So that when using the log—linear equations,

a strong assumption must be made: there is a positive correlation between dollar




           as is likely, general and specific training are joint outputs, then
longer jobs will be associated with larger volumes of both types of investment.
                                               7



investment     costs and the time spent investing. The reason for the assumption is

that even though dollar investment costs and completed job duration are           positively
correlated, the same     need   not be true between time—equivalent costs and job

duration. The assumption permits us to say that there is a positive correlation

between time investment and completed experience, since those with longer job

duration viii have more investment, but by assumption they spend more time at it.

       These hypotheses can be easily introduced into the earnings function if we

assume the relationships to be linear. In particular, the level of investment

in   the   1th job (k01) is given by:


              k0i —   +t         —
                                     a1 'I              (i—i,...,n)                 (6)



where t is the expected completed duration of the i job, and                 is labor

force experience prior to starting job •11 The parameter p measures the

importance of specific training on investment behavior, while              measures the

effect     of aging on the distribution of lifetime investments.'2
       A problem immediately arises since the t       are   not observed. For all previous
jobs (i—l,...,n—l),     a first—order approximation is the actual completed job

duration. For the current job, t is unobserved and no reasonable proxy exists.

We do know, however, that t >          . Specifically,      t —
                                                                  e + R, where R represents
the years remaining on the current job. An implication of the existence of

specific training is     that   how long an individual has already been at the job

provides information on how       long he viii remain ther.        That is, those men who
have   been longer at the job and       invested more in   spe if ic training, will have a

Equation (9) says that the 1th segment (i—2,...,) will have three variables

associated with it in the earnings function:14 linear and quadratic experience,

and an interaction between experience in the ith job and previous experience.

Each interaction term is negative because the higher the starting age of the job

the lower the volume of investment in that job.

     An important implication of (9) is that the linear current job coefficient

is likely to have a relatively stronger effect (when compared to the linear

coefficients of the previous jobs). The reason is that the total duration of




     13The fact that the probability of separation strongly diminishes with
tenure has been recently documented by Bartel and Borjas (1977).

     4The first segment only has the linear and quadratic terms since previous
experience at that time is zero.
                                                      9



the current job is unobserved, thus making it seem                       as if observed current

experience matters more than previous experience.                       Note also that the linear

coefficient of previous experience segments is given by ri a1. It can be seen

from (6) that a1 measures the investment ratio that would occur early in the

life cycle at a very short job. Since little on—tbc—job training is likely

to take place in short jobs, a1 will lie close to zcro. Moreover, it can

be shown that the negative depreciation rate enters the linear coefficients

of job experience [see Mincer and Polachek (1974)].                      Once depreciation Is

included in the analysis, (9) provides a partial cx planation of why the

coefficient of previous jobs has been found to be insignificantly different

from zero (and sometimes even negative) in other st idies. 15

       Clearly equation (9) cannot be estimated since the dependent variable

is earnings capacity which is unobserved. Net earn Lngs can be defined as
   —
       E
           —
               C,   so that in        —    in    + ln     (1 —

empirically observed earnings since most investment costs are likely to be

At this point it is perhaps appropriate to note an important problem with

equation (l0):16 the parameters of interest are not identified.17 In

particular, for a given rate of return only          can be identified; the parameter

measuring the importance of specific training, p1, cannot be estimated. Thus it

is impossible to test directly whether the existence of specific training

significantly affects the distribution of earnings.'8 However, it can be shown

that   if t were known, equation (10) becomes:

Equation   (11) adds in two variables that did not enter (10): R and an inter-

action term between R and e. The reason that R enters negatively into the




     16Note also that the use of observed earnings instead of earnings capacity
adds the parameter c to all the linear previous job coefficients and      —

to the linear current job coefficient. Generally, it is found that the quadratic
of current job experience is negative, hence [py — (B/2)] < 0. This implies
that the use of observed earnings biases upwards all the linear experience
coefficients. The relative bias between the previous jobs and the current job
cannot, however, be estimated.

     7This is, of course, a general problem with this family of earnings functions.
Recently, it was shown by Hanushek and Quigley (1977) that by using certain
assumptions restricting the interactions between investment and labor supply some
of the parameters may be identified.

     '81n the empirical section below, however, the investment ratios
ki will be estimated for several values of r1B/2 (which allows us to identify
rP for i<n and rpy). Thus for a given value of the rate of return the
investment ratio can be calculated.

 equation is because of the existence of a positive        orrelation between investment

 and job duration: the higher the remaining time in the current job, the higher

 the incentive to Invest more in the current time pet iod t (since the payoff

 period to that part of investment which is specific is longer), therefore the

 lover current earnings. The Interaction between R nd e is positive because

 the theory suggest more investment in longer jobs:        the longer en the more

 investment that occurred on the job, therefore the higher the returns the in—

dividual is collecting at time t. Thus the specific training hypothesis can

be tested by taking advantage of the nature of panel data. If individuals can

be observed over a relatively long period of time, t hen we can obtain (at least

for a subset of the sample) completed time in the current job.

III. The Earnings   of   Older Men

  A. The Sample

     The National Longitudinal Survey was started in the year 1966 for men

aged 45—59 during the original survey. This data pr )Vides us with a longitudinal
                                                               19
(though retrospective) working life history of older men.            Because of the

structure of the questionnaire, it Is possible to ge :,      at most,   the duration

of three jobs in the individual's working life: the first full—time job ever

held after completion of schooling, the longest job ver, and the current job.

Since two or three of these jobs might refer to the same       job   (that is, the first

job was also the longest job, etc.) we have differei it numbers of jobs across

individuals. The data also allows us to determine ti e time elapsed between jobs——

e.g., time elapsed between the first and   longest   job    or a "residual."

     The earnings functions derived earlier require i he same number of jobs across

individuals.   To do this, the sample was broken up ii Lto four job mobility patterns:




     19See The Pre—Retirement Years, Volume I, Manpo er Research Monograph
No. 15, United States Department of Labor, for an ext :ensive discussion of the
survey and of the techniques employed in collecting the data.
                                       12




     Pattern 1——only one job has been held since the completion of schooling.

Obviously, this pattern is composed of the most non—mobile individuals.

     Pattern 2——the first job after the completion of schooling is different from

the current job, which is also the longest job ever. We can also identify the

time elapsed between the first and current jobs, or a residual. This pattern,

therefore, is characterized by three segments.

     Pattern 3——the first job was the longest job ever, and is different from

the current job. Again we can identify a residual: the time elapsed between the

first and current jobs. This pattern, too, is characterized by three segments.

     Pattern 4——the first, longest, and current jobs are all different. Two

residuals can be estimated for these individuals: the time elapsed between the

first and longest jobs, and the time elapsed between the longest and current jobs.

This mobility pattern clearly contains the most mobile individuals and is

characterized by five segments.

     In order to pool the samples a simple method is used throughout. All in-

dividuals are assumed to have a current job. Define FIRST as the first job

after completion of schooling, if different from the current job; RESID1 as the

residual following the first job; LONGEST as the longest job ever, if different

from both the first and current jobs; RESID2 as the residual following the

longest job; and CURRENT as the current job. If a job does not exist for a given

individual, a zero is coded as his experience for that particular job.20

     The sample was restricted to white, salaried men who were working in 1966

and who had valid data for wages, working life histories and the other key

variables in the analysis. These restrictions reduced the sample size to 1976

observations of which about 90 percent are in mobility patterns 2 or 4.




     20For example, in mobility pattern 2——where the first job is different from
the current (longest) job—-FIRST, RESID1, and CURRENT would exist, but LONGEST
and RESID2 would be coded as zero.
                                           13



Table 1 gives the list of variables used in the stud'r. Table 2 gives suary

statistics for each of the mobility patterns and for     the   pooled sample. It shows

systematic variations in the characteristics of thee individuals across mobility

patterns. The least mobile men (Pattern 1) have vag rates 33.8 percent higher

than the most   mobile   (Pattern 4) men. The same find: Lng holds when we compare

Pattern 2 (where the current job is the longest job ver) to Pattern 4: those

men who have been longest at the current job have va e rates 17.6 percent higher.

Moreover, it can also be seen in Table 2 that in comi aring the two largest

mobility patterns, differences in personal character: stics such as education,

health, etc., are too small to explain the sizable w ge differential.

B. Estimates of the human Capital Earnings Function

     Table 3 gives the unsegmented earnings function derived in equation (3) for

the pooled sample and across mobility patterns using the natural logarithm of

the wage rate as the dependent variable. The explan tory power of the equation

is small. The estimated investment ratios are largei • and more significant

for the less mobile, Patterns 1 and 2. For the most mobile men in Pattern 4,

the estimate of the investment ratio is negative. T Lie     result   might be caused

by two factors: this sample might have an average e rnings        profile   that has

already peaked and/or mobile men invested significan ly lees than the non—mobile

men in on—the—job training, and once the depreciatiot rate is taken into account

net investment becomes zero or negative. Thus even i t     this    level, the basic

hypothesis of this paper, namely that job mobility a fects        the rate of growth

of earnings adversely, is confirmed.

     The individuals in Pattern 1 have only had one ob. Therefore the analysis

of their earnings profile does not require any furth r segmentation of the

investment path. The coefficient of experience can 1 e used to calculate an

estimate of the investment ratio. If the rate of ret urn is assumed to be 10

percent, the initial investment ratio is .18.

       The segmented earnings function (with and without interaction terms) is

 presented in Table 4 for the pooled sample. As can be seen, the interaction

 terms are mostly negative, and in fact the addition of the interaction terms

 to the simpler segmentation in Column 1 significantly increases the explanatory

 power of the equation (the F statistic is 2.21, significant at the 10 percent

 level). Note also that the coefficients of
                                                      previous experience are significantly
 weaker than the effect of current experience and
                                                           that the coefficient of the
 longest job prior to the current job is by far the largest and most significant

 of all the previous job coefficients.

      By estimating the segmented earnings function within each mobility pattern,

 it is possible to calculate the investment ratios for the different jobs in

 each mobility pattern. These regressions are shown in Table A—i of the Appendix.

As can be seen, the estimates are
                                           generally not very significant but this is
mainly due to the large amount of aulticollinearity
                                                              among the variables. Table 5
presents the initial investment ratios for several values of rB/2 (assumed to

be the same across all jobs in the individual's
                                                         life cycle):21 .0010, .0015,
and .0020. The estimates are presented assuming r —
                                                               .10,   since varying the
rate of return did not affect the qualitative results of the analysis. Table 5

also presents estimates of the "projected" investment
                                                                ratio, k. defined as what
investment would have been if the particular job had been the first job in the

life cycle.22




     2These estimates of r/2 cover the range of those found in the literature
on unsegmented earnings functions. For example, Mincer (1974) has an estimated
rB/2 — .0012.

     22Mathematically,         — k01   +   This measure is useful since by
                                   a1
assuming the    to be constant across jobs, the difference in     from one job
to another measures the change in investment from the last time period in the old
job to the first time period in the new job.

     The results presented earlier for those individuals who were least mobile

(Pattern 1) indicated they invested heavily on the job as expected since these

men currently receive returns on all training ever acquired (net of depreciation),

and since they had more incentive to invest larger amounts In their only job.

     For the individuals in Pattern 2——where the first job was a short job

different from the current (longest) job——investment was also extensive. The

estimate of k01 for the current job is higher than the estimates for previous

jobs, despite the fact that the current job started 15.4 years after the

beginning of labor force experience.

     The estimates for individuals in Pattern 3——where the longest job was

the first job——are highly dependent on the functional, form of the earnings

function. One reason for the instability of the coefficients might be the small

size of this mobility pattern (113 observations). The results do indicate

little investment in all jobs.

     The results for the most mobile individuals——Pattern 4——show that little

investment occurred in all jobs except he longest. Both the first and current

jobs yield estimated k1's which are negative even though in the actual regression

the current job coefficient was significantly higher than all the other coefficients.

The fact that these estimates are negative might be because these are ratios net

of depreciation.

     The projected       shown in Table 5 yield two important empirical findings.

Note that since we have assumed the same rate of decline within all jobs, the

difference between    across jobs gives the shift in the level of the investment

profile from one job to the other. The estimates in Table 5 show consistently

higher koi the later the job. This finding indicates that there is an upward

shift in the level of the investment profile after changing jobs. A second
                                          21




finding given by the        of Patterns 2 and 4 is that the size of the jump in

investment across jobs is highest when individuals switch to the longest job.

       Summarizing, two important conclusions can be inferred from the analysis

of investment ratios across jobs: First, the results indicate that the non—

mobile invest in time units more than the mobile. This, of course, depresses

current earnings of mobile men, ceteris paribus; thus providing an explanation

as to why the    current earnings of mobile individuals are   lower than the earnings

of   the   non—mobile. Secondly, the findings show that longer duration of jobs

is associated    with higher growth in earnings.
       As shown earlier, a more direct test of the specific training hypothesis
                      *
can   be obtained if t, the total duration of the current job, is observed.
The results using equation (11) are shown in Table 6, using a small     sample of

individuals who left the job    they held in 1966 before 1969. The   coefficient

of   the interaction term (REM x CURRENT) is positive and significant as expected,

thus rn p • .0087.      The coefficient of time remaining (REM) is negative and

approaching statistical significance, thus p — .0620.     The implied estimate of

     is about 14 percent.23 The results unambiguously suggest that the correlation

between job duration and investment is a significant determinant of the distribution

of earnings. The addition of these two variables increases the explanatory power

of the equation (the F statistic is 2.55, significant at the 10 percent level).

The negative effect of REM on current earnings can only be explained by referring

to the effects of specific training and job mobility on the investment profile.

If training were totally general, then time remaining in the current job would




     23Though the signs are as theoretically predicted, the magnitudes are not
reasonable. They are several times higher than the ones used earlier to calculate
investment ratios. This is probably due to the fact that the sample is small and
REM has little variation.

have no effect on the investment profile or on the earnings distribution.

Once specific training is introduced, the payoff period to that portion of the

training which is firm—specific becomes the time remaining in the current job.

The longer the time remaining, the higher the marginal revenue of investment,

so that more investment takes place in the current period. This, of course,

implies lover earnIngs nov. Similarly, the positive interaction term says

that the negative effect of REM on current earnings is balanced by the fact

that longer REM and longer CURRENT would imply a longer job, so that more would

have been invested on the job prior to the current time period, leading to

higher current earnings.

     One   last piece   of evidence on the validity of the specific training

hypothesis is given by measuring the gain of the      fine   degree of segmentation used

in this paper to the unseginented earnings function or to a function which combines

all previous jobs into One segment, PREVIOUS. These two—segment earnings functions

are shown in Table 7 for the pooled sample and for the mobility patterns. When

the results are compared to the full segmentation in the pooled sample (Table 4)

the simpler two—segment earnings function does not      fare   badly. The R2 in the

simpler equation is .223, while the    explanatory   power of the full segmentation

is only slightly higher, .233.

    Within mobility patterns, however, there are significant differences between

the simple segmentation shown in Table 7 and the full segmentation in Appendix

Table A—i. For example, no significant differences in explanatory power can be

detected in the equations for Pattern 2 (where the current job is the longest).

The R2 for the unsegmented equation is .208; it increases to .232 with the two—

job breakdown, and to .234 with the full segmentation. Thus the introduction of

the current job, where most investment took place, is the factor behind the

increase in explanatory power. In Pattern 4, the results are quite different.

The full segmentation gives a much better fit to the earnings profile in this

    mobility pattern: the R2 for the full segmentation is .184, while the explanatory

    power of the simpler equation is only .142, and that of the unsegmented function

    is .140. Thus the increase in R2 comes when we segment previous experience.

    This finding suggests that the more "homogeneous" previous experience, the better

•   the fit of the simpler (two—job) segmentation. That is, in Pattern 4 we are

    combining the longest job and a series of short jobs into one segment of previous

    experience. The results discussed earlier indicated that some investment took

    place in the longest job, but little investment took place in the other previous

    jobs. If we combine these jobs into a single category of previous experience,

    we lose the information given by the relationship between job duration and the

    rate of growth in wages. Therefore the results point out the importance of

    the longest job (regardless of when it occurred) in the determination of earnings.24




         24Note that the analysis has concentrated on the effect of job experience on
    earnings; very little attempt has been made to include other variables in the
    equation. This was done to avoid the "kitchen—sink" tendency of many recent
    analyses using the earnings function. A more detailed specification of the equation
    can be found in Borjas (1975), and does not change any of the qualitative results.
    Secondly, the analysis has focused on documenting the effect of job mobility on
    the slope of the earnings profile. As was mentioned in the introduction, mobility
    also affects the level of the profile. A simple way of estimating this effect is
    to hold some measure of total on—the—job training constant, and then inserting
    variables that measure the extent of mobility. This can be done easily by adding
    mobility pattern dummies to the regression presented in the second column of Table
    4. The coefficients of interest were:

                   Pattern           Coefficient          t—ratio
                      2                 .050                (.9)
                      3                —.043               (—.5)
                      4                 .160               (1.8)

    Thus the results indicate a shifting of the level of the earnings profile of
    about 16 percent for the most mobile individuals in the sample. A more
    detailed analysis of the level effects of job mobility can be found in
    Bartel and Borjas (1977).

IV.   The Earnings of Young Men

      The sample used to study the effects of mobility on earnings at younger ages

is the National Longitudinal Survey of Young Men (aged 14—24 during 1966, the

original survey year).25 Due to the young age range of the individuals being

analyzed and the short duration of the jobs, the analysis is conducted with two

segments of post—school experience:26 duration of all previous jobs and current

job experience. The non—mobile individuals are defined as those men who have

always been in the current job. The data shows that the non—mobile individuals

are younger. This is because of a selectivity bias inherent in the data:

younger men have had less labor force experience, therefore they have had less

opportunity to leave the current job, and are thus classified as non—mobile.

      The average (1969) wage of the non—mobile Is $3.207; while that of the

mobile men is $3.372. Thus the more mobile have wage rates 5.7 percent higher

than the non—mobile. This can, of course, be due to the fact that the mobile have

had, on the average, more labor force experience. The estimated earnings function

for the two mobility patterns is given in Table 8. Using the experience

coefficients in the regressions, the investment ratios, k0, can be estimated.

Given a rate of return of 10 percent, the non—mobile invested .162 of their

time in their only job. The mobile men had an investment ratio of .12 in their

previous job and .29 in the current job. Thus the volume of investment for the

non—mobile is higher than investment for the previous job of the mobile but lower

than investment in the mobile's current job. However, it is important to realize

that due to the selectivity bias inherent in the non—mobile sample (younger men



      25
       An analysis of earnings for this sample is also given in Criliches (1976);
however, his emphasis is on the bias in the schooling coefficient due to omitted
ability variables. The sample is described in U.S. Department of Labor,
Career Thresholds.

     26The sample is restricted to white, working young men who reported the key
variables, and who are not enrolled in school in 1969, the year used in Table 8.

are more likely not to have changed jobs since they have not sampled the labor

market very long) this group is likely to include individuals who will SOOn be

mobile. Thus the average investment ratio is under—estimated for this group.

A more conclusive finding that the volume of investment is positively correlated

with job duration is given by using equation (11), where the completed duration

of the current job is known. The dependent variable in this case is the log of

the wage rate in 1966. The equation was estimated for a sample of individuals

who left the 1966 job before 1969. The estimated equation was:27


          in Y    -.0636 REM + .0367 REM x CURRENT
                  (—2.5)       (3.0)

                  n560,        R2 — .176


Since the coefficient of REM is negative, and the interaction term is positive

(and both are statistically significant) we find that there is a strong positive

correlation between job duration and on-the—job training.

     In order to study the wage differential between the mobile and the non—

mobile groups, a dummy variable set equal to one if the individual has not

been in the current job since the beginning of labor force experience was

included in the equation. Its effect on earnings was insignificantly different

from zero. Thus we find that there is no wage differential by mobility patterns

in this age group. Therefore even though the calculated investment ratios

suggested more on—the—job investment for the non—mobile, the gains from job

mobility are partly compensating the mobile at young ages. As the individuals

age, and less mobility is undertaken (both in absolute terms, and in terms of

the proportion that is voluntary) the accumulation of on—the—job training begins




     27Years of schooling, years in the army, and experience in each of
the jobs (plus quadratics and interactions) were held constant in the equation.
                                         29




to outweigh the gains from job mobility. This process results in significant

wage differentials by the time the men reach age 50 as shown earlier.

V. Summary

     This   paper has analyzed the effects of job mobility on earnings both at

young and at older ages. The discussion in Part II developed an earnings

function which took into account: the discontinuity of earnings across jobs,

the decline of human capital investment within the job and over the life

cycle, and the effects of mobility on the slope of the earnings profile. It was

shown that careful attention to the functional form of the equation led to an

understanding of why the coefficient of the current segment is usually larger

than the coefficient of the previous segments. Using the expanded equation on

the NLS surveys led to several major empirical findings:

     1. Mobile individuals at all ages invest significantly less in on—the—job

training: longer job duration is associated with steeper growth in earnings.

     2. Although job mobility is associated with significant wage gains (across

jobs), there is a substantial wage differential between the mobile and the non—

mobile at older ages. At young ages, however, no wage differential was detected,

thus the gains from mobility plus the lower costs of investment are compensating

the lower returns accruing to the mobile from their lower on—the—job training.

As the men age, less mobility is undertaken so that the gains from mobility fall,

and the non—mobile begin collecting returns on a large volume of training,

leading to higher earnings.

     3. The explanatory power of the equation was significantly increased by

accounting for the effects of job mobility; this increase occurred when the longest

job. The increase in explanatory power, therefore, points out that job mobility

is an important determinant of the wage structure.
