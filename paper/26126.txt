We use the universe of birth records in the United States from 2013 to 2018 to examine the effect
of e-cigarette tax rates on pre-pregnancy smoking and prenatal smoking. We study these
questions using two-way fixed effects models and pregnancy fixed effects models. We show that
e-cigarette taxes increase pre-pregnancy smoking, increase prenatal smoking, and lower smoking
cessation during pregnancy. These findings imply that e-cigarettes and traditional cigarettes are
substitutes among pregnant women. We also find evidence that e-cigarette taxes reduce pre-
pregnancy and third trimester e-cigarette use.

1. Introduction

        Electronic cigarettes (‘e-cigarettes’)1 were developed in China in 2003 (Riker et al. 2012)

and have become increasingly popular over the past decade (Bao et al. 2018, Filippidis et al.

2017). In the United States, the focus of our study, the adult e-cigarette regular use rate was

3.2% in 2018 (4.3% for men and 2.3% for women), which implies over eight million American

adults used these products every day or some days in that year (Creamer et al. 2019).

        There is debate within the medical community as to whether e-cigarette use (‘vaping’)

improves or harms population health (Ribisl, Seidenberg, and Orlan 2016, Kenkel 2016, Royal

College of Physicians 2019, NHS Health Scotland 2017). One potential benefit of e-cigarettes is

that these products may represent a healthier alternative for consuming nicotine -- the addictive

ingredient in tobacco products -- to traditional cigarettes for smokers who are unable to quit. For

example, the Surgeon General of the U.S. has concluded that while e-cigarettes are not harmless,

these products generally contain fewer toxicants than traditional cigarettes (U.S. Department of

Health and Human Services 2016). This harm reduction benefit offered by e-cigarettes could be

potentially important as 68% of current smokers want to quit but cannot (Babb 2017).

        Pregnant women who smoke may place elevated value on e-cigarettes as an alternative to

traditional cigarettes, at least during pregnancy, as such women are highly motivated to quit

smoking. The health harms of maternal smoking are well known, and smoking while pregnant is

highly stigmatized and strongly discouraged by healthcare professionals. However, government

  Other names for these products include: e-cigs, e-hookahs, electronic nicotine delivery systems, ENDS, vape pens,
and vapes. The e-cigarette market contains disposable and rechargeable devices that are available in a wide variety
of forms. We follow the U.S. Surgeon General’s convention in referring to all of these products as e-cigarettes.
While their names differ, all of these devices have the same functional purpose: to allow inhalation of an aerosol
typically containing nicotine, flavorings, and other additives (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2016).

                                                        3
data show that 45% of women smoking three months before their pregnancy are unable to quit

smoking for the duration of pregnancy (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2016).

Pregnant women who cannot quit smoking may therefore disproportionately look to e-cigarettes

for help in quitting, or at least consider transitioning to a product that is perceived as less harmful

for the duration of the pregnancy. E-cigarettes may be especially attractive to pregnant women

who smoke because of reluctance on the part of healthcare professionals to recommend other

forms of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), products that are efficacious for most other

smoking populations (Kapaya, Tong, and Ding 2015). NRTs have not been proven efficacious

for pregnant women and there are concerns that nicotine in NRTs may harm the developing fetus

(Coleman et al. 2015), which likely prevents healthcare professionals from recommending these

products.2 Many pregnant women perceive e-cigarettes as less harmful than traditional cigarettes

for the fetus and helpful in smoking cessation (Wagner, Camerota, and Propper 2017, Mark et al.

2015, Oncken et al. 2017), and a recent clinical trial suggests that e-cigarettes are more effective

for cessation than NRTs for adults generally (Hajek et al. 2019).

        Descriptive evidence on vaping prevalence among pregnant women provides additional

confirmation of such women’s potential interest in e-cigarettes. Data from two states in the

Pregnancy Risk Assessment System (PRAMS) show that in 2015 -- roughly the mid-point of our

study period -- 10.8% of the sample used e-cigarettes in the three months prior to the pregnancy

while 7.0%, 5.8%, and 1.4% used these products at the time of the pregnancy, in the first

trimester, and at birth (Kapaya et al. 2019). According to National Health Interview Survey



2
  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that healthcare professionals discuss costs and
benefits of NRT use only among women who are unable to quit using other methods such as behavioral
interventions (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2016).
                                                        4
(NHIS) data from 2014 to 2017, 38.9% of pregnant smokers used e-cigarettes compared to only

13.5% of non-pregnant, reproductive age women smokers (Liu et al. 2019). The high rates of e-

cigarette use among pregnant women that smoke could be due to these women attempting to quit

traditional cigarette smoking with e-cigarettes.

         Further, dual use of e-cigarettes and traditional cigarettes is common among pregnant

women, which may reflect attempts to reduce smoking (perceived as more harmful to the fetus)

by partially substituting toward e-cigarettes (perceived as less harmful to the fetus). Among

pregnant women, 4.9% reported current use of e-cigarettes in the 2013 to 2014 Population

Assessment of Tobacco and Health and 28.5% of currently smoking pregnant women also used

e-cigarettes (Kurti et al. 2017). Liu et al. (2019) document similar patterns using the 2014 to

2017 NHIS: 38.9% of pregnant women who smoked also used e-cigarettes. Given the

prevalence of e-cigarette use among pregnant women, state and local laws designed to regulate

these products may affect vaping and smoking outcomes among such women.

       In this paper, we use comprehensive records on the universe of births from the U.S. and

provide the first evidence on the effect of e-cigarette taxes on pre-pregnancy and prenatal

smoking. The birth record data contain information on traditional cigarette smoking, mother’s

demographics, and place of birth. We match the birth record data to state and county e-cigarette

taxes levied from 2013 to 2018. We show that the levying of an e-cigarette tax leads to

increased traditional cigarette smoking among pregnant women. E-cigarette taxes increase pre-

pregnancy smoking and tax increases that occur during the pregnancy also increase smoking

among women. We suspect that the changes in smoking that we observe are attributable to

reduced propensity to quit rather than initiation into smoking. Our findings imply that e-

                                                   5
cigarettes and traditional cigarettes are substitutes for pregnant women, which is in line with

previous work that has considered this relationship using different sources of plausibly

exogenous e-cigarette policy variation (Pesko and Currie 2019, Cooper and Pesko 2017).

        We organize the paper as follows. Section 2 discusses taxation of e-cigarettes in the U.S.

and the related literature. Data are listed in Section 3 and Section 4 outlines our methods.

Section 5 reports our main results for pre-pregnancy and prenatal smoking. Sections 6 and 7

provide extensions to pre-pregnancy and prenatal e-cigarette use, and birth outcomes

respectively. Finally, Section 8 concludes.

2. Background and related literature

         E-cigarettes are relatively new products in the U.S. tobacco markets and regulation on

their production, distribution, marketing, and sale is still in the formative stage. The Food and

Drug Administration (FDA), the federal agency with the authority to regulate tobacco products

in the U.S., only gained the power to regulate e-cigarettes in 2016.3 The FDA, however, does

not have the authority to levy e-cigarette taxes; therefore this legislative action has occurred at

the state and local level. As of the end of 2018, the end of our study period, 13 states, counties,

and cities have levied e-cigarette taxes. Unlike traditional cigarette taxation which is a standard

excise tax, localities have levied e-cigarette taxes in varied ways. Delaware, Kansas, Louisiana,

New Jersey, North Carolina, West Virginia, the city of Chicago, and Cook County in Illinois

levy consumer taxes per milliliter of e-liquid. The city of Chicago also levies an excise tax per


3
  The FDA was granted the authority to regulate a wide range of tobacco products through the Family Smoking Act
of 2009. The FDA then ‘deemed’ e-cigarettes as a tobacco product and thus under that agency’s purview. In 2016,
this deeming became official policy with the FDA gaining authority to regulate many attributes related to the
production and sale of e-cigarettes. The FDA has had the authority to regulate smoking cessation products for a
much longer time period, therefore any e-cigarettes marketed explicitly as a cessation product have been under the
purview of this agency prior to 2016.

vaping unit. Washington DC, California, Minnesota, Montgomery County in Maryland, and

Pennsylvania tax a percentage of wholesale value.

       Taxes may reduce e-cigarette use by raising the relative price of the product. Indeed,

three recent studies show that e-cigarette taxes are more than fully passed through to consumers

(Cotti et al. 2020, Allcott and Rafkin 2020, Saffer et al. 2020). For example, Cotti et al. (2020)

estimate a pass-through rate of 1.6 using sales data over the period 2011 to 2017. Increasing the

price of a product by the law of demand will decrease the quantity consumed. In addition,

levying a tax may send a signal to consumers regarding the health harms of the product, thus

reducing demand for e-cigarettes. This phenomenon has been documented for other health

behaviors, for example, see a discussion in the context of soda taxation by Gostin (2017).

Further, a recent paper highlights that traditional cigarette tax changes are often heavily covered

in the news media, and this media attention have an independent effect on product use (Rees-

Jones and Rozema 2019). While we cannot discriminate between these hypotheses in our

analysis, at the market level all will act to reduce the quantity of e-cigarettes consumed.

       Several studies use variation in e-cigarette taxes to estimate cigarette own- and cross-tax

elasticities. Cotti et al. (2020) use data from the Nielsen Retail scanner data (NRSD) and show

that a $1.00 increase in the e-cigarette tax reduces e-cigarette sales by 42% and increases

traditional cigarette sales by 19%. Instrumenting prices with taxes, they also calculate an e-

cigarette own-price elasticity of -1.5 and a cross-price elasticity of 0.9. Pesko, Courtemanche,

and Maclean (2019) combine survey data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey

(BRFSS) and the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) over the period 2011 to 2018 to

study the effects of e-cigarette and traditional cigarette taxes on vaping and smoking. The

                                                  7
authors find that a $1.00 increase in the e-cigarette tax rate increases daily smoking propensity

by 5.3% and the probability of ‘dual use’ (i.e., consuming both e-cigarettes and traditional

cigarettes) by 24.4%. Further, a $1.00 increase in the traditional cigarette tax rate leads to a

14.2% increase in daily vaping. Saffer et al. (2020) study the effect of the first e-cigarette tax

adopted in the U.S. – in the state of Minnesota in 2010 – on adult smoking. The authors show,

using synthetic control methods, that Minnesota’s e-cigarette tax increased smoking and reduced

cessation. In contrast to these studies suggesting that e-cigarettes and cigarettes are economic

substitutes, Cotti, Nesson, and Tefft (2018) use Nielsen household scanner data to show that an

increase in the traditional cigarette tax leads to a reduction in e-cigarette household purchases.

In particular, a $1.00 increase in the traditional cigarette tax reduces household purchases of e-

cigarettes by 61.0%. Finally, Allcott and Rafkin (2020) use a shift-share approach combined

with the NRSD over the period 2013 to 2018 and find limited evidence of substitution.4

         Additionally, several studies use policy variation from e-cigarette minimum legal sale age

(MLSA) laws to estimate the relationship between e-cigarettes and cigarettes. An MLSA

increases the non-pecuniary (or hassle) cost of e-cigarettes as youth below the MLSA are

prohibited from legally purchasing the product. Friedman (2015); Pesko, Hughes, and Faisal

(2016); and Dave, Feng, and Pesko (2019) show evidence of substitution: following the passage

 Several studies use price variation (without instrumentation) to document that e-cigarette purchases fall as e-
cigarette prices rise (Stoklosa, Drope, and Chaloupka 2016, Huang et al. 2018, Pesko et al. 2018, Pesko and Warman
2017, Zheng et al. 2017, Pesko et al. 2016, Marti et al. 2019). A number of studies additionally use market-level
price variation to study cross-price elasticities of demand, without a consensus reached on whether the products are
economic substitutes or complements (Huang et al. 2018, Pesko et al. 2018, Stoklosa, Drope, and Chaloupka 2016,
Pesko and Warman 2017, Zheng et al. 2017). Outside of two studies using discrete choice experiment methods to
experimentally vary the e-cigarette prices, Pesko et al. (2016) and Marti et al. (2019), these studies do not exploit a
plausibly exogenous source of price variation.

                                                          8
of an MLSA youth traditional cigarette use increases. However, in a sample of 12th grade

students, Abouk and Adams (2017) find that MLSA adoption leads to a decrease in youth

smoking, suggesting that the two products are complements.

       A series of studies has investigated the extent to which traditional cigarette taxes and

indoor use bans, both of which are designed to reduce smoking, influence smoking outcomes

among pregnant women using birth record data. While related, these studies do not include data

from the e-cigarette era, thus women do not have the option to substitute e-cigarettes for

traditional cigarettes in response to policy changes. Early studies using birth records document

that higher traditional cigarette taxes reduce smoking among pregnant women with implied own-

tax elasticities of -0.7 to -1 (Ringel and Evans 2001, Colman, Grossman, and Joyce 2003). More

recent studies confirm the negative relationship between traditional cigarette taxes and smoking

among pregnant women in birth record data, although the implied tax-elasticities of demand are

smaller in magnitude. For example, Adams et al. (2012) estimate an elasticity of -0.09.

       In summary, the literature offers definitive evidence that e-cigarette use declines when

the price or tax of this product rises. Most of the available evidence to date suggests that when e-

cigarette prices or taxes rise, traditional cigarette use falls. Thus, we expect that, among

pregnant women, e-cigarette use will decline when localities adopt an e-cigarette tax. However,

the extent to which pregnant women will increase smoking (or reduce smoking cessation)

following such a tax is not clear because pregnant women are different from youth and the

general population. Pregnant women plausibly consider the well-being of the fetus when making

health-related decisions such as whether to alter their e-cigarette and traditional cigarette use

following policy changes. Further, some pregnant women who smoke may be seeking to quit

                                                  9
temporarily, i.e. for the duration of the pregnancy, rather than establishing a longer-term change

in smoking. Our study seeks to provide evidence on this question.

3. Data

3.1 Data on birth records

         We use administrative birth records with geocodes provided by the National Center for

Health Statistics (NCHS).5 In particular, we use the 2003 revised birth record forms rather than

the traditional forms which have been in place since 1988. We use the revised records because

this format includes self-reported smoking information at four points in time: pre-pregnancy

(three months prior to pregnancy) and in each trimester. States transitioned, in a staggered

manner, from the traditional form to the revised form over the period of 2003 to 2015. Neither

revised nor unrevised birth record forms include information on prenatal vaping. However, in an

extension (Section 6) to our main analysis we use data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment and

Monitoring System (PRAMS) to examine e-cigarette use.

         As of May 2020, the time of writing, revised birth records are available from the NCHS

through the end of 2018. We restrict our analysis sample to mothers giving birth on after 2013




5
  As discussed in Section 7, we also study the effect of e-cigarette taxes on infant mortality. To do so, we combine
the birth record data with administrative data on infant deaths administered by NCHS. As of May, 2020, these data
are available through 2017 (compared to through 2018 for birth certificate data). Absent the one-year lag compared
to standard birth certificate data, the birth/infant death period data are identical except for including an indicator for
if the infant died in the same calendar year in which they were born. These data capture approximately 86% of
infant mortality, only missing mortality for infants born in one calendar year and died in the next calendar year (but
within one year of their birth).
                                                            10
or conceiving6 before April 2018 to avoid censoring the data based on gestational length.7 That

is, mothers who conceive after March 2018 and have a full term pregnancy would not be

observed in all three trimesters if we extended our study period to incorporate more recent data.

We begin our study period in 2013 to ensure a representative sample; by this year all but three

states (Connecticut, New Jersey, and Rhode Island) had adopted the revised birth record format.

Minnesota was the first locality in the U.S. to adopt an e-cigarette tax (August 2010). In

robustness checks reported later in the manuscript we show that our results are insensitive to

beginning the sample in 2011 and excluding the 13 states that had not adopted the revised birth

record format by that year.

         We make several additional exclusions to form our analysis sample. First, we exclude

mothers giving birth in Hawaii and Alaska because these states are not included in the Nielsen

Retail Scanner data that is used to create standardized e-cigarette taxes (described in Section

3.2). Second, we exclude non-singleton births to reduce potential confounding from fertility

treatment availability (Kulkarni et al. 2013). Third, we exclude a small number (2.4%) of

mothers with missing smoking information pre-pregnancy and in any of the three

trimesters. These exclusions leave us with 20,965,502 mothers.

         We construct three traditional cigarette smoking measures: (i) any smoking during the

pregnancy, (ii) the average number of traditional cigarettes smoked per day during the



6
  We assume that the infant was born at the mid-point of the month recorded in the birth record. We then use
gestational length in weeks, to identify the estimated point of conception and the start of the three trimesters. The
first trimester is defined as the point of ovulation that led to pregnancy. The second trimester is defined as week 14
of pregnancy (14 weeks after last menstrual period). The third trimester is defined as week 28 of pregnancy.
7
  For example, a mother conceiving after March 2018 would only appear in our data in the event of a premature
birth. By restricting our sample to conceptions occurring on or before March 2018, we avoid this issue of our
sample only containing premature births, which are very different from full term births, beyond March 2018.

pregnancy, and (iii) any smoking during the three months prior to conception (‘pre-pregnancy

smoking’). As mentioned above, birth records do not include vaping information.

3.2 Data on e-cigarette taxes

       We identify dates of e-cigarette and traditional cigarette taxes from the Vapor Products

Tax Data Center (2019), American Nonsmokers Rights Foundation (proprietary data), and the

Tax Foundation (2018). Online Appendix Table 1 lists the localities levying e-cigarette taxes at

different points in time through the end of 2018. Figure 1 reports the number of new e-cigarette

tax adoptions in each year of our study and Figure 2 graphically displays the tax variation.

Among adopting localities there is no clear geographic clustering and, given the limited number

of adopting localities, we have reasonably good coverage of the U.S.

       We also consider heterogeneity in the size of these taxes. While traditional cigarette

excise tax units are common across localities (i.e., a dollar value per pack of 20 traditional

cigarettes), e-cigarette taxes are levied in different ways. Of the 13 localities levying an e-

cigarette tax by the end of our study period, five use an ad valorem tax on the wholesaler and

eight use an excise tax per milliliter (ml) of vaping liquid. Of the six localities using excise

taxes, five of these range from $0.05 to $0.20 per fluid milliliter (ml). For comparison, each

JUUL (a leading manufacturer of e-cigarettes in the U.S. at the time of writing) disposable pod

contains 0.7 fluid ml of liquid nicotine, implying that these excise taxes are quite small. Ad

valorem taxes range from 27.3% to 96.0% during our study period, implying these taxes are

much larger than excise taxes.

       Washington DC’s tax is unique in that the ad valorem tax rate is set to match 100% of the

traditional cigarette tax, suggesting that each one percentage point or ‘ppt’ of ad valorem tax is

                                                 12
4.3 cents. Following Cotti et al. (2020), we use this relationship to convert e-cigarette ad

valorem taxes into excise tax equivalents for each relevant locality. Please see the Online

Appendix for a detailed discussion of our conversion process, which utilizes Nielsen Retail

Scanner data. Our primary e-cigarette tax measure is therefore a continuous tax variable

representing the actual excise tax rate, or the excise tax rate equivalency for an ad valorem tax.

We refer to the converted tax as the ‘standardized’ e-cigarette tax.

3.3 Data on additional policies

        We adjust for other tobacco control policies in our regression models. Specifically, we

control for inflation-adjusted federal, state, and local traditional cigarette taxes (Centers for

Disease Control and Prevention 2019); state and county e-cigarette MLSA laws8 (Pesko and

Currie 2019); Tobacco 21 laws (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2019); and county-

level share of the population covered by indoor vaping restrictions and indoor smoking

restrictions in bars, restaurants, and private workplaces.9 We also control for Affordable Care

Act (ACA) Medicaid expansion status (Maclean, Pesko, and Hill 2019, Kaiser Family

Foundation 2020). We control for ACA Medicaid expansion as, following expansion, lower

income women may have gained eligibility for this insurance program prior to conceiving.

Medicaid expansion plans covered a range of effective cessation medications and (non-

laws for vaping or smoking in different venues. We use this information to create two separate measures for the
share of the population in each county living with indoor smoking and indoor vaping restrictions for private
workplaces, restaurants, or bars. We weight laws applying to bars, restaurants, and private workplaces equally. For
indoor smoking restrictions, we also consider laws applying to only part of the establishment (but not the full
establishment) with ½ weight. Partial laws are uncommon for indoor vaping restrictions.

2019). All monetary values are consumer price index-adjusted to 2010 dollars.

4. Methods

       We first estimate the effects of e-cigarette taxes on pre-pregnancy and prenatal smoking

in a two-way fixed effects specification outlined in Equation (1):

(1)    𝑆𝑖,𝑐,𝑠,𝑡 = 𝛼 + 𝛽𝑇𝑎𝑥𝑐,𝑠,𝑡 + 𝑇𝑃𝑐,𝑠,𝑡 𝛾 + 𝑋𝑖,𝑐,𝑠,𝑡 𝜃 + ɣ𝑐,𝑠 + 𝜔𝑡 + µ𝑠,𝑦 + 𝜀𝑖,𝑐,𝑠,𝑡

i indexes a pregnancy with conception year-month t of conception year y, in county c in state s.

𝑆𝑖,𝑐,𝑠,𝑡 is an indicator for whether the mother smoked at any point during the pregnancy, or the

average daily number of traditional cigarettes smoked while pregnant. 𝑇𝑎𝑥𝑐,𝑠,𝑡 is either e-

cigarette tax adoption or the standardized e-cigarette tax rate. 𝑋𝑖,𝑐,𝑠,𝑡 includes mother's

race/ethnicity (White, non-Hispanic, Black, non-Hispanic, Hispanic, and other), age (separate

indicators for ages 14 through 50), primary payment source information on file at birth

(Medicaid, private insurance, uninsured, Indian Health Service, military [CHAPUS/TRICARE],

other government sources, other, and unknown), marital status (married, not married, and

unknown), education (less than high school, high school, some college, a college degree or more,

and unknown), and birth count (one, two, …, seven, eight or more, and unknown). 𝑇𝑃𝑐,𝑠,𝑡

includes tobacco control and ACA Medicaid policies.

       We control for county fixed effects (ɣ𝑐,𝑠 ), which mitigate potential bias from time

invariant, county-specific factors. Note that county fixed effects incorporate state fixed effects




                                                   14
as counties are nested within states. Including these fixed effects allows us to leverage within

locality (county or state) variation in e-cigarette taxes for identification of treatment effects.10

         Time controls include month-by-year of conception fixed effects (𝜔𝑡 ) and state-by-year

of conception fixed effects (µ𝑠,𝑦 ). Including month-by-year of conception fixed effects allows us

to account for time varying factors affecting the nation as a whole, such as the increase in the

popularity of e-cigarettes that occurred over our study period. Additionally, state-by-year of

conception fixed effects isolates the impact of e-cigarette taxes on smoking outcomes within the

conception year in which the e-cigarette tax is levied for that specific state, allowing us to

account for other potential sources of omitted variable bias.

         𝛽̂ is our primary coefficient of interest and captures the effect of e-cigarette taxes on

smoking outcomes. We expect 𝛽̂ to be positive if e-cigarettes are substitutes for traditional

cigarettes among pregnant women. However, if instead these products are complements, then 𝛽̂

should be negative. Finally, the two products may be unrelated goods among pregnant women,

suggesting that 𝛽̂ will be zero.

         A necessary assumption for the two-way fixed effects model to recover causal estimates

is that the treatment (i.e., localities adopting an e-cigarette tax) and the comparison (i.e.,

localities not adopting an e-cigarette tax) groups would have followed the same trend in pre-

pregnancy and prenatal smoking outcomes in the post-treatment period, had the treatment

localities not been treated. While this assumption is clearly untestable as adopting localities are



10
  We use place codes provided in the birth records to divide Cook County into the city of Chicago and the rest of
Cook County, given that the city of Chicago passed a city e-cigarette tax prior to the passage of a county-wide tax
(see Appendix Table 1 for more details). Both localities are treated as separate counties (and receive separate
county fixed effects) in all regression models.
                                                         15
treated in the post-period and hence we cannot observe counterfactual trends, we provide

suggestive evidence on whether the parallel trends assumption is satisfied by modifying Equation

(1) into an event study design, which is standard within the economic literature (Autor 2003).

        To implement the event study, we replace the e-cigarette tax variable (i.e., indicator for

any tax/standardized tax) with a set of mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive tax leads

and lags that divide the study period into the following categories (all relative to the e-cigarette

effective date): conception >18 months before, >15 to 18 months before, >12 to 15 months

before, >9 to 12 months before (omitted category), >6 to 9 months before (i.e., the e-cigarette tax

plausibly affects pregnant women during their third trimester), >3 to 6 months before (i.e., the e-

cigarette tax plausibly affects pregnant women during their second and third trimester), >0 to 3

months before (i.e., the e-cigarette tax plausibly affects pregnant women during all trimesters), 0

to >3 months after conception, and >3 months after conception.11 Apart from including tax leads

and lags instead of the e-cigarette tax, the event study equation is identical to Equation (1).

        In the event study specification, the coefficient estimates on the tax leads can provide

evidence of differential pre-trends between the treatment and comparison groups. Differential

pre-trends may occur if, for example, localities adopt e-cigarette taxes in response to changes in

pre-pregnancy and prenatal smoking outcomes and/or there are anticipatory behaviors on the part

of pregnant smokers. If the coefficient estimates on the tax leads are small in magnitude and

statistically indistinguishable from zero, this pattern of null results suggests that the parallel

trends assumption is plausibly satisfied in the birth record data and that our two-way fixed



11
  Between the end of our study period in 2018 and the end of 2019, eight additional states enacted new e-cigarette
laws (i.e., Connecticut, Illinois, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin). We use
these additional taxes in constructing the policy leads and lags (Schmidheiny and Siegloch 2019).
                                                        16
effects models can recover causal estimates of e-cigarette tax effects. The event lag indicators

are informative for assessing any dynamics in tax effects that emerge over time in the post-

period. Dynamics may capture the time required for a levied tax to be passed through to

consumers (e.g., menu costs, stockpiling among e-cigarette users) or avoidance behaviors among

consumers (e.g., purchasing e-cigarettes in localities that do not levy the tax or online). These

behaviors suggest that e-cigarette tax effects could increase or decrease over time post-tax.

       As a secondary analysis, we explore the effect of e-cigarette tax adoption that occurs

during a mother’s pregnancy on within-pregnancy smoking; we refer to this analysis as the

‘panel data analysis.’ We create a panel of pregnancies with four observations per pregnancy;

that is we rely on the balanced panel in this analysis. We focus on any smoking and number of

cigarettes smoked at each of the four time periods in the panel data analysis. We estimate the

regression model outlined in Equation (2):

(2)    𝑆𝑖,𝑐,𝑠,𝑝,𝑡 = 𝜌 + 𝜋𝑇𝑎𝑥𝑐,𝑠,𝑡 + 𝑇𝑃𝑐,𝑠,𝑡 𝜙 + 𝛿𝑖 + 𝜅𝑝,𝑡 + 𝜗𝑖,𝑐,𝑠,𝑝,𝑡 ,

where i is a mother in period p (either in the three months prior to pregnancy or in each of the

three trimesters) and t indexes year-by-month of the start of each period p. As these variables do

not vary within-mother, we replace individual mother characteristics with pregnancy fixed

effects (𝛿𝑖 ). We control for period-by-year-by-month fixed effects (𝜅𝑝,𝑡 ). Pregnancy fixed

effects incorporate locality fixed effects.

       All models are estimated with linear probability models when the outcome is binary and

least squares when the outcome is continuous. We use variation generated by the decisions of

counties and states to levy e-cigarette taxes. Thus, the correct level (county or state) at which to

cluster standard errors is unclear. We choose to cluster standard errors at the state level to

                                                   17
provide conservative estimates of precision. However, as we report in robustness checking, our

precision is not markedly different if we instead cluster standard errors at the county level.

5. Results

5.1 Summary statistics

       Table 1 reports summary statistics for the full sample, the sample of counties that levy an

e-cigarette tax, and the sample of counties that do not levy an e-cigarette tax by the end of 2018.

7.6% and 9.9% of the full sample reported any smoking while pregnant and any smoking in the

three months prior to conception. In the full sample, the unconditional average number of

traditional cigarettes smoked per day before pregnancy is 1.3. Smoking declines monotonically

as the birth date approaches: the unconditional average number of traditional cigarettes smoked

per day in the first, second, and third trimesters is 0.79, 0.60, and 0.53, respectively. For all

smoking variables that we consider, smoking is lower in counties that levy vs. do not levy an e-

cigarette tax. For example, average pre-pregnancy daily unconditional number of traditional

cigarettes smoked in counties that levy an e-cigarette tax is 0.97 and this average is 1.43 in

counties that did not levy such a tax.

       The racial/ethnic breakdown of the sample is 52.6% non-Hispanic White, 14.3% non-

Hispanic Black, 23.6% Hispanic, and 9.5% other race. The average age of mothers at the birth

of their child in our sample is just over 28 years. Private insurance finances 47.9% (the plurality)

of all births in the sample, with Medicaid, self-pay, and other payment forms (Indian Health

Service, military insurance, other government sources, other, and payment source unknown)

financing 43.2%, 4.1%, and 5.0% of births, respectively.



                                                  18
       Demographics and policies vary somewhat across counties that levy and do not levy an e-

cigarette tax. We control for these differences in all regression models.

5.2 Two-way fixed effects regression results

       Our main results are reported in Table 2, with panel A showing results for any prenatal

smoking, panel B showing results for average number of traditional cigarettes smoked per day

during the pregnancy, and panel C showing results for any pre-pregnancy smoking. We model

e-cigarette taxes, measured at the time of conception, in two ways: (i) any e-cigarette tax

indicator, and (ii) standardized e-cigarette tax rate (i.e., excise tax equivalency per fluid ml). For

each approach to modelling e-cigarette taxes, we report coefficient estimates generated in

specifications with controls for (i) county and time fixed effects (i.e., month-by-year of

conception and state-by-year of conception); (ii) county and time fixed effects, and mothers’

demographics; and (iii) county and time fixed effects, mothers’ demographics, and other

policies. A full set of coefficient estimates for the any prenatal smoking specification is reported

in Online Appendix Table 2.

       The levying of an e-cigarette tax leads to a 0.4 percentage point (ppt) increase in the

probability of any smoking during pregnancy (Table 2, panel A, columns 1 to 3). Comparing

this coefficient estimate to the prenatal smoking proportion in localities that levy e-cigarette

taxes prior to the tax adoption (all coefficient estimates are compared to this baseline

henceforth), the relative effect size is 7.7%. A $1.00 increase in the standardized e-cigarette tax

increases prenatal smoking by 0.3 to 0.4 ppts (5.8 to 7.7%). This pattern of results suggests that

e-cigarettes and traditional cigarettes are substitute products among pregnant women.



                                                  19
       Results for the average number of traditional cigarettes smoked per day (Table 2, panel

B) closely mirror our any prenatal smoking findings. The levying of an e-cigarette tax leads to

0.037 to 0.039 (8.9 to 9.3%) more traditional cigarettes smoked per day among pregnant women.

Similarly, the number of traditional cigarettes smoked per day increases by 0.037 to 0.044 (8.9 to

10.5%) following a $1.00 increase in the standardized e-cigarette tax. In Table 2, panel C we

test the effect of e-cigarette taxes on smoking in the three months prior to conception. We find

that adoption of an e-cigarette tax leads to a 0.5 ppt (7.4%) increase in the probability of pre-

pregnancy smoking and a $1.00 increase in the standardized e-cigarette tax leads to a 0.4 to 0.5

ppt increase (5.9 to 7.4%) in the probability of this outcome. The coefficient estimates are

similar to the 0.4 to 0.3 ppt increase in the probability of any prenatal smoking shown in panel A,

suggesting that the increase in prenatal smoking attributable to e-cigarette taxes is mostly due to

women smoking more before becoming pregnant.

       Having demonstrated similarity between the any e-cigarette tax measure and the

standardized e-cigarette tax rate in previously discussed results, for brevity we only present

results using the standardized e-cigarette tax rate going forward. Full results using the any tax

indicator are available on request.

5.3 Internal validity of the research design

       Event study coefficient estimates and associated standard errors for our three smoking

outcomes are reported in Table 3, using the first e-cigarette tax adoption as the relevant event to

form the policy leads and lags. We also report these results graphically in Figure 3. Coefficient

estimates appear to increase in the post period. For example, women conceiving during a time in

which e-cigarette taxes had been in place for three or more months are 0.5 ppts more likely to

                                                 20
prenatally smoke and 0.7 ppts more likely to pre-pregnancy smoke (relative to women

conceiving nine to twelve months before an e-cigarette tax came into effect).

       The event study results for any prenatal smoking and any pre-pregnancy smoking provide

suggestive evidence of parallel pre-trends in our outcomes between localities that levy and do not

levy an e-cigarette tax by 2018. All coefficient estimates are smaller in absolute value than the

effects measured for conceiving during a time in which e-cigarette taxes had been in place for

three or more months. Only one coefficient estimate is statistically significant at the 10% level,

which is within what we would expect to observe from random chance.

       For pre-pregnancy smoking, the period of time nine to 12 months prior to the e-cigarette

tax may not be an appropriate reference group because that includes the period of time in which

pre-pregnancy smoking behaviors may be affected by the tax. For that reason, we alternatively

use 12 to 15 months prior as a reference as well. Event study results are not materially different

regardless of the reference group used; see column (4) in Table 3.

       Additionally, we test the internal validity of the two-way fixed effects models by

exploring whether e-cigarette taxes influence birth rates. If e-cigarette taxes affect birth rates

through changes in conception or fetal deaths, then our regression coefficients may suffer from

conditional-on-positive (COP) bias (Angrist and Pischke 2009). To explore this hypothesis, we

estimate a model using county-by-conception year/month counts as the dependent variable and

controlling for aggregated information from the birth records (i.e., share non-Hispanic White,

share Hispanic, average age at birth, share married, shares with different education levels, and

average birth order), county fixed effects, year-by-month of conception fixed effects, state-by-

conception year fixed effects, and time-varying controls included in Equation (1). We report

                                                  21
findings from this analysis in Table 4, first for all mothers and then for mothers of different ages,

education levels, insurance types, and birth orders. None of the coefficient estimates on the e-

cigarette tax variable (representing the effect of a large e-cigarette tax increase of $1) are

statistically significant different from zero. Thus, we find no evidence of substantial COP bias

stemming from fertility rates changing in response to e-cigarette taxes.

         Finally, we test for balance in observable characteristics across treatment and comparison

groups following Pei, Pischke, and Schwandt (2018). Specifically, we regress the standardized

e-cigarette tax on tobacco control policies, mothers’ demographics from the birth records

(aggregated to the county-year level), and various fixed effects reported in Equation (1).12

Results are reported in Table 5. We find that traditional cigarette taxes (p<0.01) are correlated

with e-cigarette taxes, but we observe no evidence that any other covariates predict our treatment

variable. While achieving full balance across treatment and comparison groups is obviously

optimal, given that e-cigarettes and traditional cigarettes are plausibly related products, the

observed correlations are perhaps not surprising. For example, this correlation may simply

reflect an overall tobacco control policy strategy, which targets both e-cigarettes and traditional

cigarettes, adopted by a locality. Previous research provides evidence for this hypothesis

(Maclean et al. 2018). Of note, we control for tobacco control policies in all specifications.

         Overall, we interpret the findings from our examination of the two-way fixed effects

identification strategy to imply that the birth records data satisfy necessary assumptions.

5.4 Heterogeneity in e-cigarette tax effects across mother characteristics



12
  Because our outcome variable in this regression is the standardized e-cigarette rate, we are testing for balance
across localities with different levels of treatment (i.e., the standardized e-cigarette tax rate) intensity. Results are
very similar if we instead use the any e-cigarette tax rate indicator as our outcome variable (available on request).
                                                            22
       We next explore the extent to which e-cigarette tax effects vary across mother

characteristics. More specifically, we estimate separate regressions by mother’s age (30 years or

less vs. older than 30 years), educational attainment (high school education or less vs. some

college or more), and primary payer for pregnancy healthcare (Medicaid and private insurance;

we lack sufficient sample size to estimate separate regressions for other payment sources). We

also separately examine mothers who are having their first-birth or higher-order births.

       Perceptions about the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to traditional cigarettes may

vary by socio-demographic factors, thereby affecting the degree to which individuals may view

e-cigarettes and traditional cigarettes as substitutable products. For example, more educated and

younger adults consider e-cigarettes to be less harmful than traditional cigarettes (Viscusi 2016,

Pearson et al. 2012, Chivers et al. 2016). Further smoking while pregnant is more common

among younger, Medicaid enrolled, and less educated women (Centers for Disease Control and

Prevention 2016). These differences in risk perceptions and product use open the door to the

possibility of heterogeneous e-cigarette tax effects across demographic groups.

       Heterogeneity analysis results are reported in Table 6 for smoking outcomes. Results for

any smoking are broadly similar across age, education, and parity groups. While coefficient

estimates vary across sub-samples we note that 95% confidence intervals overlap preventing us

from drawing strong conclusions regarding heterogeneous treatment effects. For example,

among younger mothers (under age 30), the probability of prenatal smoking increases by 0.4 ppts

(6.7%) following a $1.00 increase in the e-cigarette tax while the corresponding increase among

older mothers (30 years and above) is 0.3 ppts (9.1%). Among mothers with no college

education the probability of smoking increases by 0.6 ppts (7.5%) for a $1.00 increase in the e-

                                                23
cigarette tax while the corresponding increase among mothers with a college degree or more is

0.2 ppts (7.4%). Among mothers whose delivery is financed by Medicaid, following a $1.00

increase in the e-cigarette tax the probability of smoking increases by 0.3 ppts (4.0%) compared

to 0.1 ppts (4.6%) for mothers whose delivery is financed by private insurance (we acknowledge

that these coefficient estimates are imprecise within insurance-stratified samples). Finally,

among first time mothers, a $1.00 increase in the standardized e-cigarette tax leads to a 0.5 ppt

(12.4%) increase in smoking and among mothers with previous births smoking increases by 0.4

ppts (7.2%) following such an e-cigarette tax increase. Results for traditional cigarettes smoked

per day and any pre-pregnancy smoking are similar to the findings for any prenatal smoking.

5.5 Panel data analysis

       We next estimate Equation (2) in which we convert the cross-sectional data to panel

form. More specifically, we use four observations per pregnancy (one pre-pregnancy and three

for each trimester of the pregnancy) rather than one, along with pregnancy and trimester fixed

effects. Results are reported in Table 7.

       We find that increases in the standardized e-cigarette tax rate raises trimester-specific

smoking by 1.1 ppts (21.0%) and the number of cigarettes smoked during pregnancy by 0.29

cigarettes daily (51.6%). These findings suggest that e-cigarette tax increases reduce rates of

smoking cessation during pregnancy. Two other studies have also documented that e-cigarette

regulations reduce smoking cessation during the pregnancy (Cooper and Pesko 2017, Pesko and

Currie 2019). Therefore, e-cigarette taxes appear to affect prenatal smoking both through raising

pre-pregnancy smoking levels and reducing smoking cessation during the course of pregnancy.

5.6 Robustness checks

                                                24
       Our results are stable across several alternative specifications. We explore only the

outcome of prenatal smoking having previously demonstrated similarities across our three

smoking outcomes. We first re-run the analysis, but begin the sample in 2011 and exclude 13

states that had not adopted revised birth records by 2011 from the analysis sample to maintain a

balanced cohort of states through the analysis. These results are reported in Online Appendix

Table 3 and are virtually unchanged from those reported in Table 2.

       Second, we cluster standard errors at the level of county rather than state (Online

Appendix Table 4). This approach to inference is arguably less conservative than the approach

we take in the main results in which we cluster by state. Clustering at this level does not change

the precision of our coefficient estimates.

       Third, we use an alternative construction of the e-cigarette standardized tax variable to

address possible sources of endogeneity (Online Appendix Table 5, see the Online Appendix for

details on the alternative measure and potential endogeneity). Results are substantially similar.

       Fourth, we also sequentially drop each treatment locality and re-estimate Equation (1)

(i.e., ‘leave one out analysis’) to test whether our main findings are driven by the unique

experiences of particular localities. Results, reported in Online Appendix Tables 6A through 6C

and displayed graphically in Online Appendix Figure 1, are stable across different ‘leave-one-

out’ samples and imply that we are not capturing the effect of one or two localities.

       Fifth, we exclude (collectively) California, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, and Montgomery

County Maryland from the sample and re-estimate Equation (1). The purpose of this exercise is

to provide testing on a key assumption of our e-cigarette tax conversion process. In our

conversion process (see the Online Appendix for full details) we assume that these four localities

                                                 25
(which use ad valorem taxes) have wholesale prices that are identical to Washington DC’s

wholesale price. While we have no information to suspect that these market structures differ

across these localities, we wish to explore the importance of this assumption for our findings.

Results, reported in Appendix Table 6C (final column), are very similar to our main coefficient

estimates. In particular, a $1.00 increase in the standardized e-cigarette tax rate leads to a 0.7 ppt

increase in the probability of any prenatal smoking compared to a 0.5 ppt increase in our main

specification (Table 2).

       Finally, we re-explore the effect of e-cigarette taxes on pre-pregnancy smoking by

linking the e-cigarette tax to three months prior to pregnancy rather than the date of conception

(Online Appendix Table 7). This alternative linking procedure leads to some mothers previously

assigned to the pre-e-cigarette tax comparison group being now assigned to the post-e-cigarette

tax treatment group. The coefficient estimate remains identical to that generated in our main

specification (Table 2).

6. Pre-pregnancy and prenatal e-cigarette use

       In the first extension to our main analysis, we test whether e-cigarette taxes reduce e-

cigarette use among pregnant women. For this, we use data from the PRAMS, which collects

information on maternal attitudes and experiences before, during, and shortly after pregnancy for

randomly-sampled pregnant women (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2020).

Between 2016 and 2018, the PRAMS core module includes separate questions on how often the

respondent uses e-cigarettes in the three months before becoming pregnant and in the last three

months of pregnancy. Individuals can respond with the following options: more than once a day,

once a day, two-six days a week, one day a week or less, or none. We use these questions to

                                                 26
create outcomes of any pre-pregnancy e-cigarette use, any third trimester e-cigarette use, and

estimated weekly frequency for both time periods separately.13 We estimate a model identical to

Equation (1) (including the same controls) with a few changes based on the information that is

contained in the PRAMs. In particular, we (1) exclude Illinois and Maryland since sub-state

taxes are present in these states and sub-state identifiers are not available in PRAMS; (2) include

Connecticut, New Jersey, or Rhode Island (these states are excluded from our main analysis as

they not have revised birth records as of 2013 in the NCHS data); (3) do not control for state-by-

conception year fixed effects because of limited time horizon (three years) and smaller sample

sizes in PRAMS;14 and (4) we match the timing of the e-cigarette tax to either three months

before conception or the start of the third trimester depending on the outcome.15

        Our results are present in Table 8. We find that a $1.00 increase in the standardized e-

cigarette tax leads to a reduction in pre-pregnancy e-cigarette use of 1.3 ppt (p<0.01). The same

$1.00 increase in the standardized e-cigarette tax has a large reduction in the probability of third

trimester e-cigarette use of 0.9 ppt (p<0.01). An average (conditional) e-cigarette tax of 45 cents

during our sample period is estimated to reduce the probability of pre-pregnancy e-cigarette use

by 14.3% of the pre-period sample mean for treated states, and third trimester e-cigarette use by

36.8%. Additionally, a $1.00 increase in the e-cigarette tax reduces vaping by approximately

0.15 times per week pre-pregnancy and by 0.10 times per week in the third trimester. We

therefore find early evidence that e-cigarette taxes reduce e-cigarette use among women who will



13
   We use values of 0, 0.5, 4, 7, and 14 for estimated weekly frequency.
14
   However, we do continue to control for conception year-by-month fixed effects.
15
   We view the NCHS birth records as our preferred data set as these data allow us to include three additional years
of data and thus additional policy changes, incorporate sub-state taxes, and leverage a larger sample size. Finally,
we are able to examine four points in time in each pregnancy in the NCHS birth records and just two in the PRAMS.
                                                        27
shortly become pregnant or who are pregnant, which provides evidence to support that e-

cigarette taxes lead to higher traditional cigarette use by reducing e-cigarette use.

7. Birth outcomes

       In the second extension to our main analysis, we estimate the effect of e-cigarette taxes

on birth outcomes. This supplementary analysis sheds light on the extent to which the effect of

e-cigarette taxes on traditional cigarettes and e-cigarettes that we document in Sections 5 and 6

may improve or harm fetal development.

       Several economic studies establish that increases in the traditional cigarette tax rate

improve both birth outcomes and health later in the child’s life by reducing smoking among

pregnant women (Ringel and Evans 2001, Evans and Ringel 1999, Lien and Evans 2005, Simon

2016). For example, Evans and Ringel (1999) show that a $1.00 increase in the traditional

cigarette tax increases birth weight by 16 grams (0.5%) and prenatal smoking reduces

birthweight by 360 grams (11%).

       The extent to which substituting e-cigarettes for traditional cigarettes affects fetal health

is a-priori less obvious than the documented effect of reductions in smoking. This ambiguity is

due to the fact that vaping itself may adversely affect birth outcomes. While e-cigarettes contain

few if any of the carcinogens found in traditional cigarettes, these products generally contain

nicotine which is an important risk factor for adverse fetal development (Holbrook 2016,

Committee on Obstetric Practice 2017). Therefore, any improvements to birth outcomes from

reduced traditional cigarette use may be offset by harm imposed on the fetus from vaping. As

prima facie evidence that pregnant women who transition from traditional cigarettes to e-

cigarettes do not improve the development of the fetus, a recent meta-analysis of available

                                                 28
clinical studies suggests that e-cigarette use may cause similar harms to the fetus as do traditional

cigarettes (Whittington et al. 2018).

           Two recent studies explore the effects of e-cigarette non-tax policies on birth outcomes

and broadly confirm the meta-analysis findings of Whittington et al. (2018). First, Cooper and

Pesko (2017) estimate the effect of e-cigarette indoor bans on prenatal conventional cigarette

smoking and birth outcomes in U.S. states and counties using birth records (the same data that

we utilize). E-cigarette indoor air laws reduce prenatal smoking cessation, but the laws have no

effect on birth outcomes. Second, Pesko and Currie (2019) examine the effect of MLSA laws on

teenage prenatal smoking and birth outcomes, also using birth records, and similarly find that

MLSA laws reduce prenatal smoking cessation rates for rural youth but have no effect on birth

outcomes.16 These studies foreshadow our findings that e-cigarette taxes have no discernable

effect on birth outcomes.

           We also note that our estimated effect sizes for smoking and vaping outcomes are

relatively small in magnitude. For example, our main model suggests a 0.4 ppt increase in

prenatal smoking (Table 2) and a 0.9 ppt reduction in third trimester vaping (Table 8); therefore,

we do not anticipate observing an effect of e-cigarette taxes on birth outcomes.17 Nonetheless,

for comparison with previous related economic work, we also consider e-cigarette tax effects on

birth outcomes.

           We use the birth record data (rather than PRAMS data) to study the effect of e-cigarette

taxes on birth outcomes to maximize sample sizes and to leverage as much policy variation as

     Rural youth are the only sub-group for which the data appear to satisfy the parallel trends assumption.

possible. We construct the following birth outcomes to study the health effects of e-cigarette

taxes: gestational length (weeks), premature birth (<37 weeks), birth weight (grams), low birth

weight (<2,500 grams), small-for-gestational age (≤25th percentile), extra small-for-gestational

age (≤10th percentile), Apgar 5 score, and first-year infant mortality. The Apgar 5 is an index

used by healthcare professionals to evaluate the condition of a newborn along five dimensions,

and this variable ranges from a minimum of zero (very poor health) to a maximum of ten

(excellent health). These measures are established markers of fetal development commonly used

in economics (Cooper and Pesko 2017, Evans and Ringel 1999, Pesko and Currie 2019).

        We report results for the standardized e-cigarette tax rate in Table 9. Overall, we observe

no statistically significant evidence that the levying of an e-cigarette tax leads to changes in the

birth outcomes we study except for possibly a decrease in the probability of premature birth of

0.5 ppts (5.9%). Taken together, our results suggest little effect of e-cigarette taxes on birth

outcomes, which is in line with null findings documented in the two above-noted studies

examining non-tax e-cigarette policies (Pesko and Currie 2019, Cooper and Pesko 2017).18

8. Conclusion

        Our study finds that e-cigarette taxes lead to increases in prenatal smoking. In terms of

effect sizes, prenatal smoking increases by 0.4 ppts or 7.7% following a $1.00 increase in the

standardized e-cigarette tax. This result appears to be driven by changes in the rates of pre-

pregnancy smoking. Additionally, using a panel data model, we find that trimester-specific

smoking increases by 1.1 ppts (21.0%), suggesting that e-cigarette taxes reduce smoking


18
  We note that event study analysis (not reported but available on request) suggests some evidence that the data may
not satisfy parallel trends for small for the gestation age, extra small for gestational age, and infant mortality
outcomes. Given the potential differential pre-trends, in addition to concerns noted above, we interpret the birth
outcome findings cautiously. Full results available on request.

cessation during pregnancy. Our results suggest that e-cigarettes are economic substitutes for

traditional cigarettes among women who are pregnant or soon to be pregnant, which is in line

with two recent studies that document that polices that raise the non-financial price of e-

cigarettes (indoor vaping bans and MLSA laws) increase prenatal smoking (Cooper and Pesko

2017, Pesko and Currie 2019). For example, Cooper and Pesko (2017) show that adoption of an

e-cigarette indoor vaping ban increases any prenatal smoking by 0.9 ppts and smoking within a

given trimester by 2.0 ppts. Thus, our effect sizes are somewhat more modest than the findings

of Cooper and Pesko (2017).

        One possible reason for the somewhat more modest effect sizes we document is that the

e-cigarette taxes we explore in this study were implemented between 2016 and 2018, with the

exception of Minnesota, whereas e-cigarette indoor vaping restrictions in general pre-date e-

cigarette taxes. In the earlier years pregnant women may have been more responsive to e-

cigarette policies as there was less information available on the health risks of e-cigarettes, so the

e-cigarette policies may have had extra impact through health signaling. In recent years

individuals have access to more information on such risks that may make them less responsive to

e-cigarette policies.

        Our study has limitations. First, we identify the effect of e-cigarette taxes from variation

in nine states, Washington DC, two counties, and one city. Although the localities are diverse in

size, geography, and smoking prevalence, future research using data from time periods in which

additional localities impose e-cigarette taxes will broaden our understanding of this question.

Second, our estimates have an intent-to-treat (ITT) interpretation. We note that an estimate of



                                                 31
the treatment-on-the-treated (TOT) would also be informative. Third, our measures of smoking

are self-reported and could therefore be measured with error.

       In summary, we offer timely new evidence on the effect of e-cigarette taxes on pre-

pregnancy and prenatal smoking, and vaping. Importantly, we provide credible evidence that e-

cigarettes and traditional cigarettes are substitute products among pregnant women.

Online appendix: Standardizing e-cigarette taxes

Our procedure was pioneered by Cotti et al. (2020). Through 2018, e-cigarette taxes have been
levied using either specific excise taxes or ad valorem taxes. To standardize e-cigarette taxes
levied in different ways into a single measure, we combine policy data on e-cigarette taxes and
data from the Nielsen Retail Scanner data. Chicago, Cook County, Delaware, Kansas,
Louisiana, New Jersey, North Carolina, and West Virginia use an excise tax on liquid volume.
California, Minnesota, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, and Washington DC use an ad
valorem tax. Chicago uses an excise tax on both liquid volume and the number of disposable or
refill units sold. Several Alaskan counties also have e-cigarette taxes, but Alaska is not included
in the Nielsen retail data and is therefore not included in our standardization exercise that follows
Cotti et al. (2020). Between the end of our study period in 2018 and the end of 2019, eight
additional states adopted new e-cigarette taxes (Connecticut, Illinois, New Mexico, New York,
Ohio, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin).

We standardize e-cigarette ad valorem taxes into an excise tax equivalency (per ml of fluid)
using the following formula:
                                   𝑠𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑠 𝑣𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑚𝑒 𝑖𝑛 𝑟𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑖𝑙 𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑠𝑠𝑡        𝑡𝑎𝑥 𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑢𝑒𝑠𝑡
     𝑎𝑑 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑚 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 ∗ 0.044 ∗                                  =                            = 𝑡𝑎𝑥 𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑚𝑙 𝑜𝑓 𝑓𝑙𝑢𝑖𝑑𝑠𝑡
                                   𝑠𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑠 𝑣𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑚𝑒 𝑖𝑛 𝑚𝑙 𝑜𝑓 𝑓𝑙𝑢𝑖𝑑𝑠𝑡 𝑠𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑠 𝑣𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑚𝑒 𝑖𝑛 𝑚𝑙 𝑜𝑓 𝑓𝑙𝑢𝑖𝑑𝑠𝑡

Where s indexes a tax jurisdiction s on a year-by-quarter basis t. Tax jurisdictions are defined as
state, except for Illinois and Maryland that have sub-state tax variation in which case the tax
jurisdiction is either the sub-state (i.e., Chicago, Cook County, and Montgomery County) or the
rest of the state.

Washington DC’s ad valorem tax is benchmarked to be equal to the value of the traditional
cigarette tax (as determined by DC’s tax authority, using a weighted average of all e-cigarette
products) (Public Health Law Center 2020). In the 1st quarter of 2017, the traditional cigarette
tax was $2.92 per pack in DC and the e-cigarette ad valorem tax (as a percent of the wholesale
price) was 67 percent. Therefore, a 67 percent ad valorem tax equals $2.92, and the wholesale
price (inclusive of the tax) in DC is equal to $4.36 ($2.92 / 0.67).19 We assume other ad valorem
tax localities (California, Minnesota, Montgomery County, and Pennsylvania) similarly have
wholesale prices of $4.36; therefore, each one percent of ad valorem tax has a value of




19
  This is somewhat larger than the wholesale price estimate (inclusive of the tax) of $3.52 for replacement pods in
Minnesota in 2012 estimated by Saffer et al. (2020). This difference could reflect wholesale prices being larger in
2017 than in 2012, wholesale prices being larger in Minnesota than in Washington DC, or wholesale prices for
replacement pods being different than for a broader array of e-cigarette products. To the extent that wholesale prices
change nationally over time, or that wholesale prices exhibit time-invariant differences across localities, our
identification strategy using year and county fixed effects removes this as a potential source of bias.
                                                             46
approximately $0.044.20 We multiply the ad valorem rate (e.g., 40, 65, 95) by 0.044 for all ad
valorem localities.

Next, we multiply by total sales volume in retail units to obtain overall tax revenue for each tax
jurisdiction s on a year-by-quarter basis t. Sales units include all disposable e-cigarettes, starter
kits, and replacement pods in the Nielsen data, after omitting products for which fluid amounts
or container amounts could not be identified using internet search and visits to retailers. E-
cigarette product characteristics are identified for 93.5% of sales-weighted e-cigarette units as
identified by the Nielsen data.

Lastly, we divide total volume in ml of fluid for each tax jurisdiction s on a year-by-quarter basis
t, again after omitting products for which fluid amounts or container amounts could not be
identified using internet search and visits to retailers.

One concern with our conversion is that the ratio of sales volume in units to ml of fluid may be
endogenous to the e-cigarette tax adoption. Therefore, our primary standardized tax measure
uses the ratio for all locations that have not adopted e-cigarette taxes by January 2020. As a
sensitivity analysis, we use the ratio specific to each tax jurisdiction. Results are similar
regardless of which measure is used.

For Cook County, we do not have the ability to separate Chicago from the rest of Cook County
in the Nielsen data. For the Chicago portion of the tax, Chicago uses a $0.55 tax per ml of fluid
and a $0.80 tax per container of products containing liquid nicotine (e.g., cartridge, disposable).
We, therefore, calculate tax per ml of fluid in the following way:
                                 𝑠𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑠 𝑣𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑚𝑒 𝑖𝑛 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑠 𝑠𝑡
                        0.55 +                                 ∗ 0.80 = 𝑡𝑎𝑥 𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑚𝑙 𝑜𝑓 𝑓𝑙𝑢𝑖𝑑𝑠𝑡
                                 𝑠𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑠 𝑣𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑚𝑒 𝑖𝑛 𝑚𝑙 𝑜𝑓 𝑓𝑙𝑢𝑖𝑑𝑠𝑡

For the Cook County tax, similar to the approach mentioned earlier to address potential concerns
of endogeneity, we used the ratio of sales volume in containers to sale volume in ml of fluid for
all locations that have not adopted e-cigarette taxes by January 2020 for our primary
standardized e-cigarette tax rate. As a sensitivity analysis, we use the ratio specific to Chicago.
Results are similar regardless of which measure is used.

Since Chicago constitutes approximately 52.1% of the population of Cook County in 2017, we
weight the Chicago tax by this share of the population to approximate the Cook County tax.
Cook County later passed its own tax per fluid ml of fluid that we added in whole to the
weighted tax from Chicago. In the manuscript we show that our results are insensitive to
excluding Cook County.

As of the time of writing Nielsen retail data is not yet available for year 2018 to standardize the
ad valorem taxes into an excise tax equivalency. For 2018 we use December 2017 values, with
the exception of the new e-cigarette taxes enacted in Delaware and New Jersey (both excise

  We show in Online Appendix Table 6c that our main result is largely unchanged when dropping these tax
jurisdictions.

which the tax was enacted.
