This paper explores a macroeconomic model of the business cycle in which stickiness of information

is pervasive. We start from a familiar benchmark classical model and add to it the assumption that

there is sticky information on the part of consumers, workers, and firms. We evaluate the model

against three key facts that describe short-run fluctuations: the acceleration phenomenon, the

smoothness of real wages, and the gradual response of real variables to shocks. We find that

pervasive stickiness is required to fit the facts. We conclude that models based on stickiness of

information offer the promise of fitting the facts on business cycles while adding only one new

plausible ingredient to the classical benchmark.

         This paper explores a macroeconomic model of the business cycle in which stickiness of
information is a pervasive feature of the environment. Prices, wages, and consumption are
all assumed to be set, to some degree, based on outdated information sets. We show that
a model with such pervasive stickiness is better at matching some key facts that describe
economic fluctuations than is either a benchmark classical model without such informational
frictions or a model with only a subset of these frictions.
         The benchmark classical model that provides the starting point for this exercise will
seem familiar to most readers. Prices are based on marginal cost; wages are based on the
marginal rate of substitution between work and leisure; the demand for output is derived
from a forward-looking consumption Euler equation; and interest rates are set by the central
bank according to a conventional Taylor rule. The economy is buﬀeted by two kinds of
disturbances: shocks to the production function and shocks to monetary policy.
         To this benchmark model, we add the assumption of sticky information. In Mankiw
and Reis (2002) and Reis (forthcoming) we showed that if firms are assumed to set prices
based on outdated information sets, certain features of inflation dynamics are more easily
explained. In Mankiw and Reis (2003) we found that sticky information on the part of
workers could account for some features of the labor market. And Reis (2004) discovered
that inattentiveness on the part of consumers helps explain the dynamics of consumption.1
Here we show that pervasive stickiness of this type can simultaneously help explain several
features of business-cycle dynamics.

I.          Three Key Facts

         We focus here on three key facts that describe short-run economic fluctuations. These
facts are chosen because we believe they are crucial for any business cycle theory to explain
and because they are hard to square with macroeconomic models without any frictions.

         Fact 1: The Acceleration Phenomenon. In Mankiw and Reis (2002), we emphasized
that inflation tends to rise when the economy is booming and fall when economic activity is
depressed. This is the central insight of the empirical literature on the Phillips curve. One
simple way to illustrate this fact is to correlate the change in inflation, π t+2 − π t−2 with
output yt detrended with the HP filter.2 In U.S. quarterly data from 1954:3 to 2005:3, the

     1
     Xavier Gabaix and David Laibson (2002) and Jonathan A. Parker and Christian Julliard (2005) explored
the consequences of inattentiveness for the link between consumption and asset prices.
   2
     All variables in this paper are in logs and are for the non-farm business sector. Inflation is measured


                                                     2
correlation is 0.47. That is, the change in inflation is procyclical.

      Fact 2: The Smoothness of Real Wages. According to the classical theory of the labor
market, the real wage equals the marginal product of labor, which, under Cobb-Douglas
production, is proportional to the average productivity of labor. In the data, however, real
wages do not fluctuate as much as labor productivity. In particular, the standard deviation
of the quarterly change in real compensation per hour is only 0.69 of the standard deviation
of the change in output per hour. The real wage appears smooth relative to its fundamental
determinant.

      Fact 3: Gradual Response of Real Variables. Empirical estimates of the dynamic re-
sponse of economic activity to shocks typically show a hump-shaped response. The full
impact of shocks is usually felt only after several quarters. One simple way to demonstrate
this fact is to compare the standard deviation of the quarterly change in output, σ(yt −yt−1 ),
with one-half the standard deviation of the four-quarter change in output, 12 σ(yt − yt−4 ).
For a random walk, there is no hump-shaped response, and these two measures are equal.
In U.S. data, however, the first is only 0.79 of the second, indicating that the impact of
shocks builds over several quarters.

      In summary, here are the three facts we focus on:

      1.    ρ(π t+2 − π t−2 , yt − yttrend ) = 0.47;
      2.    σ [∆(w − p)] /σ [∆(y − l)] = 0.69;
      3.    σ(yt − yt−1 )/[ 12 σ(yt − yt−4 )] = 0.79.

As we will see, a benchmark classical model has trouble fitting each of these facts. We can
fix this problem with the assumption of pervasive stickiness of information.

II.        The model

      Markets and individual behavior. We will use a standard general equilibrium new Key-
nesian model with monopolistic competition and no capital accumulation. Because the
model is standard, we briefly sketch it here, relegating a detailed exposition to the appen-
dix. There are three types of agents in the economy: firms, consumers, and workers. They
meet in markets for labor, goods, and savings.

by the change in the log of the implicit price deflator for this sector, which is also used to create all real
variables.


                                                       3
    The firms in the model have a monopoly over a specific product, for which the demand
has a constant price elasticity ν. Each firm operates a technology yt,j = at + βnt,j that
transforms a composite variable labor input (nt,j ) into output (yt,j ) under decreasing returns
to scale (β ∈ (0, 1)) subject to aggregate productivity shocks (at ).3 Productivity follows a
random walk with a standard deviation of innovations of σ a . The composite input combines
diﬀerent varieties of labor supplied through a Dixit-Stiglitz aggregator with an elasticity of
substitution γ.
    Within each firm, there are two decision-makers. The hiring department is in charge of
purchasing the diﬀerent varieties of labor so as to minimize costs. The sales department
produces the good and sets its price to maximize profits. Although the hiring department
acts with perfect information, the sales department faces costs of acquiring, absorbing,
and processing information as in Reis (forthcoming), so it only sporadically updates its
information. A firm that last updated its information j periods ago, up to a first-order
approximation, sets a price:
                                       ∙                                  ¸
                                             β(wt − pt ) + (1 − β)yt − at
                          pt,j   = Et−j pt +                                .
                                                   β + ν(1 − β)

The firm wishes to set its price (pt,j ) relative to the aggregate of prices set by other firms
(pt ) to increase with real marginal costs. Real marginal costs are higher if the real wage
(wt − pt ) is higher, if production (yt ) is larger because of diminishing returns to scale, and
if productivity (at ) is lower.
    As in Mankiw and Reis (2002), price setters have sticky information. In each period,
a fraction λ of firms, randomly drawn from the population, obtains new information and
recalculates the optimal price.4 The price level, up to a first-order approximation, then
equals:
                                                ∞
                                                X
                                         pt = λ   (1 − λ)j pt,j .
                                                 j=0

    Consumers are the second set of agents. They maximize expected discounted utility

   3                                                                           β    1−β
     You can alternatively think of firms as operating a technology Yt,j = At Nt,j Kt,j where Kt,j is a fixed
endowment of capital. Since we are abstracting from capital accumulation, this is equivalent to our model
with the fixed amount of firm capital normalized to one.
   4
     Reis (forthcoming) provides a micro-foundation for why firms would choose plans for prices and of the
conditions under which, in a population of firms that optimally choose to be inattentive, the arrival of
planning dates has an exponential distribution.




                                                       4
from consuming every period a Dixit-Stiglitz aggregator of the diﬀerent varieties of goods
that the firms sell. They face an intertemporal budget constraint. The nominal interest
rate is it , the real interest rate is rt , and the Fisher equation holds:


                                      rt + Et (∆pt+1 ) = it .


   Consumers also have two decision-makers. One is a shopper who allocates total ex-
penditures over the diﬀerent varieties using full information. This leads to the constant
price-elasticity demand for the product of each firm mentioned earlier. The other decision-
maker is a planner who allocates total expenditure over time. She faces costs of information,
leading her to stay inattentive; every period a fraction of consumers δ updates their infor-
mation. Reis (2004) provides a detailed analysis and micro-foundation for this behavior.
A planner that last updated her information j periods earlier chooses expenditure ct,j to
satisfy the log-linearized Euler equation:


                     ct,j = −θEt−j (rt ) + δEt−j (ct+1,0 ) + (1 − δ)ct+1,j+1 .


The parameter θ is the elasticity of intertemporal substitution.
   The consumers diﬀer only with regards to when they last updated their plans. Total
consumption, up to a first-order approximation, is therefore equal to:

                                               ∞
                                               X
                                      yt = δ     (1 − δ)j ct,j ,
                                               j=0


where we used market clearing to replace total consumption with aggregate output.
   Workers are the final set of agents. They share a household with consumers and so also
care about maximizing expected discounted utility subject to the same intertemporal budget
constraint. They choose how much to work and what wage to charge for the particular
variety of labor over which they hold a monopoly. The demand for their services comes
from the hiring department of firms and therefore has a constant price elasticity of γ.
   A worker who last updated her information j periods ago sets a nominal wage according
to the Euler equation:


ψwt,j = Et−j {lt,j − ψrt + ψpt + ω [ψ(wt+1,0 − pt+1 ) − lt+1,0 ] + (1 − ω) [ψ(wt+1,j+1 − pt+1 ) − lt+1,j+1 ]} .


                                                     5
The parameter ψ measures the Frisch wage elasticity of labor supply, while ω is the proba-
bility that any worker faces of updating her plans at any date. The nominal wage (wt,j ) is
higher the more labor is supplied (lt,j ) and the higher are prices pt . As in Robert E. Lucas
Jr. and Leonard A. Rapping (1969), workers intertemporally substitute labor. The higher
they expect their wage to be tomorrow, the more willing they are to work then rather than
now and so the higher the wage that they demand today. Likewise, if they expect to work
more tomorrow, they wish to substitute part of this into work today and thus lower their
wage demands. The last component of the intertemporal labor supply is the real interest
rate. The higher is rt , the higher are the returns to working today rather than tomorrow.
This leads to an increase in the willingness to work today and thus lowers wage demands.5
    The wage index equals, up a first-order approximation:

                                                 ∞
                                                 X
                                        wt = ω     (1 − ω)j wt,j .
                                                 j=0


    Finally, the monetary authority follows a Taylor rule:


                                   it = φy (yt − ytn ) + φπ ∆pt + εt .

The parameter φπ is larger than one, respecting the Taylor principle and ensuring a determi-
nate equilibrium for inflation. The natural level of output ytn denotes the equilibrium level
of output if all agents were attentive (that is, if λ = δ = ω = 1) so policy responds to the
output gap.6 Finally, εt denotes policy disturbances which follow a first-order autoregressive
process with parameter ρ and standard deviation of shocks σ e .7

    The reduced form of the model. From the previous equations, one can obtain three
equations that capture the equilibrium in the three markets of the model. The first equation

    5
      If both members of a household update their information at the same time, then labor supply has the
perhaps more familiar static form: ψwj,t = Et−j (lj,t + ψct,j ). However, if workers set their wage plans at
diﬀerent dates from when consumers set their consumption plans, this condition does not hold. The two
members of the household do not agree on the marginal value of an extra unit of wealth.
    6
      One can to show that ytn = (1 + 1/ψ)at /(1 + 1/ψ + β/θ − β).
    7
      Our choices regarding inattentiveness were made in an attempt to avoid some thorny theoretical issues.
For example, if shoppers were inattentive, monopolistic firms would be tempted to raise prices to take
advantage of their inattentiveness. Separating consumers and firms into attentive and inattentive pieces
allows us to make prices, wages, and consumption sticky at the macroeconomic level without inducing such
strategic responses at the microeconomic level.




                                                       6
is an AS relation or Phillips curve:

                          ∞
                          X             ∙                                  ¸
                                   j          β(wt − pt ) + (1 − β)yt − at
                   pt = λ   (1 − λ) Et−j pt +                                .
                                                    β + ν(1 − β)
                            j=0


Intuitively, the higher are expected prices or marginal costs, the higher will be the price
that firms wish to set. In response to an unexpected rise to these variables though, only a
share λ of firms will raise their price.
       The second condition is an IS equation capturing the relationship between spending and
financial conditions:
                                            ∞
                                            X
                                   yt = δ     (1 − δ)j Et−j (ytn − θRt )
                                            j=0
         P
Rt = Et ( ∞                                       8
          i=0 rt+i ), the long real interest rate. Higher expected productivity increases

spending, while higher expected interest rates lower spending by encouraging saving. The
stickier is information (smaller δ), the smaller is the impact of shocks on spending since
fewer consumers are aware of them.
       The third equation is a labor market clearing equation or wage curve:

                    ∞
                    X             ∙                                             ¸
                             j          γ(wt − pt )    yt − at   ψ (ytn − θRt )
             wt = ω   (1 − ω) Et−j pt +             +          +                  .
                                          γ+ψ         β(γ + ψ)     θ(γ + ψ)
                     j=0


Nominal wages increase one-to-one with expected prices because workers care about real
not nominal wages. The more labor is used in production, the higher are wages, reflecting
the standard slope of the labor supply curve. Higher expected productivity leads to higher
wages. Finally, higher interest rates imply a larger return on today’s saved earnings thus
leading to more willingness to work and lower wage demands.
       These three equations combined with the Fisher equation and the Taylor rule determine
a sticky information equilibrium in (yt , pt , wt , rt , it ) given exogenous shocks to (at , εt ). The
appendix describes an algorithm that computes the equilibrium. We will use a baseline set
of parameters. For preferences: θ = 1 so utility over consumption is logarithmic, ψ = 4 so
labor supply is very wage elastic, and ν = 20 so the price markup is about 5% consistent
with the lower end of the estimates in Susanto Basu and John G. Fernald (1995). For
technology, we assume that γ = 10 so the wage markup is about 11% and that the labor

   8
    All variables are in deviations from the steady state so limi→∞ Et [rt+i ] = 0 and the long rate is finite.
See the appendix for more details.

share of income β = 2/3. The Taylor rule parameters are taken from Glenn D. Rudebusch
(2002): φy = 0.33, φπ = 1.24, ρ = 0.92 and σ e = 0.0036. Finally, based on U.S. quarterly
data, we set σ a = 0.0085. We have experimented with alternative reasonable parameter
values and obtained similar conclusions, but we do not report these experiments here due
to space constraints.

III.     The Need for Pervasive Stickiness

   The classical benchmark. We start with the classical model in which there is no stickiness
of information. In this fully attentive economy, the classical dichotomy holds, and output
is always at its natural level. Because there is no output gap, the model oﬀers no obvious
way of explaining fact 1, the acceleration phenomenon. In this classical benchmark, output
(which is driven solely by productivity shocks) and inflation (which is driven solely by
monetary policy shocks) are independent.
   The model also cannot explain fact 2, the smoothness of real wages: without any rigidi-
ties, real wage growth exactly equals productivity growth. Finally, output is proportional
to productivity (see footnote 6). Thus it follows a random walk, contradicting fact 3. We
therefore conclude that this frictionless economy cannot fit any of the three facts.

   Single sources of stickiness. Imagine now that only firms are inattentive, updating their
information on average once a year (λ = 1/4). The model can now generate an acceleration
correlation of 0.56, moving in the direction of fitting fact 1. But σ [∆(w − p)] /σ [∆(y − l)] =
1.54 and σ(yt − yt−1 )/[ 12 σ(yt − yt−4 )] = 1.03, so the model moves in the wrong direction
when it comes to fitting the other two facts.
   Alternatively, suppose there is sticky information only in the labor market with 25% of
workers updating their plans every period (ω = 0.25). The model again moves in the right
direction with regards to the acceleration phenomenon, predicting a correlation between
changes in inflation and the output gap of 0.10. However, real wages are exactly as volatile
as labor productivity, and output adjusts quickly to shocks (the ratio of standard deviations
is 1.17). The result concerning real wages can be derived from the Phillips curve: if goods
prices are set with full attention, real wages always equal output per hour.
   The last case is that of only inattentive consumers (δ = 0.25). This model fails to match
fact 1 (the correlation between inflation and the output gap is almost exactly zero) and fact
2 (real wages are just as volatile as labor productivity). Sticky information on the part of


                                                8
consumers helps move the model closer to the data with regards to the sluggishness of real
variables. The ratio σ(yt − yt−1 )/[ 12 σ(yt − yt−4 )] is 0.65, much closer to fact 3 on U.S. data.

   Two sources of stickiness. What if two of the three sets of agents in the economy are
inattentive, but the remaining are attentive? Again, the model cannot fit the facts. If
producers are attentive, then real wages and output per hour are proportional, failing to
match fact 2 concerning the smoothness of real wages. If instead workers are the only agents
without sticky information, then σ [∆(w − p)] /σ [∆(y − l)] = 1.68. In this case, real wages
are more volatile than productivity, again failing to match fact 2. Finally, if consumers
are the only attentive agents, then σ(yt − yt−1 )/[ 12 σ(yt − yt−4 )] = 1.03. The model with
attentive consumers cannot generate fact 3, the gradual response of real output.

   Pervasive stickiness. The previous cases showed that with either no stickiness or selec-
tive stickiness, one cannot fit all three business cycle facts. Pervasive stickiness is necessary.
We now ask whether pervasive stickiness is itself enough to account for the facts. We start
with the case where firms, consumers, and workers, are all inattentive with λ = δ = ω =
0.25. In this economy, ρ(π t+2 − π t−2 , yt − ytn ) = 0.63, σ(∆(w − p))/σ(∆(y − l)) = 0.29 and
σ(yt − yt−1 )/[ 12 σ(yt − yt−4 )] = 0.69. Pervasive stickiness moves the baseline classical model
in the right direction across all three dimensions. Changes in inflation are now positively
correlated with real activity, wages are smoother than productivity, and output adjusts
gradually to shocks.
   These results come from somewhat arbitrarily setting the degree of information stickiness
to 0.25 for all sectors of the economy. We have searched for the values of the inattentiveness
parameters λ, ω, and δ that move the model closest to fitting the three facts, in the sense
of minimizing the sum of squared deviations of the model’s predicted moments and their
empirical counterparts. Formally, this is akin to the method of simulated moments with a
GMM weighting matrix that gives each moment the same weight. The resulting estimates
are λ = 0.52, ω = 0.66, and δ = 0.36. In this best-fitting case, firms setting prices update
their information on average about every 6 months, workers setting wages update about
every 4.5 months, and consumers update about every 9 months. Despite this mild amount
of inattentiveness and the model’s simplicity, it fits the facts remarkably well: its predicted
moments are within less than 0.06 of the three facts. Using the same estimation method
but assuming all agents update their plans with the same frequency leads to an estimated



                                                9
probability of adjustment of 0.57, indicating that agents update their information on average
every 5 months. In this case, ρ(π t+2 −π t−2 , yt −ytn ) = 0.43, σ [∆(w − p)] /σ [∆(y − l)] = 0.56
and σ(yt −yt−1 )/[ 12 σ(yt −yt−4 )] = 0.89. Introducing this one free parameter moves the model
significantly in the direction of explaining all three facts

IV.      Conclusion

   Many modern models of business cycles start from a classical benchmark similar to the
one in this paper. Over the past two decades, however, researchers have found that this
model has several shortcomings and have proposed remedies. Because monetary policy
seems to have real eﬀects, research has recently focused on a hybrid formulation of Calvo’s
sticky price model in which either some price-setters are naive or all index their prices
to past inflation. Because real wages are smooth in the data, research has looked into
models with adjustment costs in using inputs, norms in labor bargaining, or direct real
wage rigidities. Because consumption and output growth are positively serially correlated,
research has considered modelling representative agents that form habits. In a prescient
article, Christopher A. Sims (1998) noted that across all dimensions, to match the data,
the classical model needed “stickiness.”
   It has become increasingly clear that stickiness is not just needed but must also be
pervasive. Fixing the classical model with a series of isolated patches, however, runs the
risk of losing the discipline of having a model altogether. Inattentiveness and stickiness
of information have the virtue of adding only one new plausible ingredient to the classical
benchmark. The results reported here suggest that such a model moves promisingly in the
direction of fitting the facts on business cycles.

Appendix

   This appendix contains a description of the model used in the paper and the algorithm
that solves it.

A.I.      The economic environment

   Households. There is a continuum of households distributed in the unit interval and
indexed by j. They live forever discounting future utility by a factor ξ ∈ (0, 1) and obtaining
utility each period according to:

                                                         1−1/θ                   1+1/ψ
                                                 Ct,j             −1          κLt,j
                            U (Ct,j , Lt,j ) =                            −              ,   (1)
                                                         1 − 1/θ              1 + 1/ψ

where: θ is the intertemporal elasticity of substitution, ψ is the Frisch elasticity of labor
supply, κ captures relative preferences for consuming goods or leisure, Ct,j is the consump-
tion by household j at date t, and Lt,j is the labor supplied by household j at date t.
Consumption Ct,j is a Dixit-Stiglitz aggregator of the consumption of varieties indexed by
i, Ct,j (i), with an elasticity of substitution ν:

                                           µZ        1                      ¶ ν−1
                                                                               ν
                                                                     ν
                                  Ct,j =                 Ct,j (i)   ν−1   di                 (2)
                                                 0


   At each date t, the household faces a budget constraint:


                       Pt Ct,j + Bt,j = Wt,j Lt,j + (1 + it−1 )Bt−1,j + Tt,j .               (3)


The new notation stands for: Pt is the dollar price of goods at date t, Bt,j are holdings
of nominal bonds, Wt,j is the nominal wage paid to household j, and it−1 is the nominal
net return at t on a bond purchased at t − 1. Finally Tt,j are lump-sum nominal transfers
received by the the household from two sources. First, they come from receiving profits
from firms, which are equally owned by all households. Second, we assume that consumers
signed an insurance contract at the beginning of time so that they all start each period with
with the same wealth. This way, we do do not have to track the wealth distribution. The
payments from this contract are in Tt,j . The Dixit-Stiglitz aggregator has an associated
static price index:

   Technologies. Households own a continuum of firms in the unit interval indexed by j.
Firm j operates a technology that combines the labor supplied by each household i, Nt,j (i),
into the output of a particular variety of good Yt,j . The production function is:

                                         β
                              Yt,j = At Nt,j ,                                                 (5)

At stands for exogenous aggregate productivity, which follows a random walk in logs with
standard deviation of shocks σ a . The parameter β ∈ (0, 1) is the labor share of income
and measures the degree of diminishing returns to scale. The composite of inputs used by
firm j, Nt,j , is a Dixit-Stiglitz aggregator of the diﬀerent varieties of labor hired with an
elasticity of substitution γ. It implies a dual minimum-expenditure static wage index:

   Markets. In financial assets, there is an anonymous market for nominal bonds. They
are in zero net supply so for the market to clear:
                                                 Z       1
                                                             Bt,j dj = 0,                      (8)
                                                     0


   There is a goods market for each variety i, in which all consumers are buyers and the
sole seller is firm i that has a monopoly over its variety. Market clearing requires:
                                         Z       1
                                                     Ct,j (i)dj = Yt,i .                       (9)
                                             0


Across all varieties, total output is:

   Finally, there is a labor market for each variety of labor i. The buyers are all firms and
the seller is the household that has the monopoly over labor services i. In equilibrium:

   Decision-makers and information.       Consumers wish to maximize the expected dis-
counted sum of utility at each date (1) given the preferences in (2) subject to the sequence
of budget constraints (3) from t into infinity and a no-Ponzi scheme condition.
   There are two decision-makers within a consumer, who cannot exchange information.
One is a shopper whose job is to pick at each date the consumption of each variety taking
total expenditure at that date as given. The shopper has full information and searches the
markets for all varieties for the best bundle of goods at lower cost.
   The other decision-maker is a planner, whose job is to choose the total amount of expen-
diture at each date and how much to save. The planners are inattentive only sporadically
updating their information. When a planner updates her information, she obtains full in-
formation, but in between updates she obtains no new information. Reis (2004) presents
a model in which costs of acquiring, absorbing, and processing information lead planners
to optimally choose how often to update their information. Here, we take this behavior
as given. Moreover, following Mankiw and Reis (2002), we assume that there is sticky in-
formation, understood as a constant probability δ at each date that any planner receives
new information. Our assumptions imply that planners diﬀer only with regards to their
information. To continue using j to index planners, we change its meaning. From now on,
j denotes how long ago a planner last updated her information so Ct,j is the expenditure of
a planner who last updated her information j periods ago. Thus, the unit mass of planners
is divided into a countable number of groups of consumers, each with mass δ(1 − δ)j .
   A second set of agents includes workers. They have the same objective and face the same
constraints as consumers–they share a household. Their choice is what wage to charge for
their labor services. They post a wage monopolistically taking into account the demand for
their labor and commit to supplying the labor necessary to ensure that the market clears at
that wage. They are also inattentive with sticky information, as in Mankiw and Reis (2003).
The wage Wt,j is set by a worker that last updated her information j periods ago and sticky
information implies that at every date a fraction ω of workers update their information.
   The final set of private agents are firms. Within the firm, there are two departments
making decisions. The hiring department takes as given the choice of how much to produce



                                                   13
and hires the combination of labor inputs that minimizes costs using full information. The
sales department sets a price that takes into account its monopoly power and the demand
for its product and commits to producing as much of the good as necessary to clear the
market. They are inattentive as modelled explicitly in Reis (2005), who provides also a set
of conditions under which information is sticky as in Mankiw and Reis (2002). Each date,
a fraction λ of sales departments in firms obtain new information.

   Monetary Policy. In this cashless economy, we assume that the government can enforce
the use of a unit of account and issue nominal bonds. This gives it the power to set the
nominal interest rate. (See Woodford, 2003, for an exposition of how interest rates are set
in cashless economies.) We assume that policy mechanically follows a Taylor rule:

                                        µ         ¶              µ          ¶
                                            Yt                        Pt
                          it = φy log                 + φπ log                  + εt .     (13)
                                            Ytn                      Pt−1

Ytn will be defined later and εt are policy shocks that follow the process: εt = ρεt−1 + et
where et is white noise with mean zero and standard deviation σ e . The parameter φπ is
larger than one, respecting the Taylor principle, while the parameter φy is non-negative
reflecting a desire for stabilization. Finally, note that the interest rate rule does not ensure
determinacy of the price level. This indeterminacy is well-known and there are many slight
modifications of the model that eliminate it (see, for instance, Woodford, 2003, chapter 2).
We do not wish to complicate the model further by addressing this issue directly. Instead,
we peg the initial price level at an initial condition: P−1 = 1.

A.II.      Equilibrium of the economy

   To solve the model, we must first describe optimal behavior. We start with consumers
and their two choices. Optimal behavior by shoppers implies that the demand for each
variety by consumer j:
                                 Ct,j (i) = Ct,j (Pt (i)/Pt )−ν .                          (14)

Summing over all consumers and using the market clearing condition for variety i in (9)
implies:                                                    µZ              ¶
                                                                 1
                                                       −ν
                              Yt,i = (Pt (i)/Pt )                    Ct,j dj .             (15)
                                                             0

   Moving next to planners, recall that they obtain new information with probability δ
every period. Recall also that all planners are identical aside from how long they last

                                                      14
planned j. Letting At,j ≡ [(1 + it−1 )Bt−1,j + Wt,j Lt,j + Tt,j ]/Pt denote the real resources
with which planner j enters period t, the assumption of perfect insurance implies that
At,j = At , the same for all planners. We denote by V (At , .) the value function for planners
that plan at period t. The second argument in the value function includes other state
variables that may be useful at forecasting the future–we will omit it from now onwards.
    The planner solves the dynamic program:
                               (∞                                          ∞

     V (At ) =      max               ξ (1 − δ) U (Ct+i,i , .) + ξδ               ξ (1 − δ) Et [V (At+1+i )] , (16)

                                                                        Wt+1+i,. Lt+1+i,. + Tt+1+i,.
        s.t.   :   At+1+i = Rt+1+i (At+i − Ct+i,. ) +                                                .        (17)

The first term in the Bellman equation equals the expected discounted utility if the planner
never updates her information again. The second term includes the sum of the continuation
values over all of the possible future dates at which the agent may plan again, each occurring
with a probability δ(1 − δ)i . The constraint comes from re-writing of the budget constraint,
where
                                            Rt+1 ≡ (1 + it ) Pt /Pt+1 ,                                       (18)

The envelope theorem condition is:

Combining condition (19) at i = 0 and (20) shows that V 0 (At ) = Ct,0 . The marginal
value of an extra unit of resources equals the marginal utility of using them immediately
for consumption. Using this result to replace for the marginal value terms in the optimality




                                                                 15

holding for all t and all j. The first condition is the usual Euler equation for an attentive
consumer. The second condition shows that an inattentive consumer sets the marginal
utility of her consumption equal to her expectation of the marginal utility of the attentive
consumer.
   Moving next to firms, the hiring department minimizes costs with full information. The
optimal demand by firm j for labor services of variety i is:


                                Nt,j (i) = Nt,j (Wt (i)/Wt )−γ .                        (23)


Summing over all firms and using the market clearing condition in labor variety i, we obtain:
                                                         µZ   1         ¶

                            Lt (i) = (Wt (i)/Wt )                 Nt,j dj .             (24)

The sales department maximizes profits subject to the production function (5) and the
iso-elastic demand for its product in (15). For a firm that last updated its information j
periods ago, the first-order condition is:
                                                 ³              ´
                                                       1/β −1/β

                           Pt,j =       ×                                     .         (25)
                                    ν−1             Et−j (βYt,j )

This states the usual result that with iso-elastic preferences, nominal prices are a fixed
markup over nominal marginal costs. The markup equals ν/(ν − 1). The other fraction in
the expression, for a firm that is planning, equals the nominal marginal cost–the nominal
wage divided by the marginal product of the composite labor input.
   Finally, we move to workers. Their problem is similar to that faced by the consumption

planners. Jumping to the optimality conditions:

                                        Et Lt+j,0 Lt+j,j /Wt+j,0

The first condition states that wages equal a constant markup γ/(γ − 1) over the marginal
opportunity cost of labor. For the worker that is planning, this equals the marginal disutility
            1/ψ
of labor κLt,j divided by the marginal utility of an extra dollar for the worker V̂t0 . The
second equation is a standard Euler equation for an attentive worker. Supplying an extra
                                                       1/ψ
unit of labor today leads to a fall in utility of Lt,0 . In return, the worker receives Wt,0 /Pt ,
which after invested in bonds returns Rt+1 per unit the next period. The worker can then
work less (Rt+1 Wt,0 /Pt )Pt+1 /Wt+1,0 units tomorrow which raise utility by this amount times
                                            1/ψ
the marginal utility of labor tomorrow Lt+1,0 discounted by the factor ξ. At an optimum,
the cost of anticipating work must equal its expected benefit, so the equality must hold.
Finally, the third condition states that an inattentive worker sets wages so that her expected
disutility from working mirrors the expected disutility from working of an attentive worker.
   We can now define a competitive equilibrium of this economy: it is an allocation of total
expenditures and savings, consumption of varieties, labor supplied of the diﬀerent varieties,
and output produced of each variety such that consumers, workers and firms all behave
optimally, monetary policy follows the Taylor rule, and all markets clear.
   The equations above characterize this equilibrium. However, they are diﬃcult to handle.
We proceed by log-linearizing around the stationary point where σ a = σ e = 0 so all variables
are constant. Small letters denote the log-linear deviation of the respective capital variables
from the steady state, with the exception of rt , which denotes the log-linear deviation of




                                                  17
Et [Rt+1 ]. The set of log-linearized optimality conditions is:


                       rt = it − Et (∆pt+1 ) ,                                                                (29)

                     yt,j = yt − ν (pt,j − pt ) ,                                                             (30)

                      lt,j = lt − γ(wt,j − wt ),                                                              (31)

                      ct,j = Et−j (ct+1,0 − θrt ) ,                                                           (32)

                     pt,j = Et−j [wt + (1/β − 1)yt,j − at /β] ,                                               (33)

                     wt,j = Et−j [pt + lt,j /ψ − rt + wt+1,0 − pt+1 − lt+1,0 /ψ].                             (34)


The log-linearized definitions of the aggregate production function and the price, wage, and
output indices are:

                                          pt = λ    (1 − λ)j pt,j ,                                           (36)

                                          yt = δ            (1 − δ)j ct,j ,                                   (38)

Finally the log-linear Taylor rule is:


                                      it = φy (yt − ytn ) + φπ ∆pt + εt .                                     (39)

    This set of 11 equations over time provide the competitive equilibrium solution for the
set of 11 variables (yt , yt,j , ct,j , lt,j , lt , wt , wt,j , pt , pt,j , it , rt ) as a function of the exogenous
processes at , εt and ytn .

A.III.         Reduced-form representations of the model

    The fully attentive economy. In the classical economy, λ = δ = ω = 1 so all are attentive.
Following convention, we label the equilibrium in this economy “natural.” Equations (36)-
(38) imply that pnt,j = pnt , wt,j
                               n = w n and cn = y n , while (30)-(31) imply that ln = ln
                                    t       t,j  t                                t,j  t
     n = y n . This reflects the fact that all agents are identical. A few steps of algebra
and yt,j  t

using equations (32)-(35) shows that: ltn = (ytn − at )/β, wtn − pnt = ytn − ltn , rtn = 0 and


                                                        18
that ytn = Ξat , where Ξ = (1 + 1/ψ)/(1 + 1/ψ + β/θ − β). Note that all real variables
are determined as a function of only the exogenous technology shock at , independently of
monetary policy. The classical dichotomy holds in this economy. Monetary policy shocks
determine the nominal interest rate and inflation through the Taylor rule and the Fisher
                                                                    ¡      ¢
equation. The solutions are: ∆pnt = −εt /(φπ − ρ) and int = rtn + Et ∆pnt+1 .
   We have solved for the natural equilibrium. Note that for preferences consistent with a
balanced growth path (θ = 1) the parameter Ξ = 1. Therefore, output and real wages are
proportional to productivity and labor supplied is constant. Since output is always at its
natural level that follows a stochastic trend, there is no output gap and so the acceleration
correlation is zero. Moreover, as at and εt are independent, output and inflation in the
attentive economy are statistically independent. Since real wages are proportional to output
per hour, the two are equally variable. And since output follows a random walk, the standard
deviation of its quarterly changes equals one-half of the standard deviation of its annual
changes.

   The reduced-form sticky information economy. Combining equations (30) and (33) to
replace for pt,j and yt,j in equation (36) gives the aggregate supply relation:

                       ∞
                       X             ∙                                  ¸
                                j          β(wt − pt ) + (1 − β)yt − at
                pt = λ   (1 − λ) Et−j pt +                                .             (40)
                                                 β + ν(1 − β)
                       j=0


Denoting by mct (real marginal costs) the fraction on the right-hand side, we can re-arrange
this equation to obtain a sticky-information Phillips curve:

                                     X     ∞
                             λmct
                    ∆pt =         +λ  (1 − λ)j Et−1−j (∆pt + ∆mct ) .                   (41)
                             1−λ
                                           j=0


   Iterating forward on equation (32), we get:

                                     T
                                     X
                         ct,j = −θ         Et−j (rt+i ) + Et−j (ct+T +1,0 ) .           (42)
                                     i=0


Next, take the limit as T → ∞. As time elapses to infinity all become aware of past news
                                ¡ n ¢
so limi→∞ Et (rt+i ) = limi→∞ Et rt+i = 0. Moreover, since the probability of remain-
ing inattentive falls exponentially with the length of the horizon, we approach this limit
fast enough to ensure that the sum in the first term converges. As for the second term,


                                                   19
                               £ n ¤
limi→∞ Et (ct+i,0 ) = limi→∞ Et yt+i = ytn . The first equality holds because consumers
are fully insured every period and in the limit all are informed. The second equality holds
because ytn follows a random walk. The expression above therefore becomes:

                                                            n
                                     ct,j = −θEt−j (Rt ) + yt−j ,                                 (43)

               P
where Rt = Et ( ∞
                i=0 rt+i ), the long real interest rate. Replacing for ct,j in (38) gives the

IS curve:
                                          ∞
                                          X
                                 yt = δ     (1 − δ)j Et−j (ytn − θRt ) .                          (44)
                                          j=0

We can first-diﬀerence this equation to obtain an alternative representation of the IS:

    Similar steps, iterating forward on (34) and using the fact that ψ(wtn − pnt ) − ltn = ψytn /θ
show that:

Using this result as well as (33) and (35) to replace for lt,j , wt,j and lt in (37), gives a wage

(54) allows us to drop wages and the long rate and reduce the problem to finding prices,
output and the short rate with two equations:


                                     ŷn = Ψn p̂n ,                                     (58)

                                    θr̂n =          −     .                             (59)
                                           ∆n+1 ∆n

where we defined a new parameter:
                         n                h                   i         o

               Ψn =                                                                     (60)
                        (1 − β)(γ + ψ)θ∆n + Ωn {θ∆n [1 − γ(1 − β)] + ψβ}

For the coeﬃcients involving productivity shocks, we have instead:


                                     ỹn = Ψn p̃n + Υn ,                                (61)
                                           ỹn+1     ỹn
                                    θr̃n =        −      .                              (62)
                                           ∆n+1 ∆n

where the new parameter is:

                                     θ∆n [γ + ψ + Ωn (1 − γ)]
                 Υn =                                                    .              (63)
                        (1 − β)(γ + ψ)θ∆n + Ωn {θ∆n [1 − γ(1 − β)] + ψβ}

   Finally, using the Fisher equation to substitute nominal interest rates out of the Taylor
rule and rearranging leads to:


                  φπ p̂n = φy ŷn+1 + (1 + φπ )p̂n+1 − p̂n+2 − r̂n+1 + ρn+1 ,           (64)

                  φπ p̃n = φy ỹn+1 + (1 + φπ )p̃n+1 − p̃n+2 − r̃n+1 − φy Ξ,            (65)


for n = 0, 1, 2... There is also an initial condition from the Taylor rule at date 0:


                         φy ŷ0 + (1 + φπ )p̂0 − p̂1 − r̂0 + 1 = 0,                     (66)

                             φy ỹ0 + (1 + φπ )p̃0 − p̃1 − r̃0 = φy Ξ.                  (67)


   We have all the conditions we need to solve for the undetermined coeﬃcients on the
impact of monetary and productivity shocks. Our algorithm that finds the impact of mon-
etary shocks starts by choosing a very large number T and setting ŷn = r̂n = 0 and p̂n = p̄



                                              22
for n ≥ T . We know that for T = +∞ this guess is correct for some unknown positive
value of p̄. Starting with a guess for p̄, the system made by equations (58), (59) and (64)
recursively gives the solution for ŷn , r̂n , and p̂n for n = T − 1, T − 2, ...0. The final step
is to check the initial condition (66). One can then search for the p̄ that ensures that (66)
holds, which concludes the algorithm.
    For productivity shocks, the algorithm is similar. For large T , ỹn = Ξ, r̃n = 0 and
p̃n = p̄ for n ≥ T , and the system of equations (61), (62) and (65) recursively gives the
solution for ỹn , r̃n , and p̃n for n = T − 1, T − 2, ..., 0, while (67) is the initial condition used
to pin down p̄.
    Finally, (52) and (53) give the solution for ŵn and w̃n . Using the production function:
ŷt − ˆlt = (1 − 1/β)ŷt and ỹt − ˜lt = (1 − 1/β)ỹt + 1/β. Note also that

using the formulae in (69)-(71) and the coeﬃcients provided by the algorithm above as a
function of the parameters. Since we know little about the function that we are minimizing,
we tried diﬀerent non-linear minimization algorithms to search for the optimal {λ, δ, ω} in
the space [0, 1]3 .
