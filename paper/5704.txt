                             INEQUALITY, PREDATION AND WELFARE

                                                ABSTRACT

        This paper studies the relation between inequality and welfare in a general-equilibrium       model

in which people can choose to be either producers or predators.            We assume that some people (the

privileged)     are well endowed with human capital and other people (the unprivileged)          are poorly

endowed with human capital.

        We analyze how the choice of the privileged between deterring and tolerating predation by

the unprivileged     depends on the interpersonal distribution of human capital.        We find that, if the

number of people who are unprivileged          is large, but a privileged person does not have too much

human capital relative to an unprivileged person, then the privileged allocate enough time and effort

to guarding against predation to deter the unprivileged           from being predators.     Otherwise,   the

privileged tolerate predation by the unprivileged.      Interestingly, a distribution of human capital that

is more egalitarian in that the number of people who are unprivileged is smaller can result in the

privileged choosing to tolerate rather than to deter predation by the unprivileged.

        Next, we partition the feasible distributions of human capital into a set of Pareto efficient

distributions    and a set of Pareto inefficient distributions.   Interestingly, we find that if the average

endowment of human capital is large, then the fully egalitarian distribution is not Pareto efficient.

Instead, Pareto efficiency implies an unegalitarian         distribution   of human capital in which each

unprivileged person has only the endowment of human capital with which he was born. In addition,

this unegalitarian distribution satisfies the Rawlsian criterion of maximizing the consumption of the

unprivileged.     With this unegalitarian distribution the privileged choose to tolerate predation by the

unprivileged,     and predation results in maximum consumption for everyone.

          America       that looks like Manila,                 Mr Newsome              shrugs:      “It’s already          like tl~at, ”

          he says. ( The Wall Street Journal, September                                 26, 1995, page .48. )


           This paper studies the relation                   between inequality            and welfare in a general-equilibrium

model in which people can choose to be either producers                                     or predators.            Predators       are people

who produce           nothing,      but live by appropriating                  the product           of the producers.l             We assume

that a person chooses to be a. predator                       rather     than a producer              if and only if predation               yields

higher consumption                for that person than would production.

           We consider        a society in which some people                        (the privileged)              are well endowed              with

human capital,          but in which other people (the unprivileged)                              are poorly endowed with human

capital.      In this society, the interpersonal                   distribution         of human          capital     has two dimensions:

the number           of people who are unprivileged                     and the endowment                  of the human            capital       of a

privileged       person relative to the endowment                       of an unprivileged             person.        Given the aggregate

endowment         of human capital,               it seems natural          to define a distribution                to be more egalitarian

either if the number              of people who are unprivileged                        is smaller     or if the ratio of the human

capital      of a privileged       person         to the human          capital     of an unprivileged               person is smaller.

           Given that        the consumption             that      a person       can obtain          from being a producer                     is an

increasing       function        of that    person’s         human      capital,        the unprivileged             find predation             more

attractive       than the privileged. 2 We assume                       that      the privileged           have two alternative                 ways

    lTl~is paper      is about    predation.        It is not about      crime,     Predation        and crime       are not    tile same       tking.

Altl~ougll    many    predatory     activities,     like burglary    and robbery,         are criminal,      many criminal        activities,     like

illegal   gambling    and drug dealing,           are productive     and not predatory,           Also,    some     predatory     activities,     like

tke collection    of taxes    to support       a parasitic    ruling class,     are not criminal.

   In another         paper       — Grossman             and Kim       (1996b)      — we analyse            the inteusi{v         of’pl-edation       in & model         ill

we define       to be moral,             always      choose        to be producers,           no mat. tel      how Iucrat.ive          predation      is relative        t.o

differ    radically       from     biological        models        of predation.         Most     itnportantly,         in economic          rrr(~dels a potential

predator      can choose          not to be a predator                 if production          is more    lucrative       than      predati[)ll.      In rent rast.           L

biological     model.

   In pioneering           general-equilibrium              models     that     allow for predation,            Usher ( 1987)          and M oselle        and Polak

(1995)    analyse        equilibria      in which people            decide simultaneously            whether      to be producers            01- predators.         [Also:

neither of these papers                 considers     the possibility          of a strategy      of deterring        predation,

  In two previous             papers       – Grossman           and Kim (1995,            1996a)         we developed           general-equilibrium            models

of appropriative           interaction        between        a pair of unitary           agents     in which      a prey can act to deter                  a potential

predator.      The first. of these papers,                 however,      abstracted        from the possibility            that an agent would              ch(]ose     to

specialize     in predation,            The second         of these     papers     w~< more closely            related     to the present          paper    ill t hat it

allowed      a potential       predator          to choose      to specialize      in either predation           or production,            But,    the role of prey

contr~st., in the present               paper,     LS in Grossman            and Kim (1996 b), every potential                    predator     is also a potential

prey.

a distribution        of human      capital     that is more egalitarian             in that     the nulnber          of l)eople WI1O

are unprivileged        is smaller     can result in the privileged                 choosing     to tolerate          rather     tliall (o

deter predation        by the unprivileged.

         Next, we partition          the feasible      distributions          of human         capital     into a set of Pareto

efficient distributions       and a set of Pareto inefficient               distributions.        The key to understanding

Pareto      efficiency in this model that            allows predation              is to observe         that   the possibility               of’

predation       can affect aggregate           net consumption           ill two distinct        ways.      First.     a.riy tillle and

effort devoted        to guarding       against     predation         reduces      tile [let collsumption              of producers.

Second, if the privileged           tolerate     predation       by the unprivileged,            then the human                capital        of

the unprivileged        is wasted by not being used productively.

         We find that the partition            between Pareto eficient               distributions        and Pareto inefficient

distributions      depends on the economy’s average endowment                           of humarl capital.             Specifically,          if

the average endowment            of human capital is small, then both the fully egalitarian                              distrihutioll

as well as some of the distributions               of human capital such that the privileged                         clloos~ to deter

predation       by the unprivileged       are Pareto efficient.            But, if the average endowment                       of human

capital is large, then the fully egalitarian             distribution         is not Pareto        efficient.        Instead,      Pareto

efficiency implies       a distribution          of human     capital       with a positive          number          of’ unprivileged

people    and with each unprivileged                person       having     only the endowment                  of human          capital

with which he was born.             With this distribution              the privileged         choose to tolerate            predation

by the unprivileged.

         Then, we apply the Rawlsian                criterion,        from Rawls ( 1971), and we determine                           which

 1.     Analytical           Framework

             Assume that each unprivileged                      person has an endowment                 of k units of human            capital.

 and that       each privileged             person         has an endowment             of     lK units of human            capital,     where

 1( > k.        Also, assume              that     each person         can produce            an amount         of consrrn]ab!es        that      is

 an increasing          concave function              of his human           capital.        We choose units for measuring                 r-on-

sumables        such that          an unprivileged            producer       can produce           kti units of consumables              arl[i a.

privileged       producer          can produce             I{@ units of consumables,               where     O < f~ < 1. To focus on

the effects of the possibility                    of predation,        we assume that              individual     productive       activities

are independent,             and we abstract                from trade in either             productive      inputs    or collsuma,bles.4

Finally, assume that                 u is the number             of people who are unprivileged,                      and that     1 – u is

the number          of people who are privileged,                      where we choose urlits such that                    the population

is one and where                 O < u < 1. Aside from their endowrnerlts                            of Ilurrlarl capital,       peoP1e are

otherwise       identical.

          Let n be the number                    of people who are unprivileged                  and who choose to be producers,

where        n ~ u,        let     N be the number               of people who are privileged                   and who choose to be

producers,         where         N ~ 1 – u,           and let       ~ be the number             of people,       whether     privileged        or

unprivileged,        who choose to be predators,                       Thus, we have             n + N + r = 1.

          Each producer             retains       the nonnegative          fraction      p of his production,            while losing the

          Assume further            that the relative          contribution         of time and effort by each producer                        to

guarding        against     predation      is proportionate             to his production.            Specifically.       each nnprivi-

leged producer            devotes    a nonnegative        amount         of time and effort            k“G      to gua.rdillg against

         Let z denote           the net consumption               of each unprivileged              producer      and let         Z denote

the net consumption             of each privileged             producer         after allowing for losses to predation                      and

for the opportunity            cost of devoting           time and effort to guarding                   against       predation.           It is

where      1 > 70 > 0.           In equation        (3), we can interpret                 z   and      Z     to be the a,rnounts of

consumption        that     with no time and effort devoted to guarding                           against      predation      — that is,

with     G = O — would yield the same utility                           as the actual         combinations,            pk”        and      k“G

devoting     time and effort to guarding               against         predation       into units of consumption.

         Assume that the consumption                  of each predator,               denoted       by v, is

                                                v = (1 -p)(nk”                  + Nl{a)                                            .

             We want our model to capture                      the fact that            guarding        a.gainsl predation            call    deier’


predation,        The concept            of deterrence         implies a galrle betweeri a unitary                       leader a.ud orl(’ or

more followers.           Accordingly,          we assume that decisions                    are made ill tile following order-.

             First, the privileged            decide collectively             how rnurll time and effort each producer                          will

devote to guarding              against       predation.       In choosing              G   the privileged         take into accouu~ the

effect of kti G and               liaG        on the choice of both the privileged                          arid the unprivileged             to be

predators.        Because         in equilibrium         the privileged             choose to be producers,                 the objective          of

the privileged           is to maximize           Z, the net consumption                    of each privileged             producer.

             Second,     taking       kffG       and     K@G         as given,          each persoll          decides      whether         I,o be a

producer        or a predator.           For a privileged          person,         this choice depends             011whether        or I1OL.for

choice depends            on whether          or not, for the given values of kOG                            and       lC’XG, z is as large

2. Deterrence              or Toleration              of Predation?

           To analyze        this model,         we begin by considering                    the decisions          of the privileged           arid

the unprivileged           to be producers             or predators.            By substituting             equations       ( 1 ) and (2) into

equations        (3) and (4), we find that                 Z ~ v if and only if G z G*(l[),                             where

In addition,       we find that              z ~ w if and only if G ~ G*(k),                         where

                                                                                   K4

      5For simplicity,    the model       abstracts    from    possible       destruction    of a part o{ the product           as the result      of

predation.      The models      in Grossman       and Kim      (1995,      1996a)    suggest      how destl-uction      could   be incorpol-ated

into the analysis.       With   regard to the results derived             below,    destruction     would    make it, less likely tf{at Pareto

efficiency    would imply       toleration    of predation.



                                                                          6

                 In sum, we have

Equation             (7) says that,             if G       is at least as large as                            G*(k).         then everybody                     chooses to

be a. producer.                  Alternatively,           if G“(k)               > G ~ G*(lK),                      then the privileged                   choose to be

producers             and the unprivileged                  choose to be predators

             We consider next the collective decision of the privileged                                                     regarding           G. As indicated

above, the objective                    of the privileged             is to maximize                      Z. To simplify the analysis                           we assulrle

that the privileged                    choose either            G equal to G*( If ) or G equal to                                           G*(k).7

Important          properties              of equations             (8) and (9) are that both                            ZIG*(lf)]              and     Z[G*(k)]         are

ZIG”(lf)]           does not depend                      on        I{/k.     In contrast,                given       1(,         Z[G*(k)]              is a decreasing

            Comparing               the values of Z[G*(J{)]                           and         Z[G*(k)],          we see that                 equations         (8) and

wise, the privileged               producers            choose to tolerate            predation        by the unprivileged.                      Equation

( 10) also implies that the larger is u the larger is the largest                                            value of 1(/k                 for whicl! 111P

privileged            producers      choose to deter predation                     by the unprivileged.

          A small value of u induces the privileged                                 producers       to tolerate             predation           because,       if

u is small. then, even with                   ~ equal to u,                 p is not too much less than one. In other words.

if u is small. then the loss to producers                                 from tolerating         predation           is small.~ A large value

then. from equations                  (5) and (6),             G“(k)        is large relative          to     G*(If).             In other       words. if

If/k      is large, then deterring                the unprivileged               from predation             would require                 each producer

to allocate           a relatively      large amount            of time and effort to guarding                            against        predation.

          As mentioned               above, it seems natural                 to define a distribution                     of human          capital     to he

more egalitarian             if, given the aggregate                  endowment           of human           capital,           either      u   is smaller

(closer to zero) or K/k                 is smaller (closer to one). The limiting distribution                                       that has u equal

to zero is identical              to the limiting           distribution          that has        ii/k        equal to one. This limiting

distribution            is fully egalitarian            in that the distinction             between           privileged            and urlprivileged

people has disappeared.                   (With either               u equal to zero or, equivalently,                           If/k      equal to one,

setting         G equal to           G*(Ii)       would deter everyone from predation.                                )

          Interestingly,           a smaller        value of          u     and a smaller          value of Ii/k                      affect the choice

between         deterrence        and toleration            of predation           in opposite      ways. A distribution                        of human

capital        that     is more egalitarian              in that          If/k     is smaller,     if anything,                 would result           in the

of people who choose to be predators,                          is neither      continuous        nor monotonic.             Suppose             that

the distribution             of human      capital     is such that         the privileged        producers         choose to tolerate

predation          by the unprivileged.               Hence,      r     equals       IL.     In this case, with a decrease                          in

u    the privileged           producers        would continue          to tolerate         predation       by the unprivileged,                     as

long as        u     remains      positive.      (As we have noted,                with      u   equal to zero the distinction

between privileged              and unprivileged         people has disappeared,                 and everyone           is deterred            from

predation.         ) Thus, with       ~ equal to u a decrease in u would imply a decrease                                         in     I-.



           Alternatively,        suppose       that   the distribution           of human        capital    is such that           the privi-

leged producers              choose to deter predation,               Hence,     r equals zero. In this case, a sufficient

decrease in u would cause the privileged                          producers        to choose instead             to tolerate      predation

by the unprivileged,              Thus, with a large value of u, but                         r equal to zero, a decrease                       in   rL



could cause           ~ to become         positive.

3.   Pareto          Efficient      Distributions              of Human          Capital

           This section analyses the welfare properties                        of the interpersonal         distribution           of human

capital.     We partition         the feasible distributions            of human capital into a set of Pareto                          efficient

distributions         and a set of Pareto inefficient              distributions.           A Pareto     efficient distribution                 is a

distribution         such that there is no feasible redistribution                         of human     capital      that would result

in a Pareto         improvement.          A Pareto       improvement           is an increase          in the net consumption                       of

at least one person without                   a decrease       in the net consumption              of any other person.

           Because      this model        assumes       that     individual       productive        activities       are independent,

and the model also abstracts                   from trade,        if we were to ignore the possibility                     of preda.tion~

then all interpersonal             distributions        of human         capital     would be Pareto               efficient.      Without

           As mentioned        above, the key to understanding                        Pareto     eficiency       irl this lrlode] that

allows predation           is to observe        that        the possibility       of predation         can affect aggregate                  l~et

consumption           in two distinct         ways.    First,      any time and effort devoted                  to guarding           against

predation        reduces     the net consumption                   of producers.         Second,      if the producers                tolerate

predation        by the unprivileged,          then the human             capital     of the unprivileged          is wasted by not

being used productively,

           Let Q denote the aggregate                  endowment           of human       capital.      Thus,




In analysing        the welfare properties             of the interpersonal             distribution        of human           capital,      we

hold     0   fixed.

         Assume that          by virtue        of birth       every person          has a nonnegative            elldowlnellt          of     k.

units of human           capital.      Presumably,            k.     varies little      across economies.           .Assume further

that,   although       education       or training          can increase      a person’s        endowment        of human             capital,

a person’s endowment                of human     capital       cannot    be decreased.          Thus, for a given value of Q,

a feasible interpersonal             distribution      of human         capital     is any combination            of k,         Ii,     and u

3.1     Pareto      Efficiency         with     Deterrence

         Consider       the set of distributions              of human        capital    that    are feasible       and Pareto              effi-

cient conditional          on either the distribution                being such that the privileged                 choose to deter

predation        by the unprivileged           or the distribution            being fully egalitarian.              With        either      de-

terrence     or the fully egalitarian           distribution,         the net consumption               of a privileged          person is

Z[G*(k)],        as given by equation            (9). Also, by substituting                 equation       (6) into equation                (3),
we see that         z, the net consumptioll                 of an unprivileged                person.     is


 (13)                                                       z =(1      -~#)k”.


            Equation       (13) says that           z     is all increasing            function      of        k.     .Ac.cordillgly, ally rc~-

distribut,ion      of human        capital       that      decreased         k.        tile hulnd]] capital               of an unprivileged

person, would decrease             the net consumption                 of unprivileged            people, and ally redistribution

of human capital           that increased           k would increase the net consumption                                  of the unprivileged

people.

            In addition,     comparing          equations       (9) and (13) we see that,                      if If       is larger    than       k,

then        Z[G*(k)]       is larger     than      z.     In other     words, with deterrence.                       the net     COnSlllnpl,    jOn


of a. privileged       person     is larger        than     the net consumption                  of an unprivileged               person.       An

increase in u would imply a change in the status                                  of some people from being privileged                            to

being unprivileged.            As long as          1[ is larger than              k, any redistribution                    of human         capital

that increased         u would decrease                 the net consumption               of these people.

            Equation   (12) implies that

                                                          dI<             Q–k
(14)
                                                           du ~=       (l-u)’”

Using equations            (9) and (14) we find that,                given        k,      Z[G*(k)]         is an increasing             function

of     u.    Accordingly,      with deterrence,             given      k,    any redistribution                     of human      capital      that

decreased        u would decrease            the net consumption                  of privileged          people,

            These observations          imply that,         with deterrence,             any redistribution                of human       capital

that    either    decreased       k      or increased           u    or, given           k.     decreased             u    would not result

in a Pareto        improvement,            Also, any redistribution                     of human          capital         that   increased          k

would increase         the net consumption                  of the unprivileged                people.         Thus,       to determine         the

set of Pareto      efficient distributions              of human       capital,        we have only to partition                  the feasible

distributions      according      to whether            or not increasing         k, the human             capital of an unprivileged

person, would decrease                 Z[G*(k)],         the net consumption               of privileged             people.


                                                                     12

Using equations            :9) and (15) we obtain

where      ($)0     = (&/&)&

Condition       (16) implies that, given u, if and only if If/k > maz[(I{/k)O,                                      1], then increasing

k and decreasing              1{ would increase the net consumption                              of privileged      people and, hence,

would result in a Pareto                improvement.            Thus, with either deterrence                  or the fully egalitarian

distribution,        all distributions          of human          capital      such that           If/k     > maz[(lf/k)O,          1]     are

Pareto      inefficient.       This result           reflects    the fact that,           if    If/k      is sufficiently     large,     then

increasing         k and decreasing             K would result in a large decrease in J{ UG*(k),                              the amount

of time and effort that the privileged                      have to devote to guarding                    against    predation    in order

to deter the unprivileged                 from being predators,                relative        to the decrease         in the production

of the privileged.

           In sum, we have found that, with either deterrence                              or the fully egalitarian          distribution,

if and only if the distribution                 of human         capital     is such that either            k > ko and         1 < If/k <

(l{/k)”       or     If/k     =    1,    then no feasible redistribution                       of human      capital      would   result     in

a Pareto        improvement.             Thus, with either            deterrence      or the fully egalitarian               distribution,

all distributions           of human       capital       such that         either   k > ko          and      1 < 1{/k < (l{/k)”              or

K/k = 1 are feasible                and Pareto         efficient.

           What      amounts           of net consumption             by the privileged             and the unprivileged               are as-

sociated      with these conditionally                  Pareto      efficient distributions?              Given the specification            of

(l{/k)”,      equations           (9) and (13), together            with equation              (12), imply that


(17)                                     Z[G”(k)]       = z = (1 – ~O)Q@              if If/k = 1,

The variable        sup{ Z[G*(k)]}               denotes the supremum                of Z[G’*(k)].

3.2    Pareto       Efficiency            with    Toleration

           Now, consider          the set of distributions           of human         capital    that     are feasible     and Pareto

efficient    conditional          on either      the distribution           being     such that         the privileged        choose    to

tolerate     predation     by the unprivileged            or the distribution          being fully egalitarian.           With either

toleration      or the fully egalitarian           distribution,          the net consumption            of a privileged        person is

ZIG*(l{)],       as given by equation               (8), Also, because              I(G*(l[)      is the minimum              amount    of

time and effort that each privileged                   producer       must devote to guarding                against     predation      to

deter privileged         people from being predators,                 with      G = G*(l{),             ZIG*(lf)]      is equal to u,

the consumption           of a predator.          Thus, with either the privileged                tolerating        predation     by the

unprivileged      or a fully egalitarian           distribution,          everyone,    whether     privileged        or unprivileged,

has the same net consumption.                     Hence, to determine           the set of conditionally             Pareto     efficient

distributions      of human         capital,      we only have to find the set of distributions                        for which the

net consumption           of a. privileged        person,      ZIG*(I()],        is maximized.

           Using equations          (8) and (15) we obtain

                                                 dZIG*(l{)]
(19)                                                                 <oas            u~O.
                                                     dk         ~


Condition (19) implies that, if u is positive, then the value of k that maximizes                                             ZIG*(l~)]

is the minimum           value,     k.,    which is every person’s minimum                      endowment       of human         capital.

With toleration,         setting      k equal to          k.   minimizes        the amount         of human         capital     that   the

unprivileged      waste by being predators                  rather    than producers.

           Using equations         (8) and (14) we find that,                given     k, the value of u that maximizes




                                                                     14

Conditions       (20.1) and (20.2) imply that,                  given       k, if a(l – k/Q)          > 1 – YO, then the value

of u that        maximizes            ZIG*(lf)]       is u“,         where        O < u“ < 1. Otherwise,             the value of             u

that      mafimizes         Z[G*(K)]        is zero.       This result        reflects the fact that           the relative       sizes of

a(l – k/Q)        and       1 – ~0 determine           the relative sizes of the increase in I{ti,                   the production

of a privileged           producer,     and the decrease             in     p, the fraction       of his production           that      each

producer       retains,     associated      with any increase in u and in r.

           To simplify the subsequent                analysis,       while focusing on essential               factors,     we consider

the limiting       case as        a     approaches         one,       In the limit      as    a      approaches           one, we have

a(l –k/Q)         ~ 1 –yd        as Q ~ k/yO.

           Considering        the limiting         case as       a    approaches        one, conditions           (19),     (20.1),     and

(20.2), taken together,               imply that,        with either         the privileged       tolerating      predation          by the

unprivileged       or a fully egalitarian            distribution,          if Q is not larger than                ko/yd,      then the

unique feasible and Pareto                efficient distribution             of human     capital      has     u = O. This result

obtains     primarily       because,     if Q is small relative to ko, then the minimum                               fraction        of the

economy’s human             capital    that the unprivileged               would waste by being predators                   rather     than

producers      would be large.

          Alternatively,       if Q is larger than           kO/yd, then the unique feasible and Pareto                          efficient

distribution      of human        capital    has      k = k.         and     u = u“ >0.       This result obtains             primarily

because,     if Q is large relative           to     k.,   then the minimum             fraction      of the economy’s            human

3.3      Unconditional           Pareto       Efficiency

          We can now derive the set of distributions                         of human        capital      that     are feasible       and

unconditionally         Pareto    efficient.        In this derivation            we consider     three     possible        situations:

Either     the distribution       of human          capital     is fully egalitarian,        or the distribution             of human

capital is not fully egalitarian            and the privileged            deter predation        by the unprivileged,            or the

distribution      of human       capital    is not fully egalitarian              and the privileged             tolerate    predation

by the unprivileged.           This derivation        allows for the possibility            that a redistribution             of human

capital that results in a switch from. one of these situations                        to another       could result in a Pareto

improvement.         Again, considering             the limiting        case as a         approaches       one, the partition             of

feasible distributions         of human        capital       into a set of Pareto          efficient distributions            and a set
                                                                                                                               .
of Pareto      inefficient    distributions       depends        only on the relation          between           Q and       ko/yO.


                                                                   16
           If     Q     is not larger         than      kO/~O,           then the fully egalitaria.11 dist riblltioll                 of lluII)a Jl

addition,        as we have seen, if’and only if the fully egalitarian                              distribution        is Pareto      efli(it’lli.

then all distributions                 such that        k ~ k.            and     1 < 1(/k        < (l(/k)”        are also feasible          a.lld

Pareto         efficient.      Thus,     if   Q      is sufficiently         small relative        to    Lo. then        Par(~to efficiency

implies either deterrence                  or the fully egalitarian                distribution.

           Under        what      conditions         would      it be Pareto           efficient     for the privileged          to tolerate

predation          by the unprivileged?                 Also, under             what    conditions       would the fully egalitarian

distribution           not be Pareto           efficient?       If       ZIG*(l{)]       as given by equation             (22) is as large

as the supremum                 of Z[G*(k)]           as given by equation                ( 18), then the distributiol~             of human

capital        that    has      k = k.        and      u = u“            is feasible     and uniquely          Pareto     eficient.       Given

the specification             of (l{/k)O,         equation           (18), together       with equation          ( 12), implies        that    the

supremum              of Z[G*(k)]        is an increasing             function       of u. In the limit as u approaches                       one,

we have

          Considering           the limiting          case as        a    approaches       one, equations          (22) and (23) imply

that

Equation         (24) implies that, if Q is sufficiently                        large relative to ko, then the distribution                     of

human capital            such that         k = k.       and     u = u“ is feasible and uniquely                     Pareto    efficient.       As

we have noted, with this distribution                         the privileged           tolerate    predation       by the unprivileged,

          What distributions               of human         capital       are feasible and Pareto             efficient if Q is smaller

than      ~,            but    Q is larger than          ko/y6?          If Q is larger than            ko/~t9, then the distribution

of human          capital      such that        k = k.        and         u = u“       is still feasible      and Pareto       efficient.       In
                                                                                                                                   .
addition,        if Q         is smaller      than      ~_~,vO, then            some distributions            such that       k > k.          and


                                                                           17
1 < If/k < (l[/k)O               are feasible       and Pareto          efficient.      This subset        of feasible     and Pareto

efficient distributions          includes    all distributions          such that        k 2 ko,      1<     Ii/k < (Ii/k)O,           and

Z[G*(k)],       as calculated         from equations          (9) and (12), is as large as ZIG*(lf)],                      as given by

equation      (22).

          In sum,       considering       the limiting        case as        a       approaches     one, if       Q      is not larger

than      ko/~O,      then the fully egalitarian              distribution        and all distributions          of human          capital

such that        k z k.         and      1 < 1{/k < (l{/k)”                 are feasible       and Pareto        efficient.        In this

case, because         the average        endowment          of human         capital     is small relative       to the minimum

endowment        of each unprivileged              person,      some of the distributions                  of human      capital       such

that the privileged            choose to deter predation             by the unprivileged            are Pareto         efficient,      The

fully egalitarian         distribution      is Pareto       efficient in this case, but only in this case.

          At the other         extreme,     if    Q    is not smaller            than    ~_~,~O, then the distribution                   of

human      capital      that   has    k = k.       and      u = u“ is feasible and uniquely                   Pareto      efficient.     In

this case, because the average endowment                        of human capital is large relative                to the minimum

endowment        of each unprivileged             person,      Pareto      efficiency implies         a distribution          of human

capital    such that the privileged              choose to tolerate           predation       by the unprivileged.

          In the intermediate            case, if Q is smaller than                  ~_~,70, but     0      is larger than         kof-y%,

then the distribution            of human        capital    that has       k = k.       and     u = u“ and all distributions

such that       k ~ ko,          1 < If/k         < (If/k)O,       and        Z[G*(k)]        > ZIG*(I[)]         are feasible         and

Pareto     efficient.     In this case, Pareto           efficiency allows both a distribution                  of human        capital

such that      the privileged         choose to tolerate          predation          by the unprivileged          as well as some

of the distributions           of human      capital       such that the privileged            choose to deter predation                by

the unprivileged.

4.     Rawlsian         Distributions            of Human         Capital

          Now that        we have found the set of Pareto                    efficient distributions           of human         capital,

let us consider         which of the distributions             in this set is preferred            according      to the ~awlsian




                                                                   18
 criterion.     The Rawlsian         criterion         selects from alTloIIg the set, of Pareto                eficiellt     outcollles

the outcome        that implies the maximum                   utility     for the least a.dvalltag(~d person.

           In the present      model,        net consumption             is a ca.rdillal index of utility.             Lloreover,    the

net consumption            of each unprivileged             person       is never larger thall the ]Iet, collsulnptio]l                of

each privileged        person.      Accordingly.          to apply the Rawlsia.rl criterion                ill the present        model

we have to determine             which of the Pareto                efficient    distributions     of human        capital     implies

the maximum          net consumption             for each unprivileged             person.

           If we were to ignore the possibility                    of predation,        then each person’s             net consump-

tion would equal that             person’s        production.            Moreover,      because    this model           assumes     that

individual      productive       activities      are independent,             and the model also abstracts                 from trade,

the fully egalitarian         distribution        of human         capital      would maximize        tile production          of each

unprivileged       person.    Thus, abstracting             from predation,            the Rawlsian        criterion     would select

the fully egalitarian         distribution,            In this case, every person            would have net consumption

equal to OQ.

           The possibility     of predation            can radically       alter this conclusion.           Considering       the lirr-

iting case as a approaches              one, we see from conditions                    (17), (18), (21), and (22) that, if Q

is not larger than         ko/~i3, then the Rawlsian                 criterion     would still select the fully egalitarian

distribution      of human       capital.      In this case, every person would have net consumption                              equal

to   ( 1 – ~O)Q.      But, if Q is larger than                    ko/y13, then the Rawlsian            criterion        would select

the distribution       of human       capital         such that     k = k.       and    u = u“. In this case, every person

would have net consumption                   equal to Q – ko.

           This result says that,       if the average endowment                     of human     capital     is large relative       to

minimum         endowment        of each unprivileged               person,      then the distribution           that      has a posi-

tive number       of unprivileged           people, each of whom has the minimum                       endowment            of human

capital,      maximizes      the net consumption                  of each unprivileged           person.      M~ith this unegal-

itarian     distribution     of human          capital,     the privileged         producers      tolerate     predation       by the

unprivileged,      and predation            results     in maximum          consumption        for everyone.


                                                                    19
 5.   Summary

           This   paper     has studied       the relation        between         inequality      alld welfare       ill a getleral-

equilibrium        model      in which people          can choose to be either                 producers      or predators.           We

considered        a society     in which some people             (the privileged)           are well elldowed         w’itll huma]l

capital,     but in which other people (the unprivileged)                        are poorly endowed            with burnall       rapi-

tal. In this society the interpersonal                 distribution      of human capital           has two dimensions:               the

number       of people who are unprivileged               and the endowment             of human        capital     of a, privileged

person relative         to the endowment             of an unprivileged           person.      Given the aggregate             eridow-

ment of human           capital,      it seemed natural         to define a distribution             of human        capital     to be

more egalitarian          if either      the number      of people       who are unprivileged                is smaller      or if the

ratio of the human            capital     of a privileged       person    to the human            capital     of an unprivileged

person is smaller.

           We first analysed          how the choice of the privileged                 between       either      deterring      or tol-

erating     predation      by the unprivileged           depends      on the interpersonal            distribution         of human

capital.     We found that,           if the number      of people who are unprivileged                     is large, but a priv-

ileged person       does not have too much human                       capital     relative     to an unprivileged             person,

then the privileged           allocate    enough      time and effort to guarding                against      predation      to deter

the unprivileged          from being predators.           Otherwise,       the privileged         tolerate     predation       by the

unprivileged.        These results         obtain     because    the larger        the number        of unprivileged           people

the larger would be the loss to producers                   from tolerating         predation       and because the smaller

the ratio of the human             capital    of a privileged         person      to the human         capital     of an unprivi-

leged person the less is the time and effort allocated                           to guarding      against      predation       that    is

necessary     to deter the unprivileged              from being predators.

          We also found that,            if the distribution       of human         capital     is such that       the privileged

choose to tolerate         predation       by the unprivileged,          then a decrease           in the number           of people

who are unprivileged           would result fewer people choosing to be predators.                       But, interestingly,
                                                                                                                    .
if the distribution        of human        capital    is such that       the privileged         choose to deter predation,


                                                                 20
then a sufficient, decrease              in the number         of people         W11Oare unprivileged              would cause illt’

privileged       to choose instead           to tolerate       predation         by the ul!privileged.            The     explanation


for this apparently            paradoxical       possibility     that      a more egalitarian            distribution       of humaII

capital     can result in predation            being tolerated          rather     than deterred         was that       a decrease      in

the number         of unprivileged         people reduces the loss to producers                    from tolerating         predation.

           Next, we analysed            the welfare properties           of the interpersonal              distribution     of human

capital.     We partitioned            the feasible distributions           of human          capital    into a set of Pareto           ef-

ficient distributions          and a set of Pareto          inefficient        distributions.      The key to understanding

Pareto      efficiency in this model was to observe                     that     the possibility        of predation        can affect

aggregate        net consumption           in two distinct        ways.          First,     any time and effort devoted                 to

guarding        against     predation     reduces    the net consumption                   of producers.        Second, if the pro-

ducers tolerate           predation     by the unprivileged,            then the human            capital       of the unprivileged

is wasted by not being used productively.

           We found that         the partition      between       Pareto         efficient distributions          and Pareto        inef-

ficient distributions          depends      on the economy’s             average          endowment        of human       capital    rel-

ative to the minimum                  endowment     that     each unprivileged               person     has by virtue        of birth.

Specifically,      if the average endowment                of human        capital        is small relative       to the minimum

endowment         of each unprivileged            person,      then some of the distributions                    of human       capital

such that the privileged              choose to deter predation                by the unprivileged           are Pareto      efficient,

The fully egalitarian           distribution      is also Pareto        efficient in this case, but only in this case.

           But, if the average           endowment      of human           capital        is large relative       to the minimum

endowment         of each unprivileged            person,      then     Pareto       efficiency       implies     a distribution        of

human       capital    with a positive         number       of unprivileged          people and with each unprivileged

person      having     the minimum           endowment         of human           capital.      With     such an unegalitarian

distribution,        the privileged       choose to tolerate          predation       by the unprivileged.

          Taken together,        because the minimum             endowment
                                                                    of human capital presumably varies

would not be Pareto           efficient.

          Then,     we applied       the Raw]sian         criterion,        and we deterl[lilled            wllictl of the Pareto

the model         also abstracts      from trade,         without         the possibility       of predation        the Ra.wlsian

criterion    would select the fully egalitarian                    distribution.       But. the possibility          of predatiorl

average endowment            of human       capital     is large relative          to the rninimunl          endowment       of each

Pareto efficient distribution           of human        capital     with a positive nut[lber of unprivileged                 people

and with each unprivileged            person having the minimum                    endowment            of human capital.         With

this unegalitarian       distribution       of human       capital,       the privileged     producers        tolerate    predation

by the unprivileged,         and predation         results    in maximum             consumptioll         for everyone.
