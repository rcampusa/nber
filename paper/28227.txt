A Model of Occupational Licensing and Statistical Discrimination

                                          ABSTRACT

We develop a model of statistical discrimination in occupational licensing. In the model, there is
endogenous occupation selection and wage determination that depends on how costly it is to
obtain the license and the productivity of the human capital that is bundled with the license.
Under these assumptions, we find a unique equilibrium with sharp comparative statics for the
licensing premiums. The key theoretical result in this paper is that the licensing premium is
higher for workers who are members of demographic groups that face a higher cost of licensing.
The intuition for this result is that the higher cost of licensing makes the license a more
informative labor market signal. The predictions of the model can explain, for example, the
empirical finding in the literature that occupational licenses that preclude felons close the racial
wage gap among men by conferring a higher premium to black men than white men. Moreover,
we show that in general the optimal cost of licensing is non-zero: an infinitely costly license
screens out all workers while a cost less license is no screen at all.

1     Discrimination & Licensing
Statistical discrimination against female and minority workers occurs when em-
ployers believe that workers of these types are less qualified, on average, or have
a productivity that is drawn from a noisier distribution than their male or white
peers, respectively Arrow (1973). For example, if employers believe that women
have lower (higher) expected productivity than that of white men, in equilibrium,
women will receive lower (higher) wages than white men if individual productiv-
ity is not directly observable.2 Likewise, holding expected productivity constant
across groups, if employers believe that the productivity distribution of women is
noisier (sharper) than that of white men, in equilibrium, women will receive lower
(higher) wages than white men. An important theoretical finding in the litera-
ture is that employer priors about worker productivity by worker type can itself
endogenously generate wage gaps through a self-fulfilling prophecy mechanism
even if the priors are incorrect at the outset (Coate and Loury, 1993).
    In the spirit of Coate and Loury (1993) and Moro and Norman (2004), we de-
velop a model of occupational licensing in which there is endogenous occupation
selection and endogenous wage determination. Our model differs from these two
self-fulfilling prophecy models in that we assume that the distribution of worker
ability is heterogeneous by worker type, fully known to employers, and correctly
perceived by employers ex ante. The assumptions that we make allow for a unique
equilibrium wage for licensed and unlicensed workers for each race and gender
group (Blair and Chung, 2018).
    Our model admits a unique equilibrium, in contrast to discrimination models
with a self-fulfilling prophecy feature, which admit multiple equilibria.3 We are
expressly interested in the comparative statics of the model that reflect whether
occupational licensing results in heterogeneous wage premium for licensed work-
ers by race or gender. It is either because firms have different priors over the un-
derlying distributions of ability, or because workers face different average costs of
investing in the licensing signal.
    Our work also contributes to the theoretical literature on occupational licens-
ing by providing an analytically tractable model of licensing as a job market signal
in the spirit of Spence (1973). The standard model of occupational licensing is
Leland (1979), which studied licensing from an optimal legislation vantage point.
Whereas Leland (1979) focused on whether it is socially optimal to have quality
standards, Persico (2015) studied the incentives of incumbent workers to impose
    2 The initial wages will be lower but over time as the firm learns about worker productivity from

on-the-job performance, these wage gaps should diminish, as in Altonji and Pierret (2001).
   3 The existence of multiple equilibria is a feature of self-fulfilling prophecy models. This demon-

strates how inequality in labor market outcomes can arise between two ex ante identical groups of
workers. By comparison, our goal in this paper is to take firm beliefs about workers' abilities as
given and determine the extent to which workers sort into licensed occupations in order to signal
their type.

occupational requirements for new entrants. We build a micro-founded model in
which the licensing decision of workers and the wages offered by firms are en-
dogenous outcomes of a two-period sequential screening game played by firms
and workers.


2     Model
Our model is a two-sector, two-period model of firms and workers, consisting of a
unit measure of risk neutral workers and an occupational licensing requirement for
workers in sector 1 but not sector 2. In each sector there is a single representative
firm. Firms do not observe a worker's ability but firms do observe whether or not
a worker has a license. Because licensing is costly and more easily accessible for
workers of higher ability, an occupational license acts as a signal of ability in an
analogous way to education in Spence (1973).
    In period 1, firms set wages to maximize profits, namely  L for the licensed
sector and U for the unlicensed sector. In period 2, workers choose the sector that
delivers the highest utility given the wages offered by firms and given the relative
preferences of workers over employment in the two sectors. The equilibrium of the
model is a vector of wages ( L  ,   ) and fraction of licensed workers f  that satisfy
                                   U
the utility maximization motive of workers and the profit-maximizing motive of
firms. Because firms, which are the uninformed party in our model, move first, our
model falls under the technical definition of a screening model (Stiglitz and Weiss,
1990).


2.1   Description of Workers' Tastes and Abilities
Each worker, indexed by the subscript i, is endowed with an ability ai and a relative
taste for the unlicensed sector i . For licenses that preclude ex-offenders, ability
maps to criminal history in the model. For licenses that require passing a test,
ability maps to cognitive ability. In cases where the license has no test or criminal
requirement, ability measures grit or the ability/willingness to pay the hassle cost
of completing the licensing paperwork.
    The ability type and the relative sector preference are independently and identi-
cally distributed across workers and drawn from the following two uniform distri-
butions: ai  U [µ a - a , µ a + a ] and i  U [µ -  , µ +  ]. We assume uniform
distributions for the sake of analytical tractability. The sector taste parameters µ
and  , are measured in units of dollars so that they enter the worker's utility
function on the same footing as wages. The ability and preference distribution are
allowed to be different for workers of different racial and gender groups. For nota-
tional simplicity, however, we suppress the group index and solve the model sep-
arately for each group. The sign of the comparative statics will describe how dif-


                                          3
ferences in firms' priors between women and men, minorities and non-minorities,
map onto differences in the licensing wage premium across demographic groups.
    Obtaining an occupational license is costly for workers of all abilities. To obtain
an occupational license, a worker of ability ai incurs a cost:

                                       c ( a i ) = c0 -  ( a i - µ a ).                        (1)

The parameter c0 > 0 is the unconditional average cost of obtaining an occupa-
tional license for workers of a given group.4 For example, the average cost of
obtaining a license in an occupation with a felony restriction will be higher on av-
erage for workers from groups that face higher incarceration rates. The parameter
 is the marginal benefit of ability. Each unit increase in ability lowers the cost of
licensing by an amount  . For ability measures that make it easier for a worker to
obtain an occupational license (e.g., I.Q.) we will assume a positive marginal bene-
fit of ability (i.e.,  > 0). For ability measures such as a worker's level of criminality
or criminal history, which make obtaining an occupational license more difficult,
by law, we assume a negative marginal benefit of ability (i.e.,  < 0).
     In the unlicensed sector, a worker i receives utility VU ,i , which is the sum of the
wages earned in the unlicensed sector, U , and the relative taste that she has for
the unlicensed sector i :
                                       VU ,i = U + i .                                  (2)
In the licensed sector, a worker i receives utility VL,i , which is the difference be-
tween the wages earned in the licensed sector,  L , and the cost, c( ai ), that she
incurred in order to obtain the license:

                                   VL,i =  L - [c0 -  ( ai - µ a )].                           (3)




2.2       Firms
Each firm, j, possesses a technology that converts one unit of worker ability into
 ¯ dollars worth of goods. In the licensed sector, j = 1, the occupational license
is also bundled with an exogenous level of useful human capital (training) 0 
h  1, which augments the worker's ability to utilize the technology by a factor of
(1 + h).5 The expected profit for the representative firm in the licensed occupation
is given by:
  4 It   is also the cost of licensing for the worker of average ability ai = µ a .
  5 The     cost of acquiring this human capital is borne by the workers as in equation (1).

Proof. See Appendix.
  If c0  c¯, it is not worthwhile to have a license even for the highest ability
workers. Hence, all workers pool on not having a license, i.e., f  = 0. If the cost

of licensing is sufficiently low, i.e., c0  c, licensing is cost-effective even for the
lowest ability type and all workers pool on having a license, i.e., f  = 1. In between
these two extremes, we have an interior solution in which a fraction, 0 < f  < 1,
of the workers select into the licensed sector.

    The higher the cost of licensing, the costlier it is for lower ability workers to
obtain the license and hence the stronger the signaling value of the occupational
license. In an earlier paper of ours, we regard felony restrictions of a license as
imposing a cost that differentially affects black men ­ the group facing a higher in-
carceration rate (Blair and Chung, 2018). Our current model provides a theoretical
basis for the main finding in that paper: a higher license premium for black men
(relative to white men) only exists in the licensed occupations with a permanent
felony restriction.

Proposition 3. The licensing premium is increasing in the level of human capital bundled
with the license (h), if the licensing premium is less than 100%. The licensing premium is
unambiguously decreasing in the average ability of workers (µ a ).

Proof. See Appendix.
   Intuitively, the more human capital that is bundled with the license, the higher
the marginal product of labor and hence the higher the equilibrium wage. More-
over, the license is more informative when the expected ability of the worker, given
other observables, e.g. race and gender, is lower ­ hence the higher licensing pre-
mium.
   In Blair and Chung (2018), we also show that the licensing premium for women
(both black and white) is greater than the licensing premium for white men. This
result is consistent with groups with lower perceived ability earning higher licens-
ing premiums.

                                            6
Proposition 4. Define the industry surplus as the sum of firm profits and worker wages
net of the licensing cost. The industry surplus is maximized by a non-negative average
cost of licensing:
                                        1
                                  c0 = (c  ¯ + hµ¯ a) .                           (12)
                                        2
Proof. See Appendix.
    The intuition for this result is similar to that in Spence (1973) -- a license is in-
formative because it is costly. In a market with workers of heterogeneous abilities,
the optimal cost of licensing burden is neither zero nor infinity.
    One important caveat here is that the industry surplus differs from the typical
social surplus in that it abstracts from the welfare loss experienced by customers
from higher prices as in Kleiner and Soltas (2019). In this respect, this welfare cal-
culation is closer in spirit to the producer surplus in Persico (2015), where the goal
is to determine whether firms and incumbent workers, acting collusively, benefit
from licensing, given that workers will endure the cost of licensing.


3    Conclusion
Economists traditionally viewed occupational licensing as a labor market friction
(Friedman, 1962). The arguments in this paper suggest that licensing is also an
informative labor market signal because it is costly to obtain. Consistent with this
model, in Blair and Chung (2018), we show that occupational licensing closes the
racial wage gap between men when the license credibly signals a worker's criminal
history. Given the intractable nature of the racial wage gap, as documented in
Bayer and Charles (2018), it is remarkable that occupational licensing can close
the racial wage gap. For a reform of occupational licensing to successful, a key
implication of our work is for policy makers to acknowledge the signaling value
of a license and its differentially positive impact on the wages of workers who
would otherwise face statistical discrimination on the basis of race or gender.

A.1     Proof of Theorem 1
To solve this sequential game, we use the solution concept of sub-game perfect
equilibrium (SPE). In an SPE, we solve the model using backwards induction. First,
workers in period 2 sort in to the sector that produces the highest net return, given
wages and their preferences. Next in period 1, the representative firm in each
sector chooses the corresponding wage to maximize firm profits, given the sorting
of workers.

A.1.1   Period #2: Workers Choose Sector
Starting in period 2, the probability that a worker of ability ai sorts into the licensed
sector, P( L = 1| ai ), is given by the probability that the net benefit of working in the
licensed sector is greater than the net benefit of working in the unlicensed sector:


  P( Li = 1| ai ) = Prob(VL,i > VU ,i ) = Prob( L - c0 - U +  ( ai - µ a ) >       i)
                                          1   +  ( ai - µ a )                           (13)

                                          2        2

    where,   ( L - c0 ) - (U + µ ) is the expected net benefit of licensing
across workers of all types. The conditional probability of licensing is increasing
in the expected net benefit of licensing. It is also increasing in worker ability for
cases where worker ability lowers the cost of licensing  > 0 but decreasing in
worker ability in cases where worker ability increases the cost of licensing  < 0.

A.1.2   Period #1: Firms Choose Wages
Next, we must compute firm profits given the sorting decisions of workers. In
order to compute profits for the representative firms in both the licensed and unli-
censed sectors, we first compute the fraction of workers who sort into the licensed
profession and the unlicensed profession, i.e., E[ P( Li = 1| ai )] and E[ P( Li = 0| ai )],
because these quantities enter the expect labor cost of the firms.

    Given that we have a two-sector model, a worker is either employed in the
licensed or in the unlicensed sector. Consequently:
                              E[ P( Li = 0| ai )] = 1 - E[ P( Li = 1| ai )]
                                                    1                                                            (15)

    To compute firm profits, we must also compute the expected ability level of a
worker given that she has a license E( ai | Li = 1) and given that she does not have
a license E( ai | Li = 0) both of which contribute to firm revenue:

The best response function for the wages in the licensed sector is increasing in the
level of human capital that is bundled with the license h and with the quality of
the firm's technology    ¯ . It is also increasing in the wage offered by the unlicensed
firm, the cost of licensing and the minimum taste for the unlicensed sector, µ -  .
    To find the best response function for firm 2, we assert that firm 2 chooses U

   To get the best response function of the firm 2, we re-arrange the expression

The best response function for the wages in the unlicensed sector is increasing with
the quality of the firm's technology   ¯ , the average ability of all workers, and the
competing wages in the licensed sector. It is decreasing in the cost of obtaining a
license and the maximum taste for the unlicensed sector by workers, µ +  . At
the Nash equilibrium both firms' wages are mutual best responses. Substituting
the best response of the firm in the licensed sector into the best response function
for the firm in the unlicensed sector, we solve for the equilibrium wage in the
unlicensed sector U  .

   To solve for the fraction of licensed workers, we substitute equilibrium wages
into the expression for the fraction of licensed workers in equation (26):

                                     1 µ ¯ a h - c0 - µ
                               f =     +                .                              (26)
                                     2         6
Defining c  hµ    ¯ a - µ - 3 , it is straight forward to show that if the average
cost of licensing, c0 , is lower than c that licensing is sufficiently cheap. Then, all
workers obtain a license and work in the licensed sector ( f = 1). Likewise, defining
¯  hµ
c       ¯ a - µ + 3 . If the average cost of licensing, c0 , is higher than c
                                                                            ¯, licensing
is sufficiently onerous. Hence, all workers prefer not to obtain a license ( f = 0).
It is only for intermediate value c0  (c, c ¯), that we observe a non-zero fraction of
workers in both the licensed and unlicensed sectors.
     We further simplify the expression for the fraction of licensed workers in equa-
tion (26) and the equilibrium wages for workers in equations using the definitions
for c¯ and c:

Corollary 1. Wages are unambiguously higher in the licensed sector than in the unli-
censed sector, and the wedge between these two wages is increasing in the cost of licensing.
In equilibrium, unlicensed workers also experience a wage benefit from the human capi-
tal that is bundled with the licensing. This wage benefit is half the human capital benefit
experienced by licensed workers.

    The fact that licensing is bundled with human capital h increases the market
return to licensed labor and, in doing so, increases the value of the outside op-
tion of workers who opt not to become licensed. Consistent with this prediction
of the model, Han and Kleiner (2016) provide evidence that workers in a licensed


                                            12
occupation who do not possess a license but can practice because of grandfathering
provisions experience a 5% increase in wages as a result of their occupation becom-
ing licensed, when compared to similar unlicensed workers in occupations with no
licensing requirements. By contrast, the wage premium to licensed workers in the
occupation, when compared to similar unlicensed workers in occupations with
no licensing requirements, is 12 percentage points higher than the wage premium
experienced by grandfathered workers.

Corollary 2. Given two distinct groups of workers B and W such that the average cost of
licensing is greater for group B than for group W (i.e., co,B > c0,W ), unlicensed B workers
earn less than unlicensed W workers. By contrast, licensed B workers earn more than
licensed W workers, ceteris paribus. This follows from the fact that wages are decreasing
in c0 for unlicensed workers (equation 6) but increasing in c0 for licensed workers (equation
7).

    The result of this corollary offers testable predictions. First, unlicensed black
men earn less, on average, than unlicensed white men. Second, licensed black men
working in occupations with felony restrictions earn, on average, slightly more
than licensed white men in similar occupations. The presumption here is that the
felony restriction imposes a higher average cost of licensing on black men relative
to white men. Using data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, Sakala (2014) docu-
ments that black men are six times more likely to be incarcerated than white men,
which is consistent with this assumption.


A.2    Proof of Proposition 3
Proof. By definition the license premium is:
                                             1
                        -

                             =                                            .             (30)

The license premium increases in c0 because the wage gap (numerator) increases
in c0 and the wage in the unlicensed sector (denominator) is decreasing in c0 . In
particular, the derivative of the licensing premium with respect to c0 is:

                               d     1       L - U
                                   =            2
                                                        > 0.                            (31)

The derivative of the licensing premium with respect to the mean ability is:

               d       ¯ [h(µ +  + c0 ) + 2(c0 + µ )]
                                                        d
                    =-                 2
                                                      =      < 0.                       (32)

The derivative of the licensing premium with respect to h is:
                                                  -  ]

                            -   > 0, which holds when L              - 
Therefore d

    The positive relationship between the licensing premium and the dispersion in
sector taste comes from the fact that wages in the unlicensed sector (denominator)
fall with  .

A.3     Proof of Proposition 4
The total social surplus is the sum of the firm's revenue minus the expected cost of
licensing. Since the expected wages of employees is a cost to firms and a benefit to
workers, it nets out in the social surplus calculation, in the case where we place an
equal weighting on firm profits and net worker wages:

           1                  1 2
       -        c0 ( +  ) - a
          2                   3
                                                                                      (34)
   To find the social optimal cost of licensing, we take the derivative of the social
surplus with respect to the cost, c0 . Recall the following:
                               1                     d       1
                       =          ¯ a h - c0 - µ ) =
                                 (µ                       =-                          (35)
                               3                      dc0    3
Therefore

                  =0
             dc0

             = -      (1 + h)µ¯ a+     ¯ a-
                                       µ       ( +  ) +    c0 = 0                     (36)
