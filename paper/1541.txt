                     The U.S. Capital Stock in
                      the Nineteenth Century

                                ABSTRACT



     This paper ——   prepared for and presented at a meeting of the
Conference on Research in Income and Wealth ——   describes   a set of

seven capital stock estimates for the U.S., distributed at decennial

intervals, 1840 through 1900.

     The estimates link with Raymond Goldsmith's work on the twentieth

century to form a capital stock series covering well over 100 years

of U.S. history. The paper describes the theoretical underpinnings of

the new estimates, the sources of the evidence from which they were

constructed, the types of estimating procedures followed, and the

relationships of the new series to other economic aggregates. A few

of the ways in which the series illuminates the nature of the

nineteenth century U.S. economy and the course of U.S. economic

development are taken up.

The U.S. Capital Stock in the Nineteenth Century
                  Robert E. Gallman*




        This paper describes the results of work
begun many years ago bY Edward S. Howle and me and

carried forward intermittently since then bY me.
Howle and I estimated the value of the U.S. fixed
capital stock (current and 1860 prices) at decade

intervals,     1840   to 1900,    and circulated      in

n,neographed form a manuscript describing our
estimating procedures (Gailman and Howle, ND.).
This manuscript was never published, although it
served as the basis for a number of descriptive
and analytical papers bY us and bY others (Galiman
and Hc'wle, 1971; Davis and Gailman, 1973, 1978;
Davis et al, 1973, Ch. 2; Galiman, 1965, 1972).
While Howle and       I   thought the estimates were
fundamentally sound, we regarded the project as

Howle    and   Colleen Callahan,       the   first   for

work, the second for recent assistance.              The

research reported in this paper has been supported

incomplete and chose to delay publication until we

were more fully satisfied with it.        We wanted to

run additional tests in particular, Howle thought
that appropriate samples from the manuscript
census (SoltOwts work (Soltow, 1975) ultimately
met our requirements) would give us the means for
strong tests of a set of important estimating
decisions. A number of minor sectoral estimates
had been hastily made, and we believed that they
could be improved with more research and a little
ingenuity. We also wanted to extend the series to

earlier years, add figures for elements of the
capital stock ignored in our original manuscript,

and work out regional distributions of the totals.
      Our decision to delay was a mistake. Both of

us were drawn off     into   other work, I temporarilY,

Howle permanently.       The manuscript entered the
underground of research; it was occasionally cited

and our data were used, but it was never subjected

to the constructive criticism that publication
would have brought. We should have remembered that

all research is, in a sense, preliminarY, and that
                                                        3



to withold won.:: for   long serves scholarship badly,
however good the motives for witholding may be.
      The delay has not been all a waste.           In the

years since we wrote the original :mansucript               I


have managed to do most of           the things we had
planned: I have carried out additional             tests,

thoroughly revised the old estimates (here and
there substituting new series), added estimates of
important element.s of the capital stock that were

not treated in the old manuscript, and extended
                                1
the series to earlier years.         This does not mean1

of course, that the work is now complete —— sound

and durable in every respect. It is certainly not.
Gaps remain (for example, there are no figures for

the value p1 roadways), and there are any number

of ways in which the existing estimates could be

improved.      But additions and improvements must be
left, for the time being, perhaps to be carried
out eventually bY other hands.              The existing
estimates seem to me ready for formal presentation

to the scholarly community, at long last.

       Part,     but    not   all,     of    the     formal

presentation will take place in this paper. There

is not space enough here to include estimating
details: the notes describing our procedures now
run in excess of 200 manuscript pages, more than
the Conference would happily publish.               In the

present paper I will be able to deal only with the

types of estimating procedures and tests adopted
and their general results1            the     identity and
character of the principal sources used, and the
theoretical concepts that guided the work. These
subjects are treated in the next section, Section
2.     Section 3 is concerned with the theoretical
and quantitative relationships between the new
estimates and those already in the field:                 the

Goldsmith and Kuznets series, as well as the
original Gallman and Howle figures (Goldsmith,
1952; Kuznets, 1946; Gailman and Howle, n.d.;
Gallman, 1965). Section 4 considers the ways in
which the new series illuminate the nature of. the
nineteenth century U.S. economy and the course of

U.S. economic development.

       The new series contain estimates of the
value of land (except agricultural land in 1840).
I will use the term "national wealth" to refer to
the value of reproducible capital, land, stocks of

monetary metals, and net claims on foreigners.
"Domestic        wealth"   will   mean      the   value    of

reproducible capital and land. Notice that paper
claims are excluded from both of these aggregates,

as are consumers' durables and human capital. If I
have occasion to aggregate across these variables,
I    will   so     indicate   (e.g.   "national wealth,
                                                     5



 inclusive     of    consumers'   durables and human
capital").          The terms "national capital" and
 "domestic capital" refer to national wealth and
domestic wealth, respectively1 minus the value of
 land. The •concepts I      refer to as "wealth" and
"capital"      are sometimes      called   (by   others)

"capital" and "reproducible capital,"
respect ively.



                             2



Uses of Capital Stock Estimates



         There are at least four scholarly uses for
aggregate capital stock series,
         (1)   They can be used in place of national
product series——or in addition to national product

series——to describe the scale, structure, and
growth of the economy. There is no reason why,
over short, or even intermediate periods, the
capital stock should grow at exactly the pace of
the national product, but over the long run there
should be a considerable degree of similarity. For

this reason capital stock series have sometimes
been used as proxies for national product series
in the measurement of long-term growth (Jones,
1980).     But one could easily make a case for the
                                                 6


use of such series as independent indexes of
growth,      not   simply as proxies for   national

product. Looked at (and measured) in one way, the
capital stock of a given Year describes the
piled—up savings of the past; looked at (and
measured) in a different way, it is a vision of
future production (see below), Either way, we have
a picture of the economy that is different from
the one provided by the national product, and one
that is analytically useful.
      (2)     Capital stock series have appeared as
arguments in consumption functions and, thereby,
in the analysis of the level of economic activity,

cyclical variations, and economic growth. Land and
consumers'     durables are helpful additions to
capital in these uses, as are paper claims.
      (3)     The capital stock is a consequence of
savings and investment decisions, with which are
tied up choices of technique.       The level and
structure of the capital stock emerge out of these
decisions, and capital stock series figure in the
study of them.

      (4) Finally, capital stock series are used
in the analysis of production relationships and
the sources of economic growth, a practice that
has been at the heart of one of the major
theoretical disputes of the post—war period.

      In this paper the capital stock series are
put chiefly to the first use and, to a limited
extent, to the third and fourth.

Methods of Estimating the Capital Stock



      Capital stock estimates maybe made in two
ways: they may be cumulated from annual investment
flow data (Raymond Goldsmith's perpetual inventory

method--Goldsmith, 1956), or they may be assembled
from censuses of the capital stock.       If census and

annual flow data were perfectly accurate, if the
identical concepts were embodied in each, and if
appropriate estimating procedures were used, then
perpetual inventory and census procedures would
yield the same results.       In fact, they rarely do,
although   given   the    rich      opportunities   for

discrepancies to arise,        it   is surprising how
narrow the margins of difference often are.

      The choice between the two techniques turns
on the types and quality of data available. From
1850 through 1900 there were six reasonably
comprehensive federal censuses of wealth, while
for 1805 and 1840 we have census—style estimates
const r ucted bY able and informed
                                                                8

contemporaries——Samuel Blodget (1806) and Ezra
Seaman      (l852)——chifly          from      federal        data.
Investment        flow data,       from which        perpetual
inventory estimates might                be made, are less
generally available. But there are some that offer
opportunities for estimates superior to those
derivable from nineteenth century census—style
data.       The     best    were         assembled      in    the
extraordinarily well conceived and careful work of

Albert Fishlow (1965, 1956) on the railroads. We
used Fishlow's estimates as the bases for our
railroad series and similarly exploited the work
of Cranmer (1960), Segal (1961), North (1960),
Simon (1960), and Ulmer (1960) on canals, the
international sector, telephones, and electric
light and power.           We also built up our own
perpetual inventory figures for the telegraph
industry and for consumers' durables.                No doubt
other sectoral estimates could be constructed,
with profit, from flow data, although I doubt that

the remaining opportunities are quantitatively
important. The estimates described in this paper
are     chiefly    (and    bY     necessity)     drawn from
census—style data (see Table 1).

        There are also some aggregate flow data
which, while not very helpful in the derivation of
sectoral     estimates,         proved     useful       in    the
                                                         9

construction of        aggregate     perpetual   inventory
estimates of manufactured producers' durables and
structures ——       estimates    that we have used 'for
checl.::ing   the    census—style     figures    and    for

constructing annual capital stock series.              That

story is told elsewhere; I will also make brief
reference to it subsequently in this paper (see
Davis and Galiman, 1973; Gallman, 1983).


Valuation of Capital



         In principle, capital stocks might be valued
in any number of ways. 3
•

                                 In practice, there are
only three ways of any importance, two of which
exist in two variants.          (I yefer here, to current

price estimates; constant price estimates are
discussed below.)        Capital may be valued at
acquisition cost (which I will also refer to as
book value), at reproduction cost, and at market
         4
value.

         Acquisition cost corresponds to the notion
(expressed above) of the capital stock as piled—up

savings.      The great difficulty posed by such
estimates is that the capital stock of each year
is valued in the prices of many years, so that no
meaningful comparisons (at least none that comes
to my mind) can be made. This difficulty can be
                                                         10

overcome bY adjusting the data by means of a
general price index——a consumer price index would
be best——so that all elements of the capital stocl<

of a given Year are expressed in the prices of
that   year. A capital stoct.:: so valued retains the

sense of acquisition cost: the valuation expresses
the     capital   stock     in   terms     of   foregone

consumption. The foregone consumption consists of
the consumption goods given up in the year of
investment, expressed in the prices of th.e year to
which the capital         stock: estimate refers.
Unambiguous comparisons can thus be drawn ——           with
the national product of the same year,                  for

examp 1 e.

       The capital stock may also be valued at
reproduction cost.        Each item is valued at the
cost of the resources that would be required to
replicate it in the year to which the capital
stock estimate refers, given the factor prices and
techniques of production of that year. The capital
stock thus has the sense of congealed productive
resources,    valued      consistently,    so   that     a

summation has a precise meaning.          Such estimates
are well adapted to the study of production
relationships. They avoid, in some measure, the
circularity problem implicit         in market value
estimates. Compared to acquisition cost estimates,
                                                          11


 they express the capital stock in terms of current
productive     resources,    rather     than historical
 foregone consumption.5

      The third system value; the capital stock in
market prices; that is, each item of capital is
appraised at the price it would bring in the
curren,t market.    The market value of a piece of
capital   is    presumably     a      function   of     its

productivity, its expected life, and the going
rate of interest. The capital stock, so valued,
expresses the income that capital is expected to
earn, discounted back to the Year to which the
estimate refers. Such a measure would be useful •in

consumption function applications, as well as in
describing the scale and structure of the economy.

      Book and reproduction cost measures differ,
theoretically, in     that the former measures the
capital stoci.:: in terms of what was given up to
obtain it, while the latter measures the capital
stock in terms of what would have to be given up
in the current year to reproduce it.                  In an
unchanging economy in equilibrium, these measures
would be identical.    In an economy in which there
were no changes except in the price level, they
could be made identical bY means of the deflation
adjustment described above. In the absence of this

adjustment, book value would exceed reproduction
                                                                                     12


cost whenever the price level was falling, and
vice versa. Changes in relative prices could lead
to the divergence of the two measures, even after
adjustment. Thus if the prices of capital goods
fell relative to the prices of consumption goods,
adjusted        book            value       measures             would     exceed
reproduction cost, and vice versa.                                 (All of the
above analysis rests on the assumption that the

                                                                     Ud I

                                                                              l Ii



reproduction cost of these goods.                            If that is not
the case, matters become more complicated, as will

appear.)        In fact, we know that the price indexes
of   neither           consumption nor                   capital         goods
exhibited a very pronounced trend over the last
four decades of the ante bellum period, although
the latter fell slightly as compared with the
former (see Brady, 1964, and Historical

Statistics 1960, series El, 7,8). Between 1859 and
1869—1878, the former rose dramatically, while the
latter did not (Gallman, 1966). The two then fell
pronouncedly until nearly the end of the century,

the latter declining the mare markedly. Thus, for
the dates of concern to this paper, book value
(adjusted          and          unadjusted)             probably         exceeded

reproduction cost modestly, 1840—1860, and more
markedly, 1880—1900; adjusted book value also
probably exceeded reproduction cost in 1870.

         Bocil.:: value measures 1001.:: to the past——what

was given up to obtain capital——while market
values look to the future——earnings potential.          In

an unchanging economy in equilibrium, and with
perfect knowledge, book value and market value
would differ only in that the former treats each
piece of capital as though it were new, while the
latter does not.         Even in an unchanging economy1
fixed capital would gradually wear out. Therefore
old fixed capital would sell for less than new
fixed capital, and a capital stock expressed in
market values would be smaller than one expressed
in bool:: values.        The disparity could easily be
removed bY deducting capital consumption from the
boo!:: value measures, producing estimates of net
boo!:: value.

         The effects of changing prices(levels and
relative prices) on the relative magnitudes of net

book arid     market valuesare presumably much the
same as the effects of changing prices on the
relative magnitudes of book and reproduction cost
values (see above), Once we drop the assumption of

perfect      I.::nowledge,     other   opportunities   for

divergences between capital stock estimates based

on these two concepts emerge.                Specifically,
deviations between the expected life of individual

pieces      of   fixed       capital   (on which capital
                                                                14

consumption allowances rest) and their actual life
may arise.           These deviations may            prove,    in

practice, not to. be serious,                in view of the
opportunity for errors of opposite direction to
offset in the aggregate, although a general change
in the rate of            innovation could produce an
uncompensated deviation.6 Changes in the interest
rate produce systematic shifts in the relative
values of assets of differing life expectation, in

the market, but do not influence aggregate net
book values. Actual changes in the interest rate
over the last sixty years of the nineteenth
century seem likely to have raised market values
above net bool.:: values from 1870 onward, but not bY

much, except perhaps for the year 1900 (Gailman,
1983).

         Once      allowance    is    made     for      capital

consumption,        reproduction cost        (that     is,    net

reproduction cost) ought to be similar to market
value.          Indeed,   if    the    economy       were      in

equilibirum——such that the market price of new
capital equalled its reproduction cost7——and if
capital     consumption        allowances     followed        the

pattern implicit in the structure of the sales
prices of capital goods of differing vintage, then

market value and net reproduction cost would be
identical. In fact, however, these conditions are
                                                        15

not met. Market prices deviate from the value of
resources used up u-i     production   (there are profits

or losses) and capital consumption allowances fail
to reflect precisely the structure of prices of
capital of differing age. Thus divergences arise
between market value and net reproduction cost,
divergences of     a type discussed previously in
connection with book and market values.

      Finally,     it    should be      said   that   the

deviations among net book value, net reproduction
cost, and market value are least marked for items

recently produced; in equilibrium, there is no
deviation at all for new goods.            The faster a
capital stoct:: grows, ceteris paribus, the lower
the average age of capital and the narrower the
differences among boot.:: value, reproduction cost,
and rriarket value. As will appear, the U.S capital

stock grew at an extraordinarily rapid pace in the
nineteenth century. Thus the application of the
three concepts might produce net valuations that
differed little from one concept to the next. The
market value and reproduction cost of inventories
also will normally differ little. Thus the more
important inventories are in the total capital
stoc!.::, the smaller the disparity between aggregate

reproduction cost and aggregate market value,
ceteris paribus.        Inventories were, in fact,an

important   element     of     the nineteenth century
capital stock,   partly      because agriculture bulked
large in the economy and agriculture held large
inventories (e.g., ofanimals).
       If data were readily available and estimates

costlessly made, it would be desireable to have
sets   of   capital     stock       estimates    based    on

acquisition costs, reproduction costs, and market
values. Comparisons among the estimates would have

interesting analytical uses (e.g., Tobin's hqU)
Unfortunately,   these conditions do not obtain.
Data are less than abundant and less than perfect;

the assembly of estimates is not costless.

       In recent times the data that have been most

abundant have been acquisition cost data, since
firms maintain records of sales and purchases and
keep books on their capital stock.              Given good
price data, evidence on purchases and sales can
also   be   converted        into   perpetual    inventory

reproduction     cost     estimates,      although       the

procedure is not problem-free. Market values and
census—type figures on reproduction cost are very
much harder to obtain. Few elements of the capital

stock (apart from goods held in inventory) are
sold in any given year. If the capital stock is to

be valued at market prices, imputations must be
drawn from recorded prices in marl.::ets that may be

very thin.      Estimating reproduction cast is even
more difficult, since it sometimes requires that
one work out the cost,          in a given Year, of
producing, a goad which, in fact, was not produced
in that year.     These are familiar points. But we
should not lose sight of the fact that market and
reproduction costs are constantly being estimated,
and that there are experts who spend their lives
at these tasks ——       experts hired by insurance
companies, the loan departments of banks, and
various tax offices. Indeed, most of us here today
who own homes have a fair idea of what they would

bring, on the market, or how much it would take to

rebuild them, despite the recent gyrations of the
real estate market.

       In the nineteenth century, boot.:: value data

were much less common than they are today. Until
late in the century, most firms charged off
capital purchases on current account. Thus there
were few books to refer to when the census taker
came    around.       Perhaps    equally   important,

businessmen did not think in terms of book value.
It was much mare natural for them to appraise
plant and equipment in terms of what it would take

to replace it, should it all burn down, or what it

might sell for. This was even more clearly the
case for farmers and householders viewing their
                                                                   18

property.       These nctions of value seem to have
influenced the designers of census questions.
While the questions are bY no means always crystal

clear, they seem to refer most often to market
value or net reproduction cost.                (The two concepts

are not always clearly distinguished.) There is
little doubt——especially for the first three or
four census dates——that book value was only rarely

sought bY census takers. How rarely is a matter on
which there is not full agreement. Howle and I
decided that most of the census returns we used
were      expressed         in     market     values      or      net

reproduction costs (see Table 1). But I grant that

we sometimes stand in opposition to very good
authority.        For      example,      Kuznets    (1946)        and

Creamer,       Borenstein,         and      Oobrovolsky        (1960)

believe        that        the     manufacturing         censuses,

1880—1900, returned book value. Howle and                           I

        I do not have the space in this paper to
argue Haw1's and my case with respect to this
matter, although I will do so on another occasion.

As my previous remarks have suggested,                            the

distinctions among book value, market value, and
reproduction cost may not have great practical
significance,         in     any    case,     so   far    as      the

nineteenth century capital stock is concerned,9

especially in view of the wide margins for error
that must be assigned to the estimates. What is
more important is the question of whether the
census measurements of fixed capital are net or
grass. Here we have access to a test that does not

rely on the interpretation of nineteenth century

language.   We can check the census data (land
improvements and manufactured producers' durables,

separately) against perpetual inventory estimates
based on reproduction cast.   The story of these
tests has been told elsewhere (Davis and Gallman,
1973; Galiman, 1983) and will be told again in
more detail in still another place, so I offer
only a brief summary here: The net reproduction
cost estimates check quite closely with the census
aggregates before the Civil War, suggesting that
the latter are, indeed, net valuations. There is
also some support for the notion that the census
valuations refer to reproduction cost and that
they are accurate. The post—war fit is poorer, but
the evidence for the belief that the census
figures are net is strong: the perpetual inventory

figures typically exceed the census figures.

      Our   estimates    of   agricultural     land

improvements (clearing, breaking, fencing,
draining, irrigating) depend chiefly on census
physical stock data (e.g., acres of improved land)

       (a)
          "Perpetual inventory" is used here to refer to any and all cases in which estimates
       were derived from flow data; "census," to any and all cases in which estimates were dcri7cd
       from stock data.

       (b)There remain some doubts concerning valuation bases
                                                              (see text).       In particular, a
       number of the estimates identified as
                                             expressed in market prices may, in fact, refer to
       net reproduction cost.

         Both columns are checked (Panel A) in cases in which the census was the

and various coefficients developed from the work
of Martin Primack (1962). Given the form of the
data, we were restricted to the construction of
reproduction cost figures. Fishlows (1965, 1966)
estimates of railroad investment also rest on
physical data, as do       our estimates for the
telegraph industry.   In these cases, however, the
form of the data left open the possibility of
constructing book value series.      In order to
maintain consistency with most of the rest of the

work——and because we believed they would prove
more useful——we chose to produce reproduction cost

estimates instead.

     The capital stock figures, thus, consist
chiefly of net reproduction cost or market value
estimates, as Table 1 indicates. The assignment of

items to the reproduction cost category in that
table is sure, but the same cannot be said of the
estimates referred to as "market value." For a
number of these, the valuation may, in fact, refer

to   net    reproduction   cost.   The    practical

distinctions between these two types of measures
on the dates to which the capital stock estimates
refer, however, are unlikely to be very important,

for reasons previously given.

      All   of   the data——including the federal
censu.s data——underwent considerable processing and
                                                 23

testing during the construction of the estimates.
The estimating and testing notes are much too
extensive to be included here.       Some general
statements of appraisal can be ventured, however.
      The evidence is considerably weaker for 1840
and 1870 than for the other census dates. The 1840

census provided much less comprehensive wealth
data than did the censuses in subsequent years
(although with respect to the trade sector it was

unusually helpful). Also, prices fell dramatically
across that census year, which means that it is
very important to date the available evidence
correctly. We cannot be absolutely sure that we
have done so.    The census dragged on for an
inordinate length of time, so that the dating of
census magnitudes is problematical. We also were
obliged to depend heavily on the work of Ezra
Seaman (1852), who was not always entirely clear
as to his valuation base. The 1870 census came at
a difficult time, and it is widely believed that
Southern wealth was badly returned (Ransom and
Sutch, 1975). Nonetheless, it must be said that
the results of the perpetual inventory tests for
these two dates do not impugn the stock estimates.
Of course the test is particularly difficult to
run for 1840 and 1870, and the results must be
regarded as particularly chancy.    Still, it is
                                                           24

moderately reassuring that the stock and flow
estimates are at least as consistent at these
dates as at any others in our series.°
         The test for 1880 is less successful.             It

suggests        that   our   stock estimates       at    that

date——for both equipment and improvements——may be
tc'o low. These are matters to which I will return,
below.     It is perhaps sufficient to say here that
the capital stock figures are much more likely to
tell an accurate story of the long—term rate of
growth and structural changes of the capital stock

than of the decade—to—decade changes, and this is
particularly true after 1860.



Constant Price Series



         The best capital stock deflators available
are to be found among the price index numbers
assembled by Dorothy Brady (1966)                to deflate
components of the GNP. The Brady indexes are the
best for several reasons:              they are true price
index     numbers      of    capital     goods    (including

structures); they are available in considerable
detail; they were constructed with careful regard
to      their      theoretical    meaning;       and    their

theoretical meaning makes them reasonably apt
deflatars for capital stock series valued in terms
                                                     25
of reproduction cost or market value (see also
Brady, 1964). They are not perfect, but, in the
absence of     price   data for old capital, they are as
close to perfection as can be had. They are linked

price    indexes describing,         in principle,   the

movement      of   the prices of capital goods of
unchanging quality.          If    the economy were in
equilibrium in all the relevant years, such that
market prices and reproduction costs of new goods
were identical, and if the prices of new and old
goods moved closely together over time (i.e. the
interest rate was the same at each relevant date
and the rate of obsolescence was unchanging), then

deflation of capital stock estimates valued in
market prices or net reproduction costs would
yield a cc'nstant price series expressed in net
reproduction costs. That is, it would produce a
series in which each element measured the net
reproduction cost of the capital stock, given the
factor prices and techniques of producing capital
goods of the base year. Of course these conditions

were surely not met:         I have already pointed out

that    the   interest rate changed, affecting the
relative       magnitudes     of    market   value   and

reproduction cost. Nonetheless, the constant price

capital stock series approximates more nearly to a
reproduction cost series than it does to any other
                                                                   26

coherent concept.       I    will treat          it    as such,
therefore, throughout the rest of this paper.
         While the Brady inde>es were the chief
deflators we used, other price data figure in
important ways in the construction of the constant

price     capital   stock     series.      Some        important

components of the capital stock were built up bY
placing values      on counts        of     capital goods,
described      in   physical      terms.              In   these

cases-—improvements to agricultural land
(structures apart), railroads, the telegraph, farm
animal     inventories, crop inventories—-constant
price estimates could be made directly from the
evidence on physical counts and base year prices,
and we      could   be sure that           the series         so

constructed were true reproduction cost series, or

very close thereto.         Inventories of manufactured
goods and imports were deflated with price indexes

germane to the types of products incorporated in
these inventories, drawn from sources other than
the Brady papers        (Gallinan,        l960        Historical

Statistics, 1960, series U-34, E-l, E—70).
         The Brady indexes refer to the census years
(beginning on June 1 of the years ending in 9 and
ending on May 31 of the years ending in zero)
before the Civil War, and to calendar years ending
in 9 after the Civil War. The current year capital

refer to June 1 of the years ending in zero. I was

therefore obliged to adjust the Brady indexes on
the basis of other available price data, to make
them conform to the appropriate dates. Gaps in the

coverage      of   the Brady   indexes   were   filled

similar ly.

      There are both conceptual and substantive
differences between the old Gailman—Howle capital
stock estimates and the new ones reported on in
this paper. The conceptual differences are the
more important.
      When Howle and I estimated the value of
property employed in agriculture we decided to
extract from the value of agricultural land (and
to list separately) the value of agricultural
structures1 but to treat all other agricultural
improvements as part of the value of land,     We

wanted to be able to link our series with series
extending into the twentieth century, and we
believed that this treatment of agricultural land
and   improvements would bring our work       into

conceptual alignment with the twentieth century
estimates.11   When I came back to this work I
decided that a second set of estimates should be
made, in which all land improvements are treated
as capital, as of course they are. These estimates

would go to make up a capital stock series roughly
corresponding, conceptually, with the GNPII series
                                                             29
of my paper in Volume 30 of Studies in Income and
Wealth (Galiman, 1966). For purposes of analyzing
nineteenth century developments, the GNPII series
is certainly more appropriate than the GNPI
series; similarly,          the broader capital stock
series would be superior fQr these purposes to the

narrower one.

         I made estimates of the reproduction cost of

clearing arid breaking farm land, fencing it, and
draining and irrigating it, all of these estimates
based on the work of Martin Primack (1962), as I
have previously indicated. The value of fences was

taken net of capital consumption. Retirements were
deducted from the other items, but no allowance
was made for capital consumption, on the ground
that normal maintenance would prevent physical
deterioration of these improvements. Clearly some
deduction in value should have been made to
account for the deterioration of improvements on
land withdrawn from production but               not   yet

returned,        for    census purposes, as unimproved
(i,e, retired), but I could devise no system for

making    this    type of adjustment.     The improvements

estimates         are     therefore     almost   certainly

overstated, as compared with the values recorded
                                                           30
for other elements of the capital stock.             How
 important this matter may be,          I   do not know,
although I doubt that it is of great importance.

         Farm improvements (exclusive of structures)
constituted a very large part of the capital
stock, but        a     part that declined in relative
importance as time passed. Thus roughly six—tenths
of the agricultural capital stock consisted of
these improvements in the years 1840 and 1850, a
fraction that fell to less than half, iii current

prices, in 1900, and something over one half, in
constant prices.          The fraction of total domestic
capital accounted for bY these improvements fell
from between three and a half and four—tenths in
1840, to just over one—tenth in 1900 (see Table
2).      It should be clear, then, that the new
Galiman—Howle capital stock series, inclusive of
improvements, is substantially larger than the old
one, and exhibits a substantially lower rate of
growth. These are matters to which I will return
below.

         As I have already indicated, I also made a
number of substantive changes to the old Gailman
and Howle series.          So far as the current price
series are concerned, the chief changes are as
follows:      I       substituted Weiss's estimates of
government buildings for the very preliminary

estimates Howle and         I    originally used (Weiss,
l967; I changed the original animal inventory
estimates, making them more comprehensive (Howle
and     I    had originally       included   only     Tflature

animals); I altered the est imates of
non—agricultural residences and trade capital for
1870,       the    adjustments    resting    on     evidence
unavailable to Howle and me when we built up our
original series; i improved the price indexes for
shipping and railroad capital, which affected only
the current price series, since the constant price

series were estimated directly from data on
physical capital. On balance, these changes are
small so far as the Years 1840, 1850, 1860, and
1880 are concerned: in these years the new and
old12 national wealth series are within one and a

half percent of each other, once allowances are

made for differences in coverage between the two
series.13         In the remaining three years, the
margins are much wider: about 8 1/2 percent in
1870, and about 4 percent in 1890 and 1900, the
new estimates being below the old in each year.
For 1890 and 1900, the principal explanation lies
in the changes I have made in the price indexes
used to convert         the constant price railroad
improvments series into current prices.
Originally, Howle and I had used Ulmers (1960)
                                                            33
index, despite Fishlow's (1965, 1966) warning that

the price series incorporated therein and the
weights attached to them made the index inadequate
for our purposes.      I have now replaced this index
bY a new one, in which I have considerably greater
confidence.14

       The new railroad improvements price index
and the new price index for vessels in the
merchant marine and fi!hng fleets also affected
the 1870 estimates, making the new ones lower than
the old ones. Much more important however, is the
fact that I have now re—worked the 1870 estimates

of nan—farm residences and of the capital of the
"trade" sector (the "other industrial" sector, in

Kuznetss (1946) terminology). The new estimates
were adopted as the result of tests based on
evidence supplied by Lee Soltow (1975), evidence
that was not available to Howle and me when we
constructed     our    original     series.    The    new

estimating procedures are very much stranger than
the old ones were, and a test              for internal
consistency provides strong support             for   the

results. Nonetheless one cannot be sure that the
new estimates are actually closer to the truth
than were the old ones. Both sets depend upon data

from   a      census    that      under-enumerated    the

population, and probably undercounted property as
                                                       34

well (Ransom and Sutch, 1975).. Since the new
estimates are lower than the old ones, it may very
well be that they reflect the true value of the
relevant property less accurately than do the old
estimates, despite the fact that they rest on
technically superior procedures.

         Some, but not all, of the changes in the
current price series, described above, affect the
const-nt price series as well.     I also made a few
small alterations in those constant price series
that were built up from counts of physical capital

(e.g. the railroads). More important is the fact
that I made some adjustments to the price index
numbers. Howle and I received many of the price
indexes we used in correspondence with Dorothy
Brady.     In a few cases, Dr. Brady subsequently
revised her figures.    Howle and I also used the
Brady indexes without adjustment, although, in
fact, they did not refer to precisely the dates we

required (see the discussion of this point above).
When I returned to the estimates, I corrected the

price indexes, so that they reflected Dr. Brady's
last word on the subject and so that the indexes
were more nearly relevant to the dates to which
the   censuses refer.    The principal     changes,
substantively, were to raise the 1840 estimates of

agricultural buildings and non-farm residences,
                                                     35
and to   lower the estimates of machinery and
equipment in manufacturing, 1890 and 1900, and the
"trade" sector, 1870—1900.   Of these alterations,
the ones referring to 1840 are most doubtful.   In

these cases I was obliged to build up new price
indexes for structures to replace an index number
abandoned bY Dr. Brady.   It may very well be that

my new indexes——based, as they are, on materials
prices and wage rates——actually understate the
price levels of structures in l840. If that is
the case, using these indexes to deflate the 1840
values may have produced an over—statement of
constant price values in that year. However, all
the tests I have run so far suggest that this has

not happened. On balance, the changes I have made
in the constant price series have not been of
overwhelming quantitative significance (in no year
do they amount to more than 10 percent of the
value of the domestic capital stock), but they are
far from negligible, and since the adjustment for
1840 is in an upward direction, and the ones for
l870—l90C' in a downward direction, the rates of
long—term growth are lower when computed with the
new series than when computed with the old one,
even when the two series are put on the same
conceptual basis.
                                                         36
      The old series,       expressed    in   constant

prices, was never published, but a set of index
numbers based on it appeared in American

Economic Growth: An Economist's History of the

United States (Davis, Easterlin,, Parker et al.,
1972). These index numbers provide the best bases
for comparing the old with the new series.

      The comparisons can be made with data in
Table 3, which show that the new series describe
lower long—term rates of growth than do the old
(Panels A and C). The disparities are the wider

when the new series, inclusive of all farm land

improvements (Variant A in the table), is compared

with the old series. That is reasonable
enough,    in view of the conceptual difference
between the two series and the well known fact
that the agricultural sector grew at a slower
pace, over the last six decades of the century,
than did the rest of the economy. But even when
the conceptual difference is removed——the Variant
B series     is   substituted   for   the Variant A
series——the new estimates exhibit somewhat lower
long—term rates of growth than do the old. The
margins are not great, however——less than half a
percentage point in every case, an adjustment of
less than one—tenth in each of the long—term rates
of growth. The data on the decadal rates of growth

show, moreover, that in only two
decades——1840—1850 and 1860—1870——are the
disparities in growth rates at all wide (Panel B).
These are the decadal growth rates that are
affected bY the major estimating changes described
above, of course.       It should also be pointed out
that the new and old series exhibit the same
patterns of change over time, the rate of growth
rising from 1840—1850 to 1850—1860, falling to
1860—1870,     rising     again   to   1870—1880   and

1880—1890, and finally falling to 1890—1900.

         On the whole1 then, the new series differ
from the old in important respects, but once
allowance is made for differences in concept and
coverage, they appear to tell roughly the same
story with respect to the rate of growth of the
capital stock.     (The subject is treated further,

There were also a good many sectoral estimates for

the late nineteenth century, deriving from a major

Since then the research of Soltow (1975) and Weiss

(1967) has provided additional materials that I
have found helpful.
      Howle and I began with Kuznets's National

Product since 1869 (1946), which provided us with
the framework within which we have subsequently
worked.    The volume contains very detailed
estimates, together with full descriptions of
estimating procedures. Our idea was to modify
Kuznets's estimates in light of the work: that had

come forward since National Product since 1869 was

published, and to extend the           estimates to the
years 1840, 1850, 1860, and 1870. The Goldsmith
                                                      41
(1952) estimates for 1850, while available in less
detail, were to serve as an ante—bellum benchmark.

      The extent to which the new Gallman-Howle
series now deviate from the Kuznets and Goldsmith
estimates is exhibited in Table 4.       It will be
seen that     in the cases of fixed reproducible
capital in farming, street railroads, shipping,
canals, river improvements, and pipelines and in
the cases of inventories of farm livestock and
monetary metals,    the differences are slight (in
the cases of street railroads and pipelines there
are none at all).       For the rest, there are
substantial differences.   As they relate to the
Kuznets and Gailman—Howle estimates, they tend to
cancel out, so that the values of aggregate fixed
reproducible capital fall within ten percent of
each other in each year, the K:uznets figures being

the higher.     The net gaps between the Goldsmith
and the new Gailman—Howle estimates are wider and
they also run in opposite directions in 1850 and
the later years,      Thus the Goldsmith series
describes a substantially higher rate, of growth
across the nineteenth century than does the
Gailman—Howle series, even when differences of
concept and coverage are eliminated.'6

     The differences between our work and that of
Goldsmith and Kuznets have emerged in part because
                                                        42

we had available evidence unavailable to them, in
part because we have interpreted some of the
evidence available to all of us in a new way, and
in part because we have adopted, here and there,
different concepts. In the cases of the estimates
relating to agriculture, the "other industrial"
(or "trade") sector, non—farm residences, steam
railroads, telephones, canals and river
improvements, electric power and light,
irrigation, tax—exempt property, and international
claims, we were the beneficiaries of substantial
amounts of research that came forward only after
Goldsmith and Kuznets had published.        We did a
certain amount of new research particularly with
respect to inventories and the telegraph, and we
worked     out   new interpretations   of   existing

evidence in a number of places, notably in the
cases of mining and manufacturing (we believe that

rented real estate was inadvertently left out of
Kuznetss manufacturing estimates). Finally, in a
number of cases (e.g., steam railroads, the
telegraph) we chose to substitute estimates of net

reproduction cost for bool.:: value.

         In summary, then, the new Gallman—Howle
capital stoci.:: estimates are net of retirements and

net of capital consumption. While a few of the
components (current prices) are expressed in book
                                                             43

values, most are in     market prices        or    in net
reproduction costs. Conceptually, the new series
differ importantly from the old        substantively1
somewhat less. The substantive differences between

the new series and the Goldsmith and Kuznets
nineteenth century series are wide enough. that one

might   anticipate   that   accounts    of        economic

structure and change based on the new series would
offer an element of novelty It is to this matter
that I now turn.

Rates of Growth

      To say that the nineteenth century U.S.
capital stock increased rapidly or slowly is to
mal.::e a comparative statement. It is to say that

the stod:: increased rapidly or slowly compared to
other times-—earlier or later——or to other places.

So far as earlier times are concerned, Alice
Jones's (1980) wealth data for 1774 and my own
figures for the early part of the nineteenth
century would provide bases              for   a     relevant

comparison.      But my own estimates for the early
part o-f the century are not quite ready to be put
to this use and I am therefore obliged to defer
this matter.

     There is no reason to defer consideration of

subsequent     i.t-e-us,   however.   Raymond Goldsmith's
recent extension of his estimates to 1980 provides

us with data covering virtually                the     entire

twentieth century (Goldsmith, 1982).               These data
                                                                         45
differ from the Goldsmith series discussed in the
previous section. The latter consisted chiefly of
census—style estimates, whereas the twentieth
century      series were          built       up    bY     perpetual
inventory      procedures.         In     concept,         the     new
Gallman-Howle Variant B estimates are virtually
identical         to. Goldsmith's         twentieth         century
series.17 Where the two overlap--at 1900--they are
also      substantively       quite           similar.           Where

differences of detail appear, aggregating up to
the next relevant level virtually removes them.
For    example,      the    estimates          of     agricultural
structures and equipment differ,                      in   the two
series,      in     1900,    but        the        sums    of      the

two——agr icultural fixed capital——are virtually
identical.        The same is true with respect to
non—farm rsidential land and non-farm residential
structures.18 Thus the two series link together
reasonably well, providing coverage for a period
of 140 years, the link being particularly good at
the level of what I have called domestic wealth
(see Section 1, above). Here, however, I will be
comparing Goldsmith's domestic capital series with
the Galiman—Howle national capital series.                        For

present      purposes,      the     consequences           of     the

conceptual and substantive differences between the
series are trivial.
      According to Goldsmith, domestic capital 46
(reproducible tangible assets, narrow definition),
in current prices, increased at an average annual
rate of 5.79 percent between 1901 and 1929, 5.00
percent between 1930 and 1953, and 8.20 percent
between 1954 and l80. These are, on the whole,
higher rates of change than are exhibited bY the
Gallman—Howle series over     similarly extended
periods (see Table 5), and this is true whether
one looks at the Variant A or the Variant 9
series. The explanation, lies in the price

history of the two centuries. While prices rose
and fell dramatically in both the nineteenth and
twentieth centuries, the long—term drift in the

former period was neither powerfully upward nor
powerfully downward.    That is not true of the
twentieth century, however. Prices moved strongly

upward,   on average,   between 1901    and 1929,
1930—1953, and 1953—1980. Thus, deflating on the
base 1929, one finds that the real capital stock
increased at rates of only 3.60 percent, 1.68
percent, and 3.60 percent, in the three periods,
lower than most of the rates exhibited in Table
l9 Over the full sweep of the years 1900 through
1980, the current price series rose 6.36 percent
per year, on average, while the corstant price
series increased only 2.80 percent, the former.

lower than the long—term nineteenth century rates

real national product (Gallman, 1966).

      By     the   standard     of   twentieth century
experience, the capital stock grew rapidly
between 1840 and 1900. My guess is that further
work will show that it also grew rapidly by the
standard of what had gone before. But what of the
third standard mentioned above that of experience
in other places?     I am not yet in a position to
make meaningful direct comparisons of this type,
but a fairly obvious indirect one can be made. We
know that the U.S. real national product increased

between the 1830's and 1900 at an exceptionally
high rate, the judgment resting on observations
for   many     countries      (Galiman,    1966;   Davis,

Easterlin, Parker et al., 1972, Cl,. 2). Unless the

rates of change of capital stocks and national
products     diverged      widely——which     is    highly

improbable——the U.S. capital stock must also have

grown rapidly, compared with experience elsewhere.
That means that the U.S. capital stock was
probably a relatively young one, with a high
                                                          51
proportion of the stock embodying best—practice
techniques (Galiman (1978)).

         In fact, the data of Table 5 show that the
capital stock actually grew faster           than the
national product, in both current and constant
prices, in both variants, over long periods and
over most of the short periods identified in the
table.     That fact •has a rather important set of
implications. But before considering them, it will
pay us to look at other aspects of the evidence in
the table.

         Rates of change of both Variants A and B of
the capital stock are contained in Table 5.          It

will be observed that the rates of change of the
Variant B series are always at least as large as
the rates of change of the Variant A series, and
usually larger. One should recall that the Variant
A series includes investment in agricultural land
clearing,     fencing,    and   the   construction   of

drainage and irrigation ditches, while the Variant
B series does not. The Variant A series grew the
more slowly because this component of the capital
stock increased at a below—average pace. This, in
turn, was a consequence both of the fact that the
value of improvements of this type (measured in
reproduction     costs)    constituted   a   declining
fraction of the value of the agricultural capital
                                                        52

stock (in both current and constant prices), and
of the fact that the agr icultural
sector——including the capital stock thereof——grew
more slowly than the rest of the economy.         The

former development reflected both a slowing in the
rate (percentage) at which agricultural land was
being added to the stock and the continued high
rates of increase of the stocks of agricultural
structures and equipment, particularly the latter.

Agriculture was becoming more highly mechanized.
      A   second   feature of     the    table worth
remarking is that the rates of growth recorded
therein exhibit,    on   the    whole,   a   downward

long—term movement. This is true of both of the
GNP series, in current and constant prices, both
of the capital series, in current prices, and the
Variant B series, in constant prices. The Variant
A series, in constant prices, is only a moderate'

exception.   It exhibits lower rates of growth for
the periods 1860—1900 and 1870—1900 than for
1840—1860, which makes it consistent with the
Variant B and GNP series, but if the peribd is
broken into three equal lengths, the Variant A

series shows equal. rates of growth for 1840—1850
and 1880—1900, the rate for the period 1860—1880
being considerably lower. This is the one bit of
evidence running against a conclusion of general
                                                            53

retardation in rates of growth across the latter
part of the nineteenth century. The exception is
not a very important one, however, in view of the
reservations expressed above concerning the 1880
capital stock figure.        If the estimate for that
date    is,    indeed,   biased   downward,    then    an

appropriate adjustment would remove this one
exception to the general finding of retardation in
the rates of growth of the GNP and the capital
stock, a development begun in the nineteenth
century and continued in the twentieth.

        A third piece of information emerging from
the table is that the decade—to—decade variations
in the rates of growth of the GNP and the capital
stock    are    reasonably    consistent.     Thus    the

long—swing boom of the 1850's clearly emerges from
the record provided bY Table 5, rates of growth
rising above the levels attained in the 1840's
(exception: the current price GNP Variant B
series), while the rates of change of all series
drop sharply in the Civil War decade, l860_l870.20

Between 1870 and 1880 the rates of change of the
current price series continue to fall, reflecting
the price deflation of the period, while the rates

of change of the real series all rise.           All of
these variations are reassuring. They correspond
to what one might have expected, from a
                                                       54

knowledge of the qualitative history of the period
and of quantitative studies of a micro variety. It

is also reasonable to expect the rates of change
of the GNP and capital stock series to move
together as they do. These features of the table
thus enhance one's confidence in the capital stock
series, but (necessarily) offer no new insights

into the period.
      The consistency in the movements of the
rates of change of the two sets of series ends
with 1880. Thereafter, the rate of growth of the
GNP series, expressed in constant prices, falls.
persistently, while the rate, of growth of the
current price series falls and, then rises. The
rates of change of the current and constant price
stock series follow neither. of these patterns,
rising betwen 1880 and 1890, and falling between

1890 arid 1900.     Thus the variations in the rates

of growth of the GNP and capital stock series
diverge across the last two decades of the
century. Once again, if the capital stock estimate
for 1880 is, indeed, too low, adjusting it might
bring the patterns of change of the two series
more nearly into line.



Sources of Growth
                                                               55

       Finally, the data in Table 5 offer the
opportunity to re—work the "sources of              growth"
calculations that I derived on the basis of the
old Gailman and Howleseries and presented on two
earlier occasions (Davs, Parker, Easterlin et
al., (1982); Gallman (1980)). The results of            this
reworking, together with the old figures, appear
in Table 6,      In making my revisions I have left
everything unchanged from the earlier set of
calculations, with the following exceptions:              in

the case of the new calculations based on the
Variant B series, I re—computed the contributions
of the capital stock and productivity; in the case
of   the new calculations based on the Variant A
series,     I   re-computed     the     contributions    of

capital,    productivity, and land.        The Variant B
series is conceptually identical             to the old
Gallman—Howle series, it will be recalled.           It was

therefore possible to substitute            it    into the
calculations without       changing anything else,
except, of      course,   for    the contribution        of

productivity change to economic growth.               Since

productivity change is taken as a residual, the
introduction of       a   new capital       stock    series
necessarily produced changes in the productivity
figures. The Variant A series differs conceptually

from      the   old   Gallman     and     Howle     series,
                                                                        56

Table 6 (continued)

Sources: All of these figures, except the ones labelled "Land Supply,
          Var. A," "Capital Stock, Var A and B," and "Productivity,
          Var. A and B," were taken from Davis, Easterlin, Parker, et al.,
           1972 ,   Table 2.12, and Gailman (1980), Tables 1 and 2
          underlying them or were computed from these tables or their
          underlying data.

         The "Productivity" figures in Panel A were taken as residuals.

         The data in Panel A labelled "Capital Stock, Var. A and B"

         were derived by weighting rates of change with appropriate

         income share weights. The rates of change were taken from
         Table 5, above, (in the case of Panel A, Part I) or were

         computed by subtracting the rate of change of
         population from the rate of change in Table 5 (in the case of
         Panel A, Part II). The income share weight for the Variant
         B series (.19) was taken from the notes to Table 2.12 of Davis,

         Easterljn, Parker et al. (1972). The income share weight for
         the Variant A capital serie.s (.26) was computed by raising the

         Variant B weight in the same proportion as the Variant A capital
         stock figure (current prices) exceeds the Variant B

         figure, in 1860. The average annual rate of change of the
         Variant A land supply figure was computed from Historical

         Statistics (1960) ,   Series K-2, .1850—1900. The incOme
         share weight (.06) was computed by subtracting the capital
         stock weight (.26) from the sum of the land and capital stock

         weights (.32) employed for the Variant B calculations.

series leads to the conclusion that productivity
change accounted for almost six-tenths of the
growth of per capita N.N.P. in the nineteenth
century. This is lower than the figure recorded
for the twentieth century (almost eight—tenths),
but is by no means low. Theterm "productivity"
covers, of course, the influences of a multitude
of forces operating on c'utput. Perhaps a more
meaningful way to put the conclusion is to say
that the calculations in Table 6 (Variant A)
assign to the factor inputs narrowly defined,
responsibility for only a little more than two—
fifths of the increase in per capita real national

product across the last six decades of the
nineteenth century.     The role of other forces,
therefore, cannot be regarded as small.



Capital/Output Ratios


      The capital stock increased faster than the
national product, according to the data of Table
5.   This means that the capital/output ratio was

rising;   the economy was engaged         in capital
deepening. Table 7 is organized to describe this
process. The data leave something to be desired
because, for the period before the Civil War, the
ratios depend upon data referring to individual
                                                                     61

Years. The ratios, therefore, are influenced by
events peculiar to these Years and may not be
fully representative of the period, 1840—1860. The

post—war estimates are less susceptible to this
criticism, since the national product data are
decade averages, centered roughly on the Years to
which the capital stock figures refer (see the
notes to the table). One should remember, also,
that the estimates are not equally reliable; those

for 1840, 1870, and 1880 rest on capital

stock data that are probably less strong than the
data for the other years. Differences in ratios
between one Year and the next should not be given
undue importance.         It is the general drift of the
ratios that should be the focus of our interest.

        The aggregate capital/output ratios (first
two columns) do, in fact, rise over time, and this

is true of both the Variant A and Variant B
series, in current and: constant prices. The
Variant A ratios are much larger than the Variant
B ratios,         indicating      the    great     quantitative
significance        of      the   component        of      capital

consisting of farm land clearing, fencing, etc.
(see,     also,     the     fourth      column),        components
included in Variant A, but not Variant B.                      The

Variant A ratios also rise less rapidly than the
Variant     B     ratios,      reflecting        the    declining
                                                            63


capital, accounting for over two—thirds of the
value of the stock in constant prices, by 1900
their share had      fallen   to about a third. Machinery

and equipment, composing barely one—twentieth of
the stock (constant prices) in 1840, were over
one—quarter of the stock in 1900. Accompanying the

capital deepening there was, then, a substantial
re—shaping of the stoci.::, with new forms of capital

rising to prominence.
      The last four columns of the table also
throw some light on the nature of the decline in
the capital/output ratio between 1860 and 1875.
Changes in the ratios of inventories, equipment,
and "other improvements" to output clearly are not

responsible. The first rose moderately, in both
current and constant prices, whereas the other two

either changed very little (equipment, in current

prices),     or     rose   vigorously    (equipment,   in

constant prices; "other improvements," in constant

prices "other improvements", in current prices).
But the ratio of "farm improvements" to GNP
declined very sharply (especially in current
prices) and played a major role in the observed
capital shallowing for the economy as a whole.
This development may reflect the effects of the
Civil War.        In the South, some improved land was
allowed to return to nature during the War, while
                                                                65




American balance      of   trade.   In     any   case,   this
 phenomenon also played a role in the decline of the
 capital/output ratio between 1860 and 1875 (Williamson,
1974).

       An indication of the importance of this matter is
easily obtained. The sum of the ratios in the last four
columns of the table in each Year approximates the
Variant A ratio of domestic capital to GNP.              The
difference between this sum and the value in the first
column measures the effec.t of net claims on foreigners

on the national capital/output ratio. The sums and the
entries from column for 1860 and 1875 are as follows:



          Current Prices            Constant Prices
                    Column (1)
                    __________      Sum           Column(1)
1860      2.89      2.87            2.95          2.92
1875      2.77      2.59            2.94          2.80



The sums are almost identical with the first column
values in 1860, but much larger thanthe first
column values in 1875. More to the point, in
constant prices the sums are almost the same in

the two years, while in current prices the 1875

sum is only moderately below the 1860 sum. The
decline in the aggregate national capital/output
ratio, then, reflects both changes in the

capital/output ratios computed from the former
will show less tendency to rise over time than
will capital/output ratios computed from the
latter. That must be borne in mind when Tables 7
and 8 are compared.22

      I begin with three sectors: agriculture;
mining, manufacturing and hand trades; all other
private business. The estimates forthese sectors
are relatively strong (that is, compared with the
estimates on which the other ratios in the table
depend), the capital and value added estimates are

independent, in each case, and the sectors are
sufficiently broad so that one can hope for a
modicum of stability in the ratios.

      All of the series, e>cept for agriculture,
Variant A, show quite pronouncedupward movements
over time.   The Variant A series shows no very
clear trend, in either current or constant prices.

The Variant B series and the ratios for the "all
other private business" sector rise strongly
before the Civil War, flatten out between 1860 and

1880, and then rise again strongly, while the
"mining, manufacturing, and hand trades, sector
exhibits a ratio that neither rises nor falls"
bef6re the War, but increases strongly from 1860
to 1900, in both current and constant prices.   It

would be fair to say, then, that the upward
                                                      73


residences, farm and non—farm. Since the capital
stock series do not distinguish farm residences, I

was obliged to include all farm buildings in the
numerator, which means that all of the ratios for
this sector are biased upward. Furthermore, the
denominator was initially estimated on the basis
of capital stock data (see Galimari and Weiss,
(1969)), although not the capital stock data
appearing in the numerators of these ratios. Thus
the ratios cannot be taken very seriously.        I


include them for the sake of completeness arid
because the data do figure, in another form1 in
Table 7, and the reader is therefore entitled to
know something about them.

      Whether or riot the estimating procedures
were proper (for the purpose of measuring the
capital/output ratio), the relationships obtained
between value added and the capital stock of the
"residences" sector are plausible. Reversing the
ratios and adding land to residential capital, we
have estimates of the rate of return (gross) to
residential property.   The computed rate follows
fairly closely the pattern of the interest rate
(at least from 1860 onward), a result which might
have been anticipated on theoretical grounds. Thus

at' least the value added and capital stoci.:: data

for this sector seem consistent.
                                                                  75

the data exclude certain types of capital.                  But

that is certainly not all there is to it.                   The

residential        and      transportation       and     public
utilities sectors were,             in fact, more capital
intensive than were the secondary sectors, far
example.      Since the structure of the economy was
changing in important ways, the level of the
aggregate capital/output ratio may have been
influenced bY the shifting relative importance of
the various sectors. Lines 6 (a)—(d) and 7(a)—(d)
were computed to help settle that issue. The lines

contain various weighted average capital/output
ratios, sets of calculations appearing for both
Variant A and B estimates, and for both all
sectors     and      all        except   the     questionable
"residences" sector. .          In one set of calculations
(6(a) and (b); 7(a) and (b)), sectoral value added

weights     were         held     constant     and     sectoral

capital/output ratios were allowed to vary over
time; in the other (6(c) and (d); 7(c) and (d)),
capital/output ratios were held constant, while
value added weights were allowed to change over
time.     The first set of calculations shows the
effects of rising sectorl ratios on the aggregate
ratio, no allowance being made for the effects of

structural changes.             In the second set, only
                                                                77


change that worked against the downward movement
of the overall ratio was the growing relative size

of the transportation and public utilities sector,

with its exceptionally large capital/output ratio.
  All    of     these structural          developments were
inter—related: all were part                of the general
process of modernization, which consisted of the
transfer of economic activities into the orbit of

the market, increasing specialization and trade,
and the movement of information and goods over
longer distances and at faster rates,

        While    these     structural       changes had    no

pronounced direct          effect    on     the   depreciable

capital/output ratio,24 they did influence the
means bY which the capital stoci.:: was assembled. In

the ante bellum years, almost half of                     the

depreciable      capital     stock        (constant   prices)

consisted of agricultural land improvements, many
of them created by family labor, or the labor
attached to the plantation on which they were
constructed, or bY other local sources of labor.
These works were typically carried out in the off
season--in the spaces in •the agricultural year
when there were no pressing tasks——e.g., planting

or harvesting—-associated with the growing crops.
Little external finance was required to carry them
out.    But the structural changes of modernization

                 Col (3):
                 _______         The numerators from Col(2) plus capital consumption, the latter estimated

                                 at 10% of the value of machinery and equipment and 4% of the value of

                                 improvements (exclusive of farm land clearing,etc.).   These estimates
                                 approximate straight-line capital consumption on the assumptions that

                                 machinery and equipment had a useful life of 15 years and that the

commodities and services 'to consumers (1839—48,
1849—58, etc., Galiman, 1960,    P.   27) to form
estimates of net product (Table 9, Cols (1), (2),
and (4)). This procedure does not result in useful
estimates   if   current   price stock data, are
employed; thus the estimates in Table 9 all rest
on constant price data.       It should be said,
however, that even the constant price estimates
leave something to be desired, in view of the
moderately ambiguous conceptual character of the
stock estimates (see Section 2, above).

      In the second procedure, net investment
flows are estimated bY subtracting from gross
investment flows (Galiman, 1960, p. 34) the value
of capital consumption (Table 9, Col (5)).      The

latter can be estimated from the capital stock
data, given estimates of the average age and
useful life of the various components of the
depreciable capital stock. The flow data are of
such a character that investment proportions can
be estimated for     depreciable capital.     Given
estimates of capital consumption,     it    is also
possible to generate gross investment shares, in
which the measurement of gross investment depends
exclusively on stock data (Table 9, Col (3), Ccl,
(6)). Of course gross share estimates can also be
made directly from the flow data (Table 9, Col
                                                          83
from the flow data (Col (5)) than from the stock
data (Cols (1), (2), and (4)), however, and from
the measures incorporating a narrow definition of
capital (Cols (2) and, particularly, (4)) than
from the ones based on a broad definition (Col
       27
(1))

       The   increase     in   the   net    investment

proportion   required an even more pronounced
increase in the gross investment proportion (Cols
(3), (6) and (7)).      The explanation is not far to

seek: the rising depreciable capital/output ratio
meant that, ceteris paribus, the share of capital
consumption in national product was rising.         But

other things were riot,        in fact,    equal:   the

structure of the depreciable capital stock was
changing,    the     shorter—lived   machinery      and

equipment increasing in importance relative to the

longer—lived improvements. This structural change
increased the share of national product accounted

for by capital consumption.

       These two developments meant that the share
of the GNP (concept adopted by Gailman (1960))
accounted for      bY gross investment more than
doubled between the 1840's and 1890's.       One must

further remember that the forms of investment and
their relationships with the market were changing.

        Section 4 constitutes a brief precis of some of the
main results derivable from the         new capital stock
series. Limitations of space and competence prevent me
from adding to them and showing more clearly th plac!
of capital in nineteenth century history.        As I have
indicated previously,       I   have been concerned here
chiefly to introduce the new series, to explain their

pedegrees and character, and to show the principal
conclusions to which I have been drawn as a result of

mulling them over and comparing them with          related
variables,     I hope to write more füllyon these matters
later.     In the meantime, the task of introduction    is

fairly begun. Perhaps soon the series will be able to
go out into the world on their own where their rough
edges will be knocked off them in the give and take of
scholarly discussion.      Whether, when thi process is
over, they retain anything of use and "alue1 time will
tell.
                            FOOTNOTES


1,       This paper, however                is concerned
exclusively with the period l84O-19OO.


2.      The topics treated in Section 2 are of a
type that has been discussed at earlier meetings
of the Conference, See, in particular, Volumes 2,
12, 14, 19, 25, 29, and 45, and especially the
papers by Edward Denison, Raymond Goidsmith. 6imoi
Kuznets, Nancy and Richard Ruggies, and Dan Usher,
and the comments on them.



3.      The following discussion was developed with

fixed capital chiefly in mind, although it can
also     be made       to   apply to       inventories and
international claims, with two exceptions:                there
is no clear correspondence between uacuisitjon
cost'     and    any    single    system     of    inventory
accounting. For present purposes, that is not an
important matter, All inventories treated herein
are     valued   at     market    prices.     So    far     as

international claims are concerned, there is no
good counterpart of reproduction cost (other than
market price).
                                     3
 7,         I ignore here the problems posed by taxes
 and subsidies, problems of           modest dimensions
 through most of the nineteenth century.


8.      See3 also, Kuznetss objection3 voiced         in
his paper in Volume 2 of Studies in Income md
Wealth (1938),



9,      This is particularly true with respect to
the manufacturing sector, which was experjncing
e>traordinarily high rates of growth.


10.     That is, the fit for 1840 is as good as the
fit   for   1850 or 1860;   the fit for 1870 is at least
as good as the fit for 1880, 1890, or 1900.


11,    Following Kuznets (1946), we produced           a

separate set       of                         from the
agr I cult ural est imates-of i rr igat ian
improvements, which we treated as part of he
capital stock,



l2     For present purposes, the hold" series i
the one published in Gailman, 1965, which includes
some components of wealth (e.g,            inventories)
                                     5
 18,      These     results   were   worl::ed   out     ?,rom
 Goldsmith, Lipsey, arid Mendelsor,        (1963), Volume
 II, p 71, which is the source of the 1900 data in
 Goldsmith (1982).


 19.     It   is   well known that the deflationbas
 selected can affect the rate of change of            a real
 capital stock series, earlier bases            typically
 producing higher rates of growth than late one,
It     is therefore fortunate, for present purposes,
that the deflation bases of the two series being

considered here occupy similar relative          temporal
Positions. Thus the Goldsmith series is deflated
on the base 1929, 28 Years from the first Year in
the series and 51 from the last;         the Gallman and
Howle series, on 1860, 20 years from the first
Year in that series and 40 Years from the last.


20.     Throughout I use the dating scheme relevant
to the capital stock series (1840,          1850, etc.).
Notice that the GNP series is dated to different
Years than these, the disparity being Particularly
wide in the case of the first po.t—Cjvj1 War date.
See the notes to Table 5.

The reconciliation between the two series is by no

means perfect; the upward movement of the ratio
from 1879        to 1889 is more than negligible.
Nonetheless, the long—term trend is much reduced
in the second tabulation, as compared with the
first, and the variations from one year to the
next are not large, ic, the cortte>t of the obsqrv:ed

annual changes in GNP.


23.    If the measure of capital employed here had

included inventories, this result might have been
different.



24.    The      indirect   effects,       through changing
supply and demand conditions for capital goods,
constitute another matter. The rapid expansion in
the    stock     of   machinery   and      equipment,   for

example——a development that, we have seen, played
a role in the rise of the overall capital/output
ratio——was related to the revolutionary growth of
the industrial sector (mining, manufacturing, hand
trades).
