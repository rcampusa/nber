                                           ABSTRACT

Mutual fund managers may decide to deviate from a well-diversified portfolio and concentrate their
holdings in industries where they have informational advantages. In this paper, we study the relation
between the industry concentration and the performance of actively managed U.S. mutual funds from
1984 to 1999. Our results indicate that, on average, more concentrated funds perform better after
controlling for risk and style differences using various performance measures. This finding suggests
that investment ability is more evident among managers who hold portfolios concentrated in a few
industries.

Actively managed mutual funds are an important constituent of the financial sector.

Despite the well-documented evidence that, on average, actively managed funds

underperform passive benchmarks, mutual fund managers might still differ substantially

in their investment abilities.1 In this paper, we examine whether some fund managers

create value by concentrating their portfolios in industries where they have informational

advantages.

        Conventional wisdom suggests that investors should widely diversify their

holdings across industries to reduce their portfolios’ idiosyncratic risk. Fund managers,

however, might want to hold concentrated portfolios if they believe some industries will

outperform the overall market or if they have superior information to select profitable

stocks in specific industries. Consistent with this hypothesis, we would expect funds with

skilled managers to hold more concentrated portfolios. As a result, we should observe a

positive relation between fund performance and industry concentration.

        Mutual fund managers may also hold concentrated portfolios due to a potential

conflict of interest between fund managers and investors. Several studies indicate that

investors reward stellar performance with disproportionately high money inflows but do

not penalize poor performance equivalently.2 This behavior results in a convex option-

like payoff profile for mutual funds. Consequently, some managers, especially those with

Boudry (2004).

  Numerous studies have called attention to the nonlinearity in the performance-flow relation, for example,
Ippolito (1992), Gruber (1996), Chevalier and Ellison (1997), Goetzmann and Peles (1997), Sirri and



                                                 2
lower investment abilities, may have an incentive to adopt volatile investment strategies

to increase their chances of having extreme performance. Consistent with this hypothesis,

funds pursuing such gaming strategies would hold more concentrated portfolios. In this

case, we should not observe a positive relation between fund performance and industry

concentration.

        The literature analyzing the net returns of mutual funds documents that mutual

funds, on average, under-perform passive benchmarks by a statistically and economically

significant margin. However, several studies based on the gross returns of the portfolio

holdings of mutual funds conclude that managers who follow active investment strategies

have stock-picking abilities. For example, Grinblatt and Titman (1989, 1993); Grinblatt,

Titman, and Wermers (1995); Daniel, Grinblatt, Titman, and Wermers (DGTW 1997);

Wermers (2000); and Frank, Poterba, Shackelford, and Shoven (2004) find evidence that

mutual fund managers outperform their benchmarks based on the returns of fund

holdings.

        Coval and Moskowitz (1999, 2001) show that mutual funds exhibit a strong

preference for investing in locally headquartered firms where they appear to have

informational advantages. Nanda, Wang, and Zheng (2004) provide evidence that fund

families following more focused investment strategies across funds perform better, likely

due to their informational advantages. To further investigate the informational advantages

or investment abilities of mutual fund managers, we analyze in this paper whether some

fund managers can create value by holding portfolios concentrated in specific industries.


Tufano (1998), Del Guercio and Tkac (2002), and Nanda, Wang, and Zheng (2004).


                                             3
       Recent studies suggest the size of a fund affects its ability to outperform the

benchmark. In a theoretical paper, Berk and Green (2004) explain many stylized facts

related to fund performance using a model with rational agents. In their model, skilled

active managers do not outperform passive benchmarks after deducting expenses because

of a competitive market for capital provision combined with decreasing returns to scale in

active management. In a related empirical study, Chen, Hong, Huang, and Kubik (2002)

find that smaller funds tend to outperform larger funds due to diseconomies of scale.

While the size of the fund negatively affects its performance, it is possible that a wide

dispersion of holdings across many industries also may erode its performance. Our paper

investigates whether such diseconomies of scope have important implications for asset

management.

       This paper evaluates a fund’s performance conditioned upon its industry

concentration. The rationale for selecting industry concentration as the conditioning

variable is that skilled fund managers may exhibit superior performance by holding more

concentrated portfolios to exploit their informational advantages. To date, there has been

no research on whether portfolio concentration is related to fund performance.

       Using U.S. mutual fund data from 1984 to 1999, we construct portfolios of funds

with different industry concentration levels. We develop our measure, the Industry

Concentration Index, to quantify the extent of portfolio concentration in ten broadly

defined industries. This index is based on the difference between the industry weights of

a mutual fund and the industry weights of the total market portfolio. Our analysis

indicates that mutual funds differ substantially in their industry concentration and that



                                         4
concentrated funds tend to follow distinct investment styles. Managers of more

concentrated funds overweigh growth and small-cap stocks, whereas managers of more

diversified funds hold portfolios that closely resemble the total market portfolio.

       We find that more concentrated funds perform better after adjusting for risk and

style differences using the four-factor model of Carhart (1997). Mutual funds with above

median industry concentration yield an average abnormal return of 1.58% per year before

deducting expenses and 0.33% per year after deducting expenses, whereas mutual funds

with below median industry concentration yield an average abnormal return of 0.36%

before and -0.77% after expenses. We confirm the relation between fund concentration

and performance using panel regressions controlling for other fund characteristics. Using

the conditional measures of Ferson and Schadt (1996), we establish that the superior

performance of concentrated funds is not due to their greater responsiveness to macro-

economic conditions.

       To investigate the causes of the abnormal performance of concentrated portfolios,

we follow DGTW (1997) and measure the performance of mutual funds based on their

portfolio holdings using characteristic-based benchmarks. The results indicate that the

superior performance of concentrated mutual funds is primarily due to their stock

selection ability. Furthermore, we find that concentrated funds are able to select better

stocks even after controlling for the average industry performance.

       We also examine the trades of mutual funds and find that the stocks purchased

tend to significantly outperform the stocks sold. Moreover, we show that the return

difference between the buys and the sells by mutual funds increases significantly with



                                          5
industry concentration. This finding indicates that concentrated mutual funds are more

successful in selecting securities than diversified funds.

       The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. We describe the data in Section I.

Sections II and III define the concentration and performance measures, respectively.

Section IV documents the empirical results and reports several robustness tests. Section

V concludes.



                                           I. Data

       The main data set has been created by merging the CRSP Survivorship Bias Free

Mutual Fund Database with the CDA/Spectrum holdings database and the CRSP stock

price data. The CRSP Mutual Fund Database includes information on fund returns, total

net assets, different types of fees, investment objectives, and other fund characteristics.

One major constraint imposed on researchers using CRSP is that it does not provide

detailed information about fund holdings. We follow Wermers (2000) and merge the

CRSP database with the stockholdings database published by CDA Investments

Technologies. The CDA database provides stockholdings of virtually all U.S. mutual

funds. The data are collected both from reports filed by mutual funds with the SEC and

from voluntary reports generated by the funds. We link each reported stock holding to the

CRSP stock database in order to find its price and industry classification code. The vast

majority of funds have holdings of companies listed on the NYSE, NASDAQ, or AMEX

stock exchanges. However, there also are funds for which we are not able to identify the

price and the industry code of certain holdings. The missing data, however, constitute less



                                           6
than 1% of all holdings. The Appendix provides further details pertaining to the merging

process.

         Our final sample spans the period between January 1984 and December 1999. We

eliminate balanced, bond, index, international, and sector funds, and focus our analysis

on actively managed diversified equity funds. In addition, we include funds with multiple

share classes only once. We also eliminate all observations where fewer than 11 stock

holdings could be identified. Finally, we exclude all fund observations where the size of

the fund in the previous quarter does not exceed $1 million. With all the exclusions, our

final sample includes 1,771 actively managed diversified equity funds. Panel A of Table I

presents summary statistics of the data.

                                [Insert Table I around here]



                             II. Industry Concentration Index

         We define our measure of industry concentration, the Industry Concentration

Index, based on the fund holdings. Specifically, we assign each stock held by a mutual

fund to one of ten industries. In the Appendix, we present the detailed composition of the

industries. The Industry Concentration Index (ICI) at time t for a mutual fund is defined

as the sum of the squared deviations of the value weights for each of the ten different

industries held by the mutual fund, w j ,t , relative to the industry weights of the total stock


market, w j ,t .

                                         j =1


       The Industry Concentration Index measures how much a mutual fund portfolio

deviates from the market portfolio. This index is equal to zero if a mutual fund has

exactly the same industry composition as the market portfolio, and increases as a mutual

fund becomes more concentrated in a few industries.

       The Industry Concentration Index is related to the Herfindahl Index, which is

commonly used in Industrial Organization to measure the concentration of companies in

an industry.3 The Industry Concentration Index can be thought of as a market-adjusted

Herfindahl Index. In our sample, it has a correlation coefficient of 0.93 with the

Herfindahl Index. We choose the Industry Concentration Index for two reasons. First, the

industry weights of the total market vary over time. The Industry Concentration Index

takes this variation into account by adjusting for the time-varying industry weights in the

market portfolio. Second, a mutual fund can have a lower Herfindahl Index than the

entire market portfolio if it is more equally invested in the different industries. The

Industry Concentration Index is not subject to this problem, because the market portfolio

has the lowest possible index value of zero.

       Panel A of Table I documents summary statistics for the Industry Concentration

Index and other fund characteristics. The average actively managed mutual fund has an

Industry Concentration Index of 5.98%. The Industry Concentration Index ranges




                                          8
between 0.01 and 83.42%, which demonstrates a significant cross-sectional variation of

mutual funds with respect to their concentration level. Concentrated funds may differ

substantially from diversified funds in numerous characteristics such as size, age,

managerial fees, loads, and turnover. In Panel B of Table I, we examine the correlation

between the Industry Concentration Index and fund characteristics. In general, we

observe statistically significant correlations between the different characteristics. On

average, concentrated funds have higher turnover and higher expenses than diversified

funds. On the other hand, concentrated funds are younger and have a lower value of

assets under management.



                                     III. Performance Measures

          To examine the relation between industry concentration and fund performance,

we use both factor-based and holding-based performance measures. In this section, we

describe the different measures we use to evaluate fund performance.



A. Carhart Four-Factor Measure

          One of our measures is the Carhart (1997) four-factor model, which controls for

risk and style factors. It is especially important to adjust for momentum in stock returns

(Jegadeesh and Titman, 1993) of our industry concentration portfolios, as momentum is




                                                 ( )
                                             N       2
3
    The Herfindahl Index is defined as HIt = ∑ wi ,t . Using the Herfindahl Index instead of the Industry
                                            i =1
Concentration Index does not change the qualitative aspects of our results.

stronger at an industry level (Moskowitz and Grinblatt, 1999).4 We estimate the

following regression:


Ri,t – RF, t = αi + βi,M (RM,t – RF,t) + βi,SMB SMBt + βi,HML HMLt + βi,MOM MOMt + ei,t,             (2)


where the dependent variable is the quarterly return on portfolio i in quarter t minus the

risk-free rate, and the independent variables are given by the returns of the four zero-

investment factor portfolios. The expression RMt – RFt denotes the excess return of the

market portfolio over the risk-free rate;5 SMB is the return difference between small and

large capitalization stocks; HML is the return difference between high and low book-to-

market stocks; and MOM is the return difference between stocks with high and low past

returns.6 The intercept of the model, αi, is the Carhart measure of abnormal performance.

        To account for possible differences in idiosyncratic risk exposure, we also

compute the appraisal ratio of Treynor and Black (1973), defined as the ratio of the

intercept from the regression equation (2) and the standard deviation of the residuals from

the same regression.




4
  Carhart (1997) indicates that performance persistence mainly can be explained by including a momentum
factor. Zheng (1999) suggests that the "smart-money" effect is closely related to momentum in stock
returns. Nevertheless, our findings remain similar when we use the Fama and French (1993) three-factor
model.

  The market return is calculated as the value-weighted return on all NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ stocks
using the CRSP database. The monthly return of the one-month Treasury bill rate is obtained from Ibbotson
Associates.
6
  The size, the value, and the momentum factor returns were taken from Kenneth French’s Web site
http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/Data_Library.


                                                10
B. Ferson-Schadt Conditional Measure

         Ferson and Schadt (1996) argue that the traditional unconditional measures of

abnormal performance might be unreliable, because common variation in risk levels and

risk premia will be confounded with average performance. They argue that a managed

portfolio strategy that can be replicated using readily available public information should

not be judged as having superior performance. They advocate a model based on

conditional performance, which uses predetermined instruments to capture the time-

varying factor loadings. Our specification of the conditional model follows Wermers

(2003) and includes interaction terms between the excess market returns and various

macro-economic variables:


Ri,t–RF,t = αi + βi,M (RM,t–RF,t) + βi,SMBSMBt + βi,HMLHMLt + βi,MOMMOMt

             + ∑4j=1βi,j[zj,t-1(RM,t–RF,t)]+ei,t,                                                        (3)


where zj,t-1 is the demeaned value of the lagged macro-economic variable j. Consistent

with the previous studies, we consider the following four macro-economic variables: the

one-month Treasury bill yield, the dividend yield of the S&P 500 Index, the Treasury

yield spread (long- minus short-term bonds), and the quality spread in the corporate bond

market (low- minus high-grade bonds).7 The intercept of the model, αi, is the conditional

measure of performance.




7
  Ferson and Schadt (1996) also include an indicator variable for January. We exclude this indicator
variable because our data are at a quarterly frequency and because the coefficient on the interaction term
between the excess market return and an indicator variable for the first quarter is usually not statistically
significantly different from 0.


                                                    11
C. DGTW Measures

       To investigate the causes of the abnormal performance, we use an alternative set

of measures based on the fund holdings rather than the time-series of fund returns.

DGTW (1997) decompose the overall return of a fund into a “Characteristic Selectivity”

measure CS, a “Characteristic Timing” measure CT, and an “Average Style” measure AS.

       To form the benchmark portfolios, we follow DGTW (1997) and group the

universe of common stocks listed on the NYSE, NASDAQ, and AMEX into quintiles

along the dimensions of size (market value of equity), book-to-market ratio, and

momentum (the return of a stock in the previous year). This sequential sorting results in

125 passive portfolios. We calculate the value-weighted returns on each benchmark

portfolio. DGTW (1997) describe the computation of these benchmarks in more detail.

       The variable CS denotes a measure of stock selection ability and uses as a

benchmark the return of a portfolio of stocks that is matched to each of the fund’s stock

holdings every quarter along the dimensions of size, book-to-market ratio, and

momentum:


                           CSt = ∑jwj,t-1[Rj,t – BRt(j, t – 1)],                           (4)


where Rj,t is the return on stock j during period t; BRt(j, t – k) is the return on a benchmark

portfolio during period t to which stock j was allocated during period t – k according to

its size, value, and momentum characteristics; and wj,t-k is the relative weight of stock j at

the end of period t–k in the mutual fund.




                                            12
       The variable CT denotes a measure of style timing ability, which examines

whether fund managers can generate additional performance by exploiting time-varying

expected returns of the size, book-to-market, or momentum benchmark portfolios:


                     CTt = ∑j[wj,t-1 BRt(j, t – 1) – wj,t-5BRt(j, t – 5)].              (5)


       As in DGTW (1997), we use the AS measure to capture the returns earned by a

fund due to a fund’s tendency to hold stocks with certain characteristics. The AS measure

is defined as:


                                ASt = ∑j[wj,t-5BRt(j, t – 5)].                          (6)




D. Industry-Adjusted Measures

       To adjust a fund’s performance for industry returns, we develop the industry stock

selectivity measure, IS, and the industry timing measure, IT. The variable IS measures a

manager’s ability to select superior stocks within industries, while IT is a measure of a

manager’s ability to select superior industries. The measures IS and IT are defined in two

steps. In the first step, we compute the industry-adjusted performance using the returns of

the 48 industries:


                              ISt = ∑jwj,t-1[Rj,t – IRt (j, t – 1)]                     (7)



                       ITt = ∑j[wj,t-1 IRt (j, t – 1) – wj,t-5 IRt (j, t – 5)],         (8)




                                              13
where IRt (j, t – k) is the return on an industry portfolio during period t, to which stock j

was allocated during period t – k. The variables R and w are the same as defined

previously. In the second step, we regress the IS and IT measures on the Carhart four-

factor model to obtain industry-adjusted abnormal returns.



E. Trade Portfolios

       Chen, Jagadeesh, and Wermers (2000) and Kothari and Warner (2001) suggest

that examining trades can be a more powerful method to find value in active fund

management than examining holdings. To analyze mutual fund trades, we compute for

each fund the average quarterly returns of the stocks purchased and sold during the

previous six months. The average returns of the buys and sells of a mutual fund during

quarter t are computed as follows:


                                                    ∑~              (w   j ,t −1
                                                                                    ~

       The weight of stock j in a mutual fund at the end of the previous quarter is

denoted by w j ,t −1 and the return of stock j during quarter t is denoted by R j ,t . We adjust




                                                14
for the weight changes that occur due to price changes in buy-and-hold portfolios. Thus,

                  ~
the lagged weight w j ,t −3 is defined as follows:

                                                  w j ,t −3 1 + R j ,t −2 1 + R j ,t −1   )

                                  w j ,t −3 =                                                  .   (11)

                                                 j



        We also compute the return difference between stock purchases and liquidations:

                                RtBuys − Sells = RtBuys − RtSells .                                (12)


        We use two measures of performance for the trades. The first measure is the raw

return and the second measure is the stock selection ability measure CS from DGTW

(1997). For the second measure, we replace the raw returns R in equations (9), (10), and

(12) with the style-adjusted returns CS.



                                  IV. Empirical Evidence

        In this section, we present the empirical results. First, we investigate the relation

between industry concentration and fund performance using both a portfolio and a

regression approach. We then examine how fund size and investment style interact with

the observed relation. Finally, we analyze the trades of mutual funds to further explore

the relation between industry concentration and fund performance.




                                                15
A. Portfolio Evidence

       To gauge the relative performance of funds with different concentration levels, we

sort all mutual funds into ten portfolios according to their Industry Concentration Index at

the end of each quarter. For each decile portfolio, we compute the equally weighted

average return for each quarter. For this estimation, we use the performance information

from all funds, including funds with short return histories, thus mitigating a potential

selection bias.



                        A.1. Factor-Based Performance Measures

       Table II summarizes the results of the unconditional and conditional four-factor

models, as in equations (2) and (3). We examine the factor-adjusted returns before and

after subtracting expenses. Looking at the returns before expenses enables us to better

evaluate the investment ability of mutual fund managers, since managers with better

skills may charge higher expenses to extract rents, as discussed in Berk and Green

(2004). On the other hand, the returns after expenses are important for mutual fund

investors.

                              [Insert Table II around here]

       The unconditional abnormal returns before expenses are summarized in the first

column. The results indicate that the most diversified fund portfolio generates an

abnormal return of 0.09% per quarter, while the most concentrated fund portfolio

generates an abnormal return of 0.53% per quarter. The abnormal returns of the five most

concentrated portfolios are all significantly positive at the 10% level. In contrast, the



                                          16
abnormal returns of the five most diversified portfolios are all not significantly different

from 0. The difference in the quarterly abnormal returns between the five most and the

five least concentrated deciles equals 0.30 percentage points per quarter, which is

statistically significant at the 5% level. The magnitude of the performance difference

increases further if we compare the top and the bottom quintiles or deciles. The Spearman

rank correlation between fund concentration and performance equals 0.87 and is

significant at the 1% level. Hence, the evidence indicates that concentrated funds perform

better than diversified funds before deducting expenses.

       The second column summarizes the abnormal performance using the conditional

four-factor model. In general, the results of the conditional model are stronger and

statistically more significant than the results using the unconditional model. Thus, the

performance difference between the concentrated and the diversified funds are not driven

by their responses to macro-economic conditions.

       The ranking of the concentration deciles for the abnormal returns after expenses is

very similar to the one before expenses. The most concentrated fund portfolios tend to

have positive abnormal net returns, while the least concentrated portfolios tend to have

negative abnormal net returns. The difference in the performance between concentrated

and diversified funds declines slightly if we study after-expense returns, because highly

concentrated funds charge higher expenses than diversified funds. In particular, the

average quarterly expenses range from 0.38% for the most concentrated funds to 0.26%

for the most diversified funds. The after-expense abnormal return of the five most

concentrated deciles exceeds that of the five least concentrated deciles by 0.24 percentage



                                          17
points per quarter. A trading strategy of going long in the most concentrated portfolios

and going short in the most diversified portfolios would have generated these risk-

adjusted returns. Therefore, concentrated funds appear to outperform diversified funds

even after taking into account fund expense ratios.

       To examine the risk and style characteristics of the decile portfolios, we report the

factor loadings of an unconditional four-factor model using before-expense returns in the

last four columns of Table II. In our sample, the coefficient on the market factor does not

differ much among the ten portfolios. We observe that diversified funds tend to hold

large and value companies, whereas concentrated funds tend to hold small and growth

companies. Concentrated funds exhibit more momentum in their returns than diversified

funds. Therefore, we rely on the four-factor Carhart model and the DGTW model to

control for momentum.



                       A.2. Holding-Based Performance Measures

       DGTW (1997) propose an alternative method to estimate the performance of

mutual funds based on the portfolio holdings (equations 4 to 6). This method sheds light

on the causes of the performance of mutual funds. Specifically, the DGTW performance

measures detect whether mutual fund managers successfully select stocks that outperform

a portfolio of stocks with the same characteristics and whether fund managers

successfully time these characteristics.




                                           18
         Table III summarizes the three performance measures for the concentration decile

portfolios. Overall, the average performance during our sample period, 1984 to 1999, is

similar to that reported by DGTW (1997) using data from 1975 to 1994.8

                                    [Insert Table III around here]

         Concentrated mutual funds tend to have higher selectivity measures CS and

higher timing measures CT than diversified mutual funds. The difference in the CS

measures between the five most and the five least concentrated deciles equals 0.20

percentage points per quarter, while the respective difference in the CT measures equals

0.06 percentage points per quarter. The CS and the CT measures of the decile portfolios

increase almost monotonically with the Industry Concentration Index, which results in

statistically significant Spearman rank correlations. Consistent with our earlier results,

concentrated funds exhibit better stock picking and style timing abilities than diversified

funds.



B. Multivariate Regression Evidence

         In this section, we further extend our analysis using multivariate regressions. This

approach differs from the portfolio approach in three major respects. First, the decile

portfolio analysis does not control for mutual fund characteristics that are related to fund

performance. For example, well-diversified mutual funds are, on average, larger than

concentrated funds. It might be that smaller funds perform better than larger funds, and

8
  DGTW compute an annualized average CS measure of 0.77%, while our results show an annualized
average CS measure of 0.96%. Their results are statistically significant at the 5% level, while our results
are significant at the 10% level. The CT measure is neither statistically significant in their paper nor in our
paper.


                                                  19
that the concentration level matters only because it is correlated with size. A multivariate

regression framework simultaneously controls for these different factors. Second, the

portfolio approach aggregates mutual funds of similar concentration levels into different

groups. Here, we take advantage of the rich panel of individual mutual funds. Third, in

the previous section we assume constant factor loadings across time. To take into account

possible time variations in the factor loadings of individual funds, the regressions use past

data to estimate the four-factor model and determine the abnormal returns during a

subsequent period. In the regression analyses, we examine the concentration-performance

relation using the unconditional and conditional four-factor as well as the holding-based

performance measures.



                        B.1. Factor-Based Performance Measures

       We use three years of past monthly returns to estimate the coefficients of the

unconditional and conditional factor models. Subsequently, we subtract the expected

return from the realized fund return to determine the abnormal return of a fund in each

quarter.9

       Next, we regress the abnormal return of each mutual fund in each quarter on the

Industry Concentration Index and on other fund characteristics. We lag all explanatory

variables by one quarter, except for expenses and turnover, which are lagged by one year

due to data availability. Using the lagged explanatory variables mitigates potential

endogeneity problems. We take the natural logarithms of the age and the size variables,




                                          20
because both variables are skewed to the right. Wermers (2003) shows that flows by

mutual fund investors can have an impact on asset prices. To control for the effect of

lagged inflows, we include the lagged-quarter flows into each mutual fund as an

additional explanatory variable.10 Each regression additionally includes time fixed

effects.

           We estimate the regressions with panel-corrected standard errors (PCSE). The

PCSE specification adjusts for the contemporaneous correlation and heteroskedasticity

among fund returns as well as for the autocorrelation within each fund’s returns (Beck

and Katz, 1995). We analyze the unbalanced panel, since most mutual funds do not exist

over the whole sample period. Table IV summarizes the regression results.

                                [Insert Table IV around here]

           The first column shows the coefficients from the panel regression using the

abnormal return based on the unconditional four-factor model as the dependent variable.

The sign and magnitude of the coefficient on the Industry Concentration Index are

consistent with our previous analysis using the concentration decile portfolios.

Specifically, an increase in the Industry Concentration Index by 5 percentage points

(corresponding approximately to one-standard-deviation of the Industry Concentration

Index) increases the quarterly abnormal return of a mutual fund by 13 basis points (=

2.57*5 = 12.85), or by approximately 0.52 percentage points on an annual basis. This

effect is economically and statistically significant. On average, expenses have a


9
   One limitation of this approach is that we have to exclude young mutual funds that do not have a
sufficiently long return history.
10
   We calculate quarter flows following Gruber (1996) and Zheng (1999).


                                             21
statistically significant negative effect on the abnormal return of the mutual fund. Fund

age is negatively related to fund performance, and lagged cash flow is positively related

to fund performance.

       In the second column of Table IV, we use the conditional abnormal return as the

dependent variable. The coefficient on the Industry Concentration Index remains similar

and is statistically significant at the 1% level. This result indicates that the superior

performance of concentrated funds cannot be attributed to their greater responsiveness to

macro-economic conditions.



                       B.2. Holding-Based Performance Measures

       Columns three and four of Table IV summarize estimation results using holding-

based performance measures, CS or CT, as the dependent variable, respectively. The

results show that mutual funds with a high Industry Concentration Index have better

stock selection and better style timing abilities. Specifically, a one-standard-deviation

increase in the Industry Concentration Index increases the quarterly CS measure by 14.7

basis points, and the CT measure by 4.7 basis points. Compared to the previous portfolio

results, taking advantage of the rich panel structure of our data set and controlling for

other mutual fund characteristics result in a significant relation between mutual fund

concentration and characteristic-based performance measures.

       Overall, the regression results confirm our earlier evidence using decile portfolios

that concentrated funds outperform diversified funds by an economically significant

margin during our sample period.



                                         22
                      B.3. Industry-Adjusted Abnormal Performance

       One explanation for the superior performance of concentrated funds is that they

select industries with high returns. We test this hypothesis using the previously defined IS

and IT measures (equations 7 and 8). The measure IS evaluates the stock-picking ability

of a fund within industries, while IT captures the ability of the fund to time industries.

The first two columns of Table V summarize the results of adjusting the portfolio returns

for industry, risk, and style. A one-standard-deviation increase in the Industry

Concentration Index increases the quarterly IS measure by 9.5 basis points. Likewise, a

one-standard-deviation increase in the Industry Concentration Index increases the

quarterly IT measure by 7.3 basis points. Both effects are significant at the 1% level.

                              [Insert Table V around here]

       These results indicate that concentrated funds outperform diversified funds even

after adjusting for the industry performance. Concentrated funds appear to have the

ability to select better performing stocks within industries and select better performing

industries.



                                   B.4. Appraisal Ratio

       As a portfolio deviates from the market portfolio, it will be exposed to

idiosyncratic risk. To take into account the different amount of unique risk across our

sample of funds, we use as a performance measure a modified appraisal ratio of Treynor

and Black (1973). The appraisal ratio is calculated by dividing the abnormal return by the



                                          23
standard deviation of the residuals from a four-factor model. Brown, Goetzmann, and

Ross (1995) show that survivorship bias is positively related to fund return variance.

Thus, the higher the return volatility, the greater the difference between the ex-post

observed mean and the ex-ante expected return. Using the alpha scaled by the

idiosyncratic risk as our performance measure mitigates such survivorship problems.

       The regression results using the appraisal ratio are presented in the third column

of Table V. Consistent with our earlier findings, we observe a positive relation between

portfolio concentration and fund performance, which is statistically significant at the 1%

level. The coefficients on the other variables are similar to those using the alternative

performance measures. Thus, the empirical results suggest the superior performance of

concentrated funds is not driven by the amount of idiosyncratic risk, which is related to

survival conditions.



                              B.5. Sub-Period Performance

       We examine the relation between portfolio concentration and fund performance

for two sample periods: 1987 to 1993 and 1994 to 1999. There are significant differences

in fund characteristics for the two time periods. For example, many new funds entered the

market and the average TNA per fund increased substantially during the latter period.

The two periods differ also in the overall stock market performance. The average

quarterly market return equals 3.4% in the first sub-sample and 5.3% in the second sub-

sample. Thus, it is possible that the concentration-performance relation may differ across

the two sub-periods. The results of this analysis, presented in Table VI, suggest that a



                                         24
similar positive relation between portfolio concentration and fund performance exists in

both sample periods.

                              [Insert Table VI around here]



C. Size Portfolios

       To further analyze whether the effect of the Industry Concentration Index depends

on the size of the mutual funds, we segregate the mutual funds into different size

portfolios and compare the performance of concentrated and diversified funds within

these size portfolios.

       The distribution of the assets under management by mutual funds is highly

skewed to the right. For example, the median mutual fund in our sample has a TNA of

$104 million, while the largest mutual fund (Fidelity Magellan) reached a TNA of

$97,594 million in 1999. Diseconomies of scale in money management, as discussed by

Berk and Green (2004), make it difficult for very large funds to outperform passive

benchmarks even if fund managers are skilled.

       To gauge the impact of fund size on the concentration-performance relation, we

first sort funds into size quintiles based on the TNAs at the end of the previous quarter.

Subsequently, we sort the mutual funds within each size quintile into two equally-sized

groups according to their Industry Concentration Index. Mutual funds in the first quintile

manage on average $10.19 million, while funds in the fifth quintile manage on average

$2,604 million.




                                         25
       Our findings, reported in Table VII, confirm the results in Chen, Hong, Huang,

and Kubik (2002) that small mutual funds outperform large funds. Specifically, mutual

funds in the small size quintile have an abnormal return before expenses of 0.48% per

quarter using the unconditional four-factor model, while funds in the large size quintile

have an abnormal return of 0.16% per quarter. This difference in the abnormal

performance is statistically significantly different from zero at the 5% level.

                               [Insert Table VII around here]

       Table VII focuses primarily on the effects of the Industry Concentration Index on

abnormal performance within the size quintiles. We observe a positive performance

difference between the high and low concentration funds in all size quintiles using the

various performance measures. The concentration effect does not differ significantly

between the different size quintiles. This finding indicates that our results are not

primarily driven by the smallest mutual funds.



D. Style Portfolios

       Funds frequently concentrate their holdings in specific investment styles, for

example, value vs. growth or small vs. large capitalization stocks. In this section, we

investigate to what extent our concentration results are related to funds’ investment

styles. We sort our sample of mutual funds into four investment styles based on the

characteristics of their stock holdings.

       Each stock traded on the major U.S. exchanges is grouped into respective

quintiles according to its market value and its book-to-market ratio. Subsequently, using



                                           26
the quintile information, we compute the value-weighted size score and value score for

each mutual fund in each period. For example, a mutual fund that invests only in stocks

in the smallest size quintile would have a size score of 1, while a mutual fund that invests

only in the largest size quintile would have a size score of 5. Next, we group all mutual

funds according to their size scores and value scores into four portfolios. The small-

growth portfolio includes mutual funds with below median size scores and below median

value scores. Similarly, we define the large-growth, small-value, and large-value

portfolios. Finally, we subdivide each of these four portfolios according to their Industry

Concentration Index. As a result, we obtain eight portfolios of mutual funds according to

their style and concentration characteristics.

        Table VIII summarizes the different performance measures of these portfolios of

mutual funds. The first two columns report the four-factor abnormal returns before

subtracting expenses; the remaining columns report the holding-based DGTW

performance measures. Consistent with the findings in DGTW (1997) and Chen,

Jegadeesh, and Wermers (2000), we observe that mutual funds investing primarily in

small or growth stocks outperform other mutual funds with respect to all performance

measures. On the other hand, mutual funds specializing in large-value stocks tend to

perform the worst according to all measures. Specifically, mutual funds focusing on

small-growth stocks outperform mutual funds specializing in large-value stocks by 0.39%

per quarter, using the unconditional four-factor model. This performance difference is

statistically significant at the 10% level.




                                              27
                             [Insert Table VIII around here]

       Consistent with our earlier findings, mutual funds with a higher industry

concentration tend to generate higher abnormal returns before expenses within style

categories, unless they specialize in large-value stocks. The least concentrated 50% of

small-growth mutual funds have an abnormal return before expenses of 0.18% per

quarter, while the most concentrated 50% have an abnormal return of 0.59% per quarter

using the unconditional four-factor model. On the other hand, the least concentrated 50%

of large-value mutual funds have an abnormal return before expenses of 0.06% per

quarter, while the most concentrated 50% have an abnormal return of -0.08% per quarter.

The effect of the Industry Concentration Index on the abnormal returns and the statistical

significance of the return differences strengthen if we compute conditional instead of

unconditional abnormal returns. The results using the holding-based performance

measures are also consistent with the results using the abnormal four-factor performance.



E. Trade Portfolios

       To further examine whether concentrated funds have informational advantages,

we study the performance of mutual fund trades. Specifically, for each fund, we compute

the average quarterly returns of the stocks purchased and sold during the previous six

months, as described in Section III-E. In our test, we sort the mutual funds according to

their Industry Concentration Index and group them into ten portfolios, as in Tables II and

III.




                                         28
        Table IX summarizes the two performance measures for the portfolios based on

stock trades by mutual funds in different concentration deciles. The stocks purchased

tend to perform significantly better than the stocks sold. Overall, the stocks purchased

have a raw return that exceeds the return of the stocks sold by 1.35% per quarter. The

difference between the buy and the sell portfolio tends to increase with the Industry

Concentration Index. The return difference equals 0.95% for the most diversified decile

and 2.11% for the most concentrated decile. The difference in the differences is both

statistically and economically highly significant. The superior performance of the trades

of the concentrated funds is due to higher returns of the stocks purchased and lower

returns of the stocks sold.

                                [Insert Table IX around here]

        The last three columns of Table IX summarize the return differences for the

characteristic-adjusted CS measure. These results confirm the earlier findings using the

raw returns that the trades of concentrated funds create significantly more value than the

trades of diversified funds.



                                          V. Conclusions

        The value of active fund management has been a long-standing debate among

researchers and practitioners. Mutual fund managers may deviate from the passive market

portfolio by concentrating their holdings in specific industries. We investigate whether

mutual fund managers hold concentrated portfolios because they have investment skills

that are linked to specific industries.



                                             29
       Using U.S. mutual fund data from 1984 to 1999, we find that mutual funds differ

substantially in their industry concentration, and that concentrated funds tend to follow

distinct investment styles. In particular, managers of more concentrated funds overweigh

growth and small stocks, whereas managers of more diversified funds hold portfolios that

closely resemble the total market portfolio.

       We find that funds with concentrated portfolios perform better than funds with

diversified portfolios. This finding is robust to various risk-adjusted performance

measures, including the four-factor model of Carhart (1997), the conditional factor model

of Ferson and Schadt (1996), and the holding-based performance measures of Daniel,

Grinblatt, Titman, and Wermers (1997). Analyzing the buy and sell decisions of mutual

funds, we find evidence that the trades of concentrated portfolios add more value than the

trades of diversified portfolios.

       In summary, this paper finds that investment ability is more evident among

managers who hold portfolios concentrated in a few industries. The evidence lends

support to the value of active fund management.

A. Matching of the CRSP and the CDA Data Sets

           To analyze the relation between industry concentration of mutual funds and their

style characteristics, one of our main tasks includes the matching of the CDA mutual

fund holdings database and the CRSP mutual fund database. We match funds in the

CRSP database to the CDA holdings database. Specifically, given that both data sets have

different identifying numbers, we need to use different characteristics to perform the

merge. A natural common characteristic used as a merging variable is the name of the

fund. The matching procedure is done manually and very often, to avoid any spurious

matches, supplemented by additional information from the Web sites of particular funds.

In cases where matching by name is not conclusive, we support our matching with

additional information about the TNA and the investment objective of the fund.

           At the outset, our matched data set includes 4,253 different funds identified both

in the CRSP and the CDA databases, which existed at any time between January 1984

and December 1999.11 For this sample, we apply another filter, in which we exclude all

bond, balanced, money market, index, international, and sector funds.12 We also

eliminate fund observations where the TNA of a fund in the previous quarter is less than

$1 million or where fewer than 11 stock holdings are identified. In summary, our final

sample includes 1,771 distinct equity funds with complete characteristics of returns, total

     For funds with multiple share classes, we include the dominant class of shares in CRSP.

     We exclude funds that do not predominantly hold U.S. equities.

   Kenneth French lists on his Web page the SIC codes for a 48-industry classification

(http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/Data_Library) used in Fama and

French (1997). Our analysis aggregates these 48 industries into 10 main industry groups

as described in Table AI.

This table summarizes abnormal returns and the factor loadings using the Carhart (1997) four-factor model for
different portfolios of mutual funds for the period of 1984 to 1999. The first and third columns show the
unconditional abnormal returns before and after expenses. The second and fourth columns show the conditional
abnormal returns according to Ferson and Schadt (1996), using the lagged level of the one-month Treasury bill
yield, the lagged dividend yield of the S&P 500 Index, the lagged measure of the slope of the term structure, and the
lagged quality spread in the bond market. The last four columns summarize the factor loadings for the unconditional
model using returns before expenses. We divide the sample into deciles based on the lagged Industry Concentration
Index ICI = ∑( wj – w j )2, where wj is the weight of the mutual fund holdings in industry j and w j is the weight of
the market in industry j. The returns are expressed at a quarterly frequency and the portfolios are rebalanced
quarterly. The standard errors of the regressions are given in parentheses. The table includes the differences in the
abnormal returns along with their standard errors before and after expenses between the top and the bottom deciles,
the top and the bottom quintiles, and the top and the bottom halves of the mutual funds. Spearman rank correlations
have been included together with their respective p-values.

                                     Holding-Based Performance
This table summarizes holding-based performance measures according to DGTW (1997) for different
portfolios of mutual funds for the period of 1984 to 1999. We divide the sample into deciles based on the
lagged Industry Concentration Index, which is defined as ICI = ∑( wj – w j )2, where wj is the weight of the
mutual fund holdings in industry j and w j is the weight of the market in industry j. The returns are
expressed at a quarterly frequency and the portfolios are rebalanced quarterly. The characteristic-based
performance measures are denoted by CS, CT, and AS. The stock selection ability is defined as CS =
∑wj,t-1[Rj,t – BRt(j, t – 1)], where BRt(j, t – 1) denotes the return of a benchmark portfolio during period t to
which stock j was allocated during period t – 1 according to its size, value, and momentum characteristics.
The style-timing ability is defined as CT = ∑[wj,t-1 BRt(j, t – 1)– wj,t-5BRt(j, t – 5)] and the style-selection
ability is defined as AS = ∑[wj,t-5BRt(j, t – 5)]. The standard errors of the regressions are given in
parentheses. The table includes the differences in the abnormal returns along with their standard errors
between the top and the bottom deciles, the top and the bottom quintiles, and the top and the bottom halves
of the mutual funds. Spearman rank correlations have been included together with their respective p-values.

                                         Regression Evidence
This table reports the coefficients of the quarterly panel regression of the general form: PERFi,t = β0 +
β1*ICIi,t-1 + β2*LTNAi,t-1 + β3*EXPi,t-1 + β4*LAGEi,t-1 + β5*TUi,t-1 + β6*NMGi,t-1 + εi,t. The sample includes
actively managed equity mutual funds and spans the period of 1984 to 1999 (including the data used for
calculating the abnormal returns). The dependent variable, PERF, measures the quarterly performance
using the four-factor model of Carhart (1997) based on 36 months of lagged data, the conditional
performance according to Ferson and Schadt (1996), and the holding-based performance measures, CS and
CT according to DGTW (1997). The Industry Concentration Index is defined as ICI = ∑( wj – w j )2, where
wj is the weight of the mutual fund holdings in industry j and w j is the weight of the market in industry j.
We denote the expense ratio by EXP, the turnover ratio by TU, the natural logarithm of age by LAGE, the
natural logarithm of total net assets by LTNA, and the new money growth by NMG. All regressions include
time dummies. Panel-corrected standard errors for panel regressions have been provided in parentheses.

This table reports the coefficients of the quarterly panel regression of the general form: PERFi,t = β0 +
β1*ICIi,t-1 + β2*LTNAi,t-1 + β3*EXPi,t-1 + β4*LAGEi,t-1 + β5*TUi,t-1 + β6*NMGi,t-1 + εi,t. The sample includes
actively managed equity mutual funds and spans the period of 1987 to 1993 (left panel) and 1994 to 1999
(right panel). The dependent variable, PERF, measures the quarterly abnormal performance using the four-
factor model of Carhart (1997) based on 36 months of lagged data. The Industry Concentration Index is
defined as ICI = ∑( wj – w j )2, where wj is the weight of the mutual fund holdings in industry j and w j is
the weight of the market in industry j. We denote the expense ratio by EXP, the turnover ratio by TU, the
natural logarithm of age by LAGE, the natural logarithm of total net assets by LTNA, and the new money
growth by NMG. All regressions include time dummies. Panel-corrected standard errors have been
provided in parentheses.

                                      Mutual Fund Size Portfolios
Mutual funds are sorted at the beginning of each period into five equally-sized portfolios according to the
lagged TNA of the mutual funds. The mutual funds in each of these five portfolios are further divided into
two groups according to the lagged Industry Concentration Index. The Industry Concentration Index is
defined as ICI = ∑( wj – w j )2, where wj is the weight of the mutual fund holdings in industry j and w j is
the weight of the market in industry j. The returns are expressed at a quarterly frequency and the portfolios
are rebalanced quarterly. The abnormal returns before expenses using the Carhart (1997) four-factor model
are summarized for different portfolios of mutual funds for the period of 1984 to 1999. The characteristic-
based performance measures are denoted by CS and CT. The stock selection ability is defined as CS =
∑wj,t-1[Rj,t – BRt(j, t – 1)], where BRt(j, t – 1) denotes the return of a benchmark portfolio during period t to
which stock j was allocated during period t – 1 according to its size, value, and momentum characteristics.
The style-timing ability is defined as CT = ∑[wj,t-1 BRt(j, t – 1)– wj,t-5BRt(j, t – 5)]. The standard errors of the
regressions are given in parentheses.

Mutual funds are sorted at the beginning of each period into four portfolios according to the lagged market
values (small vs. large cap) and the lagged book-to-market ratios (growth vs. value) of their holdings. The
mutual funds in each of these four portfolios are further divided into two groups according to the lagged
Industry Concentration Index. The Industry Concentration Index is defined as ICI = ∑( wj – w j )2, where
wj is the weight of the mutual fund holdings in industry j and w j is the weight of the market in industry j.
The returns are expressed at a quarterly frequency and the portfolios are rebalanced quarterly. The
abnormal returns before expenses using the Carhart (1997) four-factor model are summarized for different
portfolios of mutual funds for the period of 1984 to 1999. The characteristic-based performance measures
are denoted by CS and CT. The stock selection ability is defined as CS = ∑wj,t-1[Rj,t – BRt(j, t – 1)], where
BRt(j, t – 1) denotes the return of a benchmark portfolio during period t to which stock j was allocated
during period t – 1 according to its size, value, and momentum characteristics. The style-timing ability is
defined as CT = ∑[wj,t-1 BRt(j, t – 1)– wj,t-5BRt(j, t – 5)]. The standard errors of the regressions are given in

                                               Trade Portfolios
This table summarizes the returns of the stocks purchased and sold by different portfolios of mutual funds
for the period of 1984 to 1999. We divide the sample into deciles based on the lagged Industry
Concentration Index, which is defined as ICI = ∑( wj – w j )2, where wj is the weight of the mutual fund
holdings in industry j and w j is the weight of the market in industry j. The returns are expressed at a
quarterly frequency and the portfolios are rebalanced quarterly. For each mutual fund, we compute the raw
returns and style-adjusted returns of their stock purchases and sells. The style adjusted return is a measure
of stock selection ability and is defined as CS = ∑wj,t-1[Rj,t – BRt(j, t – 1)], where BRt(j, t – 1) is the return of
a benchmark portfolio during period t to which stock j was allocated during period t – 1 according to its
size, value, and momentum characteristics. The table includes the differences in the returns along with their
standard errors between the top and the bottom deciles, the top and the bottom quintiles, and the top and the
bottom halves of the mutual funds. Spearman rank correlations have been included together with their
respective p-values.
