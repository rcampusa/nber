Older Women’s Labor Market Attachment, Retirement Planning, and Household Debt

NBER Working Paper No. 22606
September 2016
JEL No. D91,J14

                                         ABSTRACT

The goal of this paper is to ascertain whether older women’s current and anticipated future labor
force patterns have changed over time, and if so, to evaluate the factors associated with longer
work lives and plans to continue work at older ages. Using data from both the Health and
Retirement Study (HRS) and the National Financial Capability Study (NFCS), we show that older
women’s current and intended future labor force attachment patterns are changing over time.
Specifically, compared to our 1992 HRS baseline, more recent cohorts of women in their 50’s
and 60s’s are more likely to plan to work longer. When we explore the reasons for delayed
retirement among older women, factors include education, more marital disruption, and fewer
children than prior cohorts. But household finances also play a key role, in that older women
today have more debt than previously and are more financially fragile than in the past. The NFCS
data show that factors associated with retirement planning include having more education and
greater financial literacy. Those who report excessive amounts of debt and are financially fragile
are the least financially literate, had more dependent children, and experienced income shocks.
Thus shocks do play a role in older women’s debt status, but it is not enough to have resources:
people also need the capacity to manage those resources if they are to stay out of debt as they
head into retirement.

                       Older Women’s Labor Market Attachment,
                       Retirement Planning, and Household Debt
                            Annamaria Lusardi and Olivia S. Mitchell


       Economic research has shown convincingly that young and middle-aged women’s

attachment to the paid labor force has risen substantially over time in America. 1 To examine

whether this pattern might also characterize older women, this paper examines several cohorts of

older women in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) to document the size of possible future

changes, and to pinpoint which groups might be most likely to extend their work lives. In

addition, we investigate what role debt might play in older women’s continued work. For this we

examine the 2012 National Financial Capability Study (NFCS), which provides detailed

information on how older women appear to be managing their debt and their retirement planning

efforts. Our focus throughout is on descriptive analysis rather than proving causal links between

retirement and debt.

       Our findings from the HRS show that recent cohorts of older women were more likely to

be working at both ages 51–56 and 57–61 than the earliest cohort of the same age, first surveyed

in 1992. 2 Effects differ significantly over time, in that the mean probability of being at work for

the baseline HRS sample age 51–56 when surveyed was 64.9 percent, and 54.8 percent for those

age 57–61. All subsequent cohorts displayed higher rates of work, particularly for the age 51–56

cohort, controlling for other factors. Thus, there is a rising probability of working among older

women across cohorts.

 The 51–56 age cohorts of women were surveyed in 1992 (the HRS baseline group, born 1936-
1941), the 1998 War Babies (WB) group (born 1942–1947), the 2004 Early Baby Boomers
(EBB) cohort (born 1948–1953), and the 2010 Middle Baby Boomer (MBB) group (born 1954–
1959). The three 57–61 age cohorts of women were surveyed in 1992 for the baseline HRS
cohort, in 2004 for the WBB; and in 2010 for the EBB.
                                                                                                 2



        We also find that recent cohorts of women drawing near to retirement have more debt

than before, and this is positively associated with older women being more likely to work

currently, as well as to plan to continue to work in the future. Somewhat surprisingly, total debt

more than doubled in constant dollars, and older women were increasingly likely to hold

mortgage debt in excess of half their residential value in recent waves. Additionally, the

percentage of women having less than $25,000 in savings for recent cohorts is roughly double

that of the earlier cohorts.

        We also draw on data from the 2012 NFCS to explore the factors associated with

retirement planning, debt and debt management, and an indicator of financial fragility. As shown

in previous work, planning for retirement is associated with better retirement security (Lusardi

and Mitchell 2007a, 2011a, 2014). Moreover, many people are found to pay high interest and

fees on the debt they carry, and debt is part of household balance sheets throughout the lifetime

and even close to retirement (Lusardi and Tufano, 2015; Lusardi and Mitchell, 2013). Correlates

of retirement planning include having higher income, more education, and greater financial

literacy for both age groups we evaluate (age 51–56 and 57–61). Factors associated with over-

indebtedness and financial fragility include lower financial literacy, having more financially

dependent children, and experiencing unexpected and large income declines. Accordingly,

shocks do play a role in the accumulation of debt close to retirement. Nevertheless, it is not

enough to have resources: people also need the capacity to manage those resources if they are to

stay out of debt and find retirement security at older ages.

Prior Studies

        Many prior studies have explored American women’s labor supply patterns over time

(c.f., Goldin, 2006; Attanasio, Low, and Sanchez-Marcos, 2008; Michaud and Rohwedder,

2015). Yet there has been relatively little work focusing on cohort changes in older women’s

participation patterns and debt, as well as financial literacy. In this section we review relevant

literature on these issues.

        Several authors have evaluated the links between debt management and financial literacy,

and they have concluded that the least financially literate incurred high fees and used high-cost

borrowing. The least financially knowledgeable also report that their debt loads were excessive

and they were often unable to judge their debt positions (Lusardi and Tufano, 2015, and the

references therein). This group was also more likely to borrow from their 401(k) and pension

accounts (Lu, Mitchell, and Utkus, 2010; Utkus and Young, 2011) and use high-cost methods of

borrowing, such as payday loans (Lusardi and de Bassa Scheresberg, 2013).

        There has been some research linking the quality of financial decision making and age,

and the findings offer little reason for complacency. For instance, one influential study (Agarwal

et al., 2009) found that the quality of financial decision making fell at an older age in 10 financial

areas, including credit card balance transfers; home equity loans and lines of credit; auto loans;

credit card interest rates; mortgages; small-business credit cards; credit card late-payment fees;

credit card over-the-limit fees; and credit card cash-advance fees. Older persons pay higher

financial service fees and interest.

        In the wake of the financial crisis, these age-linked patterns are now translating into an

awareness that older Americans are nearing retirement with increasingly concerning levels of
                                                                                                 4



debt. 3 For instance debt held by borrowers age 50–80 rose roughly 60% between 2003 and 2015,

while aggregate debt balances held by younger borrowers declined modestly (Brown et al.,

2016). Much of this rise consisted of home mortgages, held by over half (55%) of the American

population age 55–64, and about the same fraction (50%) had credit card debt (Bucks et al.,

2009). Moreover, among people age 65–74, two-thirds held some form of debt, almost half had

mortgages or other loans on their primary residences, over one-third held credit card debt, and a

quarter had installment loans. In recent years, on average, older borrowers held substantially

more debt than did borrowers of the same age in the 1990s: for instance Lusardi and Mitchell

(2013) showed that the percentage of people age 56–61 having debt swelled to 71% in 2008, up

from 64% in 1992. Additionally, the value of their debt rose sharply over time. Median

household debt in 1992 was about $6,200, but by 2002 it had more than tripled. By 2008, it was

$28,300—more than quadruple the 1992 level.

       Accompanying this trend has been an increase in the proportion of older Americans filing

for bankruptcy over time: people age 65+ are the fastest-growing group in terms of bankruptcy

filings, which stood at 2% in 1991 and rose to over three times that rate by 2007 (Pottow, 2012).

Credit card interest and fees were the most-cited reason for bankruptcy filings by older people,

with two-thirds of them providing this reason. 4 Moreover, there is also a continuing tendency of

Securian (2013), Lusardi and Mitchell (2013), and the references therein.

  Other data sources confirm these findings. People age 55+ hold widespread credit card debt and
pay a great deal in fees for late payments and exceeding credit limits, and this at a time when
they should be at the peak of their wealth accumulation process (Lusardi, 2011; Lusardi and
Tufano, 2015). Data from the 2012 National Financial Capability Study highlighted that 60% of
pre-retirees had at least one source of long-term debt, and 26% had at least two. Nearly 40% of
pre-retirees used credit cards expensively, and the same percentage felt heavily indebted (Lusardi
and de Bassa Scheresberg, 2014). Other surveys suggest similar conclusions. The 2013 Survey of
Consumer Finances showed that family net worth—the difference between families’ gross assets
and their liabilities—generally increases with age, with a plateau or modest decreases for the
                                                                                                 5



women filing for bankruptcy more often than men, and women report being overextended on

credit as the key reason for filing (Institute for Financial Literacy, 2011).

       Another key factor spurring the increase in debt over time has been the much higher

prices paid by recent cohorts for housing, and their resulting larger residential mortgages. For

example, the median amount older homeowners owed on mortgages increased 82 percent from

approximately $43,400 in 2001 to $79,000 in 2011. Further, data show older consumers owe

more on their mortgages in relation to the value of their homes than their peers did a decade ago.

The outstanding balance on their mortgages relative to the value of their homes (debt-to-value

ratio) increased from 30 percent to 46 percent between 2001 and 2011 (CFPB, 2014). Until 2009,

single women—the fastest growing segment of the housing market—purchased more homes than

single men. Since, on average, women pay more for their mortgages than do men, it is

unsurprising that mortgage debt is reported to be especially high among older women (Drew,

2006; Clark, 2015; Cheng, Lin, and Liu, 2011).

       A related point is that subprime mortgage lenders targeted minority, elderly, and female

buyers in the years leading up to the financial crisis. Prior to the financial crisis, female

homebuyers were 32 percent more likely to have subprime mortgage loans, despite having higher

credit scores on average (U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee, 2008). These mortgages,

which made up only 13 percent of all home loans but accounted for 55 percent of foreclosure

starts, left older Americans vulnerable, and when housing prices sharply declined many turned to

delinquency (Leland, 2008). This led to a fivefold rise in the serious delinquency rate between




oldest age groups relative to the near-retirement age groups (Bricker et al., 2014). The median
net wealth of near retirees (households headed by someone between the ages of 55 and 64) was
lower in 2013 than in 1989 (Rosnick and Baker, 2014).
                                                                                                6



2001 and 2011 for mortgage holders age 65–74 (CFPB, 2014), underscoring the risk of holding

such high levels of debt at older ages.

        There is also evidence that rapid changes in housing prices altered older Americans’

labor market attachment. For example, Begley and Chan (2015) explored the relationship

between unanticipated changes in housing wealth, such as those experienced during the Great

Recession, and retirement behavior by examining how the variation in the timing of housing

price influenced work effort. They showed that women experiencing large negative housing

price shocks were 25% less likely to retire relative to those experiencing positive shocks.

Moreover, homeowners having mortgages were less likely to retire (if not yet retired) or more

likely to reverse retirement (if already retired). Farnham and Sevak (2016) found that people

responded to rising home prices by revising down their expected retirement ages. Specifically,

they estimated that a 10% real increase in home value reduced expected retirement ages by about

four months. One might anticipate that the mechanism worked in reverse when housing prices

fell during the financial crisis and thereafter.

        The trend in debt is attracting increasing attention from the media, with recent articles

exhorting people to cut their debt as they near retirement (e.g., Derousseau, 2016). Additionally

the high and rising levels of household debt are increasingly troubling older persons as well

(FINRA, 2006, 2007; United States Government Accountability Office, 2015). For instance just

9% of workers in 2016 who described their debt as a major problem said they were very

confident of having enough money to live comfortably throughout retirement. Yet retirement

saving efforts are still lagging, according to the 2016 Retirement Confidence Survey (RCS)
                                                                                                  7



(Blakely, VanDerhei, and Copeland, 2016). Instead, people who admitted they were undersaving

indicated that they would likely cope with the shortfall by either saving more or working longer. 5

       In what follows we contribute to the literature by examining cohort changes in older

women’s work plans and debt burdens using the HRS, as well as the links between financial

literacy and debt stresses in the NFCS. Our results point to the need for boosting older women’s

retirement security and the important role of managing debt later in life.



Cohort Trends in Continued Work and the Role of Debt in the HRS

       In this section we analyze distinct cohorts of older women observed in the HRS, a

nationally representative survey of respondents over the age of 50. Specifically, we focus on four

birth cohorts of women first surveyed when age 51–56, and three cohorts of women surveyed

when age 57–61, so as to evaluate each of them on the verge of retirement. We utilize extensive

information gathered by the HRS about these women’s current employment status and future

work plans, along with their sociodemographic characteristics, including marital and family

histories. In so doing, we evaluate whether there are statistically significant differences across

the cohorts after controlling for other factors. We also evaluate whether these factors are

correlated with anticipated future work. Finally, we evaluate the extent to which the older

women’s cohorts differ with regard to how much debt they held as they entered their 50’s. This

permits us to evaluate whether rising levels of debt might be significantly associated with plans

to continue working at older ages.

Cohort Differences


5
  This is somewhat worrisome since some retirees indicate that they could not work longer
because they were forced to leave the workforce earlier than planned (for reasons such as health
problems or disability) (Banerjee, 2014).
                                                                                                  8



          For the cohort analysis, we examine four groups of women initially surveyed when they

were age 51–56, and three different groups age 5761. This is facilitated by the structure of the

HRS (see Figure 1), which periodically enrolls refresher cohorts over time. For the age 51–56

group, we include those first surveyed in 1992 (the HRS baseline group, born 1936–1941), the

1998 War Babies (WB) group (born 1942–1947), the 2004 Early Baby Boomers (EBB) cohort

(born 1948–1953), and the 2010 Middle Baby Boomer (MBB) group (born 1954–1959). The

three 57–61 age cohorts of women were surveyed in 1992 for the baseline HRS cohort, in 2004

for the WB; and in 2010 for the EBB. 6

Figure 1 here

          Our empirical modeling in each case involves multivariate analysis of each respective

outcome variable (y) on a vector of cohort dummies, where the HRS baseline is the reference

category. The main outcomes analyzed are an indicator of the respondents’ current employment

status, and their estimated chances of working at age 65. In both cases, the estimated coefficients

on the cohort dummies refer to the differential behavior of subsequent cohorts versus the HRS

baseline 1992 cohort. In all cases we control for the respondent’s age, race (White vs other), and

ethnicity (Hispanic vs other). These factors are, of course, most likely to be exogenous to past

work patterns. We also control for the respondent’s years of education, whether she had

experienced marital disruption (ever divorced or widowed), whether she was in fair or poor

health, her number of children, and ratios of her household primary residence and other debt to,

respectively, housing value and liquid assets. These factors permit us to ascertain whether what

might appear to be cohort differences could instead be associated with differences in socio-

economic and demographic factors over time, including changes in financial markets and the

    Descriptive statistics for our sample appear in Appendix 1.
                                                                                                    9



increased opportunities to borrow and take on debt. The entire sample includes slightly over

6,700 women age 51–56 and around 4,200 women age 57–61.

           Our first set of results examines whether women reported working for pay at the time of

their interview, and Table 1 reports coefficient estimates of the linear probability analysis. Panel

A provides results for current work among the women age 51–56 when surveyed, while Panel B

looks at the same outcomes for the older age 57–61 groups. For both age groups, the first column

excludes debt to asset ratio variables, while the second two includes them to allow comparison of

results.

Table 1 here

           Looking across the first three rows of coefficient estimates it is clear that, compared to

the first HRS baseline group, recent cohorts of women were increasingly likely to be working in

their 50’s. The mean probability of being at work for the baseline HRS sample age 51–56 when

surveyed was 64.9 percent, and 54.8 percent for those age 57–61. All subsequent cohorts

displayed higher rates of work, particularly for the age 51–56 cohort. For instance, younger WB

women age 51–56 had about a 7 percentage point greater labor force attachment, or around 11%

higher than the HRS reference cohort. Early Boomer women age 51–56 were 5.3–5.7 percentage

points more attached to the labor force, or 8% more than the HRS, while the older group (age

57–61) of Early Boomers had participation rates of 4.7–6.2 percentage points higher, or 8–11%

more than the HRS reference group. The younger Middle Boomers also were working more than

the reference group, with 3.8–4.5 percentage point greater employment rates, or 6–7% versus the

HRS reference cohort.
                                                                                                   10



       The measured effects are also robust to the inclusion or exclusion of the financial

variables, as are virtually all of the other coefficient estimates. 7 In other words, these estimates

confirm that the probability of working rose across the cohorts compared to the HRS baseline.

Nevertheless, the magnitudes were somewhat larger for the younger WB group, a bit less for the

Early Boomers, and smallest (though still statistically significantly different from zero) for the

MBB age group. Among the older women, the Early Boomers were substantially more likely to

be working compared to the baseline HRS.

       Turning to Table 2, we see that among the HRS cohort, 22.5 percent of the younger age

group (51–56) and 23.4 of the older age group intended to still work at age 65. Interestingly,

there is no significant difference between the HRS cohort and the War Babies in terms of the

women’s plans to continue working, but both Boomer cohorts were significantly more likely to

say they intended to work at age 65, compared to the original HRS cohort. 8               Moreover,

intentions to work at age 65 rose over time. That is, the age 51–56 Early Boomers were about

3.6–3.7 percentage points (or 16%) more likely to work at age 65, where the Middle Boomers

were 7.7–7.9 percentage points (or 35%) more likely to plan to work longer, compared to the

benchmark. For the older group (age 57–61) the increase was similar in percentage points (4.7–

5.1) but as it was measured on a slightly higher base, the 20% increase was slightly lower. In any

case, the most recent cohorts for which we have data appear to be notably more attached to the

labor force into their mid-60’s. As before, comparing Panels A in Tables 1 and 2, we again see

  In results not detailed here, we have explored additional models where we interacted the debt
variables with marital disruption to test whether including these terms alters the estimated cohort
effects. Doing so does not change conclusions reported in the text.
8
  The reader is reminded that the question about chances of working at age 65 was asked only of
those working when surveyed at a younger age.
                                                                                                    11



that the magnitudes of the cohort effects are relatively invariant to including additional controls. 9

Therefore little of what we have attributed to cohort differences is associated with more recent

waves of older women having more education, higher rates of marital disruption, and fewer

children.

Table 2 here

Impacts of Other Factors

       We also seek to analyze the impact of other factors on women’s current and future work

patterns. Looking across Tables 1 and 2, we see that age is generally negative when statistically

significant, indicating that even within these narrow age bands, older women’s labor market

attachment does decline. Nevertheless the estimated age coefficients are only weakly significant

in Table 2 across the board, and not significant for the younger women in Table 1. Thus older

women’s workforce attachment does not decline in lockstep with age, by any means. Another

factor consistently significant and positively associated with work is years of educational

attainment, such that one more year of schooling is associated with a 3 percentage point higher

probability of women’s current work (Table 1), and a 0.8–1.1 percentage point higher chance of

working at age 65 (Table 2). Interestingly, women who were widowed or divorced (marital

disruption) are 6–8 percentage points more likely to be working currently, and they have an 8–9

percentage point greater expectation of working at age 65. Poor health is quite important in terms

of explaining work patterns for both age groups: those in fair/poor health were 28–30 percentage

points less likely to be working, and among workers, 10–14 percentage points less likely to

project that they would still be working at age 65. Accordingly, women in good health or better

Doing so does not change conclusions reported in the text.

are much more likely to report they will remain employed at age 65. Finally, the number of

children has a significant negative effect on older women’s current employment but only for the

51–56 age group, and the impact is small (-0.9 percentage points).

What Role for Debt?

       The last two rows of Tables 1 and 2 speak to the question of how debt is associated with

older women’s work patterns, a topic of substantial current interest (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2013).

Our findings indicate that mortgage debt, in particular, is associated with a higher probability of

women working for pay and expecting to be working at age 65. For instance, an increase of a

standard deviation in the ratio of mortgage debt to home value 10 in Table 1 is associated with a

3.4 percentage point rise (or 5%) in younger women’s anticipated probability of working at age

65. This is in line with Fortin (1995), who suggested that liquidity constraints related to home

down payments prompted many women to work more. The effect we discern here is

complimentary, suggesting that older women may defer retirement due to the need to help repay

their mortgage debt. The effect is even larger, at 5.5 percentage points (or 10%), for the 57- to

61-year-old group. The second debt variable we included in the model, the ratio of nonmortgage

debt to liquid assets, is generally small and not statistically significant across Tables 1 and 2.

       To further examine the role of debt, we note that previous research has reported that

people are reaching retirement age today holding more debt than in the past. 11 Accordingly, we

devote some additional attention to various measures of older women’s debt and financial

fragility across cohorts in Table 3.

   See, for instance, Lusardi and Mitchell (2013); AARP (2013); Bucks et al. (2009); Butrica and
Karamcheva (2013); Copeland (2013), and Pottow (2012).
                                                                                                     13



       Results show that Baby Boomer cohorts are more likely to have debt later in life for both

age groups (51–56 and 57–61) compared to the baseline HRS cohort (Panel 1). Moreover, recent

cohorts have higher levels of total debt late in life (Panel 2). It is also striking that cohort mean

and median debt levels have been steadily rising over time. For example, while the median (p50)

debt of the HRS baseline was a little more than $15,000 for women age 51–56, this level almost

tripled for the Middle Baby Boomers ($43,200; all values are in $2015). Increases in debt are

even more striking for the older group of women age 57–61: the EBB cohort had almost eight

times as much debt as the baseline HRS cohort ($31,320 versus $4,175).

        One reason for such a large expansion in debt is that households have taken on larger

mortgages in recent years. This is the pattern we observe for both of the age groups we examine

(Panel 3 of Table 3). Mortgages, along with loans related to the primary residence, not only grew

in absolute value but they also rose as a percentage of the value of the primary residence. These

ratios more than doubled for the older respondents: while the older HRS baseline cohort (age 57–

61) neared retirement with a ratio of mortgages and loans on the value of the primary residence

of 0.11, this ratio grew to 0.28 for the Early Boomers. Moreover, older women are more likely to

be in households where the ratio of mortgage debt to residential value has doubled, from 18% to

32%, comparing the Middle Boomers to the HRS baseline cohort. This implies that many older

women will need to manage mortgage debt well into their older years, consistent with the

findings reported by Lusardi and Mitchell (2013). In other words, during retirement, Boomer

cohorts will have to use their income and assets to repay debt, in contrast to the earlier cohort.

       And even more striking is the fact that higher proportions of older women are in

financially fragile circumstances compared to two decades ago. Only 18% of the younger HRS
                                                                                                  14



cohorts had less than $25,000 in savings, 12 whereas one-third of the MBB group reported having

so little savings (Panel 4). We conclude that higher debt levels in later life could well be

contributing to rising labor force attachment among older women.



Financial Frailty at Older Ages: Findings from the NFCS

           To further explore how older women are managing their debt and retirement planning, we

draw on the 2012 wave of the National Financial Capability Study (NFCS). 13 The overarching

research objectives of the NFCS are to benchmark key indicators of financial capability and

evaluate how these indicators vary with underlying demographic, behavioral, attitudinal and

financial literacy characteristics. 14 The 2012 NFCS is a state-by-state online survey of

approximately 25,000 American adults (roughly 500 per state, plus the District of Columbia) that

is representative of the U.S. population. 15 In order to thoroughly explore the financial capability

of Americans, the NFCS covers several aspects of behavior, including how people manage their

resources, how they make financial decisions, what skill sets they use in making these decisions,

and how they search for information when making these decisions (Lusardi, 2011).

           Consistent with the HRS analysis above, we again focus on two separate age groups of

women in the NFCS: age 51–56 and age 57–61. There are over 1,800 observations for the first
12
     Savings is defined as total net worth or total assets minus total debt.
13
   The data are publicly available at http://www.usfinancialcapability.org/ The first survey was
fielded in 2009, and it is slated to be repeated triennially.
14
   FINRA Investor Education Foundation commissioned the NFCS in 2009 in consultation with
the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the President’s Advisory Council on Financial Literacy.
The 2012 Study—similarly developed in consultation with the U.S. Department of the Treasury,
other federal agencies, and President Obama’s Advisory Council on Financial Capability—
updated key measures from the 2009 Study and deepened the exploration of topics that are
highly relevant for research and policy. Lusardi serves as academic advisor to the Study.
15
   In our analysis, data are weighted to be representative of the national population as a whole in
terms of age, gender, ethnicity, and education, based on the Census Bureau’s American
Community Survey. However, breakdowns of sub-populations may not necessarily be
representative.
                                                                                                15



age group and around 1,300 for the second. The empirical analysis evaluates whether older

women tried to figure out how much they need to save for retirement, their perceived level of

indebtedness, and their financial fragility, which relies on respondent answers to whether they

could come up with $2,000 in 30 days if an unexpected need arose. 16

       To this end, Table 4 displays descriptive statistics for women age 51–56 in Panel A, and

for women 57–61 in Panel B. Here we see that the sample is mostly married, white, working, and

has at least some college education. The older women (57–61) indicated they were more likely to

plan for retirement (or to have planned, if they had retired), but fewer than half (45%) had tried

to figure out how much they needed to put aside for retirement, versus 39% of women age 51–

56. Moreover, many of them indicate they are carrying too much debt (43% of those age 51–56

and 39% of those age 57–61) and that they are financially fragile (43% of the younger and 39%

of the older group). This is consistent with the HRS evidence showing high levels of debt on the

verge of retirement.

Table 4 here

       Other indicators of financial distress are reported in Table 5. Results show that about a

third of women (age 51–56) are able to easily cover their expenses in a typical month, or have set

aside emergency or rainy day funds that would cover expenses for three months. NFCS data



16
   The precise wording of the questions are (1) Retirement planning: Have you ever tried to
figure out how much you need to save for retirement? Or, if already retired: Before you retired,
did you try to figure out how much you needed to save for retirement? Possible answers: yes, no,
don’t know, prefer not to say. (2) Debt: How strongly do you agree or disagree with the
following statement: I have too much debt right now. Please give your answer from a scale from
1 to 7, where 1=strongly disagree, 7=strongly agree and 4=neither agree nor disagree.
Possible answers: 1–7; don’t know, prefer not to say. (3) Financial fragility: How confident are
you that you could come up with $2000 if an unexpected need arose within the next month?
Possible answers: I am certain I could come up with the full $2,000, I could probably come up
with $2,000, I could probably not come up with $2,000, I am certain I could not come up with
$2,000, don’t know, prefer not to say.
                                                                                                  16



confirms that mortgage debt and other debts turn out to be problematic for a relatively large

subset of women. Twenty percent of the female homeowners in the younger age group and 15

percent in the older age group report being underwater, owing more on their homes than they

thought they could sell them for. As far as non-mortgage debt is concerned, many women said

they did not pay off credit card balances in full (if they had them), and they engaged in many

costly credit card behaviors such as paying only the minimum due, using the card for cash

advances, being charged fees for late payment, or exceeding the limits. These findings

underscore the point that many older women are exposed to illiquidity and/or problems in debt

management. Turning to other indicators, many older women reported having unpaid medical

bills, and having engaged in high-cost borrowing using alternative financial services, such as

rent-to-own stores, pawn shops, payday loans, auto title loans, and tax refund loans.

Table 5 here

       The NFCS also included a set of questions to assess respondents’ levels of financial

literacy. Five questions were asked to test fundamental concepts regarding numeracy and the

capacity to do calculations related to interest rates, knowledge of inflation, risk diversification,

understanding of interest payments on a mortgage, and understanding of basic asset pricing

(Lusardi, 2011). Table 6 reports the proportion of correct and incorrect answers and the “do not

know” responses to each of these questions. Overall, we find that financial literacy is rather low.

A large fraction of women does not know simple financial concepts, and many indicate that they

do not know the answer to the questions. The proportion of “do not know” responses was

particularly high on the risk diversification question; as many as 52% of women age 51–56 and

51% of women age 57–61 indicated that they did not know whether a single company stock is

riskier than a stock mutual fund. There is also a high proportion of “do not know” responses for
                                                                                                  17



the question on asset pricing. These two questions will help us differentiate among different

degrees of financial literacy among older women.

Table 6 here

Multivariate Regression Analysis

       Next we present multivariate linear probability analyses of indicators of financial

planning, debt, and financial fragility. For the first dependent variable, we use the NFCS

question about whether respondents ever tried to figure out how much they need to save for

retirement. This is an important question in light of prior research showing that planners

accumulate far more retirement wealth than non-planners (Lusardi, 1999; Lusardi and Beeler,

2007; Lusardi and Mitchell, 2007a, b; 2011a, b). In addition to the regressors used in the HRS

analysis, namely age and ethnicity, we also control for marital status, education, income (using

dummies), and number of children. In addition, the richness of the NFCS allows us to control for

whether respondents experienced a large and unexpected drop in income the previous year, and

also the respondent’s level of financial literacy (defined as the number of correct answers to the

five financial literacy questions). Results are reported in the first column of Table 7.

Table 7 here

       Both Panels A and B in Table 7 confirm that higher education and income are strongly

positively correlated with women having tried to figure out how much to save for retirement

among both age groups. Their number of dependent children is negatively associated with the

probability of having tried to plan for women age 51–56 but not for the older group, suggesting

some potential for a ‘catch-up’ after children leave home. Interestingly, financial literacy is also

an important determinant of financial planning: being able to answer one additional financial

literacy question correctly is associated with a 4–6 percentage point higher probability of
                                                                                                18



figuring out how much to put aside for retirement. This is a reasonably large result, in view of

the fact that only 39–45% of the respondents indicated they had tried to plan for retirement

(Table 4). This finding is consistent with data from the 2009 wave of the NFCS (Lusardi and

Mitchell, 2011b) where we use a very similar empirical specification, but we use all respondents

and all age groups, and other surveys as well that use different measures of planning (Lusardi

and Mitchell, 2014). This finding is also consistent with data from a special module we designed

for the HRS on retirement planning and financial literacy; in that work we showed that financial

literacy is an important predictor of retirement planning for older women as well (Lusardi and

Mitchell, 2008).

       Next we turn to respondents’ answers to the NFCS question about their degree of

agreement with the statement: “I have too much debt right now.” We use this variable to proxy

for peoples’ concerns about their debt, since debt levels (as reported in the HRS) are not

available in the NFCS. Results are reported in column (2) of Table 7 for both age groups (Panels

A and B).

       Once again, we find that women who report having too much debt are also those with

more dependent children, with the effect among the older age group almost three times as large

as for those age 51–56. Shocks also matter: those having had a large unexpected income drop in

the prior year were 68–78 percentage points more likely to state that they were over-indebted.

Those with higher income (income greater than $100,000 for women age 51–56 and income

greater than $150,000 for women age 57–61) are less likely to have too much debt. And once

again, the more financially literate were less likely to report they had excessive debt (answering

one more financial literacy question decreases the probability of “too much debt” by 8–10

percentage points), confirming findings in other surveys and other age groups (Lusardi and
                                                                                                19



Tufano, 2015). In other words, shocks do contribute to debt concerns for women on the verge of

retirement, but people who have the capacity to manage their resources are more likely to stay

out of debt as they head into retirement.

       The financial fragility measure available in the NFCS is a proxy for low savings. While

the HRS reports whether women have less than $25,000 in savings, the NFCS asks if they could

come up with $2,000 within a month (multiplying that figure by 12 would bring $24,000).

Findings in column (3) of Table 7 show that, for both age groups, having more dependent

children and having experienced an income shock are positively and significantly associated with

the probability of being financially fragile. Those with higher income are less likely to be

financially fragile. Moreover, those who are more financially literate have a lower probability of

being financially fragile.



Conclusions

       Our goal in this paper has been to ascertain whether older women’s current and

anticipated future labor force patterns have changed over time, and if so, to evaluate the factors

associated with longer work lives and plans to continue work at older ages. We have also sought

to evaluate debt and debt management as a factor spurring older women’s continued work.

       The analysis has yielded several findings. First, we show that each cohort of older women

worked more currently, and intended to work more in the future, than our HRS baseline surveyed

in 1992. The mean probability of being at work for the baseline HRS sample (age 51–56 when

surveyed) was 64.9 percent, and 54.8 percent for those age 57–61. All subsequent cohorts

displayed higher rates of work, particularly the age 51–56 cohort. For instance, younger WB

women age 51–56 had about a 7 percentage point greater labor force attachment, or around 11%
                                                                                                 20



higher, than the HRS reference cohort. Early Boomer women age 51–56 were 5.3–5.7 percentage

points more attached to the labor force, or 8% more than the HRS, while the older (age 57–61)

Early Boomers had participation rates of 4.7–6.2 percentage points higher, or 8–11% more than

the HRS reference group. The younger Mid-Boomers also were working more than the reference

group, with 3.8–4.5 percentage point greater employment rates, or 6–7% versus the HRS

reference cohort.

       Second, when we compare differences in older women’s self-reported expected chances

of working at older ages, again we find evidence that more recent cohorts of older women

anticipate working longer. For the baseline HRS cohort, 22.5% of the younger age group and

23.4 of the older age group intended to still work at age 65. By contrast, both the Early and

Middle Baby Boomer cohorts were significantly more likely to say they intended to work at age

65. Early Boomers believed they had a 4–5 percentage point higher chance of working than the

HRS cohort (on a base of about 26%), and the Middle Boomers were even more likely to be

working for pay at age 65 compared to the HRS reference group. These patterns confirm that

continued work and delayed retirement is becoming more prevalent for older women over time.

       Third, when we explored the explanations for delayed retirement among older women,

significant factors included education, marital disruption, health, and fewer children than prior

cohorts. Yet household finances also appeared to be playing a key role, in that older women

today have more debt than previously, and they are more financially fragile than in the past. As

an example, we showed that a standard deviation increase in the ratio of mortgage debt to home

value was associated with a 3.4–5.5% rise in women’s anticipated probability of working at age

65. In large part this can be attributed to having taken on larger residential mortgages due to the

run-up in housing prices over time and decline in required down payments.
                                                                                                 21



       Our results using the NFCS are compatible with the HRS results, but the richer set of

questions asked in the NFCS add additional dimensions to the results. For instance we found that

women who were more financially literate were more likely to plan for retirement, were less

likely to have excessive debt, and were less likely to be financially fragile. Having more children

and unexpected, large income shocks also played an important role. Overall, these findings speak

to the important role of managing finances later in life, including debt.

       Our work to date has been mainly descriptive rather than causal, but we are well aware

that planning, saving, and retirement decisions are all made in a life-cycle context. Accordingly

our future research will explore ways to identify how financial literacy, planning, and debt

management can help drive decision making at older ages which can be conducive to retirement

security.

Coefficient estimates from linear probability analysis, standard errors in parentheses. Controls for missing
values included where relevant. The 51–56 age cohorts of women were surveyed in 1992 (the HRS
baseline group, born 1936–1941), the 1998 War Babies (WB) group (born 1942–1947), the 2004 Early
Baby Boomers (EBB) cohort (born 1948–1953), and the 2010 Middle Baby Boomer (MBB) group (born
1954–1959). The three 57–61 age cohorts of women were surveyed in 1992 for the baseline HRS cohort,
in 2004 for the WB; and in 2010 for the EBB. Martial disruption defined as divorced/separated or
widowed; All 1ry Res Loans/1ry Res Value is defined as the value of all primary residence loans divided
by the value of the primary residence; and Other debt/liquid assets is defined as the ratio of other debt to
liquid assets (excluding the home). See also Appendix 1.

Note: The sample includes all age-eligible women age 51–56 and 57–61 in the 2012 NFCS. Financial
literacy refers to the number of correct answers to 5 financial literacy questions. Income shock refers to a
dummy variable for those who experience a large drop in income in the previous 12 months that they did
not expect. Financial planning is coded as 1 for those who tried to figure out how much they need to save
for retirement. Having too much debt refers to respondents who chose values 5, 6, or 7 (on a scale from 1
to 7) when asked to evaluate if they have too much debt. Financial fragility is coded as 1 for those who
probably or certainly could not come up with $2,000 within the next month. All statistics are weighted
using survey weights.

meet refers to the ability to balance monthly income and expenses. Statistics related to underwater with
home value and credit card fees are conditional on holding the asset or debt. Statistics related to loan on
retirement accounts and hardship withdrawal from retirement accounts are conditional to having a
retirement account. High-cost methods of borrowing refer to auto title loans, payday loans, pawn shops,
rent-to-own stores, and tax refund loans. All statistics are weighted using survey weights.

Note: Coefficient estimates from analysis reported in the text, standard errors in parentheses. Retirement planning coded as 1 for those who tried to figure out how much
they need to save for retirement. Having too much debt ranges from 1 to 7, where 1 means I strongly disagree and 7 I strongly agree with the statement “I have too
much debt right now.” Financial fragility coded as 1 for those certain or probably could not come up with $2,000. Explanatory variables include age, race/ethnicity,
marital status, number of financially dependent children, education, income, having experienced an income shock, and an indicator of financial literacy. Baseline
categories: White, married, less than high school education, and income lower than $15,000. Weighted data. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1
