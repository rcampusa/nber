                             Argentina:
                 Debt and Macroeconomic Instability




                             ABSTRACT




        The paper reviews the Argentine debt experience in the past

ten years. The emphasis is on the interaction between relative prices,

financial instability, budget .deficits, inflation and debt

accumulation. A longer run perspective shows that the continuing

fiscal problems have stood in the way of investment and growth.

        In 1985, after 40 years of financial instability, Argentina reached

once again near—hyperinflation conditions. Budget deficits were the immediate

cause, but the deeper roots must be seen in ill—fated policy experiments of

the 1970s. The destructive pendulum between populists and market-oriented

reformists has meant that much of national wealth is held abroad, taxes are

paid by only few and the general atmosphere is one of scepticism about

everything Argentinian. Mallon and Sourrouille (1975) have drawn attention to

this steady conflict when they write


              "Decision makers in Argentina have quite consistently attempted
      to adopt policy positions that seemed designed to tear society apart
      rather than to forge new coalitions.... Major policy disagreements in
      modern Argentina history have their main roots in the conflict between
      two divergent streams of thought: liberalism of the British Manchester
      School variety and what can be called national populism.. . In general the
      liberals have stood for the virtues of a society open to international
      opportunities and influences, whereas the national populists have
      emphasized indigenous, autonomous development."

        Our study investigates the interaction between domestic macroeconomic

instability and external constraints. We study these relationships by focusing

on the past decade in which four very different periods can be distinguished.

        The Martinez de Hoz period of the 1970s (march 76—march 81) when
external debts were accumulated in the context of an incompatible mix of
policies: large, persistent deficits, a strongly overvalued currency and
liberalization of capital flows.

        •The period running from the end of the 1970s to the hyperinflation.
In this period debt and foreign exchange problems, war and domestic politics,
are the reasons for an inflation explosion.

A. Longrun Perspective

        Although we only focus on the past ten years we place our analysis in

a longer run context. This is appropriate since debt problems and financial

crises are at least 100 years old in Argentina. One hundred years ago

Argentina's inability to service foreign the debt nearly brought down the City

of London in the famous Baring panic of 1890; the famous Tornquist monetary

reform dates back to 1899.

        It is important to view developments in this long term perspective

because it highlights how Argentina has lost its position in the world economy

steadily during this century.2 Carlos Diaz Alejandro (1970,p.l) reminds us of

this decline:

      "It is common nowadays to lump the Argentine economy in the same
      category with the economies of other Latin American nations. Some

       opinion even puts it among such less developed nations as India and
       Nigeria. Yet most economists writing during the first three decades of
       this century would have placed Argentina among the most advanced
       countries——with Western Europe, the United States, Canada and Australia.
       To have called Argentina "underdeveloped" in the sense that word has
       today would have been considered laughable."


            If in 1900 Argentina had a U.S. standard of living then the decline

has been long and deep. Summers and Heston (1985) estimate that in 1950

Argentina had only 41 percent of the U.S. standard of living (against 80

percent in Australia and Canada). By 1985 the standard of living had slipped

to only 30 percent of the U.S. level. Figure 1 shows the level of per capita

real income in Argentina over the past 45 years.

        There is a striking difference between the steady expansion of the

thirty years to 1975 and the stagnation and decline that have occurred since

then. The contrast could not be stronger: From 1945 to 1975 per capita income

grew at an annual rate of 1.7 percent. From 1975 to 1985 it fell at an annual

rate of 1.7 percent.

        The other dimension in which Argentinian performance has shown a

dramatic deterioration is inflation and fiscal stability. Of course, there

have been frequent precedents of massive inflation and depreciation. But the

experience of the past decade, with two near—hyperinflations stands out. In

1899 Banker's Magazine already reported of South Americans and their

currency:


       • . [they] are always in trouble about their currency. Either it is too

     good for home use, or, as frequently happens, it is too bad for foreign

        exchange. Generally they have too much of it, but their own idea is that
        they never have enough.. the Argentines alter their currency almost as
        frequently as they change presidents.. No people in the world take a
        keener interest in currency experiments than the Argentines."


         The experience with the destruction of the financial system in the

past fifteen years has certainly reinforced that keen interest and expertise.

Figure 2 shows the monthly rate of inflation since 1970. In interpreting the

graph one should bear in mind that a monthly rate of inflation of 6 percent

corresponds to 100 percent per year and 22 percent per month yields an annual

rate of 1000 percent. Inflation passed 1000 percent both in the Peronist

period of 1975—76 and again in the pre—Austral period of early 1985. At no

time in the past ten years did they fall below 100 percent for any length of

time.

         The third broad feature that we want to draw attention to concerns the

real exchange rate. This is key price in any economy and even more so in

Argentina. Figure 3 shows the real exchange rate measured as the ratio of

Argentine manufactured prices relative to those of her trading partners.4

         The extraordinary variations in Argentina's external competitiveness

tie closely with the macroeconomic policy mistakes, capital flight induced by

these mistakes and the present debt crisis. The outstanding episode, clearly

apparent in Figure 3, is the real appreciation of 1979—1981. For the period

1970—78 the real exchange rate averaged 73; it increased to 108 over the next

three years before declining back to an average of 75 in the 1982—86 period.

By March 1987 it had fallen to almost a third of the peak value during the

period of most extreme overvaluation. The swings in the real exchange rate

capture best the seesaw nature of Argentine policies. In some periods

unimaginable damage is done to the productive and financial structure and then

a period of repair follows where austerity and real' depreciation restore the

base for yet another political, fiscal or foreign exchange adventure.

          Table 1 shows the debt accumulation over the past 15 years. There is

considerable uncertainty about the size of the external debt prior to the late

1970s and available estimates from various official sources vary widely.

Estimates of the BCRA show that debt varied between $2.5 and 3 billion in the

1960s, starting with about the same level as it ended. But from 1970 on

external debt steadily increases both for the private and for the public

sector. Between 1970 and 1977 the external debt rises by $6 billion and in the

next four years by more than $30 billion.

            With this broad overview of the past decade we now turn to a review of

 the principal episodes. We use these episodes to describe and explain their

relevance to the debt problem, or the role of the external debt in creating

domestic macroeconomic difficulties. A brief chronology of dates and important

facts help place the events in context:



The Martinez de IIoz Period (3/1976—3/1981): When de Hoz assumed power as

finance minister of the military government consumer prices in the previous

month had increased at an annual rate of 5000 percent, output had declined

sharply. The black market premium for foreign exchange exceeded 200 percent.

The new program was to stabilize the macroeconomy, as a first priority, and

then to renovate industry and financial markets. Macroeconomic stabilization

came under way quite rapidly so that inflation fell to less than 200 percent

soon.

        A financial reform was implemented that aimed to liberalize capital

markets and link Argentina more effectively with the world capital market.

Already in late 1976 foreign exchange transactions were completely liberalized

on capital account and this was done so effectively that for the next four

years the black market premium was zero. Figure 4 shoes the black market

premium and brings out the striking interlude of free capital mobility between

the Peronist period and the aftermath of the collapse of Martinez de Hoz'

policies.

Pablo (1980,1984).

         Inflation failed to decline further once it had come to the 150

 percent range. To make further inroads policy makers opted for what Fernandez

 (1985) has called an "expectations management approach." Beginning in 1979

 they pre—fixed the rate of exchange depreciation with a tablita, announcing

ahead of time a gradually declining rates of depreciation. These announcements

were repeated on a rolling (though shortening) basis so as to create an

environment where economic agents could discern a government commitment to

disinflation embodied in the time table for declining rates of exchange

depreciation.

        This policy was expected to reduce inflating through three separate

channels. First, reduced rates of depreciation would directly reduce the rate

of import price inflation. Second, reduced depreciation would enforce a

discipline on domestic price setters. Third, in an environment where inflation

to a large extent depended on expectations the rule or precommitinent

introduced as nominal anchor around which expectations could rally. Needless

to say, the intellectual underpinnings of such a program relied on the belief

that the "law of one price" would be strongly operative.

        Inflation responded to this policy and gradually fell throughout 1980

to reach ultimately a bottom well below 100 percent. But gradually, during

1978 and 1979, the real exchange rate appreciated because inflation

consistently outpaced the rate of depreciation. We saw in Figure 3 that the

cumulative overvaluation reached 50 or even 60 percent. But while the

overvaluatjon ultimately led to capital flight and collapse of the financial

system, the early stages were quite the opposite. The high interest rates——
                                   8



relative to world rates and the preannounced rate of depreciation—— gave rise

to an (almost) riskfree speculation in favor of Argentine assets. As a result

private sector borrowing abroad increased to take advantage of the relatively

low foreign interest rates and a massive capital inflow developed. This is

shown in Table 1 in the large increase in Central Bank reserves between 1978

and 1979 and the matching increase in private external borrowing.

        The trade and employment effects of the overvaluation were slow to

come. Diaz Alejandro (1964) has shown that the real income effects of a real

depreciation tend to be dominant in the early stages, before substitution

effects take over. For the real appreciation of 1977—80 the reverse applied:

the increase in real income created an expansion in demand and thus seemed to

validate the Martinez de Hoz approach by creating inflation reduction with

rising real income. This factor was reinforced by the fact that trade

protection, even with liberalization measures, kept the economy relatively

closed which dampened the disinflation effects of the tablita but also the

effects in the real sector.

        By 1979—80 the overvaluation had become so extreme that financial

markets increasingly took the view that depreciation would have to come

sometime. Even though the government asserted that the policy would be

continued, and could be financed, speculation increasingly went in the

direction of dollar purchases. The regime of unrestricted capital mobility

introduced in late 1976 facilitated this capital flight to the maximum. Hence,

in 1979—80, the Central Bank and public sector enterprises were forced to

borrow massively abroad to obtain the foreign exchange which is then sold in
                                    9



 support of the exchange rate policy. Private speculators in turn bought the

 dollars and applied them abroad. With the round trip complete, commercial

banks in New York, Zurich and Tokyo had lent to the government the resources

to finance capital flight which returned to the same banks as deposits. Of

course, capital flight was not limited to dollar deposits. Investments in

financial markets were important as was real estate abroad.

        A variety of estimates is available on the accumulation of external

assets by Argentines during this period. These estimates are typically formed

as residuals from debt and balance of payments data. They are obtained by

deducting from the recorded increase in gross external debt the current

account and recorded capital flows in the form of direct investment and

changes in reserves. Dornbusch (1985), for example, calculates that capital

flight in 1978—82 amounted to $23.4 billion. In a review of various estimates

the IMP (Watson et al. (l986),p.l42) reports capital flight amounting to

cumulatively to about $15 billion in 1979—1981. Rodriguez (1986) estimates

that between 1979 and 1982 the external assets of Argentinian's increased from

$10 billion to $34 billion. The estimates would have to be revised upward to

the extent that underinvoicing of exports and overinvoiciong of imports was a

significant channel of capital flight in this period.

        Both the fact of and the motivation for the wave of capital flight in

the late 1970s are very clear. Unlike in other debtor countries as for

example Brazil or Chile, mismanagement of the exchange rate combined with an

opening of the capital account are the almost exclusive explanation for the

massive debt accumulation. The particular background must be understood to
                                   10



appreciate that in Argentina's case the government has an external debt, but

the private sector has matching external assets. Moreover, that process was

carried further over the next few years as the government increasingly took

over all external debt in the course of sustaining failing financial

institutions. In 1980 about half of the debt was owed by the public sector and

in 1985 that share had increased to 82 percent.



From Martinez de Hoz to Alfonsin (3/81—12/83): The end of the military

government did not come easy. The Martinez de Hoz overvaluation had sown the

seeds of financial destruction, but the actual unraveling came only over the

next four years. The world economy contributed to the difficulties by the debt

crisis: sharply declining commodity prices and much higher interest rates

brought with them difficulties in servicing the external debt.

        But domestic events certainly were the dominant fact. First came the

undoing of the overvaluation. This started with the change of presidents: the

incoming president, months before taking office, declined to comment on his

exchange rate policy. This served as an obvious indication to anyone that

devaluation was ahead and hence capital flight turned massive. Central Bank

reserves declined by more than $5 billion and public external debt increased

sharply. Finally Martinez de Hoz was forced by his successor, not yet in

office, to bring his own expectations management and credibility approach to

an end by depreciating the currency.

        Over the next three years exchange depreciation and inflation became

endemic, rising from less, than 100 percent to 600 percent at the time Alfonsin
                                      11



 took office. Changes in public finance and financial markets were particularly

 important in this period. Exchange control was instituted once again and the

 black market premium reemerged (See Figure 4). The Central Bank, in an effort

 to assure continuing trade flows started exchange rate guarantee programs only

to find that it could never hold on to the guaranteed exchange rates. As a

result of losing a string of bets in the foreign exchange market the budget

deteriorated dramatically. The deterioration was reinforced by financial

failures that turned up in public sector hands, by the burden of external

interest payments and by deteriorating terms of trade. The conflict in the

South Pacific added to the loss in confidence and devastation of public

finance.

           The economics of this period of deterioration can be expressed in

terms of a simple model of deficit finance and of financial markets. Suppose

the budget deficit represents a fraction (g) of national income and let

velocity of highpowered money be an increasing function of the rate of

inflation. Then it can be shown that the rate of inflation (p) will be an

increasing (and steeply rising) function of the deficit, but it will also

depend on financial institutions.



(1)          p = (ag—y)/(1—bg)



The higher the level of noninflationary velocity (a) and the more responsive

velocity is to inflation as measured by the parameter (b) the more dramatic

the inflation impact of budget deficits.
                                   12


        This framework helps to identify the interaction of deficits, external

debt service, real depreciation and financial markets in generating the

inflation explosion of 1981—84. Increasing burdens of debt service, because of

higher interest rates and real depreciation increased the budget deficit ratio

(g) and hence raised money creation and inflation. The institutional response

of financial markets to higher inflation aggravated this impact by a flight

from money. The reduction in money holdings was facilitated by an increasing

range of interest bearing substitutes. As these came increasingly into play

velocity sharply increased (a and b in (1) above increased) and that meant the

inflation rate associated with a given deficit ratio also escalated.

        The 1981—84 period thus represents an unraveling of the artificial

stability of the late 1970s. Several events, each in itself extraordinary,

combined to make the crisis large: the initial overvaluation had been extreme,

the financial sector had been allowed to become overexposed in speculation,

private capital flight had been massive and finally the world economy turned

unfavorable just at the wrong time. Each of these factors deteriorated the

budget and hence reinforced inflation.



Alfonsin (1/1984— ):

        These difficulties carried over to the beginning of the Alfonsin

administration. Large real wage increases in 1983—84 created problems for the

budget and for the external balance. Inflation rapidly escalated and

negotiations with creditors and the IMF did not bring a solution.
                                    13


         The inflation issue soon become the single most pressing problem. In

 early 1985 annualized monthly rates of inflation rose toward 1500 percent and

 beyond. The possibility of a hyperinflation was entirely realistic since the

 inflation process itself eroded the real value of tax collection as well as

the financial system, so that ever more money needed to be created to finance

an ever widening deficit. Because IMF programs seemed unable to cope with the

inflation problem on a timetable and in a fashion that was politically

acceptable, and because the sheer pace of disintegration was so rapid, the

government considered extreme measures. The monetary reform known as the

Austral Plan was just that, an all—out attempt to stop hyperinflation.

        The details of the June 1985 Plan of Economic Reform which is now

called the Austral plan were as follows:

          A real depreciation and a sharp increase in real public sector
          prices. An export and import tax, a forced saving scheme and
          accelerated tax collection.

          A wage—price—exchange rate freeze.

          A new money, the Austral, and a promise not to create money to
          finance the budget.

          A conversion scale for existing contracts that would adjust them
          so as to keep real burdens unchanged in the face of the
          unanticipated reduction in inflation.

        • An IMF agreement and a rescheduling agreement with the creditors.


        The stabilization immediately reduced inflation to levels of only 1-2

percent per month. The decline in inflation and the fiscal measures brought

about a rapid and major shift in the budget. High real interest rates and the

budget improvement created an atmosphere of at least temporary stabilization.
                                      14



The black market premium vanished. For a country that had been on the verge of

hyperinflation the stabilization created an immense relief, but it also left

considerable scepticism as to the possibility of stopping inflation by edict.

The scepticism extended in particular to the governments ability to achieve

sufficient budget control to permanently reduce the need for inflationary

money creation.

           But even if scepticism subsisted the stabilization proved an important

political move and as such a stepping stone for ultimate and more deeply

rooted stabilization. A public opinion survey presents an assessment over time

of the public response to policy and management. The data are reported in

Table 2.

           This was not the first time Argentina had used wage—price controls to

stop inflation. Indeed, in 1975—76 this was tried and the experience ended in

an outburst of repressed inflation. The Austral plan has in fact not brought

price stability. Inflation today is back to the 100—200 percent range. But the
                                      15



 important achievement is that inflation was brought down from more than 2000

 percent and that this was accomplished without a major decline in economic

 activity, rise in unemployment or reduction in the purchasing power of wages..

          Today there is little risk that in the near term the stabilization

 will collapse. That confidence makes it possible and fruitful for the

 government to concentrate on the two key issues: how to achieve further budget

 improvement so as to bring inflation down to less than 20 percent and how to

 restore investment and growth. External debt and debt service has a bearing on

each of these questions.



Investment. Debt and the Budget:

          The budget influences inflation as well as investment and growth

because it influences the distribution of resources in the economy. If the

government commands a large share of the resources less is left for the

private sector. the government may use these resources to service the external

debt via noninterest external surpluses, it can use the resources to support

consumption or it can make them available for investment. The possible choices

of budget strategy then are to service the debt, sustain consumption or use

resources for growth. Table 3 shows the budget of the consolidated government.

          Two points must be separated in looking at the budget impact on the

economy. One is the y in which the government finances its outlays, i.e. by

regular taxes, by borrowing or by the inflation tax. The second, possibly

related, is how the tax system determines the allocation of resources among

sectors. To illustrate, the government can replace the inflation tax with

outright taxes and there will be little effect in the aggregate except that

inflation will decline. But if the inflation tax declines without an

offsetting increase in outright taxes than an offsetting reduction in

absorption needs to occur: either the government cuts its spending or it

reduces its debt service.

          For the country at large there is a tradeoff between consumption,

investment and net resource transfers abroad. These points can be brought out

by looking at the GDP identity:



(2)   Output =     Net Resource       +    Investment   +   Consumption
                   Transfer Abroad



where consumption denotes private and public sector consumption and

investment, likewise, includes the private and public sector. With a given

amount of resources or output available (because the economy is fully employed

already) the budget and the external debt strategy now determine inflation and

growth.
                                                                  4




                                      17



        To show the range of options we can look at two particular scenarios.

One possibility is to keep budget adjustments to a minimum, not to interfere

with consumption and yet foster growth via increased investment. That strategy

requires, as (2) shows, that resource transfers abroad can no longer occur or

must even be reversed. In a second scenario the government seeks both

investment and continued, partial debt service. In that case the resource

shortage calls for crowding out of consumption by outright taxation or by the

inflation tax.

        Over the past few years crowding out of investment, not consumption

has been the rule. By maintaining relatively tight money and a strongly

competitive exchange rate the government has crowded out private investment,

leaving resources with consumption and transfers abroad absorbing the

available resources. The adverse effect of positive and often high real

interest rates on investment is all the more punishing in that uncertainty

about future budget trends and debt service, and hence interest rates, make it

unwise to repatriate capital or risk borrowing.

        Figure 5 shows the extraordinarily low rate of private investment (as

a percent of GNP) in Argentina. Net investment in fact is zero or negative.

With productive capacity not expanding, or even shrinking, there is no source

of growth in the standard of living. Hence the question is whether the current

policy mix can be sustained much longer without doing irreparable damage to

the economy productive system and thus to the longrun viability of the

economy. The flourishing of the underground economy is certainly a warning

signal of a very undesirable trend.

        IMP programs for Argentina, in the absence of an official change in

the debt strategy, anticipate that the current account deficit gradually

declines as a ratio of GDP and ultimately turns toward surplus. The 1986

program, for example, anticipated that by 1990 Argentina's current account

would reach a modest surplus of 0.2 percent of GDP. That means, of course,

net resource transfers in the full amount of interest labilities and no "new

money" except for principal. This strategy, if it is to be consistent with

even moderate growth of the economy's supply side, requires a major shift in

the budget to contain consumption. That can take the form of a much higher

inflation tax or a much higher outright form of taxation.

        Latin American leaders advocate a different scenario. They argue that

net resource flows need to be reversed and that the noninterest surpluses can

come down. Resources need to be transferred inward again, they argue, so that

they can supplement scarce domestic saving in financing domestic investment.

Such a reversal of resource flows encounters the problem of creditworthiness.

If now debtor countries like Argentina experience difficulties in servicing

the debt, is it plausible that yet more debt should be added. Feldstein (1986,

1987) has argued that some countries, in particular Brazil, can both borrow

and grow without risking the build up of an unsustainable debt. It is

difficult to see that possibility in Argentina, except in the context of a

major restructuring of the public sector.

        But if increased reliance is placed on external resources by reducing

net transfers abroad the question must be asked how the extra room thus gained

should be used. Once again a fiscal reform could translate these resources
                                   19



into growth of productive capacity. Using them for consumption would simply

reduce creditworthiness and thus presage yet another financial crisis sometime

in the future.

        Argentina thus faces a critical juncture in respect to fiscal policy.

Fiscal choices today are critical because they affect inflation and growth and

because there is little room left for mistakes. The external debt service is a

key variable because it presently absorbs resources that could be available

for growth. But resource savings due to reduced external debt service

(assuming there is no debt forgiveness) can only be used productively if

fiscal reform translates them into sharply higher growth. The critical

decisions to make that possible have as yet not been reached. Moreover, if

capital markets are unwilling to lend on a major scale then most of the growth

must be financed by reduced consumption. Thus the policy mistakes of the 1970s

directly translate into a growth crisis for the 1980s.

        The present effort to stabilize the budget and hence bring about

growth and financial stability goes in its implications much beyond the

economic sphere. Political and institutional instability in Argentina resemble

that of the Weimar Republic and Central Europe in the 1920s or the 5th

Republic in France. The political instability in turn influences economics

because it stands in the way of continuity and farsightedness of economic

policies. If, as has been the case in Argentina, the average tenure of a

central bank president is less than a year this is certainly not conducive to

a long view. The attempt at reconstruction underway today is thus of

extraordinary significance. This also implies that increased flexibility of
                                     20


 external constraints associated with debt service assumes particular

importance.
