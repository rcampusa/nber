Countries rarely hit the zero-lower bound on interest rates, but when they do, these episodes tend
to be very long-lived. These two features are difficult to jointly incorporate into macroeconomic
models using typical representations of shock processes. We introduce a regime switching
representation of risk premium shocks into an otherwise standard New Keynesian model to
generate a realistic distribution of ZLB durations. We discuss what different calibrations of this
model imply for optimal inflation rates.

1       Introduction

When the U.S. Federal Reserve finally raised its target for the Federal Funds Rate in December 2015, this
likely marked the end of the zero-bound on short-term nominal interest rates for the United States after a
staggering seven years. Japan’s zero-bound period will most likely exceed this duration under
Abenomics, while the Bank of England has similarly had near-zero interest rates since March of 2009.
The Euro Central Bank is also not expected to raise interest rates for years. Combined with the previous
experiences with the zero-bound on interest rates that occurred during the Great Depression and in Japan
during the 1990s-2000s, this suggests that the two most prominent empirical features of zero-bound
episodes are that they are rare but long-lived.
         The zero-bound on interest rates raises a number of profound problems for monetary
policymakers, one of which is the traditional question of what the optimal inflation rate should be. While
it is well-understood that even stable inflation has costs (such as those arising from price dispersion),
higher average inflation is also associated with higher nominal interest rates, which can benefit
policymakers by giving them extra room to avoid running into the zero-bound. Quantifying the optimal
rate of inflation then requires balancing the costs of inflation against its benefits, such as minimizing the
frequency and severity of zero lower bound (ZLB) episodes.
         But quantifying this potential benefit of higher inflation is difficult because the paucity of ZLB
episodes makes their frequency and duration hard to gauge. For example, Schmidt-Grohe and Uribe
(2010) calibrated their model prior to the start of the Great Recession and had no post-WWII zero-bound
episodes in the U.S. to guide their choice over the frequency of hitting the zero-bound. This resulted in a
calibration with very rare and short-lived ZLB episodes. Coibion, Gorodnichenko and Wieland (2012)
used the fact that the U.S. had spent 3 years at the ZLB at the time of their writing out of the post-WWII
period to fix their frequency, yielding more frequent but still mostly short-lived episodes. In each case,
these authors conclude that the optimal rate of inflation is unlikely to be much above 2% despite the zero-
bound on interest rates. But given the actual durations of the most recent ZLB experienced by developed
economies, each of these papers likely underestimated the average duration of ZLB episodes and
therefore the potential benefits of higher levels of target inflation on the part of central banks.
         In this paper, we revisit the topic of longer-lived ZLB episodes in two steps. First, following
previous work, we generate longer-lived ZLB episodes by either increasing the persistence or the
volatility of AR(1) risk-premium shocks which push the economy into the ZLB in our model. By doing
so, we can generate a longer average duration of ZLB episodes consistent with the data. In our benchmark
New Keynesian model, increasing the average duration of ZLB episodes (for a given steady-state level of
inflation) through either more persistent or more volatile shocks can have large positive effects on the
optimal inflation rate. For example, moving from an average duration of ZLB episodes of 5 quarters to
just 6 quarters, holding the frequency of ZLB episodes fixed (by varying the persistence and volatility of
shocks accordingly), can raise the optimal inflation rate from 1.3% to 2.2% in our baseline calibration, a
very high sensitivity.
         This sensitivity, however, reflects an unappealing characteristic common to all standard models
of the ZLB in which normally distributed shocks drive the economy into the ZLB: the vast majority of
ZLB episodes in the model are extremely short-lived. Significantly raising the average duration therefore
requires large tail events, and these episodes have disproportionately large welfare costs. Policymakers
become very willing to tolerate higher average inflation rates to avoid these episodes, leading to
significantly higher optimal rates of inflation for even small changes in average durations of ZLB


                                                                                                           2
episodes. Hence, the high sensitivity of the optimal rate of inflation to the average duration of ZLB
episodes in our benchmark model is a reflection of the counterfactual distribution of ZLB episodes,
namely that they are too frequent and short-lived compared to the rare and long-lived episodes that we
observe in the data.
         Our second step is then to incorporate an alternative modeling strategy for the shocks that drive
the economy into the ZLB which generates an empirically realistic distribution of ZLB episodes, namely
that they tend to be rare but long-lived. We assume that each period, risk premia follow a regime-
switching process. In each period when the economy is not at the ZLB, there is a fixed probability that the
risk premium will rise sharply for a set number of periods. If the increase in the premium is large enough,
this shock will give rise to a distribution with very long-lived ZLB durations, thereby more closely
representing the empirical distribution of ZLB episodes. As a result, we can more carefully assess
whether (or how much) raising the rate of inflation is optimal, in a welfare sense, to offset the presence of
the zero bound on interest rates.
         Unlike the AR(1) model, the regime switching approach does not display an excessive sensitivity
of the optimal inflation rate to the average duration of ZLB episodes. Nonetheless, long-lived ZLB
episodes generate large welfare costs in the model, which higher levels of steady state inflation can help
avoid by reducing their frequency. We find that depending on our calibration of the average duration and
the unconditional frequency of ZLB episodes, the optimal inflation rate can range from 1.5% to 4%. This
uncertainty stems ultimately from the paucity of historical experience with ZLB episodes, which makes
pinning down these parameters with any degree of confidence very difficult. A key conclusion of the
paper is therefore that much humility is called for when making recommendations about the optimal rate
of inflation since this fundamental data constraint is unlikely to be relaxed anytime soon.
         Our paper builds on a broad literature on the optimal rate of inflation. This literature has covered
a wide range of costs and benefits, with the zero bound on interests only recently coming to the forefront
as a plausible source for positive optimal rates of inflation. In a survey of pre-Great Recession work,
Schmidt-Grohe and Uribe (2010) highlighted that, although the quantitative conclusions about the optimal
rate of inflation were potentially sensitive to the choice of the model used to assess the costs and benefits
of inflation (or deflation) in the steady-state, one generally found that it was optimal to have a small
amount of deflation. For example, using a standard model with demand for money, Schmidt-Grohe and
Uribe (2010) estimated the optimal inflation rate at -0.6 percent per year with the Ramsey optimal policy.
While this rate of deflation is considerably smaller than the rate of deflation originally suggested by
Milton Friedman (approximately equal to the real interest rate), the optimality of deflation in steady state
is inconsistent with the 1-3%/year inflation rates currently targeted by most central banks.
         Even when one moves to cashless economies, it is difficult to push the optimal rate of inflation
near the levels commonly targeted by modern central targets using traditional arguments for positive
levels of inflation such as downward wage rigidity. Indeed, New Keynesian models generally suggest that
the optimal rate of inflation should be close to zero because price dispersion generated by non-zero trend
inflation is costly (see Benigno and Woodford 2005). 1 However, one may be able to raise the optimal rate
of inflation by departing from the workhorse specifications to incorporate e.g. foreign demand for
currency (Schmidt-Grohe and Uribe 2012), firm-specific productivity growth (Weber 2012), occasionally
binding financial constraints (Abo-Zaid 2015), or tax evasion (Schmidt-Grohe and Uribe 2010).

1
  Wolman (2011) and others show that even in the absence of money demand considerations, the optimal rate of
inflation in New Keynesian models can be negative. For example, in Wolman’s model and calibration the optimal
deflation is 0.4% per year.

                                                                                                           3
         Pre-Great Recession work (e.g., Summers 1991) discussed the zero lower bound (ZLB) on
nominal interest rates as a potential reason for positive inflation but generally considered the ZLB as an
improbable event. As a result, the models were calibrated to generate infrequent and short-lived ZLB
episodes. For example, Schmidt-Grohe and Uribe (2010) indicate that to violate the zero bound “…the
nominal interest rate … must fall more than 4 standard deviations below its target level” thus making
ZLB an extremely rare event.
         Many others found similar results. For example, Reifschneider and Williams (2000) and Chung et
al. (2012) document that the frequency of ZLB for three popular dynamic stochastic general equilibrium
(DSGE) models estimated on the post-WWII, pre-2007 data is typically less than 5 percent. 2 Furthermore,
ZLB episodes longer than 8 quarters can be observed less than 1 percent of the time. If one uses data from
the Great Moderation period to assign parameters in DSGE models, ZLB episodes are even shorter and
less frequent. Similarly, Adam and Billi (2007) find that, with optimal monetary policy, conditional on
hitting ZLB, the likelihood of being at the ZLB for more than 4 quarters is a mere 1.8%. In Billi’s (2011)
calibration, the ZLB binds 4 percent of the time and the average duration of ZLB is only 2 quarters. Using
non-linear methods to solve and simulate calibrated DSGE models, Amano and Shukayev (2012) report
that the probability of hitting the ZLB is 1.7% per quarter (i.e., a 4-quarter ZLB episode occurs once
every 60 years). In other words, ZLBs in models used by researchers and policymakers were too short and
too rare to matter.
         As the welfare costs of short ZLB episodes tend to be small, the ZLB was found to have tiny
effects on the estimated optimal rate of inflation. For example, the optimal rate of inflation in the
Schmidt-Grohe and Uribe (2010) calibration increased modestly from -0.6 to -0.4 percent per year in light
of the ZLB. In short, the consensus view before the Great Recession was that, although the ZLB was an
interesting and curious possibility, one could treat it as remote and largely irrelevant.
         With policy interest rates in major developed economies having spent years at the zero lower-
bound during the Great Recession and its aftermath, there has of course been a shift in thinking about the
frequency and nature of the ZLB. Examination of new cross-country evidence and long time series (i.e.,
series including the Great Depression) suggests that ZLB episodes are potentially costly (e.g., Williams
(2009) estimated that four years at the ZLB can cost as much as $1.8 trillion), more frequent (e.g., Chun
et al. (2012) indicate that, based on pre-2010 data, one should double the probability of being at the ZLB
in calibrated models), and more persistent. The latter point is particularly important as ZLB episodes in
the U.S. and elsewhere are not characterized by a series of short intervals of constrained policy rates.
Instead, the Great Depression and the Great Recession in the U.S. or the crash in Japan indicate that ZLB
episodes can last for years if not decades.
         Incorporating these changes in the way we model the ZLB can have dramatic effects on the
optimal rate of inflation. Indeed, apart from ZLB episodes being modeled as more frequent and thus
costlier, we know from Coibion et al. (2012) and others that the cost of ZLB is increasing steeply in its
duration. That is, an 8-quarter ZLB is costlier than two 4-quarter ZLB episodes. Thus, the cost of ZLB in
a new calibration can be considerably larger than in previous calibrations and can entail an optimal rate of
inflation higher than the conventionally suggested 2 percent per year.
         While the treatment of the ZLB is one important source of differences in the estimated optimal
rate of inflation, there are other factors and modelling choices that can affect the optimal rate. For
example, Coibion et al. (2012) show that how one models price stickiness can also influence results.

    Coibion et al. (2012) calibrate the frequency of ZLB in the basic New Keynesian model at 5 percent.

                                                                                                          4
Using the Calvo (1983) approach tends to yield a lower optimal inflation rate because Calvo-style pricing
generates a larger increase in cross-sectional price dispersion for a given increase in trend inflation than
e.g. Taylor (1977) pricing. 3 Intuitively, firms with Calvo pricing may be stuck at suboptimal prices for a
long time while Taylor pricing guarantees that prices can be reset after a fixed number of periods which
caps the size of departures from optimal levels of prices. Because cross-sectional price dispersion is the
main cost of non-zero steady-state inflation in New Keynesian models, the choice of pricing assumptions
can alter the point at which the cost of positive inflation balances the benefit of positive inflation (e.g.,
avoid ZLB). Consistent with this logic, Coibion et al. (2012) find the optimal rate of inflation to be 1.5%
under Calvo pricing (when the probability of price adjustment is set at 0.55) and 1.8% under Taylor
pricing (when the duration of contracts is set at 3 quarters).
         In a similar spirit, menu-cost models limit the degree of cross-sectional price dispersion (since a
firm can reset its price whenever it deviates too far from the optimal price) and thus could reduce the cost
of non-zero steady-state inflation. As a result, it may be optimal in such models to target a higher rate of
inflation which will reduce the probability of hitting the ZLB, but the exact magnitude depends on the
details of menu cost models. While the optimal rate of inflation in the Dotsey et al. (1999) model is below
2 percent (see Coibion et al. 2012), Blanco (2015) found that in the Golosov and Lucas (2007) model
welfare is maximized at approximately 5%/year inflation rate. Because the computational demands
become exceedingly high for long-lasting ZLB periods even in linearized models, we will focus on the
Calvo approach to model price stickiness.
         The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model and the two ways of modeling
shocks that drive the economy into the zero bound. Section 3 then presents the main results of the paper,
including comparing the distribution of ZLB episodes under the two assumptions about shock processes
and their implications for optimal inflation. Section 4 concludes.

2       Model

In our quantitative analyses, we use the standard New Keynesian model similar to the framework in
Coibion, Gorodnichenko and Wieland (2012). To preserve space, we describe the main building blocks of
the model and relegate derivations and various details to the Appendix.

2.1. Households

The representative consumer maximizes the present discounted value of the utility stream from
consumption and leisure
                                                                                                          1

                                                                         𝜂𝜂                1+1/𝜂𝜂 �
                                                                                                 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑         (1)

where 𝐶𝐶 is consumption of the final good, 𝑁𝑁(𝑖𝑖) is labor supplied to individual industry i, 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺 is the gross
growth rate of technology, 𝜂𝜂 is the Frisch labor supply elasticity, ℎ the internal habit parameter and β is
the discount factor. The budget constraint in each period 𝑡𝑡 is given by

                        𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡             1 𝑁𝑁𝑡𝑡 (𝑖𝑖)𝑊𝑊𝑡𝑡 (𝑖𝑖)              𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡−1 𝑞𝑞𝑡𝑡−1 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡−1

3
 Using a medium-scale DSGE model, Ascari, Phaneuf, and Sims (2015) estimate that a consumption-equivalent
welfare loss from of raising inflation from 2% to 4% can be as large as 7 percent.

                                                                                                                    5
where S is the stock of one-period bonds held by the consumer, R is the gross nominal interest rate, P is
the price of the final good, 𝑊𝑊(𝑖𝑖) is the nominal wage earned from labor in industry i, T is real lump sum
taxation (or transfers), Γ are real profits from ownership of firms, 𝑞𝑞 is a risk premium shock, and 𝜉𝜉 is the
shadow value of wealth (i.e., the Lagrange multiplier on constraint (2)). As we discuss below, the risk
premium shock plays a central role in generating binding ZLB.

2.2. Firms

For each intermediate good 𝑖𝑖 ∈ [0,1], a monopolist generates output using a production function linear in
labor

           𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡 (𝑖𝑖) = 𝐴𝐴t 𝑁𝑁𝑡𝑡 (𝑖𝑖)                                                                                            (3)

where 𝐴𝐴 denotes the level of technology, common across firms. The time series of technology is described
                                                               𝐴𝐴
by a random walk process: 𝐴𝐴𝑡𝑡 = exp(𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡𝐴𝐴 ), 𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡𝐴𝐴 = 𝜇𝜇 + 𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝜀𝜀𝑡𝑡𝐴𝐴 with 𝜀𝜀𝑡𝑡𝐴𝐴 ~𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑁𝑁(0, 𝜎𝜎𝐴𝐴2 ). Parameter 𝜇𝜇 sets
the average growth rate of technology in the model.
         A perfectly competitive sector combines intermediate goods into a final good using the Dixit-
Stiglitz aggregator
                           1                                𝜃𝜃/(𝜃𝜃−1)
          𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡 = �∫0 𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡 (𝑖𝑖)(𝜃𝜃−1)/𝜃𝜃 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 �                                                                                  (4)

where Y is the final good and 𝜃𝜃 denotes the elasticity of substitution across intermediate goods, yielding
the following demand curve for goods of intermediate sector i:

          𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡 (𝑖𝑖) = 𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡 (𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡 (𝑖𝑖)/𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡 )−𝜃𝜃                                                                                 (5)

and the following expression for the aggregate price level

                            1                             1/(1−𝜃𝜃)
          𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡 = �∫0 𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡 (𝑖𝑖)(1−𝜃𝜃) 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 �                           .                                                         (6)

        Each intermediate good producer has sticky prices, modeled as in Calvo (1983) where 1 − 𝜆𝜆 is
the probability that each firm will be able to reoptimize its price each period. Denoting the optimal reset
price of firm i by B (all firms choose the same rest price), re-optimizing firms solve the following profit-
maximization problem

           max 𝐸𝐸𝑡𝑡 ∑∞      𝑗𝑗
                     𝑗𝑗=0 𝜆𝜆 𝑄𝑄𝑡𝑡,𝑡𝑡+𝑗𝑗 �𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡+𝑗𝑗 (𝑖𝑖)𝐵𝐵𝑡𝑡 (𝑖𝑖) − 𝑊𝑊𝑡𝑡+𝑗𝑗 (𝑖𝑖)𝑁𝑁𝑡𝑡+𝑗𝑗 (𝑖𝑖)�                                      (7)
           𝐵𝐵𝑡𝑡 (𝑖𝑖)

where 𝐺𝐺𝑡𝑡 = 𝐺𝐺̅𝑡𝑡 exp(𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡𝐺𝐺 ), 𝐺𝐺̅𝑡𝑡 is the path of government spending such that the share of government
spending in the economy is fixed when prices are flexible, and 𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡𝐺𝐺 is an exogenous, forcing variable:
𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡𝐺𝐺 = 𝜌𝜌𝐺𝐺 𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡−1

potentially lower the costs of ZLB episodes, there is little evidence suggesting that these policies have had
large economic effects. 5

2.4. Risk premium shocks

As discussed in Amano and Shukayev (2012), the risk premium shock is the main “tool” that can generate
a binding ZLB in standard New Keynesian models. To be clear, this shock should be interpreted broadly
as capturing a variety of forces that bring interest rates to ultra-low levels. We consider two general
approaches to model the dynamics of the shock.
         The first approach is to describe the time series of the shock as an AR(1) process similar to what
is usually assumed for other forcing variables in DSGE models (e.g., Coibion et al. 2012):
                      𝑞𝑞      𝑞𝑞          𝑞𝑞       𝑞𝑞        𝑞𝑞
         𝑞𝑞𝑡𝑡 = exp�𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡 �, 𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡 = 𝜌𝜌𝑞𝑞 𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝜀𝜀𝑡𝑡 with 𝜀𝜀𝑡𝑡 ~𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑁𝑁(0, 𝜎𝜎𝑞𝑞2 ).             (15)

By adjusting 𝜌𝜌𝑞𝑞 and 𝜎𝜎𝑞𝑞2 , one can regulate the frequency and duration of ZLB episodes. As we will show
later, a major shortcoming of this approach to modeling the risk premium is that it cannot replicate the
main qualitative empirical properties of ZLB episodes, namely that they are rare but long-lived. Instead,
AR(1) shocks primarily deliver frequent and short-lived ZLB episodes.
         As a result, we also consider a second approach which allows for two regimes of risk premia. For
example, Christiano, Eichenbaum and Rebelo (2011), Eggertsson and Woodford (2003), and Guerierri
and Lorenzoni (2009) assume that the ZLB is binding for a fixed number of periods or that, conditional
on being at the ZLB, every period there is a random, i.i.d. draw determining exit from the ZLB; that is,
with some probability the risk premium declines from a high level (ZLB is binding) to a low level (ZLB
is not binding). This line of work typically assumes that after exiting ZLB the economy does not return to
it.
         To permit recurrent ZLB episodes, we consider the following regime-switching process. The risk
premium can take two values: zero and Δ > 0. Each period when the risk premium is zero, there is a
random, i.i.d. draw such that with probability 𝑝𝑝12 the risk premium switches from zero to Δ and stays at
this elevated level for 𝑇𝑇𝑞𝑞 periods. After 𝑇𝑇𝑞𝑞 periods with low interest rates, the risk premium returns to
zero. By varying Δ, 𝑝𝑝12 , 𝑇𝑇𝑞𝑞 , we can obtain variation in the frequency and duration of ZLB. Note that Δ >
0 does not guarantee that the interest rate will be literarily stuck at zero: other shocks (e.g., productivity)
can lift the economy off the ZLB. However, by making Δ large enough, we can reduce the incidence of




5
  Coibion, Gorodnichenko and Wieland (2012, CGW henceforth) examine how the optimal rate of inflation varies if
the central bank can implement an optimal stabilization policy with commitment. One can think of the commitment
policy as introducing a very powerful form of forward guidance. CGW find that in this case the optimal rate of
inflation shrinks to zero considerably. Intuitively, with a strong form of forward guidance delivered by fully credible
commitment to keep low interest rates far into the future, the stabilization powers of monetary policy remain large
unaffected by the ZLB. As a result, there is no need for a “cushion” created by positive trend inflation. CGW also
show that if a Taylor rule includes an element of price level targeting, the central bank can nearly achieve the
welfare one can obtain under the optimal policy with commitment because current below-target inflation is
compensated with above-target inflation in the future. Since our objective is to consider scenarios that should push
up the optimal rate of inflation (most importantly, increase in the duration of ZLB episodes), we do not cover the
optimal policy with commitment as these move the optimal rate of inflation in the opposite direction.

                                                                                                                     8
such lift-offs. We solve the model by adapting the solution algorithm in Coibion et al. (2012) to these
deterministic regime-switching processes. 6
         While the difference in modeling the risk premium shock may seem subtle, these two approaches
can generate different distributions for ZLB durations with important implications for calculating welfare
losses arising from binding ZLB. As we demonstrate below, the AR(1) approach tends to yield frequent,
short-lived ZLB episodes. Such a distribution of ZLB episodes appears to be inconsistent with the
experience of the U.S. and other developed economies during the Great Recession or in other instances.
In contrast, the regime-switching approach can produce long-lived ZLB episodes, similar to what we
observe in the data.

technology, we can summarize the system of optimality conditions and budget constraints by the familiar

2.6. Welfare

Proposition 1 in Coibion et al. (2012) derives the second order approximation to expected per period utility
in eq. (1) when steady state inflation is different from zero:

           Θ0 + Θ1 var(𝑦𝑦�𝑡𝑡 ) + Θ2 var(𝜋𝜋�𝑡𝑡 ) + Θ3 var(𝑐𝑐̂𝑡𝑡 )                                     (19)

where parameters Θ𝑘𝑘 , 𝑘𝑘 = {0,1,2,3} depend on the steady state inflation 𝜋𝜋�. As discussed in Coibion et al.
(2012), this approximation has an intuitive interpretation and properties. The term Θ0 captures the cost of
cross-sectional price dispersion arising from positive trend inflation. For quantitatively relevant inflation
rates, Θ0 becomes more negative as steady-state inflation increases. Because of the functional assumption
about the household’s utility, Θ1 < 0 but Θ1 does not depend directly on steady-state inflation. The
coefficient on the variance of inflation Θ2 < 0, which is the main cost of business cycle in the standard
New Keynesian model like ours, is decreasing in steady state inflation. Finally, the coefficient on the
variance of consumption Θ3 < 0 captures the desire of habit-driven consumers to smooth consumption.

2.7. Calibration

We calibrate the model as in Coibion et al. (2012), see Table 1. This parametrization uses values standard
in the literature. Parameter values governing the frequency and duration of ZLB (that is, 𝜌𝜌𝑞𝑞 , 𝜎𝜎𝑞𝑞2 for the
AR(1) model and Δ, 𝑝𝑝12 , 𝑇𝑇𝑞𝑞 for the regime switching model) are harder to pin down because ZLB
episodes are rare. Consequently, we will consider combinations of parameter values that yield a spectrum
of durations and unconditional frequencies of ZLB episodes. As a baseline, we will focus on parameter
values that generate an unconditional frequency of the ZLB equal to 10%, which corresponds to the U.S.
post-WWII experience (seven years at the ZLB over seventy years), although we relax this assumption
later on. In the case of the regime switching model, we have an extra free parameter. As a baseline, we
choose to set Δ = 0.090 to ensure that the risk premium shock almost always yields a binding ZLB. For
robustness, we will also consider two additional values of Δ. One is based on setting Δ = 𝑅𝑅� − 1 =
1
  � (1 + 𝜇𝜇) − 1. That is, the size of the premium is equal to the steady-state level of the nominal rate,
  Π
𝛽𝛽
which in turn depends on the time preference parameter 𝛽𝛽, the steady state level of inflation Π � , and the
growth rate of output (and technology) in the economy 𝜇𝜇. Given the calibration of other parameters, we
have Δ ≈ 6% per year in this case. Note that because 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 may be larger than 𝑅𝑅�, the risk premium Δ = 𝑅𝑅� −
1 may be not large enough to push interest rates all the way to zero. Even when they do, the duration of
the ZLB episode may be very short-lived if some other positive shocks hit the economy. The alternative
calibration is to set a much higher value of Δ = 0.120. This value will ensure that ZLB episodes are
almost always long-lived.

3          Results

For each calibration, we simulate the model for 10,000 periods to calculate welfare and various statistics
such as the frequency and duration of ZLB episodes. Because Coibion et al. (2012) provide an exhaustive


                                                                                                            10
description of mechanisms and results for the conventionally calibrated model, we focus our analysis on
the effects of alternative calibrations of risk premium shocks that govern the properties of ZLB.

3.1         Parameters of Risk Premium Shock and the Properties of ZLB Episodes

We first consider how different parameter values in each representation of the risk premium shock
process affect the properties of ZLB episodes. Panel A of Figure 1 illustrates how 𝜌𝜌𝑞𝑞 and 𝜎𝜎𝑞𝑞2 in the AR(1)
models affect the unconditional frequency of the economy being at ZLB (that is, the fraction of periods
when 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 = 1). By raising either 𝜌𝜌𝑞𝑞 and 𝜎𝜎𝑞𝑞2 , we increase the unconditional frequency of the ZLB. This is
intuitive: more persistent shocks (higher 𝜌𝜌𝑞𝑞 ) naturally tend to leave the economy depressed longer and
more volatile shocks (higher 𝜎𝜎𝑞𝑞2 ) imply that large enough shocks that push the economy into the ZLB
happen relatively more frequently. At the same time, there is a clear trade-off between 𝜌𝜌𝑞𝑞 and 𝜎𝜎𝑞𝑞2 : one can
sustain a given level of the unconditional frequency of ZLB episodes by reducing 𝜎𝜎𝑞𝑞2 (i.e., making the risk
premium shocks less volatile) and increasing 𝜌𝜌𝑞𝑞 (i.e., making the shocks more persistent) or vice versa.
Hence, one can in principle achieve a target frequency of ZLB episodes through different combinations of
𝜎𝜎𝑞𝑞2 and 𝜌𝜌𝑞𝑞 .
           However, changing the parameter values of 𝜎𝜎𝑞𝑞2 and 𝜌𝜌𝑞𝑞 in such a way that the unconditional
frequency of ZLB episodes is unchanged still changes the nature of ZLB episodes. When 𝜌𝜌𝑞𝑞 is relatively
high for a given unconditional frequency of ZLB episodes (and 𝜎𝜎𝑞𝑞2 is therefore relatively low), ZLB
episodes will tend to be rare but longer-lived, as suggested by the historical experience. Panel A of Figure
2 demonstrates this result: as 𝜌𝜌𝑞𝑞 rises and we move along an isoquant for a given frequency of ZLB
episodes (so 𝜎𝜎𝑞𝑞2 falls by the necessary amount), the average duration of ZLB episodes also rises. This
suggests that, within the context of AR(1) risk-premium shocks, we can model the notion of rare but long-
lived ZLB episodes by raising 𝜌𝜌𝑞𝑞 and lowering 𝜎𝜎𝑞𝑞2 , thereby changing the distribution of ZLB episodes
from being frequent and short-lived to being rare and long-lived.
           However, Panel A of Figure 2 also reveals that the average duration of ZLB episodes is fairly
insensitive to changes in 𝜌𝜌𝑞𝑞 when these are offset by corresponding changes in 𝜎𝜎𝑞𝑞2 that leave the ZLB
frequency unchanged. It takes very large changes in 𝜌𝜌𝑞𝑞 to raise the duration of ZLB by a quarter. For
example, if we focus on the unconditional probability of 0.1, one has to increase 𝜌𝜌𝑞𝑞 from 0.97 to 0.985
(that is, increase the half-life of the risk premium shock from ≈ 23 quarters to ≈ 46 quarters) to raise the
average ZLB duration by just one quarter. 7
           To further explore why the average ZLB duration is relatively unresponsive to changes in 𝜌𝜌𝑞𝑞 , we
examine the distribution of ZLB durations in the AR(1) model for different calibrations of 𝜎𝜎𝑞𝑞2 and 𝜌𝜌𝑞𝑞 in
Figure 3. In each case, we choose 𝜎𝜎𝑞𝑞2 and 𝜌𝜌𝑞𝑞 such that the unconditional frequency of ZLB episodes is
0.10 but the average duration of ZLB episodes varies from a little over two quarters to almost seven
quarters in duration. A striking feature common to all calibrations is that the distribution of ZLB episodes
has a very heavy left tail: most ZLB episodes are just one- or two-quarters long while the share of ZLB
episodes longer than 12 quarters is less than 20%. Similar results have been found in other studies (e.g.,
Cheng et al. 2012) using an AR(1) process for shocks akin to our risk premium shock. This characteristic
of the ZLB distribution is largely invariant to the average duration. As 𝜌𝜌𝑞𝑞 increases, there are relatively


7
    The half life is given by ln(0.5) / ln�𝜌𝜌𝑞𝑞 �.

                                                                                                             11
more very long-lived episodes. But higher values of 𝜌𝜌𝑞𝑞 also require lower values of 𝜎𝜎𝑞𝑞2 , so the share of 1-
quarter ZLB episodes falls only gradually. These two nearly off-setting effects explain the pattern noted
in Panel A of Figure 2 that even large increases in 𝜌𝜌𝑞𝑞 have very modest effects on average ZLB
durations. 8 In short, it is very difficult to generate an empirically realistic pattern of ZLB episodes using
AR(1) shocks to the risk premium.
        As a result, we also consider an alternative modeling strategy of regime switching risk-premia, as
described in section 2.4. There are now three parameters of interest: 𝑝𝑝12 (the probability of a risk-
premium increase when the economy is outside the ZLB), 𝑇𝑇𝑞𝑞 (the duration of the high risk premium
period), and Δ (the size of the risk premium shock). In Panel B of Figure 1, we illustrate that, for a fixed
value of Δ = 9%, by changing 𝑝𝑝12 and 𝑇𝑇𝑞𝑞 we can maintain a given unconditional frequency of ZLB,
which is qualitatively similar to the AR(1) case. Increasing 𝑝𝑝12 means raising the probability the risk
premium going up when the economy is outside the ZLB, which is similar to raising 𝜎𝜎𝑞𝑞2 in the AR(1)
case. Increasing 𝑇𝑇𝑞𝑞 makes the length of the risk premium shock longer, which is akin to increasing 𝜌𝜌𝑞𝑞 in
the AR(1) case. Hence, raising either parameter serves to increase the frequency of ZLB episodes and
there is a tradeoff between the two parameters that can be utilized to maintain a fixed unconditional
frequency of ZLB episodes, as in the AR(1) case. In this respect, the two ways of modeling risk premia
appear similar.
        However, the regime switching model is much more successful at allowing us to change average
durations of ZLB episodes. Panel B of Figure 2 plots, again for a fixed value of Δ = 9%, how the average
duration of ZLB episodes changes as one increases 𝑇𝑇𝑞𝑞 (the length of risk premium shocks) while
changing 𝑝𝑝12 by just enough to maintain a fixed unconditional frequency of ZLB episodes (as indicated
by isoquants in the Figure). In contrast to the very flat slopes obtained with the AR(1) model, the regime
switching model yields an approximately linear increase with a slope just above one in the average
duration of ZLB episodes.
        The reason for this difference lies in the distribution of ZLB episodes generated by the regime
switching model. Figure 4 plots these distributions for four different values of Δ: 6%, 9%, 12%, and 18%.
In each case, 𝑇𝑇𝑞𝑞 is held fixed at 12 quarters while 𝑝𝑝12 is chosen to generate an unconditional frequency of
ZLB episodes of 0.10. When the size of the risk premium shock is low (Δ= 6%), the distribution of ZLB
episodes is very similar to the AR(1) case. Even though the risk-premium shocks are long-lived, they are
not large enough to keep the economy in the ZLB for extended periods because other shocks tend to
quickly push the economy out. As a result, ZLB episodes end up being frequent and short-lived, as in the
AR(1) case. But as the size of the risk-premium shock goes up, the distribution of ZLB durations shifts
away from short durations and toward longer-lived episodes. In part, this increase in the duration of ZLB
episodes is generated by eliminating short breaks in periods with low interest rates. For example, a risk
premium shock lasting 8 quarters can push the nominal interest rate towards zero but an expansionary
demand can interrupt the spell of low interest rates. As a result, the simulated path may have three periods
at the ZLB, then one period outside the ZLB, and then another four periods at the ZLB even though these
eight periods are effectively the same episode. A sufficiently high Δ ensures that such interruptions are
minimized which raises the average duration of ZLB episodes. In contrast, the AR(1) model does not
allow for a straightforward treatment of such breaks. Once Δ is large enough, we see almost no short-

8
  In principle, it is possible to push 𝜌𝜌𝑞𝑞 close to one and make ZLB episodes potentially very long. In this case,
however, we start to face numerical issues. Once we have very long periods with the Taylor principle being
violated, the model generates indeterminacy and thus can break down.

                                                                                                                12
lived ZLB episodes because the size of the risk premium shock is too large to be offset by other economic
shocks and the duration of ZLB episodes is generally close to, albeit somewhat less than, the duration of
the risk premium shock. Hence, this alternative modeling strategy is much more successful at replicating
the empirical pattern of ZLB episodes being both rare and long-lived.
         It’s also worth noting that as Δ becomes large, the distribution of ZLB episodes becomes
increasingly tight around 𝑇𝑇𝑞𝑞 , a feature which may seem unrealistic given that ZLB episodes have been
varied in duration across countries and time. This reflects our assumption that 𝑇𝑇𝑞𝑞 is deterministic and
constant. One could readily assume a stochastic process for 𝑇𝑇𝑞𝑞 , which would generate much more
variation in the distribution of durations of ZLB episodes. Unfortunately, because of the lack of historical
data on ZLB episodes, it is not clear a priori how one might best characterize this distribution. As a result,
and because our baseline calibration of Δ = 9% already seems to yield a reasonable distribution of ZLB
episodes, we prefer to treat 𝑇𝑇𝑞𝑞 as a constant.

3.2     ZLB Duration, Welfare, and Optimal Inflation

We now consider how changes in the duration of ZLB episodes affect welfare. To do so, we first illustrate
how welfare changes with different levels of steady state inflation under different calibrations of the risk
premium process. Parameters for the risk premium are chosen to achieve different average durations of
ZLB episodes but a fixed unconditional frequency of the ZLB equal to 0.1 when the steady state level of
inflation in the model is equal to 3.5% (the historical average for the U.S.). We then simulate the model
for each set of parameter values under different levels of steady state inflation to quantify changes in
welfare.
         The results for the AR(1) assumption for risk premia are plotted in Panel A of Figure 5 for
average ZLB durations ranging from a little over two quarters to almost seven quarters. When the average
ZLB duration is very low (about two quarters), welfare losses are very high at all levels of inflation. This
is because achieving short durations of ZLB episodes for this fixed frequency requires very volatile risk
premium shocks, and this volatility generates a very high level of welfare losses. These losses decline as
average durations rise to around five quarters because the latter requires much less volatile shocks to the
risk premium.
         As ZLB durations get much higher, the welfare losses experienced at low levels of steady state
inflation become extremely high, the welfare curves start to shift down, and the peaks of the curves start
to move to the right. The first and second observations suggest that the cost of ZLB episodes increases in
the duration of ZLB episodes. As a result, it is optimal to trade off some steady-state inflation for a
reduced incidence of the ZLB.
         To confirm this intuition, we plot the cost of the ZLB per quarter for the same combination of
parameters in Panel A of Figure 6. As the duration of ZLB episodes increases, the welfare cost per period
of ZLB rises. Furthermore, the increase in the cost is non-linear and rapid. If steady-state inflation is zero,
then for the combination of 𝜌𝜌𝑞𝑞 and 𝜎𝜎𝑞𝑞2 with the implied average duration of ZLB episodes equal to
approximately 7 quarters, the permanent consumption-equivalent cost of a quarter at ZLB is a whopping
13%. This cost, however, rapidly declines with the average duration of ZLB episodes. For example, with
the same unconditional frequency of binding ZLB but an average duration equal 4 quarters, the cost is
around 1.3%. These costs also decline sharply with higher levels of trend inflation, since the latter reduce
the duration of ZLB episodes. For example, the same calibration that yields a 13% cost of a quarter at the



                                                                                                            13
ZLB when steady-state inflation is zero yields a much smaller ZLB cost per quarter of just over 2% when
steady-state inflation is 3%.
         With AR(1) shocks, a small increase in the duration of ZLB from around 5.5 quarters to almost 7
quarters is associated with an increase in the optimal steady-state level of inflation from 1.5% per year to
around 2.5% per year. From a policy point of view, this is a dramatic difference in the inflation rate
coming from a relatively small change in the average duration of ZLB episodes. This sensitivity of the
optimal rate of inflation reflects the fact that that while the average duration of the ZLB may be rising
only little, engineering this change with AR(1) shocks requires generating some dramatically longer-lived
ZLB episodes in the tail of the distribution of ZLB durations to make up for the fact that most episodes
remain very short-lived, as illustrated in Figure 3. Because long-lasting episodes are extremely costly in
the model, even a very rare occurrence of such episodes translates into a non-trivial unconditional cost of
the ZLB. These episodes are extremely costly because the Taylor principle is not satisfied for a long time
and thus a large volatility of output, inflation and consumption is possible. Because the cost of the ZLB is
convex in ZLB duration, the welfare loss essentially explodes with these very long-lived ZLB episodes.
As a result, raising the steady state inflation rate becomes worthwhile to offset these otherwise extremely
rare and costly events.
         The very high sensitivity of the optimal inflation rate to the average duration of the ZLB therefore
appears to be an artefact of the empirically unrealistic distribution of ZLB episodes generated by AR(1)
shocks, making it an unreliable guide to policy. We therefore turn to the predictions of the regime
switching approach, which can generate more empirically realistic distributions of ZLB episodes. First,
the shapes of the welfare curves in the regime-switching model (Panel B of Figure 5) are qualitatively
similar to those of the AR(1) model. When average ZLB durations are relatively high, the welfare losses
of low trend inflation are particularly large. This again reflects the disproportionately high cost of ZLB
episodes when average durations are higher, as illustrated in Panel B of Figure 6. Second, the optimal
inflation rate is rising with the average duration of ZLB episodes (once these are sufficiently high) as
higher levels of inflation work to reduce the incidence of these episodes that induce such high welfare
costs.
         However, there are also some important differences between the results for the AR(1) and
regime-switching models. One is that the curvature in Panel B is weaker than that in Panel A, especially
at higher durations of ZLB episodes. Another is that the peaks of the curves in Panel B are closer to zero
than in Panel A, such that welfare is generally higher in the regime-switching model than in the AR(1)
model. The latter reflects the fact that ZLB episodes are less costly in the regime-switching model than in
the AR(1) model even when we use high values of Δ. Panel B of Figure 6 confirms this conjecture: the
costs of the ZLB per quarter of hit are more compressed and flatter in the regime switching model than in
the AR(1) model. For example, at 𝜋𝜋� = 0, an average duration of ZLB episodes of 7 quarters yields a
welfare cost of 13% in consumption equivalent per quarter of binding ZLB under AR(1) shocks but only
around 3.5% with regime switching in the risk premium. This much smaller cost suggests that raising
steady-state inflation levels might be less effective at combatting ZLB in the regime-switching model than
in the AR(1) model. Indeed, in Panel B of Figure 5, we see that raising the average duration of ZLB
episodes by a full year raises the optimal inflation rate by less than a percentage point, a significantly
reduced sensitivity relative to the AR(1) case.
         Since the cost of the ZLB is lower in the regime-switching model than in the AR(1) model, the
implied optimal steady-state rate of inflation rate is also lower in the regime-switching model. For
example, when average durations of ZLB episodes are around 5-5.5 quarters, the optimal inflation rate is

                                                                                                          14
1.4% with regime switching risk premia but approximately 1.7% with AR(1) shocks. When average
durations are higher, the differences are even more pronounced: the optimal inflation rate with AR(1)
shocks is nearly 3% when ZLB episodes have an average duration of 6.8 quarters whereas it is only 1.8%
with regime switching in risk premia.
        In short, these results highlight the pitfalls associated with relying on AR(1) shocks to study how
economies hit the ZLB. Because this approach necessarily implies the existence of many very short-lived
ZLB episodes, generating longer average durations requires hitting the economy with extremely long-
lived and disproportionately costly episodes that drive welfare and policy results. In contrast, the regime
switching approach can deliver a more realistic distribution of ZLB episodes and this distribution implies
a smaller sensitivity of the optimal inflation rate to the average duration of ZLB episodes.

3.3     Optimal Inflation Rates for Different Durations and Frequencies of the Zero Bound

In Figure 5, we provided some results on optimal inflation rates for a few average durations of ZLB
episodes and a single unconditional frequency of ZLB episodes. But as discussed earlier, the paucity of
historical experience with this type of episode should make anyone wary of taking a strong stand on the
precise values of these parameters. As a result, we now consider a much wider range of both frequencies
and durations of ZLB episodes and characterize optimal inflation rates in each case.
         Our results for AR(1) shocks are presented in Panel A of Figure 7 while analogous results for
regime switching model are in Panel B of Figure 7. In each case, we plot optimal inflation rates (vertical
axis) associated with different average durations of ZLB episodes (horizontal axis) and unconditional
frequencies of the ZLB (captured by isoquants), where the latter two are measured at a 3.5% steady state
inflation rate. The key result in the case of AR(1) shocks is, regardless of the specific frequency of the
ZLB, the optimal inflation rate rises extremely rapidly with the average duration, as indicated by the slope
of the isoquants. For example, going from an average duration of the ZLB of five quarters at an
unconditional frequency of ZLB episodes equal to 7% to an average duration of eight quarters raises the
optimal inflation rate from about 2% to almost 4.5%. But as discussed earlier, this excessive sensitivity
reflects the unrealistic distribution of ZLB episodes generated by AR(1) shocks to risk premia.
         A second unappealing feature of the AR(1) approach to modeling shocks is the fact that low
frequency isoquants are to the left of higher frequency isoclines. This implies that for a given average
duration of ZLB episodes, a higher frequency of the ZLB is associated with a lower optimal rate of
inflation. The reason is that we cannot separately calibrate the volatility of the risk premium and the
frequency and duration of ZLB episodes with only two parameters for the shock process, which is yet
another undesirable property of AR(1) shocks.
         Panel B of Figure 7 presents the analogous results from the regime switching approach to
modeling shocks that push the economy into the zero bound on interest rates. The first difference to note
is that, as expected, the slopes of the isoquants are now much flatter: optimal inflation rates rise less
rapidly with average ZLB durations. This reflects the fact that one does not need to introduce extremely
long-lived ZLB periods to change the average duration as is the case with AR(1) shocks. Nonetheless,
high inflation rates can be sustained as optimal if one believes that average durations of ZLB episodes are
sufficiently high or sufficiently frequent.
         A second difference to note is that the regime switching approach now implies that, holding the
average duration constant, higher frequencies of the ZLB would be associated with higher optimal rates of
inflation. This result holds even at lower levels of Δ, as illustrated in Appendix Figure 1. Hence, the


                                                                                                         15
alternative modeling strategy of regime switching shocks can fix this additional undesirable property of
AR(1) shocks when it comes to characterizing the tradeoffs faced by policymakers.
          More broadly, the results in Panel B of Figure 7 suggest that a wide range of optimal inflation
rates can potentially be defended, depending on what one perceives to be the correct values for the
average duration and frequency of ZLB episodes are. For example, relying only on the U.S. post-war
experience of a single ZLB episode lasting seven years over a seventy year period points to an
unconditional frequency of 10% and an average duration of twenty-eight quarters. This duration would
justify an optimal inflation rate of approximately five percent, well above the Federal Reserve’s current
objective of two percent but in line with recommendations made by economists like Olivier Blanchard
and Paul Krugman. Of course, other countries such as Canada experienced much shorter ZLB episodes
during the Great Recession and other advanced economies such as Australia and New Zealand did not
reach the ZLB at all. This suggests that the U.S. experience is likely not an average experience.
          To get a better sense of the cross-country experience with the zero bound on interest rates since
World War II, we summarize the experience of a range of advanced economies since 1950 in Table 2.
Only Switzerland has experienced one-quarter long ZLB experiences, in 1972Q1 and again in 1972Q3.
All other durations have been of at least one year. There are several episodes of approximately one year in
length, although some of these are what one might consider interrupted sequences of longer underlying
periods of economic weakness, such as the Euro-zone and Sweden from 2009Q3-2010Q3. For countries
still at the ZLB, we assume that they will remain at the ZLB until 2015Q4 and measure durations and
frequencies using this final date.
          Figure 8 plots the distribution of the duration of ZLB episodes from Table 2 as well as a kernel
estimate of the density. Despite the small number of observations, we can see that this distribution
resembles, at least loosely, the distribution of ZLB episodes of the regime switching model with Δ = 9%.
There is a small but non-zero share of very short ZLB episodes, but the vast majority of ZLB episodes are
longer-lived, with significant dispersion in terms of actual durations of ZLB episodes. We interpret this as
suggesting that our calibration of the model is indeed well suited to characterize the empirical distribution
of ZLB episodes and also that the U.S. experience with the ZLB is in the upper ranges, at least in terms of
durations. The mean duration across all episodes, for comparison, is fourteen quarters, less than half what
the U.S. will have spent at the ZLB since the start of the Great Recession. If Japan is excluded from the
sample, or if we include all of the Euro-zone countries as separate observations, the mean durations are
lower still, at 11.5 and 12.3 quarters respectively. Hence, we interpret a reasonable estimate for average
durations at the ZLB as somewhere between ten and fifteen quarters.
           For each country in this sample, we also estimate the frequency of the ZLB as the share of
quarters spent at the ZLB between 1950Q1 and 2015Q4. These frequencies range from a high of 23% for
Japan to a low of 0% for Norway, Australia, and New Zealand, the three countries who experienced no
ZLB periods at all over this time period. The U.S. frequency, at 11%, is again well above the average
frequency across all countries in the sample, which is given by 7.5%. Excluding Japan lowers this
frequency further to just under 6%, although it can go as high as 11% if we exclude those countries which
have never experienced a ZLB episode from our estimate. Again, the U.S. is on the high end of estimates,
and the cross-country experience suggests a plausible range of values for the frequency of ZLB estimates
ranging anywhere from 6% to 11%. 9

  Dropping the high-inflation period (e.g. 1968-1982), when reaching the ZLB was less likely given higher nominal
interest rates, reduces the length of the sample and therefore raises measured frequencies somewhat. Monetary

                                                                                                              16
         With these of ranges of values for the frequency and duration of ZLB episodes in mind, we can
then reexamine optimal inflation rates in Panel B of Figure 7. If we consider the very low end of our
estimates for both frequency and duration of ZLB episodes (a duration of around 10 quarters and a
frequency of 6%), then our model points toward an optimal level of the annual inflation rate of 1.5%. The
high end of our estimates for both frequency and duration of ZLB episodes (a duration of around 15
quarters and a frequency of 11%) points instead toward an optimal rate of inflation of 3%. Hence, these
results suggest that reasonable bounds for the optimal rate of inflation are 1.5-3%.
         The results vary little if we consider alternative calibrations of our regime switching model. In
Appendix Figure 1, we plot equivalent results as those in Figure 7 using Δ = 6% and Δ = 12%. With the
former, ZLB episodes are less costly, so optimal inflation rates are somewhat lower. But the equivalent
range is only slightly changed, to 1.5-2.8%. With a higher value of Δ, ZLB episodes become more costly
and optimal inflation rates rise. In this case, the range of optimal inflation rates becomes 1.6-4.0%. But as
illustrated in Figure 4, neither calibration is as successful in replicating the historical distribution of ZLB
durations as our baseline calibration.

4       Conclusion

Economies rarely hit the zero bound on interest rates, but when they do, these episodes tend to be long-
lived. This simple empirical pattern is one that is not replicated by traditional models of optimal inflation
that incorporate the zero bound on interest rates. We show that the most common approach to modeling
shocks that drive the economy into the zero bound yields a distribution of ZLB episodes that is
counterfactual: ZLB episodes are frequent and short-lived rather than rare and long-lived. And this
counterfactual distribution is not innocuous. The fact that AR(1) shocks have to generate a large share of
very short-lived ZLB episodes implies that longer average durations of ZLB episodes can only occur if
there are also extremely long-lived episodes that generate disproportionately large welfare costs. The
latter make policymakers very willing to raise inflation rates to avoid the ZLB, making the optimal
inflation rate exceedingly sensitive to the average duration rate of ZLB episodes.
         In contrast, we show that a regime switching approach to modeling the shocks that push the
economy into the ZLB can generate an empirically realistic distribution of ZLB episodes and that this
approach does not generate the same sensitivity of the optimal inflation rate to the average duration of
ZLB episodes. The optimal rate of inflation is still sensitive to the ZLB since the latter is costly, and more
frequent or long-lived episodes increase the incentives of policymakers to raise the target rate of inflation,
but this incentive is much reduced relative to what is implied by the standard approach to modeling
shocks.
         The specific optimal rate of inflation implied by the model remains very sensitive to one’s beliefs
about the frequency and duration of ZLB episodes, values for which history provides only limited
guidance. Using only the U.S. post-WWII experience, for example, our model would imply an optimal
rate of inflation above 4%. From a broader cross-section of countries’ historical experiences with the
ZLB, one could just as readily conclude that the optimal rate of inflation is 2%, with a plausible range of
values running from 1.5% to at least 3%. Given the uncertainty associated with measuring historical
frequencies and durations associated with ZLB episodes, the range of plausible outcomes for optimal
inflation rates implies that profound humility is called for by anyone advocating a specific inflation target.

policy prior to this period appears to have been made similarly to that of post-Volcker era (Romer and Romer 2002),
so there is little reason to disregard the earlier time period.

Notes: The table presents a summary of ZLB episodes for advanced economies since World War II. We use
Germany as representative of Euro-zone economies. For countries currently at the ZLB and expected to remain so
through the end of 2015, we list the end of the episode as 2015Q4. Frequencies are measured using data starting in
1950Q1 going until 2015Q4. “Average with all Euro countries” incorporates eleven additional countries with the
same ZLB experience as Germany.

Notes: Each figure plots combinations of parameters that yield specific frequencies of ZLB episodes in simulated data, as indicated by isoquants.
In the left panel, the two parameters are the persistence of the AR(1) process for the risk premium (x-axis) and its volatility (y-axis). In the right
panel, the two parameters are the duration of the risk premium shock (x-axis) and the probability that a risk premium shock will occur in periods
when the economy is not in the ZLB (y-axis). The size of the risk premium shock in Panel B is 9%. See section 3.1 for details.



                                                                                                                                                     22

Notes: Each figure plots how average durations of ZLB episodes change as persistence of risk premium shocks varies holding constant the
unconditional frequency of ZLB episodes. In panel A, shocks are AR(1), so persistence depends on 𝜌𝜌𝑞𝑞 , with 𝜎𝜎𝑞𝑞2 being changed in offsetting way to
hold frequency of ZLB constant along isoquants. In panel B, shocks follow regime-switching, so 𝑇𝑇𝑞𝑞 determines the duration of the risk premium
shock while 𝑝𝑝12 is changed in offsetting manner to hold frequency of ZLB constant along isoquants. The size of the risk premium shock in Panel
B is 9%. See section 3.1 for details.



                                                                                                                                                  23

Notes: The figure plots the distribution of durations of ZLB episodes from simulating the model with
AR(1) shocks for different average durations of ZLB episodes but a constant unconditional frequency of
ZLB episodes. This is done by changing the persistence and volatility of the shock process. See section
3.1 for details.




                                                                                                    24
            FIGURE 4. DURATION OF ZLB EPISODES WITH REGIME-SWITCHING SHOCKS




Notes: The figure plots the distribution of durations of ZLB episodes from simulating the model with a
regime switching risk premium shock for different average durations of ZLB episodes but a constant
unconditional frequency of ZLB episodes. The duration of the risk premium shock (𝑇𝑇𝑞𝑞 ) is held constant
but the size of the risk premium shock (Δ) and the probability of a high risk premium occurring outside
the ZLB (𝑝𝑝12 ) are allowed to vary to achieve the changing average duration of ZLB episodes with fixed
unconditional frequency. See section 3.1 for details.

Notes: The figures plots welfare losses (y-axis) associated with different levels of annual trend inflation (x-axis) for different calibrations of the
average duration of ZLB episodes (different colored lines) holding the unconditional frequency of ZLB episodes fixed at 0.10 for a trend inflation
level of 3.5%. Panel A is done for AR(1) shocks, in which case 𝜌𝜌𝑞𝑞 and 𝜎𝜎𝑞𝑞2 are varying to change the ZLB durations. Panel B is done for regime
switching risk premia, with Δ=9% while 𝑇𝑇𝑞𝑞 and 𝑝𝑝12 are varied to change the average durations of ZLB episodes. See section 3.2 for details.

Notes: The figures plots the cost of each ZLB period (y-axis) associated with different levels of annual trend inflation (x-axis) for different

In this appendix, we present a more detailed version of the model from section 2 in the paper.


Household
The representative consumer maximizes the present discounted value of the utility stream from
consumption and leisure
                                                                                                        1

where C is consumption of the final good, N(i) is labor supplied to individual industry i, 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺 is the gross
growth rate of technology, η is the Frisch labor supply elasticity, ℎ the internal habit parameter and β is
the discount factor. 10 The budget constraint each period t is given by

where S is the stock of one-period bonds held by the consumer, R is the gross nominal interest rate, P is
the price of the final good, W(i) is the nominal wage earned from labor in industry i, T is real lump sum
taxation (or transfers), Γ are real profits from ownership of firms, 𝑞𝑞 is a risk premium shock, and ξ is the
shadow value of wealth. 11


The risk premium shock 𝑞𝑞 is defined as follows:
                     𝑞𝑞
𝑞𝑞𝑡𝑡 = exp�𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡 �
 𝑞𝑞             𝑞𝑞                 𝑞𝑞
𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡 = 𝜌𝜌𝑞𝑞 𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝜀𝜀𝑡𝑡−1
       𝑞𝑞
with 𝜀𝜀𝑡𝑡−1 iid normally distributed.


The first order conditions from this utility-maximization problem are then:
            (𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡 − ℎ𝐺𝐺𝐴𝐴𝑡𝑡 𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡−1 )−1 − 𝛽𝛽ℎ𝐸𝐸𝑡𝑡 𝐺𝐺𝐴𝐴𝑡𝑡+1 (𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡+1 − ℎ𝐺𝐺𝐴𝐴𝑡𝑡+1 𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡 )−1 = 𝜉𝜉𝑡𝑡 ,               (3)
            𝑁𝑁𝑡𝑡 (𝑖𝑖)1/𝜂𝜂 = 𝜉𝜉𝑡𝑡 𝑊𝑊𝑡𝑡 (𝑖𝑖)/𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡 ,                                                             (4)
            𝜉𝜉𝑡𝑡 /𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡 = 𝛽𝛽𝐸𝐸𝑡𝑡 [𝜉𝜉𝑡𝑡+1 𝑞𝑞𝑡𝑡 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 /𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡+1 ].                                                  (5)


10
   We use internal habits rather than external habits because they more closely match the (lack of) persistence in
consumption growth in the data. The gross growth rate of technology enters the habit term to simplify derivations.
11
   As discussed in Smets and Wouters (2007), a positive shock to q, which is the wedge between the interest rate
controlled by the central bank and the return on assets held by the households, increases the required return on assets
and reduces current consumption. The shock q has similar effects as net-worth shocks in models with financial
accelerators. Such financial shocks have arguably played a major role in causing the zero lower bound to bind in
practice. Amano and Shukayev (2010) also document that shocks like q are essential for generating a binding zero
lower bound in the New Keynesian model.

Final Goods

Production of the final good is done by a perfectly competitive sector which combines a continuum of

intermediate goods into a final good per the following aggregator
                            1                                    𝜃𝜃/(𝜃𝜃−1)

where Y is the final good and Y(i) is intermediate good i, while θ denotes the elasticity of substitution
across intermediate goods, yielding the following demand curve for goods of intermediate sector i
                𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡 (𝑖𝑖) = 𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡 (𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡 (𝑖𝑖)/𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡 )−𝜃𝜃                                                                           (7)
and the following expression for the aggregate price level
                               1                               1/(1−𝜃𝜃)
                𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡 = �∫0 𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡 (𝑖𝑖)(1−𝜃𝜃) 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 �                         .                                                     (8)


Government
We allow for government consumption of final goods (𝐺𝐺). Government budget constraint is defined as
                                        𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡−1 𝑞𝑞𝑡𝑡−1 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡−1          1 𝑁𝑁𝑡𝑡 (𝑖𝑖)𝑊𝑊𝑡𝑡 (𝑖𝑖)

𝐺𝐺𝑡𝑡 = exp(𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡𝐺𝐺 ) 𝐺𝐺̅𝑡𝑡                                                                                                       (10)
𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡𝐺𝐺   =          𝐺𝐺
             𝜌𝜌𝐺𝐺 𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡−1   +   𝜀𝜀𝑡𝑡𝐺𝐺
       𝐺𝐺
with 𝜀𝜀𝑡𝑡−1 iid normally distributed
𝐺𝐺̅𝑡𝑡 is the path of government spending such that the share of government spending in the economy is fixed
when prices are flexible
Substituting household’s budget constraint (2) into the government budget constraint (9)
                                                       1
𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡 + 𝐺𝐺𝑡𝑡 = Γ𝑡𝑡 + (1 − 𝜈𝜈) ∫0 (𝑁𝑁𝑡𝑡 (𝑖𝑖)𝑊𝑊𝑡𝑡 (𝑖𝑖)/𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡 )𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑                                                                  (11)


Market Clearing
Firms’ aggregate real profits are
              1                          1     1                                                     1
Γ𝑡𝑡 = ∫0 Γ𝑡𝑡 (𝑖𝑖) 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 = ∫0 𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡 (𝑖𝑖)𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡 (𝑖𝑖) − (1 − 𝜈𝜈)𝑁𝑁𝑡𝑡 (𝑖𝑖)𝑊𝑊𝑡𝑡 (𝑖𝑖)𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 = 𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡 − (1 − 𝜈𝜈) ∫0 (𝑁𝑁𝑡𝑡 (𝑖𝑖)𝑊𝑊𝑡𝑡 (𝑖𝑖)/𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡 )𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 (12)
                        𝑃𝑃                𝑡𝑡

Plug (12) in (11), this gives us the goods market clearing condition for the economy
                𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡 = 𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡 + 𝐺𝐺𝑡𝑡 .                                                                                            (13)


Intermediate Goods
The production of each intermediate good is done by a monopolist facing a production function linear in
labor
                𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡 (𝑖𝑖) = At 𝑁𝑁𝑡𝑡 (𝑖𝑖)                                                                                        (14)

                                                                                                                                       32
At = exp(𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡𝐴𝐴 )
                𝐴𝐴        𝐴𝐴
𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡𝐴𝐴 = 𝜇𝜇 + 𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝜀𝜀𝑡𝑡−1
        𝐴𝐴
with 𝜀𝜀𝑡𝑡−1 iid normally distributed, and 𝐴𝐴 denotes the level of technology, common across firms. Each
intermediate good producer has sticky prices, modeled as in Calvo (1983) where 1 − 𝜆𝜆 is the probability
that each firm will be able to reoptimize its price each period. We allow for indexation of prices to
steady-state inflation by firms who do not reoptimize their prices each period, with 𝜔𝜔𝑠𝑠 and 𝜔𝜔𝑑𝑑
respectively representing the degree of static and dynamic indexation (0 for no indexation to 1 for full
indexation). Denoting the optimal reset price of firm i by B(i), re-optimizing firms solve the following
profit-maximization problem
                                                                                                              𝑗𝑗                      𝜔𝜔𝑑𝑑
