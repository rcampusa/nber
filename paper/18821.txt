Did Housing Policies Cause the Postwar Boom in Homeownership?

                                              ABSTRACT

After the collapse of housing markets during the Great Depression, the U.S. government played a large
role in shaping the future of housing finance and policy. Soon thereafter, housing markets witnessed
the largest boom in recent history. The objective in this paper is to quantify the contribution of government
interventions in housing markets in the expansion of U.S. homeownership using an equilibrium model
of tenure choice. In the model, home buyers have access to a menu of mortgage choices to finance
the acquisition of a house. The government also provides special programs through provisions of the
tax code. The parameterized model is consistent with key aggregate and distributional features observed
in the 1940 U.S. economy and is capable of accounting for the boom in homeownership in 1960. The
decomposition suggests that government policies have significant importance. For example, the expansion
in maturity of the fixed-rate mortgage to 30 years can account for 12 percent of the increase. Housing
policies, such as the introduction of the mortgage interest deduction or the taxation of housing services
can have significant effects on homeownership.

1       Introduction
From a historical perspective, the recent expansion homeownership is small compared
with the one that started in 1940. Before the Great Depression there was little federal
involvement in U.S. housing except for land grants and the regulation of commercial
banks. As a result of the foreclosure problem that coincided with the 1929 stock market
collapse, the role of government in residential housing expanded.1 The government played
a large role in shaping the future of U.S. housing …nance and housing policy.
    Before the Great Depression many mortgages were short term (5-7 years), balloon-
type (non-amortizing) with large down payment requirements (50-60 percent). As a result
of New Deal policies, government agencies began to o¤er standard …xed-rate mortgage
(FRM) contracts with longer maturities (20-30 years) and a higher loan-to-value ratio (80
percent and above). A government agency was established to create a secondary market
to provide liquidity and expand credit by buying primarily FHA-insured loans.
    During this period the government also changed the treatment of owner-occupied
housing in the federal income tax system. This policy changed the e¤ective price of owner-
occupied housing services because of the deductibility of local property taxes, mortgage
interest payments, and by the omission of imputed rents from adjusted gross income. All
of these interventions coincided with a signi…cant expansion in homeownership (Figure
1). Between 1940 and 1960, the percentage of owner-occupied households increased from
44 to 62 percent.

    It is important to determine the contribution of government intervention in the expan-
sion in the homeownership rate. An extensive empirical literature shows the important
contribution of various government programs. Yearns (1976) argues that the increase in
homeownership can be explained by the increased availability of mortgage funds from Fed-
eral Housing Administration (FHA) and the Veterans Administration (VA), and the easy
monetary policy of the Federal Reserve System. Housing provisions in the tax code have
    1
    For example, the Home Owners Loan Act of 1933 and the National Housing Act of 1934 were
designed to stabilize the …nancial system. The National Housing Act established the Federal Housing
Administration (FHA) with the objective of regulating the terms of mortgages.


                                                             3
also contributed to increased ownership. Rosen and Rosen (1980) estimate that between
1949 and 1974 about one-fourth of the increase in homeownership was a result of implicit
subsidies toward housing embedded in the personal income tax code. Hendershott and
Shilling (1982) support this claim by their …nding that the decline in the cost of owning
a home relative to the cost of renting during the period 1955 to 1979 was due to income
tax provisions.
    Some historians have credited passage of the Serviceman’s Readjustment Act of 1994
(the GI bill) with playing a vital role in opening the doors of higher education to millions
and helping set the stage for the decades of widely shared prosperity that followed WWII.
Almost 70 percent of men who turned 21 between 1940 and 1955 were guaranteed an
essentially free college education under one of the two GI Bills.2 Fetters (2010) has
estimated that the VA policy of making zero down payment mortgage loans available to
World War II and the Korean War veterans after 1946 accounts for a 10 percent increase in
homeownership. The aforementioned research has attempted to measure the importance
of a particular factor using a regression-based framework that attempts to hold other
potential factors constant. As is known, the results from this empirical approach depend
on the availability of data and the degree of interaction between the various factors.
    This study employs a di¤erent empirical approach; we use a dynamic general equilib-
rium model and focus on the contributions of government interventions in housing markets
to the expansion of U.S. homeownership. The interventions include the role in housing
…nancing as well as subsidies toward housing embedded in the federal income tax code.
The framework is a modi…cation of the life-cycle mortgage choice framework developed by
Chambers, Garriga, and Schlagenhauf (2009a). This approach allows the di¤erent factors
to dynamically interact and thus provides a laboratory to study the e¤ects of changes in
government regulation on individual incentives and relative prices. It also allows us to
perform counterfactual experiments.3
    The model includes ex-ante households that di¤er in education status and income
risk. These households purchase consumption goods and housing services and invest in
capital and/or housing. The purchase of housing services is intertwined with tenure and
duration decisions. Housing is a lumpy investment that requires a down payment and
long-term mortgage …nancing, and receives preferential tax treatment. The model allows
economic agents to make optimal decisions in an environment that re‡ects the economic
and institutional environment of the relevant time period. Home buyers have access to
multiple types of mortgage loans. These loans are provided by a centralized …nancial sector
that receives deposits from households and lends capital to private …rms. The model has
a homeowner-based rental market that allows the house price-to-rental price ratio to be
endogenous. The production sector uses a neoclassical technology with capital and labor
that produces consumption/investment goods and residential investment. In the model,
a government implements a housing policy through various programs and collects revenue
via a progressive income tax system. The baseline model is (1) parameterized to match

males in the 1970 census.

     This paper follows the tradition of Amaral and MacGee (2002), Cole and Ohanian (2002,2004),
Hayashi and Prescott (2002), Ohanian (1997), and Perri and Quadrini (2002), who used quantitative
techniques in the study of historical events.

the key features of the U.S. economy during the late 1930s, and then (2) used to determine
the contribution of various government policies for the expansion of homeownership.
    In the early 1940s, government-sponsored mortgages tended to be 20-year duration
contracts. By 1960, the duration of government-sponsored contracts increased to 30
years. The model suggests that the length of the mortgage contract sponsored by the
FHA can account for roughly 12 percent of the total increase in homeownership. When
combined with a narrowing mortgage interest rate wedge, the total impact of mortgage
innovation is approximately 21 percent. Given the role of housing …nance in ownership,
the implications of longer-maturity mortgage contracts are also studied. The model indi-
cates that increasing the maturity beyond 30 years has only a marginal (negative) e¤ect
on ownership. These results raise the question: “Why was the FRM not more e¤ective
in increasing homeownership in the 1940s?” The model suggests that the slow income
growth and the relatively high house prices made this contract less attractive.
    Housing policies in the tax code have signi…cant impact in the incentives to own a
house, but the magnitude depends on the size of the general equilibrium e¤ects. In
particular, the elimination of the mortgage deduction only reduces ownership when prices
are …xed and the tax surplus is not rebated back to the household sector. The taxation
of housing services always reduces the ownership.
    This paper is organized into …ve sections. Section 2 presents a brief economic history
from 1930 to 1960 as well as some data for this period. Section 3 develops our model
economy. In order to conduct a historical decomposition analysis the model must be
calibrated and estimated to the late 1930s. This is discussed in Section 4 which also
discusses data used to calibrate the model to 1960 in order to conduct our decomposition
analysis. Section 5 conducts and discusses the results of the decomposition analysis. The
…nal section concludes.


2     Government Programs and Housing Markets
In the late 1930s, and early 1940s, the economy was recovering from the Great Depression.
Not surprising, the economic environment substantially changed in the following years.
This section describes some of the policy changes that occurred between 1930 and 1960.

2.1    The FHA and the Regulation of Housing Finance
In 1900, mortgage lenders consisted of mutual savings banks, life insurance companies,
savings and loan associations(S&Ls), and commercial banks. Mutual savings banks were
the dominate lenders, whereas commercial banks played a small role. After 1900 the
importance of mutual saving banks declined while life insurance companies and savings
and S&Ls substantially increased their market shares. Commercial banks did not become
dominant mortgage lenders until after World War II. The reason commercial banks were
a relatively unimportance source of mortgage funds is the National Banking Act, which
made real estate loans inconsistent with sound banking practice. Hence, any commercial
bank mortgage loans were restricted to state-chartered banks. In 1913, the Federal Reserve
Act liberalized restrictions that limited participation in the mortgage market for national
banks. As a result, the importance of commercial banks in this market steadily increased.

                                            5
    Perhaps a more important change occurred in the structure of the mortgage contract.
LTV ratios, length of contract, and contract structure as related to amortization were
changing. For the period 1920 to 1940, a common belief is that mortgage loans were non-
amortizing and characterized by a short-term balloon payment with a high LTV ratio.
Grebler, Blank, and Winnick (1956) examine data from life insurance companies, com-
mercial banks, and S&Ls and …nd that partially amortizing loans did exist during this
period. Between 1920 and 1940, approximately 50 percent of mortgage loans issued by
commercial banks were non-amortized contracts. For life insurance companies, approx-
imately 20 percent of mortgage contracts in the period 1920-1934 were non-amortizing.
For the same period, the percent of this type of loans issued by saving and loan associa-
tions did not exceed 7 percent. However, by the early 1940s, Saulnier (1950) reports that
95 percent of mortgage loans issued by saving and loan associations were fully amortizing.
Over approximately the same period, Behrens (1952) claims 73 percent of loans issued by
commercial banks were fully amortized, and Edwards (1950) …nds 99.7 percent of saving
and loan association contracts were fully amortized.
    The belief that mortgage contracts before 1950 were of shorter duration and with lower
LTV ratios compared with the postwar period is accurate. Table 1 presents mortgage
durations for loans originated by life insurance companies, commercial banks, and S&Ls.
For the period 1920 to 1930, the average duration was between 6 and 11 years. After
1934, mortgage lengths (terms) increased and started to approach 20 year mortgages; this
was especially true for mortgages o¤ered by life insurance companies. LTV ratios also
changed over this period and were around 50. After 1934, LTV ratios began to increase,
and by 1947 approached 80 percent.

    An obvious question is why did mortgage contracts start to change after 1934? Before
1930, there was little federal involvement in housing except for grants as exempli…ed by
the 1862 Homestead Act. The Great Depression changed government’s role in residen-
tial housing. As a result of the foreclosure problem that coincided with the 1929 stock
market collapse, Congress responded initially with Home Loan Bank Act of 1932. This
act brought thrift institutions under the federal regulation umbrella. The Home Owners
Bank Act and the National Housing Act of 1934 were enacted. These acts were designed
to stabilize the …nancial system. The National Housing Act established the FHA which

                                                                                                 6
introduced a government guarantee in hopes of spurring construction.4 The FHA home
mortgage was initially a 20-year, fully amortizing loan with a maximum LTV ratio of 80
percent. Carliner (1998) argues that the introduction of this loan contract in‡uenced the
behavior of existing lenders, thus partially explaining the data trends in Table 1. The
changes in contract structuring took time to be implemented as state laws limiting LTV
ratios had to be modi…ed. The FHA also added restricted design, construction, and un-
derwriting standards. These government programs, part of the "New Deal" legislation,
are thought to have increased homeowner participation.
    A second government policy with the potential to a¤ect homeownership, especially
after 1950, was the federal guarantee for individual mortgage loans. Because public views
that World War I veterans received few bene…ts except the promise of a delayed bonus
payment,5 Congress passed the Servicemen’s Readjustment Act of 1944, or the "GI Bill."6
The new program included a housing bene…t to veterans. Initially no down payments were
required, based on the theory that soldiers were not paid enough to accumulate savings
and did not have an opportunity to establish a credit rating. Under the original VA loan
guarantee program, the maximum amount of guarantee was limited to 50% of the loan
and was not to exceed $2,000. Loan durations were limited to 20 years, with a maximum
interest rate of 4%. These ceilings were eliminated when market interest rates greatly
exceeded this ceiling. The VA also set a limit on the price of the home. Because of rising
house prices in 1945 the maximum amount of the guarantee to lenders was increased to
$4,000 for home loans. The maximum maturity for real estate loans was extended to 25
years for residential homes. In 1950, the maximum amount of guarantee was increased to
60% of the amount of the loan with a cap of $7,500. The maximum length of a loan was
again lengthened to 30 years.
    Were these programs quantitatively signi…cant? In Table 2, the values of FHA and
VA mortgages are reported as well as the relative importance of these mortgages in the
total home mortgage market. While the impact of government mortgage programs was
not immediate, by 1940 FHA and VA mortgages accounted for 13.5 percent of mortgages,
and by 1945 these mortgages accounted for nearly 25 percent of mortgages. In 1950 the
home mortgage share of FHA and VA mortgages was 41.9 percent. The increased role of
these government programs is due to the growth of VA mortgage contracts. Between 1949
    4
      Eccles (1951), who was a central …gure in the development of the FHA, made it clear the main intent
of the program was "pump-priming" and not reform of the mortgage market.
    5
      The 1920 Fordney Bill, a broader bene…ts program that would have allowed WWI veterans to choose
among a cash bonus, education grants, or payments toward buying a home or farm, was defeated by
the Senate. In 1924 Congress passed the Adjusted Compensation Act (the Bonus Bill), which promised
World War I veterans a bonus. The plan was intended to compensate veterans for wages lost while
serving in the military during the war, but the bonus (paid as a bond) was to be deferred until 1945.
In 1932, thousands of veterans (the "Bonus Army") marched on Washington and set up an encampment
to urge the government to pay the bonus earlier. The Bonus Army was forced by the military to leave
Washington, and the early payments (averaging about $800 per veteran) were not authorized by Congress
for another four years.
    6
      A "veteran" was an individual who served at least 90 days on active duty and was discharged or
released under conditions other than dishonorable. The qualifying service time was much higher for an
individual who was in the military but not on active duty. For World War II active duty was between
September 1940 and July 1947. For the Korean con‡ict was the active duty period was June 1950 to
January 1955.


                                                   7
and 1953, VA mortgage loans averaged 24.0 percent of the market. Clearly, these statistics
suggest the VA mortgage program may have had a signi…cant e¤ect on homeownership and
seem to support Fetter’s (2010) claim that the VA program led to a 10 percent increase
in the homeownership rate.

    The important changes in the mortgage market could have implications for mortgage
interest rates. Unfortunately, mortgage interest rates are more di¢ cult to …nd for this
period. Grebler, Blank, and Winnick (1956, Table O-1, p. 496) report a mortgage rate
series for Manhattan between 1900 and 1953 as well as a bond yield. Figure 2 shows the
mortgage interest rate was 5.11 percent in 1900, while the bond yield was 3.25.

    Between 1900 and 1930, both interest rates had increasing trends. After 1930 mortgage
interest rates declined from 5.95 percent to around 4.9 percent. This partially re‡ected an
easy money policy clearly seen in the large decline in bond yields over this period. Some
economic historians have used this information to argue that an easy money policy played
a large role in the increase in homeownership, but it could also be due to the elimination
of regional lending and a more homogeneous credit market.

2.2    Tax Treatment of Owner-Occupied Housing
During this period the U.S. government used the tax code to promote owner-occupied
housing. The most prominent provisions were the deductibility from taxable income of
mortgage interest payments and property taxes, and the exclusion of the imputed rental
value of owner-occupied housing from taxable income. A large body of empirical and
quantitative research evaluates the tax treatment of housing. This literature indicates
that the elimination of the prominent provisions would have signi…cant e¤ects for tenure
and housing consumption. These provisions introduce a wedge into the decision to invest
in housing relative to real capital, as well as the tenure (owner vs. renter) decision.
Laidler (1969), Aaron (1972), and Rosen and Rosen (1980) estimate that the elimination
of these tax provisions has sizable e¤ects on the homeownership rate. There is also
a growing literature that uses equilibrium models to assess the impact of changing such
provisions and estimate signi…cant e¤ects. For example, Berkovec and Fullerton (1992) use
a static disaggregated general equilibrium model and …nd that eliminating these provisions
generates a decline of owner-occupied housing consumption ranging between 3 and 6
percent. Chambers, Garriga, and Schlagenhauf (2009c) …nd that the elimination of these
provisions could increase the ownership rate if the resulting increase in government revenue
is rebated to households. However, most of the empirical research on the implications of
the tax treatment of owner-occupied housing are either estimated or calibrated to the
postwar period. In addition, these studies in general ignore the implications of mortgage
choice.
    The progressivity of the income tax code changed signi…cantly between 1940 and
1960. The Tax Foundation has constructed marginal tax rates by income level for 1940

                                                                       9
and 1960. As Figure 3 shows the marginal tax rates were substantially lower in 1940
than in the immediate post-war period. This should not be surprising given that the debt
accumulated from World War II and the Korean War.

    The highest marginal tax rate in 1940 was 63 percent for tax households earning $2
million or more. In contrast, the top marginal rate was 91 percent for households earning
over $200,000 in 1960. During this period, income also changed signi…cantly. Chambers,
Garriga, and Schlagenhauf (2013) document the importance of education and income
in ownership. The basic idea is that conditional on a certain level of income, a higher
marginal tax rate increases the bene…t for homeownership due to the tax break from the
deductibility of mortgage interest payments and property taxes. This distortion not only
provides an additional bene…t of owning, but also an incentive to own larger homes.


3     Model
The model is based on the overlapping-generations economy with housing and long-term
mortgages developed in Chambers, Garriga, and Schlagenhauf (2009a). A more detailed
version for the pre-World War II period can be found in Chambers, Garriga, and Schla-
genhauf (2011). The economy consists of households, a …nal goods-producing sector, a
rental property sector, a mortgage lending sector, and the government.

3.1    Households
Age Structure. The economy is populated by life-cycle households that are ex-ante
heterogeneous. The heterogeneity is due to di¤erent education levels. Let i denote the
education level of an individual and j represent the age. The term J represents the maxi-
mum number of periods a household can live. At every period, a household faces mortality
risk and uninsurable wage earning uncertainty. The survival probability, conditional on
being alive at age j; is denoted by j+1 2 [0; 1]; with 1 = 1; and J+1 = 0: For simplicity,


                                                                10
all individuals living in the household are subject to the same mortality risk. Earnings
uncertainty implies that the household is subject to income shocks that cannot be insured
via private contracts. As is usual in this class of models, annuity markets for mortality
risk are absent. The lack of these insurance markets creates a demand for precautionary
savings.
Preferences. Household preferences rank goods according to a momentary utility func-
tion u(c; d); where c represents the e¤ective consumption of goods, c; and d represents
e¤ective housing services over the life-cycle. This function satis…es the usual properties
of di¤erentiability and Inada conditions. A comment is required to de…ne e¤ective con-
sumption and e¤ective housing services. At a particular age j; a household is comprised
of adults and children. A household consists of up to two adults and children. Because
of economies of scale in consumption (housing services), e¤ective consumption (housing
services) is simply household consumption divided by a household consumption aggrega-
tor.7
Asset Structure. Households have access to a portfolio of two assets to mitigate income
and mortality risk. A …nancial asset is denoted by a0 with a net return r; and a housing
durable good is denoted by h0 with a market price p; where the prime is used to denote
future variables. This assumption simpli…es the problem because households do not need
to anticipate changes in house prices. A housing investment of size h0 can be thought
of as the number of square feet in the house. A house of size h0 yields s services.8 If a
household does not invest in housing, h = 0; the household is a renter and must purchase
housing services from a rental market. The rental price of a unit of housing services is R.
Mortgage Contracts. Housing investment is …nanced through long-term mortgage con-
tracts. These contracts have a general recursive representation. Consider the expenditure
associated with purchase of a house of size h (i.e., square feet ) with a unit price p (per
square foot). In general, a mortgage loan requires a down payment equal to percent of
the value of the house. The amount ph represents the amount of equity in the house at
the time of purchase, and D0 = (1        )ph represents the initial amount of the loan. In
a particular period, n, the borrower faces a payment amount mn (i.e., monthly or yearly
payment) that depends on the size of the original loan D0 ; the length of the mortgage, N;
and the mortgage interest rate, rm : This payment can be subdivided into an amortization,
(or principal) component, An ; which is determined by the amortization schedule, and an
interest component In ; which depends on the payment schedule. That is,

                                       mn = An + In ;            8n;                                   (1)
   7
    The aggregator used is the old OECD household aggregator. That is, if fj is the average family size
of an age j household, then e¤ective consumption is
                                                        Cj
                                         cj =                         ;
                                                [1:7 + 0:3(fj   2)]

where the denominator adjusts for economies of scale in household size. The term 1.7 indicates that the
second adult accounts for 0.7 of the consumption of the …rst adult. The term 0.3(fj 2) indicates that
each child consumes 30 percent of the …rst adult. This formulation is a simple way to introduce changes
in family structure into the model.
    8
      For the sake of simplicity, we assume a linear relationship between the house and services generated.
In other words, s = h0 :


                                                     11
where the interest payments are calculated by In = rm Dn :9 An expression that determines
how the remaining debt, Dn , changes over time can be written as

                                    Dn+1 = Dn           An ;      8n:                              (2)

This formula shows that the level of outstanding debt at the start of period n is reduced
by the amount of any principal payment. A principal payment increases the level of equity
in the home. If the amount of equity in a home at the start of period n is de…ned as Hn ;
a payment of principal equal to An increases equity in the house available in the next
period to Hn+1 : Formally,
                               Hn+1 = Hn + An ;      8n;                              (3)
where H0 = ph denotes the home equity in the initial period.
   Before the Great Depression the typical mortgage contract was characterized by no
amortization and a balloon payment at termination. A balloon loan is a very simple
contract in which the entire principal borrowed is paid in full in the last period, N: The
amortization schedule for this contract can be written as
                                              0                 8n < N
                               An =                                    :
                                         (1       )ph            n=N

This means that the mortgage payment in all periods except the last one, is equal to the
interest rate payment, In = rm D0 . Hence, the mortgage payment for this contract can be
speci…ed as
                                        In           8n < N
                          mn =                               ;
                                    (1 + rm )D0       n=N
where D0 = (1        )ph: The evolution of the outstanding level of debt can be written as

                                              Dn ;             8n < N
                                Dn+1 =                                :
                                              0;               n = N:

    With an interest-only loan and no changes in house prices, the homeowner never ac-
crues additional equity beyond the initial down payment until the …nal mortgage payment
is made. Hence, An = 0 and mn = In = rm D0 for all n: In essence, the homeowner e¤ec-
tively rents the property from the lender and the mortgage (interest) payments are the
e¤ective rental cost. As a result, the monthly mortgage payment is minimized because
no periodic payments toward equity are made. A homeowner is fully leveraged with the
bank with this type of contract. If the homeowner itemizes tax deductions, a large interest
deduction is an attractive by-product of this contract.
    After the Great Depression, the FHA sponsored a new mortgage contract characterized
by a longer duration, lower down payment requirements (i.e., higher LTV ratios), and self-
amortization with a mortgage payment comprised of both interest and principal. This loan
product is characterized by a constant mortgage payment over the term of the mortgage,
   9
    The calculation of the mortgage payment depends on the characteristics of the contract, but for all
contracts
PN        the present value of the payments must be equal to the total amount borrowed, D0       ph =
                 n
  n m n =(1 + r)   :



                                                     12
m     m1 = ::: = mN : This value, m; must be consistent with the condition that the
present value of mortgage payments repays the initial loan. That is,
                                                      PN      m
                                 D0         ph =       n            :
                                                           (1 + r)n

If this equation is solved for m; we can write m = D0 ; where = rm [1 (1 + rm ) N ] 1 :
Because the mortgage payment is constant each period and m = At + It ; the outstanding
debt decreases over time, D0 > ::: > DN : This means the …xed payment contract front-
loads interest rate payments,

                             Dn+1 = (1 + rm )Dn             m;          8n;

and thus back-loads principal payments, An = m rm Dn : The equity in the house increases
each period by the mortgage payment net of the interest payment component: Hn+1 =
Hn + [m rm Dn ] every period.
Household Income. Household income varies over the life-cycle and depends on (1)
whether the household is a worker or a retiree, (2) the return from savings and transfer
programs, and (3) the income generated from the decision to rent property when a home-
owner. Households supply their time endowment inelastically to the labor market and
earn wage income, w; per e¤ective unit of labor. The e¤ective units of labor depend on
the education level and the age of the household. The deterministic component of income
is denoted by ij and a transitory type-dependent idiosyncratic component, ij ; drawn
from a probability distribution, ij ( ij ): The expectations about income uncertainty are
drawn from this distribution. For an individual younger than j ; labor earnings are then
w ij ij : Households of age j or older receive a social security transfer that is proportional
to average labor income and is de…ned as : Pretax labor earnings are de…ned as yw ; where

                                             w   ij ij ;         if j < j
                         yw ( ; i; j) =                                       :
                                                  ;              if j j

    A second source of income is available to households that invest in housing and decide
to rent part of their investment. A household that does not consume all housing services,
h0 > d; can pay a …xed cost, $ > 0, and receive rental income yR (h0 ; d); this is denoted as

                                          R(h0    d)       $;           if h0 > d
                      yR (h0 ; d) =
                                                 0;                     if h0 = d

    Savings and transfers provide additional sources of income. Households with positive
savings receive (1 + r)a. The transfers are derived from the households that die with
positive wealth. The value of all these assets is uniformly distributed to the households
that remain alive in an equal lump sum amount of tr: The (pretax) income of a household,
y, is simply
                 y(h0 ; a; ; d; i; j) = yw ( ; i; j) + yR (h0 ; d) + (1 + r)a + tr:
    The various income sources generate a tax obligation of T; which depends on labor
income, yw , net interest earnings from savings, ra; and rental income, yR ; less deduc-
tions available in the tax code, : Examples of deductions could be the interest payment

                                                  13
deduction on mortgage loans or maintenance expenses associated with tenant-occupied
housing. Total tax obligations are denoted as

                         T = T (yw ( ; i; j) + ra + yR (h0 ; d)   ):

The Household Decision Problem. A single household’s budget constraint cannot be
easily written for this problem because such households make discrete tenure decisions.
In each period, a renter could purchase a home or a homeowner could change the size of
the house or even become a renter. Hence, the household’s budget constraint depends
on the value of the current state variables. The relevant information at the start of the
period is the education level (i.e., fewer than 8 years of education; 8 years of education;
fewer than 12 years of education; and 12 0r more years of education), i; household’s age,
j; the level of asset holding, a, the housing investment, h, the mortgage choice, z; the
mortgage balance with the bank, n, and the income shock (i; j);which is contingent on
age and education, written as : To simplify notation, let x = (i; a; h; z; n; j; ) summarize
the household’s state vector. A household could face a number of budget constraints
depending on the tenure decision. Individuals make decisions over consumption goods, c,
housing services, d, and investment in assets, a0 , and housing, h0 : Table 3 summarizes the
…ve distinct decision problems that a household must solve with respect to shelter.

                             Sell house and rent: h0 = 0

    This problem can be better understood by considering the problem of an individual
who starts a period as a renter and then considering the problem of an individuals who
starts a period as a home owner.

     Renters: A household that is currently renting, (h = 0); has two options: continue
                                            0
     renting (h0 = 0) or purchase a house (h > 0). This is a discrete choice in ownership
     that can easily be captured by the value function v (present and future utility) asso-
     ciated with these two options. Given the relevant information x = (i; j; a; 0; 0; 0; ),
     the individual chooses the option with the higher value, which can be expressed as

                                       v(x) = maxfv r ; v o g:

                                              14
       The value associated with continued renting is determined by solving
                                  v r (x) = max[u(c; d) +      j+1 Eij v(x
                                                                               0
                                                                                   )];                 (4)
                                      s:t: c + a0 + Rd = y(x)             T:
       The household is subject to non-negativity constraints on c; d; and a0 : These con-
       straints are present in all possible cases and are not explicitly stated in the other
       cases.10 The current decisions determine the state vector tomorrow x0 = (i; j +
       1; a; 0; 0; 0; 0 ).
       A household that purchases a house solves a di¤erent problem as choices must now
                     0
       be made over h > 0: This decision problem can be written as
                                  v o (x) = max[u(c; d) +      j+1 Eij v(x
                                                                               0
                                                                                   )];                 (5)
                   s:t: c + a0 + ( b (z; x) + (z; x))ph0 + m(h0 ; n; p) = y(x)                    T:
       The purchase of a home requires use of a long-term loan. The mortgage contract is
       a function that speci…es the length of the contract, N; the down payment fraction,
         (z; x) 2 [0; 1]; and the payment schedule, m: The decision to buy a house of
       value ph0 implies total borrowing must equal DN = (1            (z; x))ph0 : The payment
       structure depends on the mortgage available in any given period. The purchase of a
       house requires only an expenditure of the down payment and associated transaction
       costs, b (z; x). The model formulation is fairly general and allows for downpayment
       and transaction costs to depend on the mortgage choice, and potentially education
       status. The relevant continuation state is x0 = (i; j + 1; a0 ; h; z; N 1; 0 )
       Owners: The decision problem for a household that currently owns a house (h > 0);
       has a similar structure. However, a homeowner faces a di¤erent set of options: stay
       in the same house (h0 = h), purchase a di¤erent house (h0 6= h), or sell the house
       and acquire housing services through the rental market (h0 = 0): Given the relevant
       information state x; the individual solves
                                          v(x) = maxfv s ; v c ; v r g:
       Each of these three di¤erent values is calculated by solving three di¤erent decision
       problems.

         1. If the homeowner decides to stay in the current house the optimization problem
            can be written as
                                     v s (x) = max[u(c; h0 ) +     j+1 Eij v(x
                                                                                         0
                                                                                             )]        (6)
                                     s:t: c + a0 + m(h; n; p) = y(x)                     T:
            This problem is very simple because the homeowner must make decisions
            only on consumption and saving after making the mortgage payment. If
            the mortgage has been paid o¤ (i.e., n = 0); then m(h; n; p) = 0: Other-
            wise, the mortgage payment is positive. The next period state is given by
            x0 = (i; j + 1; a0 ; h; z; n0 ; 0 ); where n0 = maxfn 1; 0g:
  10
    The change in the size of rental property (‡ow) is not subject to transaction costs; only the change
in housing investment (stock) is subject to frictions.


                                                   15
         2. The homeowner could continue to be a homeowner but with a di¤erent housing
            position. This means the household must sell its housing position, h: The sale of
            the house generates revenue, = (1 s )ph D(h; n; p); from which transaction
            costs, s ph; and any remaining principal on the mortgage loan, D(h; n; p); must
                                                           0
            be paid. The new house that is purchased, h , requires paying transaction costs
            and down payment costs, ( b (x) + (x))ph0 ; as well as making a mortgage
            payment on the new house, which depends on the type of mortgage selected
            to …nance the new housing position, m(h; n; p): For this case, the consumer
            problem is
                                  v c (x) = max[u(c; h0 ) + j+1 Eij v(x0 )]
                        s:t: c + a0 + ( b (x) + (x))ph0 + m(h; n; p) = y(x) +                  T:
            This household must sell the existing property to purchase a new one. The
            choices depend on the income received from selling the property, ph, net of
            transactions costs from selling, s ; and the remaining principal, D(n); owed to
            the lender. The relevant future information is given by x0 = (i; j+1; a0 ; h; z 0 ; N
            1; 0 ):
         3. The …nal option is for the homeowner to sell the current house, h > 0; and
            become a renter, h0 = 0; which means the household must make a rental
            expenditure of Rd 11
       The consumer’s optimization problem for this situation is
                                   v r (x) = max[u(c; d) +       j+1 Eij v(x
                                                                               0
                                                                                   )];                   (7)
                                     s:t: c + a0 + Rd = y(x) +             T;
       and the future state vector is x0 = (i; j + 1; a0 ; 0; 0; 0; 0 ):
   Given the initial information summarized in x; the choice of whether to stay in the
house, change the housing size, or sell the house and become a renter depends on the
values of v s ; v c ; and v r :

3.2     Mortgage Lending Sector
The …nancial intermediary is a zero-pro…t …rm. This …rm receives deposits from house-
holds, a0 ; and uses these funds to make loans to …rms and households. Firms acquire
loans of capital to produce goods, and households use long-term mortgages to …nance
housing investment. This formulation does not derive the optimal mortgage contract
from the model primitives. It takes the contract structure available during a period as
given and imposes the mortgage structure as a constraint. Conditional on the legal lending
arrangements, lenders provide credit and receive ‡ows of payments to maximize pro…ts.
In addition, …nancial intermediaries receive principal payments from those individuals
who sell their homes with an outstanding mortgage position, as well as the outstanding
principal of individuals who unexpectedly die.12
  11
     In the last period, all households must sell h; rent housing services, and consume all their assets, a,
                                                                0
as a bequest motive is not in the model. In the last period, h = a0 = 0:

     The formulation of the market clearing condition derived from zero pro…t on the lender side is available
in an appendix available from the authors upon request.

3.3       Construction Sector
The stock of new homes is produced by a competitive real estate construction sector.
Producers manufacture housing units using a linear technology, IH = CH = ; where IH
represents the output of new homes, CH is the input of the consumption good, and
is a technology constant used to transform consumption goods into new housing units.
Technology is reversible; hence, homes can be transformed into consumption goods. The
optimization problem of the representative real estate …rm is given by

                                            max pIH      CH ;
                                            H;CH

                                           s:t: IH = CH = :

The …rst-order condition of the housing sector determines that the equilibrium house price
must satisfy p = : The homes produced are added to the existing housing stock as either
new units or as repairs of the existing stock. The aggregate law of motion for housing
investment is
                          IH = (1 + n )H 0 H + {(H; o ; r );
where n       0 represents the population growth rate. The depreciation of the housing
stock {(H; o ; r ) depends on utilization (i.e., owner- vs. tenant-occupied housing). The
larger the size of the rental market, the larger the investment in housing repairs. If
the depreciation rate is the same for owner-occupied and rental housing, o = r ; then
residential investment is linear in the stock, or {(H; o ; r ) = H: All the aspects of the
supply side of the market can be controlled by changing the technological parameter : For
example, shortages of materials can be capture by a decline in ; whereas innovations in
the process of producing homes (i.e., Levittown on the East Coast) would be an increase
in .

3.4       Production of Final Goods
A representative …rm produces a good in a competitive environment that can be used
for consumption, government, capital, or housing purposes. The production function has
the property of constant returns to scale, F (K; L) = K L1 ; where K and L denote the
amount of capital and labor, respectively, and the term represents the labor share. The
aggregate resource constraint is given by

                              C + CH + IK + IH + G +            = K L1     ;                         (8)

where C; IK ; IH ; G; and represent aggregate consumption, capital investment, housing
investment, government spending, and various transactions costs, respectively.13

3.5       Government Activities
In this economy, the government regulates markets by imposing particular lending arrange-
ments on the mortgage loan market. It also provides tax provisions toward housing. In

addition to these passive regulatory roles, the government plays a more active role through
other programs. First, retirement bene…ts are provided through a pay-as-you-go social
security program. Social security contributions are used to …nance a uniform transfer
upon retirement that represents a fraction of average income. Second, exogenous govern-
ment expenditure is …nanced by using a nonlinear income tax scheme. The …nancing of
government expenditure and social security is conducted under di¤erent budgets. Finally,
the government redistributes the wealth (housing and …nancial assets) of individuals who
die unexpectedly. Both housing and …nancial assets are sold and any outstanding debt
on housing is paid o¤. The remaining value of these assets is distributed to the surviving
households as a lump-sum payment, tr:

3.6     Stationary Equilibrium
In the model, a stationary equilibrium includes optimal decisions that are a function
of the individual state variables, x = (i; j; a; h; z; n; ); prices fr; w; Rg; market clearing
conditions, and a distribution over the state space (x) that are constant over time.14


4      Quantitative Analysis
4.1     Parameterization
The objective of the paper is to quantify the role of government policy in housing markets
during 1940-1960. During this period many other important changes occurred that could
account for the large increase in the homeownership rate. In order to measure the role
of government policy toward housing, other important factors must be incorporated into
the model. Otherwise, the model could mismeasure the role of government policy. The
methodology used in this paper incorporates the key factors that have been mentioned
in the literature but focuses on counterfactual experiments pertaining to government
housing policy. The change in ownership rates that occurs in these experiments allows us
to quantify the importance of government housing policies over this period.15
    The parameterization technique is based on moment estimation to replicate key prop-
erties of the U.S. economy between 1935 and 1940. This period is chosen to minimize
the potential structural e¤ects on the housing market due to the National Housing Act.
While this act was passed in 1934, the substantive e¤ects of this legislation did not begin
to impact housing markets until late in the 1930s. Some of the parameters are taken
directly from data or other empirical work.
Population Structure: A period in the model corresponds to …ve years. An individual
enters the labor force at age 20 (model period 1) and lives a maximum of 83 years (model
period 14). Mandatory retirement occurs at age 65 (model period 11). The survival
probabilities { j+1 } are from the National Center for Health Statistics, United States
Life Tables (1935, 1940). The initial size of a cohort, ij ; is endogenously determined by
the share of these individuals at age 25 or younger and the population growth rate.

   A formal de…nition of the recursive equilibrium is available from the authors.

paper (see Chambers, Garriga, and Schlagenhauf , 2011).

the literature and set to 1: The parameters ; which measures the relative importance
of consumption to housing services, and the discount rate are estimated. The …rst
parameter, ; is estimated to be consistent with a housing-to-consumption ratio of 0.180.
The individual discount rate is determined to match a capital-output ratio for 1935 which
was 2.54. The capital stock is de…ned as private …xed assets plus the stock of consumer
durables less the stock of residential structures (to be consistent with the capital stock in
the model). Output is gross domestic product (GDP) plus an estimate of the service ‡ow
from consumer durables less the service ‡ow from housing.
     Outputs is produced with a Cobb-Douglas production function. The capital share
parameter, , is set to 0.24 based on National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA)
data for 1935. Total factor productivity is normalized to unity. The depreciation rate of
the …rm’s capital capital stock, ; is estimated to be consistent with the observed ratio of
…xed capital investment to GDP (as previously de…ned) for 1935.
Income Endowments: A household’s income depends on its education level, i. Four
exogenous education levels are available: (1) fewer than 8 years of education, (2) 8 years
of education, (3) fewer than 12 years of education, and (4) 12 or more years of education.
For each education level, a household’s income has two components; one is deterministic
and the other is stochastic. The values for these components are constructed from Public
Use Microdata Samples (PUMS) for the 1940 and 1960 Censuses. The deterministic, or
life-cycle component, ij ; is generated using the average salary and wage income by age
and education. A polynomial is …t to age-speci…c averages per education to smooth this
component. The determination of the uncertain component hinges on the available data.
The reliance on Census data (which restricts data availability to once every ten years)
does not allow the estimation of a serially correlated income process.16 Our strategy is
to assume the stochastic component, ij ; is independent and identically distributed over
education and age: This component of income, along with the associated probabilities, is
estimated using a kernel density estimation for every age cohort, ij ( ij ); for the cross
section of individuals. Since the unit in the model is the household, the estimation con-
siders only households that work full-time. Therefore, the model captures the dispersion
of labor income for a given education. This approach has the attractive property that
it reproduces, by construction, the coe¢ cient of labor income dispersion observed in the
data for both periods.
Family Size: The size of the average household family is constructed using Census data
for the relevant years. Since the baby boom takes place during this period, the goal
  16
     Storesletten, Telmer, and Yaron (2004) …nd that income shocks have a persistent component even
when you condition on all the observables. Their …nding is based on a sample of household data over many
periods from the Panel Survey on Income Dynamics. Other recent works (e.g., Castaneda, Diaz-Giminez,
and Rios-Rull(2003) …nd that a smaller persistent component is needed once ex-ante heterogeneity is
considered. Their model is constructed to generate the observed income and wealth di¤erences.


                                                  19
is to allow for the e¤ects of changing household family size in the demand for owner-
occupied housing. In a more detailed theory, changes in institutional arrangements could
a¤ect fertility decisions. In the model, the demographic structure is taken as exogenously
determined and does not depend on education types.
Government and the Income Tax Function: In 1940, the U.S. Social Security pro-
gram was in its infancy. The payroll tax rate for a worker was 1 percent of wage income.
In addition, wage income for payroll tax purposes was capped at $3,000. The model uses
a 30 percent replacement rate.
    The income tax code in 1940 di¤erentiated income from total net taxable income,
which is equal to wage, rental, and interest income less interest payments such as mortgage
interest payments. In addition, each household receives an earned income credit. This
credit is equal to 10 percent of wage income as long as net income is less than $3,000.
If net income exceeds $3,000, the credit is calculated as 10 percent of the minimum of
wage income or total taxable income. The tax credit is capped at $1,400. In addition
to the earned income credit, each household received a personal exemption of $800. If
these two credits are subtracted from total net taxable income, adjusted taxable income is
determined. The actual tax schedules for 1940 and 1960 are programmed to determine a
household’s tax obligation. The tax functions for 1940 and 1960 are summarized in Figure
3. For the 1940 tax code, the marginal tax rate is 0.79 which is applicable to income levels
exceeding $500,000. In 1940, an income tax surcharge is equal to an additional 10 percent
must be included in the income tax obligation. The documentation for the 1940 tax code
is the Internal Revenue Service and the Tax Foundation. To ensure that the income tax
function generates the proper amount of revenue for 1940, an adjustment factor must be
added to the tax code. This parameter can be considered as adding an intercept to the
tax function. If too much revenue is generated, this parameter, 0 ; can be reduced. This
factor is estimated by targeting the personal income tax revenue-to-GDP ratio. In 1935,
this ratio was 0.01.
Housing: In the baseline model, homeowners have two mortgages choices: a short-
duration balloon loan restricted to 10 years with a 50 percent down payment and a
20-year FRM with a 20 percent down payment. Formally, (1) = 0:5 and (2) = 0:2:
The transaction costs from buying and selling property are s = 0 and b = 0:06: The
minimum house size, h; is estimated to be consistent with the set of speci…ed targets.
The values o and r are from Chambers, Garriga, and Schlagenhauf (2009), where the
annual depreciation rates for owner and tenant-occupied housing are o = 0:0106 and
  r = 0:0135; respectively.
Wealth Endowments: Bequests appear to have been an important source of homeown-
ership for young households in 1940. Table 4 presents IRS data on real estate bequests in

    Although the number of returns tripled between 1940 and 1960, the total gross value
of real estate bequests grew by less that 10 percent. However, the amount of outstanding
debt on bequeathed real estate more than tripled in the same 20-year period. As a result,
the net value of real estate bequests actually dropped by 23 percent between 1940 and
1960. The apparent importance of real estate bequests in 1940 requires the introduction
of an additional parameter W0 to the model. This parameter represents the percentage
of age 1 households that receive a bequest of a minimum size home. The percentage
is adjusted so that the model generates a homeownership rate for young households is
similar to that found in the data. The value of transfers from accidental death is adjusted
to equal the amount of housing bequests to individuals.
    The estimation of the set structural parameters ( ; ; ; h; 0 ; W0 ) for 1940 is based
on an exactly identi…ed method of moments approach plus the computation of market
clearing (capital market and rental market) under the restriction that the government
budget constraint is balanced. Table 5 reports the parameter values that generate ag-
gregate statistics consistent with the U.S. economy. Parameters are estimated within 1
percent error for all the observed targets.

4.2    Baseline Economy: 1940
The model can be evaluated from various perspectives. The objective is to measure the
performance by considering the homeownership rate statistics for the various years and
age groups. As Table 6 shows, the homeownership rate in 1930 was 48.1 percent, whereas
after the Great Depression it ranged between 42.7 and 45.5 percent. Since the baseline
model attempts to focus on the home ownership rate prior to the impact of the National
Housing Act, the targeted homeownership rate is 45.5 percent.

   Since the aggregate homeownership rate is an estimation target, it not surprising that
the baseline model generates a number close to the selected moment. The age-speci…c
homeownership rates also can be used to evaluate the model. The model captures the
hump-shaped behavior observed in the data. The lowest homeownership rate is for the
youngest age cohort; this pattern is apparent in 1930 and 1940 with the di¤erence that

                                           22
homeownership rates are higher in 1930. The model does generate a pattern by age cohort
consistent with the Census estimates. The model also makes predictions about mortgage
holdings. Table 7 summarizes some aggregate statistics about housing …nance.

                                  Table 7: Housing Finance

It is di¢ cult to …nd micro data for speci…c mortgage contracts, but given the short
duration and the predominance of balloon, this contract would be the expected to be the
dominant in the model. In the model the majority of homeowners (83.5 percent) do not
have a mortgage. In the model all the homeowners purchase the housing using the balloon
loan. The share of FRMs predicted by the model for 1940 is zero.

4.3     Baseline Economy: 1960
Many factors could have been important in the determination of the ownership boom. The
objective of this section is to isolate the contribution of government programs from other
relevant factors that could in‡uence the increase in ownership. Government programs
potentially a¤ect homeownership through policies that have an impact on …nancing of
housing, changes in the federal income tax structure, the role of the mortgage interest
rate deduction, and the reduction of transaction costs in mortgage rates. To measure the
contribution of these government policies, the model must account for other factors that
have been argued as critical.18 The relevant factors that changed between 1940 and 1960
are summarized as follows:

   1. Demographic factors: Included are changes in the survival probabilities, educa-
      tion composition, and family structure.
  18
     The federal income tax code changed signi…cantly by 1960. Using data from the Tax Foundation and
the the U.S. Treasury Department Internal Revenue Service publication No. 17, it is possible to construct
a representative tax function. This tax function had to account for the fact that renters were not likely
to itemize their deductions. A model assumption is that in 1960 all renters did not itemize deductions.
As a result, these individuals used tax tables di¤erent from the households that did itemize. In fact,
non-itemizing households with income levels under $5,000 were able to use a tax table that di¤ered from
non-itemizers with income over $5,000. Individuals were allowed an individual deduction worth $600 that
could be used to minimize the tax obligation. If a household itemized expenses because of the mortgage
interest rate deduction, another tax table was to be used to calculate the income tax obligation where
taxable income excluded the mortgage deduction and the individual exemption. The tax adjustment
coe¢ cient, 0 ; is set to be consistent with a federal income tax-to-GDP ratio of 7.73 percent. Income
tax obligations were much higher in 1960 and marginal tax rates were higher (See Figure 3). The top
marginal tax rate in 1960 was 91 percent for income over $2 million. The payroll tax increased to 1.5
percent of wage income up to a cap of $4,800.



                                                   23
   2. Endowments: Included are the change in the distribution of the i.i.d. idiosyncratic
      income component, the e¢ ciency units, and the size of the real wage income increase.
   3. House prices: According to Case-Shiller price data, real house prices increased by
      41.5 percent. Since house prices in the model are determined by the productivity
      parameter in the construction sector, this parameter can be adjusted to generate
      the increased cost of housing per unit.
   4. Housing …nance: Changes include the extension of the FRM maturity from 20
      to 30 years and a decline in the spread between the mortgage interest rate and the
      risk-free rate from 2.53 to 1.63 percent annualized.
   5. Taxation: Included are changes in the tax code.
   Table 8 summarizes the implications of allowing all factors to change in the model.19
The model accounts for a signi…cant amount of the total change in ownership (level) as
well as the compositional di¤erences across age groups. It is important to note that these
are endogenous variables, not a result of estimating the parameters for 1960

       65-72 years    60.3 69.8      9.5                         69.4 73.3     3.9

    For example, the actual aggregate housing participation rate in 1960 was 62.5 percent
and the model predicts a similar magnitude. The model-generated age-cohort ownership
rates have a more pronounced hump compared with actual 1960 data, but this is likely
due to the fact that homeowners do not face mobility or health shocks that could require
them to sell their house and rent. Despite the small di¤erences in levels, the change
between both periods in the model and data is quite similar, suggesting that this model
of tenure and mortgage choice provides a useful laboratory to assess the importance of
government interventions in housing …nance and housing policy.

4.4     Policy Intervention in Housing Finance
In this section, the model is used to measure the contribution of federal housing policies
to the increased homeownership rate.20 The focus is on the importance of amortizing
  19
     In 1960, households have mortgage choice between a 30-year FRM mortgage and a balloon contract.
In equilibrium, households do not hold the balloon- type contract. In other words, the FRM contract is
a dominant contract.
  20
     It is interesting to note that Gebler, Blank, and Winnick (1956, p. 238) stated that the "precise
e¤ects of the Federal Housing Administration and Veterans Administration programs on the volume of


                                                 24
contracts, mortgage duration, and mortgage interest rate costs. Chambers, Garriga,
Schlagenhauf (2009a,b) found that mortgage market innovation was the key factor in
explaining the increase in the homeownership rate between 1996 and 2005. More pre-
cisely, the introduction of highly leveraged loans with graduated mortgage payments was
found important as this type of contract attracted …rst-time buyers to the housing market,
while more established households still had the availability of the standard 30-year FRM
contract. Signi…cant mortgage contract innovation also occurred in the mortgage market
between 1930 and 1960. As discussed previously, stimulating the ‡ow of mortgage funds
to residential construction was a goal of federal housing policies since the early 1930s.
Grebler, Blank, and Winnick, (1956, p238) state:

      Stimulating the ‡ow of mortgage funds to residential construction has been
      the principal aim of federal housing policies since the early and middle thir-
      ties. ..[T]hese policies in fact have operated almost exclusively through the
      use of various devices in‡uencing the ‡ow of private institutional mortgages
      funds, that is, mortgage insurance or guarantee and improved marketability of
      loans through the Federal National Mortgage Association. ... Another major
      objective of federal housing policies has been to reduce the periodic payments
      of mortgage borrowers, by lowering interest rates and lengthening contract
      terms. Policy makers looked to easier borrowing as a way to increase demand
      for new residential construction.

    As noted in the previous section, the starting point is the benchmark model where the
1940 estimated parameters are used with all factors at their 1960 values. Households have
access to a 30-year FRM mortgage with a 20 percent down payment requirement as well
as a 10-year balloon contract with a 50 percent down payment. As documented earlier,
the homeownership rate would be at 63.5 percent. Since the baseline model captures the
magnitude of the increase in ownership, one way to measure the contribution of the 30-
year FRM is to replace this contract with a 20-year FRM contract. This latter contract
corresponds to the initial o¤ering of FRMs in the 1940s.
    As Table 9 shows, the model predicts that the aggregate homeownership rate should
fall from 63.5 percent to 61.6 percent. The model suggests that the extension of the FRM
contract from 20 to 30 years can explain around 12 percent of the increase in ownership.
The e¤ect is more dramatic by age cohorts, particular in young and middle-aged buyers.
For these groups, the access of a more leveraged contract reduces the magnitude of the
mortgage payments and makes housing more attractive. In both economies, the fraction
of individuals who use the balloon loan with 50 percent down payment is zero.
residential mortgage lending are as indeterminable as their impact on residential building activity."

    All households in 1960 use the FRM but the change in duration, combined with the
general equilibrium e¤ects, makes this contract more attractive to a larger percentage of
the population. The higher aggregate LTV ratio implies that the percentage of homeown-
ers with no mortgage is substantially reduced from the 1940s’…gure. In the economy with
a 20-year FRM, only 6.3 percent of homeowners do not have a mortgage and when the
maturity is extended the number does not change. The lesson learned is that mortgage
innovation did make a signi…cant contribution to the increase in homeownership between
1940 and 1960.
    The 10-year increase in loan maturity had a positive e¤ect on the aggregate home-
ownership rate. One could ask whether additional extensions in the maturity would have
resulted in even larger increases e¤ects in homeownership. The model can be used to
examine implications of increasing the maturity beyond 30 years. Table 10 summarizes
the …nds of extending maturity of FRM to 35 and 40 years.

           Total           45.7      63.5       63.0         62.5

   The model suggests that extending the loan maturity beyond 30 years has only a very
marginal (negative) e¤ect in the aggregate ownership rate. The aggregate e¤ects mask
some interesting distributional implications. As the maturity increases, the mortgage
payments for an equivalent home are reduced and housing becomes more attractive for
the young working cohorts. The decline in the older cohorts is mainly due to the terminal
condition that forces individuals to sell the home before death. Given the extended loan
maturity, the fraction of retired homeowners carrying a mortgage increases and properties
are now sold earlier.

                                           26
    Overall, the introduction of the 30-year FRM can account for roughly 12 percent
of the total change in ownership. The model suggests that the length of the mortgage
contract sponsored by FHA had a signi…cant e¤ect on ownership; however, increasing
the maturity beyond 30 years seems to have a small negative e¤ect in ownership. Since
FRM contracts already existed in the 1940s and 1950s, an obvious question is why the
FRM contracts were not more popular in the 1940s when this type contract …rst became
available? As documented in Chambers, Garriga, and Schlagenhauf (2013), given that
average household income was lower in 1940 than 1960 by a signi…cant factor, the 1940
household might not have been …nancially able to take advantage of the leverage features
available in a FRM contract.
    In addition to federal policies that impacted homeownership through mortgage con-
tract structure, Grebler, Blank, and Winnick (1956) argue that a policy of lower mortgage
interest rates and increased mortgage market e¢ ciencies were important in the increase in
homeownership. Data for 1940 and 1960 suggest the spread between the mortgage interest
rate and risk-free rate declined 85 basis points. The model can be used to quantify the
importance of the decline in the spread that resulted from an improved mortgage market.
The test maintains the baseline model for 1960 but assumes the 1940 spread. If the in-
terest spread is increased to the 1940 value, while maintaining the other factors at their
1960 values, the model-predicted ownership rate would be 62.1 percent as summarized in
Table 11. The decrease in the spread accounts for a 8.5 percent change in homeownership.

4.5     Housing Policy: The Tax Treatment of Housing
This section explores the direct role of housing policy, taking as given the innovations in
housing …nance. The purpose is to use the model to understand how housing tenure and
investment decisions can be a¤ected by housing policy embedded in the tax code. Part of
the analysis is based on Chambers, Garriga, and Schlagenhauf (2009c). The key di¤erence
is that the model abstracts from mortgage choice, and while the current framework allows
mortgage choice which turn out to be an important consideration.
    Understanding how this type of housing policy a¤ects a household’s tenure and dura-
tion decisions requires examination of the household’s budget constraint. Some additional
notation is required. Let o and r represent the taxable fraction of housing services con-
sumed by owner- and tenant-occupied housing, respectively. The terms o and r represent
the fraction of maintenance expenses from owner- and tenant-occupied housing that are
deductible. Given these de…nitions, taxable income can be de…ned in the model as
                                 0                        0
             y = ! + ra +   r R(h    d) +   o Rd   r r p(h    d)   o 0 pd    ;         (9)

where    represents other type of deductions. The mortgage interest rate deduction would

                                            27
enter through this variable as it obviously reduces taxable income.21 For homeowners who
do not pay the …xed entry cost ($ > 0); the de…nition of taxable income is reduced to
                               y = ! + ra +     o Rd     o 0 pd     ;                           (10)
as h0 = d:
   The …rst-order condition of a household that supplies rental housing services to the
market can be expressed as
                  ud
                     =R p        + T 0 (y)[p( r r o o)  R( r     o )];             (11)
                  uc
where uc measures the marginal utility with respect to consumption c; and ud represents
the marginal utility with respect to housing services consumption, d: The …rst term on
the right-hand side is the rental price of a unit of housing, R, and measures the bene…t to
a household of forgoing a unit of housing services. This bene…t is reduced the greater the
spread in the depreciation rate for renter- and owner-occupied housing,        =( r      o ).
Ignoring tax considerations, the e¤ective cost of owner-occupied housing services is Re =
R p( r        o ): The implicit moral hazard problem makes renting more expensive than
owning as in Henderson and Ioannides (1983). The last two terms on the right-hand side
of the equation re‡ect the asymmetric treatment of owner- and tenant-occupied housing.
The bene…t from supplying services to the rental market is reduced when the spread in
the fraction of rental income relative to owner-occupied imputed income is larger. In
addition, the bene…t increases when the spread between maintenance expenses on renter-
and owner-occupied housing increases. Removing the asymmetries, r = o o = r and
                                                                   0
  r = o ; and eliminating the progressivity of income taxation, T (y), reduces the bene…ts
from housing policy. As a result, the …rst-order condition without distortions is:
                                       ud
                                           =R p :                                      (12)
                                       uc
    The U.S. tax code has explicit provisions toward housing that imply o = o = 0
and r = r = 1: That is, the income from the consumption of tenant-occupied housing
services is taxable, whereas owner-consumed housing services are not taxable. Mainte-
nance expenses are treated asymmetrically in the tax code. Owner-occupied maintenance
expenses cannot be deducted whereas maintenance expenses incurred with respect to
tenant-occupied housing are deductible. Under the U.S. code, the …rst-order condition
becomes
                          ud
                             = R[1 T 0 (y)] + p[T 0 (e
                                                     y ) r 4 ]:                          (13)
                          uc
In addition to the asymmetric distortions just discussed and housing deductions, ; that
a¤ect adjusted gross income, y; the degree of progressivity of the marginal tax rates, T 0 (y);
a¤ects housing decisions. For example, under a more progressive tax code, the taxation
e¤ects are large, which changes the incentives to own and supply rental property. At the
aggregate level some of these incentives can disappear due to general equilibrium e¤ects.
Since the model has mortgage choice, changes in the tax code can change the incentives
on when to buy and the size of the house.
  21
    These terms are relevant only for homeowners since renters are not a¤ected because they cannot be
property owners in the model.


                                                 28
4.5.1    The Home Mortgage Interest Deduction
One of the hallmarks of U.S. housing policy is the deductibility of mortgage interest pay-
ments for households that itemize. This deduction creates an incentive to both own and
consume more homes, generating an asymmetry between housing and …nancial invest-
ment. The view among many economists is that the removal of the interest deduction
would reduce owner-occupied housing consumption and thus result in smaller home sizes.
Homeownership would be lower because the incentives to own have been reduced. Under
revenue neutrality, the elimination of the deduction for mortgage interest costs results in
additional revenue, thus leading to a tax reduction, which can result in making homeown-
ership more a¤ordable.22
    The baseline model assumes complete deductibility of mortgage interest payments.
Formally, the deduction on taxable income can be expressed as = {In = {rm D(h0 ; n; p);
where the term { captures the percentage of mortgage interest costs that is deductible. If
{ = 1;then mortgage interest expenses are fully deductible. It is also important to point
out that the bene…ts from the mortgage interest deduction are enhanced when the tax
rates are more progressive.
    The importance of the mortgage interest rate deduction can be determined if the
model is resolved under the assumption that this deduction is eliminated, { = 0;. Table
12 summarizes the quantitative implications of this change in policy.


                 Table 12: The Importance the Mortgage Deduction

                        Experimental Factors                   Ownership(%)
         1. Baseline: 1960 factors,1940 parameters, { = 1          63.5
         2. Removal of the mortgage deduction, { = 0               67.6
         3. Prices …xed, revenue neutrality not imposed, { = 0     50.2

    By comparing the baseline version of the model, (i.e, the model with estimated 1940
parameters with the various factors that existed in 1960), in which a mortgage interest
rate deduction is allowed with the same model except the mortgage interest deduction is
removed, the homeownership rate would increase from 63.5 percent to 67.6 percent, or
a 22 percent increase.23 The importance of general equilibrium e¤ects can be tested by
solving the model with …xed prices. In this case, ownership declines to 50.2 percent a value
more in-line with Rosen and Rosen (1980) who estimate a negative e¤ect in ownership.
Their framework ignores the importance of income e¤ects and the analysis indicates the
importance of using a general equilibrium approach over a partial equilibrium approach
when relative prices change signi…cantly.
  22
     This point is important to keep in mind in policy analysis as the lowering of tax revenue to maintain
revenue neutrality can reverse the intuition implied from a partial equilibrium analysis.
  23
     In this model all homeowners can choose to either use the standard deduction or itemize, picking the
choice that generates the lower tax liability.




                                                   29
4.5.2    Taxation of Owner-Occupied Housing Service Flows
Many economists argue that the primary distortion in the current tax code is the treatment
of housing services. Previous studies for the postwar period suggest that the elimination
of this asymmetry should lead to the consumption of smaller homes and lower home-
ownership. For example, Berkovic and Fullerton (1992) …nd that the taxation of housing
services should reduce average housing consumption between 3 and 6 percent, whereas
Gervais (2002) …nds that taxing imputed rents of owner-occupied housing would increase
the capital stock by more than 6 percent but decrease the housing stock by 8 percent.
    Under the current tax code, income generated from rental property is subject to tax-
ation, but the implicit income from owner-occupied housing is not taxed. As shown in
Equation (13), this policy introduces an asymmetry in the tax treatment of owners and
landlords that favors the consumption of owner-occupied housing services and reduces the
incentive to supply rental property. The landlord supply decision when housing services
are taxed at di¤erent rates is determined by
                      ud
                         = [R    p   ] + T 0 (e
                                              y )p   r   T 0 (e
                                                              y )R(   r   o ):         (14)
                      uc
The U.S. tax code for the period 1940-60 would set o = 0 and r = 1: In Equation (14),
the term T 0 (e
              y )R( r o ) measures the impact of the failure to tax housing services. As can
be seen, this term reduces the e¤ective cost of owner-occupied housing and thus introduces
a bias toward owner-occupied housing consumption. This asymmetry is eliminated when
the fraction of imputed rental income from owner- and tenant-occupied housing is taxed
at the same rate, r = o ; but not necessarily zero. The analysis considers the case where
the imputed rental income (measured as Rd) is fully taxed, o = r = 1: Table 13 presents
these results.


            Table 13: The Importance of Taxation Housing Services

                       Experimental Factors                    Ownership(%)
    1. Baseline: 1960 factors,1940 parameters, o = 0 and r = 1     63.5
    2. Taxation of services, o = r = 1                             60.4
    3. Prices …xed, revenue neutrality not imposed, o = r = 1      55.9

    The model suggests that the lack of taxation of housing services has an important im-
pact in accounting for the increase in homeownership. The model suggests that if housing
services were taxed, the homeownership rate would be 21 percent lower. Again, a partial
equilibrium analysis would overstate the importance of the policy of not taxing owner-
occupied housing services. With …xed prices, the taxation of housing services reduces the
homeownership rate to 55.9.


5       Conclusions
After the collapse of housing markets during the Great Depression, the government, as
part of the New Deal, played a large role in shaping the future of housing …nance. By

                                              30
1960, the housing market had more than recovered as the homeownership rate soared to
over 60 percent. This paper quanti…es the role of government intervention in housing
markets in explaining the expansion in U.S. homeownership between 1940 and 1960; this
role is quanti…ed with an equilibrium model of tenure choice. In the model, home buyers
have access to a menu of mortgage choices to …nance the acquisition of the house. The
government also provides special programs, consistent with the provisions in the tax code.
The parameterized model is consistent with key aggregate and distributional features in
the U.S. in 1940. The model can account for the boom in homeownership when adjusted
to a 1960 economy.
    Government intervention via the mortgage market was a key part of the housing boom.
The model suggests that moving from a 20-year to a 30-year FRM accounts for roughly
12 percent of the increase in homeownership. When combined with a narrowing mortgage
interest rate wedge, the total impact of mortgage innovation is approximately 21 percent.
Government intervention via tax policy was also a signi…cant factor in the housing boom.
The model suggests that housing policy can have important e¤ects on ownership. For
example, the elimination of the mortgage deduction only reduces ownership when prices
are …xed and the tax surplus is not rebated back to the household sector. The taxation
of housing services always reduces the ownership.
    These estimates have ignored the implications of the GI Bill for U.S. housing markets.
This legislation could a¤ect housing markets in two ways. First, the GI Bill made hous-
ing markets more accessible to veterans through down payment and mortgage payment
subsidies. Fetters (2010) presents some empirical …ndings on this question. Second, this
bill provided bene…ts for human capital investment. The increase in number of college
graduates increased substantially under this program. This means an individual with this
level of human capital will operate on a higher income path in expected terms than an
individual with less education, which has implications for housing investment. The quan-
titative implications of these policies are analyzed in more detail in Chambers, Garriga,
and Schlagenhauf (2013).

6.1     1900-30s: The Emergence of Mortgage Finance
The in‡uence of mortgage lending institutions on housing markets began at the start of
the twentieth century. Developments, particularly the role of the Federal government,
during the …rst half of this Century only enhanced the role of these lending institutions.
During this period there was an important process of creation of agencies, structures,
programs, and regulations designed to make investment in the housing market secure and
pro…table for households, and especially …nancial intermediaries and lenders.
    The growth in mortgage …nancing for residential real estate was a result of banks
incentives to look for new pro…t opportunities. Before the 1930’s the large down payment
requirements and the lack of long-term …nancing (mortgage contracts were only three to
…ve years) made housing ownership di¢ cult even for middle-class families.

6.2     1930s: Government Intervention after the Great Depression
The Great Depression had an important impact on the housing sector, particularly on
the mortgage market. The depression had a double e¤ect on homeowners who lost their
sources of income and landlords who could not charge higher rents. Consequently, prop-
erty owners could not maintain their mortgage payments without drawing on their sav-
ings. However, the banks had liquidity problems and homeowners could not withdraw
their funds. Unable to meet their payments, owners’properties foreclosed were by banks,
which were then stuck unsellable homes they could not sell. In addition, the few funds
available were withdrawn to satisfy depositors eliminating the possibility of issuing new
mortgage loans.
    The objective of government intervention in the 1930s was to develop institutions that
could provide funding to lenders in the housing market. Three main institutions resulting
from this intervention were the

    1. Federal Home Loan Bank Act and Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation,

    2. Federal Housing Administration (FHA), and

    3. Secondary mortgage markets.

6.2.1    Federal Home Loan Bank Act
This institution was the creation of a uni…ed national mortgage market by centralizing,
stabilizing, and insuring mortgage banking operations. The Federal Home Loan Bank
Act was passed in 1932. The objective was to make the mortgage market more e¢ cient,
predictable, and pro…table. An important aspect was to separate mortgage lenders from
the liability to their depositors, with the objective of avoiding the problems faced during
the Great Depression. The system was organized into 12 regional Home Loan Banks. In
addition, this act developed the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC).
Membership in this corporation was open to …nancial institutions and commercial banks
that engaged in long-term …nancing. Each regional Home Loan Bank was to behave as

                                            34
reserve banks for the members by accepting deposits and making loans. This had the e¤ect
of allowing mortgage companies to engage in pro…table investments by cheap borrowing.
    To attract funds, the FSLIC allowed member banks to withdraw their investment at
anytime regardless of the bank performance, (i.e., similar to deposit insurance device that
provides liquidity in the market). Consequently, member banks where able to attract
more funds for investment and reduce their obligations with depositors. In 1933, the
Home Owners Loan Corporation was established to help lending institutions with liquidity
problems by purchasing the mortgages that were about to be foreclosed.
    Over roughly 20 years, the total capital in S&Ls increased by a factor of 6. This
growth was used to provide the needed funds for the housing market and can partially
explain the boom in the real estate market during this period.

6.2.2   Federal Housing Administration (FHA)
The second institution was the FHA, established by the National Housing Act of 1934.
The objectives of the FHA was to (1) insure mortgage lenders against default risk on
approved mortgage loans and (2) increase the pro…tability of mortgage lenders. The
important aspect of this institution is that the funds provided for mortgage insurance
were not provided by taxes or mortgage lenders, but rather the borrower. With this
protection, lenders had incentives to expand the mortgage terms, making it possible for
many households to purchase a home.

6.2.3   Secondary Mortgage Markets
One of the main problems with mortgage lending, before the National Housing Act, was
that the investment in housing was not very liquid. Given new investment opportunities,
mortgage lenders found it di¢ cult to liquidate these holdings (say, due to higher interest
rates), and undertake new investment opportunities. The National Housing Act also
established a standardized secondary mortgage market. In 1938 the Federal National
Mortgage Association (FNMA) was founded.
    Before 1930, a secondary mortgage market existed in which lenders could sell their
assets to other investors. The main problem was in the great variation of mortgage char-
acteristics and risk, which rendered the market ine¤ective. The objective of FNMA was
to provide uniformity and security. The initial endowment was used to buy insured mort-
gages from approved lending institutions. As a result, FNMA gave lenders the liquidity
to make pro…ts even after the mortgage had been sold by servicing the loan and receiving
a fee of 0.25% to 1% for doing so. A large pool of insured mortgages was created, and
investment in this pool became quite pro…table.
    After the boom in real estate, FNMA became so pro…table that there was a great
pressure to privatize this institution. In 1968 the Housing Act completed the process and
FNMA, became known as the private …rm known as Freddie Mac, (the Federal Home
Loan Mortgage Corporation).

6.3    1940s: Recovering from the Great Depression
In 1944 the FHA mortgage-insurance system, together with the VA had the priority to
help returning veterans purchase housing. The program reduced the down payment to 10
percent (or in some cases no down payment), as well as providing long-term …nancing for
25 years. This program and the guarantee program provided by the VA allowed veteran
families to become homeowners.
   In 1946 the Farmers Home Administration organized as part of the Department of
Agriculture, was authorized to make direct loans to families to purchase and rehabilitate
farm homes. The formation of this institution created 1,750 county o¢ ces that were
important for rural housing.

6.4    1950s: Housing Boom
During this period housing programs were reduced by the budget cuts imposed by the
Korean War. Despite these …nancing issues, the market continued to boom. The govern-
ment objective during this period was to improve existing programs instead of creating
new ones. Some small programs were authorized to make below market interest rate loans
to nonpro…t sponsors of rental units used by elderly and handicapped persons. The pur-
pose of these programs was to reduce the rental fee paid by these tenants. This was the
…rst time that the government developed programs group of households that likely had
insu¢ cient resources to purchase a private home, but had too many resources to qualify
for public housing.
