                    Sterilization and Monetary Control Under
                   Pegged Exchange Rates: Theory and Evidence



                                    ABSTRACT



       In veiw of recent strong evidence that substantial sterilizatipn of the

monetary effects of reserve flows.occurs, a modified monetary approach model

is formulated in which central banks exercise no control over their domestic

money supply despite their sterilization activities. This model is compared

with a more general model in which the balance of payments and domestic money

supply are both influenced by the central bank's domestic policy goals. In

order for the central bank to exercise monetary control, three conditions

must be met: assets are not perfect substitutes, goods are not perfect sub-

stitutes, and expected depreciation is not "too -responsive" to the balance

of   payments. The third condition may be met for small but not large reserve
flows. Reduced form tests are derived which show for Canada, France, Germany,
Italy, Japan, th Netherlands, and the United   Kingdom that domestic policy goals

strongly influenced quarterly changes in the domestic money supply; this strongly

contradicts   both the modified and standard monetary approach to the balance of
payments.   Thus there is a relevant "short—run" in which monetary authorities

exercise monetary control. The paper concludes that the simpler monetary approach

is no longer empirically tenable for analysis of quarterly data and that more

general simultaneous models must be specified and tested.

     Standard discussions of the monetary approach to the balance of pay-

ments under pegged exchange rates have proceeded on the assumption that

no sterilization operations are attempted by the central banks of the

          countries.' Recent findings of the NEER project on the

International Transmission of Inflation Through the World Monetary System

provide strong evidence that the direct effects on national money supplies

of current balances of payments are very largely sterilized by offsetting

transactions in domestic credit instruments.2 This paper outlines in

Section I a general model incorporating sterilization which encompasses

as a special case a modified version of the monetary approach in which

both reserve flows and domestic credit flows are endogenous variables.

Generally, nonreserve central banks can exercise control over their domestic

money supply in the short—run unless certain conditions, which imply valid-

ity of the monetary approach, are met. In this monetary—approach special

case, central bank attempts to exercise monetary control are futile and in-

stead simply induce exaggerated reserve flows.

     Section II presents a simple direct test of whether determinants of

monetary policy other than the current balance of payments influenced the

nominal money supply given foreign variables determining money demand. For

quarterly data all seven countries in our sample (Canada, France, Germany,

Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom) showed clear evidence

that monetary control was, in fact, exercised under the Bretton Woods system

of pegged exchange rates. This evidence is strongly inconsistent with the

validity of the monetary approach to the balance of payments either in its

standard or modified form for analysis of quarterly data. Thus there is a

relevant "short run" within which central banks can and have exercised

monetary control under pegged exchange rates.
                                                                           3




                                  I. Analysis


     The analysis proceeds in four steps: First, sterilization is for-

mally defined in terms   of   the m'oney—supply reaction function of the

central bank. Next, a modified monetary approach is presented which is

consistent with partial sterilization. Then a more general model is

developed in which the central bank maycontrol its domestic money supply;

if this control is not present, the model reduces to the modified monetary

approach. Finally, the        conditions for monetary control are interpreted

in terms of responsiveness of capital flows, trade flows, and the expected

depreciation of the exchange rate.


A. Sterilization and the Money—Supply Reaction Function

    The central bank of a nonreserve country will resist an incipient

appreciation (for example) of its exchange rate by buying some foreign

reserves with its domestic base money.3 This new base money increases

the domestic money supply. Standard central—bank procedure involves off-

setting sales of domestic assets (for example, government bonds) for base

money. These offsetting transactions are said to sterilize the effect

of the balance of payments on the money supply.

    In the standard monetary approach, the construct of domestic credit

(base money less reserves) or its change has been assumed exogenous. This

assumption is unwarranted if monetary authorities sterilize the balance

of payments in whole or part so that a balance of payments surplus induces

a decrease in domestic credit. But, of course, the immediate steriliza-

tion might be reversed so rapidly that for all practical purposes no

sterilization occurred over a period of observation such as a quarter.
                                                                                   4




Then the exogenous—domestic—credit assumption would be acceptable for

analysis of quarterly data.

       A money—supply reaction function provides a formal         statement   of the

behavior of the monetary authorities working through the banking system.

The existence and extent of sterilization is measured by the coefficient

of the contemporaneous scaled balance of payments in the reaction function.

A    genera]. form of this reaction function is

             MogM=aft+X+u                                                         (1)



where M is the nominal money supply, B the balance of payments surplus,

H nominal base or high—powered money, and X a vector containing all other

variables which systematically affect the monetary authority's behavior.

Note in particular that lagged balances       of payments   may   appear   in X since

the    issue of ultimate concern is monetary control within the period of
observation.      If a is   1, then there is no sterilization since the balance
of    payments leads to a proportionate increase in the money supply. If a

is zero, then complete sterilization is practiced. Values of a between

o    and 1 indicate partial sterilization.4


B.      A Modified Monetary Approach

        While   the   received monetary approach has been based on the assumption

that nonreserve countries do not sterilize in whole or part, this assump-

tion is in no sense essential to the theoretical approach.5 The really

essential idea is that the       domestic money supply is demand determined

given    the exchange—rate—converted foreign price level and foreign interest

rate. Any attempt of monetary authorities to vary the quantity of money
                                                                         .5



from this demand determined growth Mog H will induce massive capital

flows, trade flows, or both until the money supply is equated to Mog H.

       To   illustrate, suppose that the demand—determined change in money
is given by:

              M0gHZd+e                                                       (2)

If the balance of payments is indeed infinitely elastic with respect to
incipient     deviations from Alog H, then



             fi8    (AlogM—Z6—c)                                             (3)



where e is negative infinity. That is any attempt by the central bank to

increase (decrease) money relative to Mog H results in an unbounded

balance of payments deficit (surplus). So equation (3) implies, given
0 =   —, that

             tlog M= Z5 +€                                                   (4)

Equation (4) and the money—supply reaction function (1) form a recursive

system in which the change in money is determined by demand.and this, plus

the "domestic policy" portion (X$ + u) of monetary policy determine the

balance of payments:



             ft=(Z5+c—X8—u)                                                  (5)


The balance of payments is the inverse of the sterilization parameter times

the   difference between the demand—determined money growth and the domestic—
policy money growth.
                                                                                6




      The modified monetary approach is illustrated graphically in Figure

1. The vertical line indicates the infinite elasticity of the balance

of   payments with respect to incipient deviations of money—supply growth
from its demand—determined level. The positively sloped line is the
money—supply reaction function.6 Their intersection determines the
equilibrium balance of payments (.)ec Note that an increase in unem-
ployment which shifted the reaction function to the right (more money

growth for a given balance of payments) results in a substantial decrease
in the balance of payments which just balances the desire for more money
growth.
       In conclusion, the existence of partial sterilization does not imply
any monetary control by a nonreserve central bank under pegged exchange
rates. It may just result in accentuated balance—of—payments movements.

C.     A More General Model
       If neither   goods nor assets are perfect substitutes, it no   longer
follows that the balance of payments will be infinitely elastic with
respect to the money supply growth rate. Other factors (such as those
appearing in   trade   supply and demand equations) represented by the vector
S will also play a role in determining the balance of payments so that
equation (3)   is expanded to



            4=0     (ó.log N — Z6 —      SX                                    (3')



where 0 > 0 >   —. solving      for b.log M yields


                                                                               (6)
            AlogMftft_ftSX+Z+E
                                                                                              7




When   equation   (6) is   combined with the reaction function (1), we obtain a

truly   simultaneous system determining Alog 14 and ft together. The (re-
duced—form) solutions for the equilibrium values are

            M.og M     1     aS
                                    +    1    ce    '+           i.
                                                                      Z6 +
                                                                             1   aS u +           C   (7)


            ft       ae
                           X$ + 1    aS

                                                    aS     1
                                                               25 +   1   aS u +          C           (8)

It can be readily verified that as the balance of payments elasticity goes
to negative infinity the solutions (7) and (8) go to the modified monetary
approach solutions (4) and (5). Thus, the modified monetary approach is,
indeed, a special case (for S = —a') of this more general model.
       The more general model is illustrated by Figure 2. The vertical
line of Figure 1 is replaced with a negatively slope line relating the
balance of payments to money growth, the trade factors SA, and the demand
variables 26 + C.      The   intersection of this line with the reaction function
determines   both the balance       of   payments and money supply growth. In this

case, a desire to increase money growth                  (due to increased unemployment,
say)    in fact does increase money growth as well as decreasing the balance

of payments. The relative size of the two effects of course depends on

the slopes of the two equations.

       Note that our model deletes the concept of domestic credit entirely.

One can derive the equilibrium value of the scaled change in domestic credit

from equations (7) and (8) ——        or      (4) and (5) in the modified—monetary—

approach special case —— and the usual identity taking the growth rate of

the money multiplier as given, but it is an accounting construct which as an

endogenous variable adds nothing to the exposition. As will be discussed

further in Section II, the negative correlation between the scaled change in
                                                                                  8




domestic credit and the scaled balance of payments makes for easy confusion

in empirical analysis.


0.     Conditions for Monetary Control

       Unless the balance of payments is infinitely elastic with respect to

money growth, the central bank of a nonreserve country does exercise a

degree of monetary control. This control is not absolute (if           0) in

the sense that the balance—of—payments effects will enter the bank's choice

of   money growth, but neither will these effects completely overwhelm all
other influences such as domestic unemployment or inflation goals. Since
lagged balances of payments may be counted among those other influences,
the pegged system may be quite stable dynamically via specie—flow type
adjustments, but this is a different process than envisioned by the mone-
tary approach. This subsection examines in more detail the crucial param—
eter6      d (B/H)
           d Alog M
       Whether 6 is negative infinity has   generally   been addressed in terms
of   either assets or goods being perfect substitutes Internationally. If

assets are perfect substitutes and the derivative of the interest rate R

with respect to money growth is negative due to a liquidity effect, then

overwhelming capital flows will force the domestic interest rate to its

parity value. Similarly if goods are perfect substitutes and the deriva-

tive of the contemporaneous price level P with respect to money growth is

positive, overwhelming trade flows will force the domestic price level to

its parity value. Either of these cases are sufficient, but it is not

necessary for either or both to hold In order to obtain 8 —       —.

       To see this, write the scaled balance of payments as the difference

between the scaled balance of trade and the scaled net capital outflows
                                                                                                 9

          HHH
scaled net capital outflows will be a function of the current covered

interest differential (adjustedfor expected exchange rate changes) and other

variables which may be taken as given for the current period:


              .'f (R_p_RF)                                                               (10)

where p is the expected depreciation of the exchange rate (p < 0 implies an

expected appreciation),               is the given foreign interest rate, and so V is

negative. We can find U by differentiating equation (9)

responds to the size of the balance of payments (as an indicator of the

probability and size of a revaluation), then the direct trade and capital

flow effects will be reinforced by induced "speculative" capital flows.

These induced speculative capital flows will be overwhelming unless


      -
          '   d (B/a)
                           < 1                                                            (12)


Therefore, there are three conditions required for a U >                —: (1)     Trade

flows must not be overwhelming.7 (2) The direct effect on capital flows

must not be overwhelming.8 (3) Speculative capital flows must not be
overwhelming (condition (12) must be met). Note that with costs of adjust-.

ment and lags in information these three conditions may                be   met for certain

periods of observation but not for longer periods. With longer periods

lagged values of       which are included in XS in the short—period analysis

would instead be included in the contemporaneous value of
                                                                             10




     Obviously it is an empirical question whether these three conditions

for monetary control are met for any relevant observation length, and we

shall turn to some empirical evdence shortly in Section II. But first, the

third condition (12) raises an interesting possibility. Suppose that the

probability of a revaluation increases with the absolute value of the scaled

balance of payments and the expected (signed) magnitude of the revaluation

varies with the value of the scaled balance of payments. Then the expected

depreciation might be determined by a   function   like



           = &
                                                                      (13)
                  (tLt)

where g' is, of course, negative. The derivative of interest is



        d (B/H)    2g                                                 (14)



which increases in absolute value with the absolute value of B/H. Thus,

there is some reason to suppose that condition (12) might hold for "small"

absolute values of the scaled balance of payments but fail if the central

bank attempted a policy which is "too" inconsistent with international

conditions. This is illustrated in Figure 3. The central bank exercises

a degree of monetary control so long as it stays in the negatively sloped

portion of the international balance curve. (f it shifts into the verti-

cal range, however, overwhelming speculative capital flows result.9
                                                                              11




                             II.   Empirical Results


    Blejer (1979) applied the Cranger—Sims causality test to quarterly data

for France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, and the United Kingdom and found that

scaled   changes in domestic credit "cause" scaled reserve flows in all five
(albeit as part of a two—way feedback structure for Sweden and the United
Kingdom).    Blejer erroneously claimed that this supports the monetary ap-

proach, but it in fact suggests short—run monetary control since the test

shows that past changes in domestic credit affect current reserve flows.

This evidence for short—run monetary control is not conclusive, however,

since past changes in domestic credit might have been induced by reserve

country actions which have current effects on foreign prices and hence re-

serve f 1ows)° It is simply not appropriate to apply an exogeneity test

to two   endogenous   variables.

     The analysis of Section I suggests two research strategies which

focus directly on the issue of monetary control: The first is to fully

specify the more general model and estimate equations (1) and (6) by a

simultaneous system method to test whether        is, indeed, zero. This method

is being pursued in the Mark III International Transmission Model and is

beyond the scope of the present paper. The second approach is to proceed

on the assumption that the null hypothesis of no monetary control is true

and perform some classical hypothesis tests. Following this second path

allows us to avoid the difficulty of fully specifying the variables which

belong   in S.
     These hypothesis tests rely on-the -difference between the reduced
forms for Mog M under the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis.
Rewriting the reduced forms here for comparison
                                                                              12

Note that neither X8 nor SX enter in the reduced form if the null hypothesis

is true. One test of the null hypothesis is to add the domestic variables

X8 to the reduced form (4) and test whether they fail to enter as required

by the null hypothesis. That is, the null hypothesis implies 4) = 0

          EslogM4)X8+Z6+c                                                    (15)


A more powerful test would also include SA, but this requires a full

specification of the alternative hypothesis as noted above.

      The empirical tests are based on the quarterly data bank developed

 for the NEER Project on the International Transmission of Inflation and

 the money—supply reaction functions in the Mark III model, both of which

 are described in Darby and Stoclcinan (1979). We must first specify which

 variables appear in the vector Z. Following Stockman's standard form, we

 include in Z the change in the U.S. interest rate iR.e the change in domestic

 real income Alog yj2 and the change in an exchange—rate—converted income—

 weighted index of foreign prices Alog (EPF)J3 Table 1 reports estimates of

 the reduced—form (and structural) equation (4) for Alog N on this specifi-

 cation of Z for all seven nonreserve countries in the data bank. The

 pegged periods used in the estimates are indicated in the table. These re-

 gressions seem very poor compared to standard monetary approach results.

 The reason is that standard estimates move domestic credit to the right—
                                                                                13




hand side on the erroneous assumption that it is exogenous. This provides
                       2
a spuriously high R

        Following Genberg (1976), we can improve the fit of the regressions by

using the short—run money—demand function introduced by Chow (1966). This

amounts to adding the change in the logarithm of lagged real money or Alog (M/P)_1

to the vector Z. Table 2 reports the results obtained using the Chow

specification. These results are rather more favorable to the monetary ap-

proach although the R2s are not very impressive in an absolute sense. Let

us now proceed to the reduced—forut tests.

        The reaction functions In the Mark III model are very general in form

to allow for cross—country differences in timing of response. For the

pegged period included variables, other than a scaled balance of payments

term,   are a time   trend, current and lagged unexpected real government

spending,    lagged semiannual   inflation rates, ligged unemployment rates

or   logarithmic transitory incomes, and lagged scaled balance of payments.
When all these variables (except the current B/H) are added     to the regres-

sions reported in Tables 1 and 2, we can do the joint test whether the

coefficients of the additional variables are all zero as implied by the

null hypothesis. The results of these F tests are reported in Table 3. For

the Chow—money—demand—function the modified monetary approach (no monetary

control) is rejected strongly for the United Kingdom, France, and      Japan   and

at the 10 percent significance level for Canada and Germany. Similar, though

more erratic, results are obtained for the long—run—money—demand function.

Consider the tests, however: They ask whether all the additional variables

reduce the sum of squared residuals by significantly more than would be ex-

pected for such a number of unrelated random variables. Since not all of
                                                                               14




these variables enter any given reaction function this is a low—power test

(it is hard to reject the null hypothesis).

        A sharper test first estimates equation (1) using fitted values of

B/H based on all the variables In X and Z. Since X and Z are independent

of C,    the resulting estimated XS should not enter in equation (15) if the
null    hypothesis is true. This saves degrees of freedom by imposing the
constraint implied by the alternative hypothesis: that the domestic
policy    variables enter proportionally to how they enter in the reaction

function.

        Tables 4 and 5 report regressions corresponding to those in Tables
                                           A
1 and 2 with the addition of a term in XS. We now see that     in every case
but    one (Canada in Table 4)   differs significantly from zero and so we can

reject the null hypothesis of no monetary control)4 The difficulty with

Canada in Table 4 appears to be in estimating.a reaction function using only

data for the brief period that Canada was on a pegged exchange rate and only

the long—run money demand variables in the instrument list; XS also enters

                        III. Suary and Conclusions

     Recent   empirical research on sterilization had   demonstrated   that

standard monetary approach models which assume domestic credit exogenous

are invalid. This paper presents a modified monetary approach model

which retains the message of central—bank lnpotence despite extensive

sterilization activities. A more general model was also sketched under

which the central bank's policy objectives do influence the change in

the money supply. There was very strong evidence of at least short—run

monetary control in the quarterly data examined. This need not indicate any

long—run monetary control, but I conclude that the simplicity of the monetary

approach (in standard or modified form) is no longer empirically tenable for

use with quarterly data. More general models must be specified and tested

to explain the simultaneous determination of nominal money and the balance

of payments under pegged exchange rates.

       1To cite the locus classicus, see for example, Prenkel and Johnson

(1976, passlm esp. pp. 152—153). An important recent exception is a

theoretical analysis by Boyer (1979) which uses a portfolio balance ap-

proach.

       2See Darby and Stockman (1979), Stockman (1979), and Laskar (1979).

Previously Argy and Kouri (1974) had also found evidence of sterilization,

but GSberg (1976) using a very rudimentary reaction function (the only

variables ware the scaled balance of payments and government deficit) did

not. Prom their review of the earlier literature on sterilization and

monetary    control, Sweeney and Willett (1976, p. 444)      conclude that "there

is   little evidence   that such automony is impossible in the short—run,

and considerable evidence it is possible."

       3The analysis is properly applied only to nonreserve countries if

the reserve country (such as the United States) is on a fiat standard as

discussed in Darby (1980).

       4By way of information, the evidence cited in footnote 2 above

generally finds cx to lie between 0 and 0.2 or at most 0.3.. This implies

that substantial but not necessarily complete sterilization was the

standard practice for those nonreserve industrial countries which were

examined.


       5Harry   Johnson (1976, pp. 152—153) noted that     the   monetary "approach
assumes ——    in some cases, asserts — that     these   monetary inflows or out-
flows associated with surpluses or deficits are not sterilized ——             or   can-

not be, within a period relevant to policy analysis ——           but   instead in-

fluence the domestic money supply." But Th.issa (1976, p. 192) rightly
                                                                                 19




observes         that this assumption is unnecessary: "If the monetary authorities

sterilize the balance—of—payments surplus created by, say, the imposition

of. a tariff, then the monetary approach predicts that there will be a

further surplus, equal to the reduction in the domestic source component

of the base which is implied by sterilization, and so on, until the

sterilization operations cease." This subsection merely works out the

analytical framework sketched by Mussa. The author (1980) has cormuented

elsewhere on the inappropriateness of the empirical tests of the monetary

approach that have proceeded on the maintained assumption of exogenous

domestic credit.

           If this line were vertical (a =   0)   there would generally be no

equilibrium in the modified monetary approach case. A negative slope

(a C   0) implies an unstable equilibrium.

           9This provides another basis for Niehan's idea (1974) that non—

 reserve countries can exercise monetary control within a United range.

       '1See Darby and Stockman (1979). Equation (6) can be thought of as

 a semi—reduced form of all the non—reaction—function equations in the

model. Stockman (1979) dealt with this problem by implicitly assuming

SA = 0 in equation (6) and estimating transformations of equations (1)

and (6) by two—stage least squares. Since SA # 0 if the alternative

hypothesis is true, his estimates of *     are   inconsistent and likely biased

toward zero. In view of this specification error, his failure to find

evidence of monetary control does not seem very informative. This and

other criticisms apply to Argy and Kouri (1974). If one is to use a

simultaneous—equation approach, the general model must be fully specified.

       12The change in domestic real income might well be endogenous, but

following Stockman we take the monetary approach strictly here.

generally a   bit lower for the form reported here, but the basic results were
qualitatively the same.    The alternate tables are available upon request
