Do High-Cost Hospitals Deliver Better Care? Evidence from Ambulance Referral Patterns

                                                ABSTRACT

Endogenous patient sorting across hospitals can confound performance comparisons. This paper provides
a new lens to compare hospital performance for emergency patients: plausibly exogenous variation
in ambulance-company assignment. Ambulances are effectively randomly assigned to patients in the
same area based on rotational dispatch mechanisms. Using Medicare data from 2002-2008, we show
that ambulance company assignment importantly affects hospital choice for patients in the same zip
code. Using data for New York state from 2000-2006 that matches exact patient addresses to hospital
discharge records, we show that patients who live very near each other but on either side of ambulance-dispatch
boundaries go to different types of hospitals. Both strategies show that higher-cost hospitals have significantly
lower one-year mortality rates compared to lower-cost hospitals. We find that common indicators
of hospital quality, such as indicators for "appropriate care" for heart attacks, are generally not associated
with better patient outcomes. On the other hand, we find that measures of "leading edge" hospitals,
such as teaching hospitals and hospitals that quickly adopt the latest technologies, are associated with
better outcomes, but have little impact on the estimated mortality-hospital cost relationship. We also
find that hospital procedure intensity is a key determinant of the mortality-cost relationship, suggesting
that treatment intensity, and not differences in quality reflected in prices, drives much of our findings.
The evidence also suggests that there are diminishing returns to hospital spending and treatment intensity.

   The U.S. has by far the highest medical spending per capita in the world; spending is over twice

as high as the median for OECD nations (Reinhardt et al. 2004, Anderson and Frogner 2008).

Despite this disparity, health outcomes, on average, do not appear superior in the U.S.: we rank

30th among the 34 industrialized OECD nations in terms of infant mortality, and 27th in terms of

life expectancy at birth (OECD 2011). There has been enormous concern expressed and numerous

studies undertaken on the source of excess spending in the U.S. health care system. A broadly shared

conclusion is that a large share of U.S. medical spending is unproductive in terms of improving

patient health.

   The seminal work in the study of regional variation in healthcare spending in the U.S. has

been done by researchers at Dartmouth University as part of the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care

project. Fisher et al. (2003) studied Medicare expenditure data and found that end-of-life spending

levels – a measure of treatment intensity that controls for the health outcome – are 60% higher

in high-spending areas compared to low-spending areas in the U.S. Nevertheless, no difference is

found across regions in 5-year mortality rates following a health event such as a heart attack or hip

fracture. The lack of a relationship between regional variation in spending and health outcomes has

been cited in support of reducing Medicare spending by 20-30 percent without adversely affecting

health outcomes (Fisher et al. 2009).

   The contention that higher spending is not associated with improved outcomes has also been

extensively tested at the hospital level. For example, Barnato et al. (2010) find small positive

returns to higher end of life spending in terms of lower mortality, but these effects fade quickly and

are largely gone within 180 days. These results suggest little long-term benefit to higher hospital

spending – despite enormous variation in spending across hospitals for similar services.

   One concern when comparing nations, regions, or hospitals is that higher costs may be accrued

by populations in worse health. Consequently, higher spending may be associated with better

outcomes for a randomly chosen patient, even if it is not associated with better outcomes for the

(sicker) patients that reside in higher-spending areas or who use more expensive hospitals.

   In this paper, we focus on hospital spending and aim to estimate the effects of being treated

at high-spending hospitals on health outcomes. We endeavor to control for patient selection into



                                                  2
different types of hospitals by focusing on emergency transports to the hospital by ambulance.

The key ingredient of our approach is the recognition that the locus of treatment for emergency

hospitalizations is, to a large extent, determined by pre-hospital factors – and, in particular, am-

bulance transport decisions and patient location. To the extent that ambulance companies are

pseudo-randomly assigned to patients in an emergency, we can develop more convincing measures

of the impact of hospital and area differences on patient outcomes.

   We consider two complementary identification strategies to exploit variation in ambulance trans-

ports. The first uses the fact that in areas served by multiple ambulance companies, the company

dispatched to the patient is effectively random due to rotational assignment or even direct compe-

tition between simultaneously dispatched competitors. Moreover, we demonstrate that ambulance

companies serving the same small geographic area have preferences in the hospital to which they

take patients. These facts suggest that the ambulance company dispatched to emergency patients

may serve as a random assignment mechanism across local hospitals. We can then exploit am-

bulance identifiers provided in national Medicare inpatient data to test whether heterogeneity in

referral patterns exists, and to develop instruments for hospital choice based on patient ambulance

assignment. Finally, we can also use these ambulance data to test and control for any pre-hospital

differences in treatment which might independently impact outcomes.

   Our second strategy localizes the “natural randomization” approach adopted by the Dartmouth

researchers by exploiting contiguous areas on opposite sides of ambulance service area boundaries

in the state of New York. In New York, each state-certified Emergency Medical Service (EMS)

provider is assigned to a territory via a certificate of need process where they are allowed to be

“first due” for response. Other areas may be entered when that area’s local provider is busy. We

obtained the territories for each EMS provider from the New York State Department of Emergency

Medical Services, and we couple these data with unique hospital discharge data that identifies each

patient’s exact residential address. This combination allows us to compare those living on either

side of an ambulance service area boundary. To the extent that these neighbors are similar to one

another, the boundary can generate exogenous variation in the hospitals to which these patients

are transported.



                                                 3
   Both of these strategies yield a striking and consistent conclusion: higher-cost hospitals are

associated with improved patient mortality outcomes. The suggested returns to hospital care are

substantial. In particular, the results from the ambulance assignment identification strategy imply

that a 10% increase in hospital costs is associated with lower patient mortality in the first year

after admission by roughly 4% of the baseline mortality rate.

   We chose average hospital cost as a summary measure of the treatment provided by the hospital

to investigate whether hospital choice matters for health outcomes. But costs are obviously corre-

lated with a wide variety of hospital-specific characteristics. In the last section of our paper, we

endeavor to explore which hospital characteristics matter most for patient outcomes. Importantly,

our empirical strategy provides a causal framework to assess the impact of a wide range of hospital

characteristics, and to assess whether they explain the relationship we have documented between

hospital cost and mortality. We find that common indicators of hospital quality, such as indicators

for “appropriate care” for heart attacks, are generally not associated with better patient outcomes.

On the other hand, we find that measures of “leading edge” hospitals, such as teaching hospitals

and hospitals that quickly adopt the latest technologies, are associated with better outcomes – but

have little impact on the estimated mortality-hospital cost relationship. We also find that hospital

procedure intensity is a key determinant of the mortality-cost relationship, suggesting that treat-

ment intensity, and not differences in quality reflected in prices, drives much of our findings. Last,

we investigate the extent to which there are diminishing or even negative returns to treatment in

hospitals with the very highest costs.

   Our paper proceeds as follows. Part I places our project in the context of the previous literature

on the returns to hospital spending. Part II describes the nature of pre-hospital care and how it

informs our approach. Part III discusses our data sources and Part IV our empirical strategy. Part

V presents the basic results from Medicare data, and Part VI presents comparable results from New

York State. Part VII extends the analysis to consider other attributes of the hospital “bundle,”

and provides some evidence of diminishing returns. Part VIII concludes.

I    Previous Literature

Our work is related to a number of cross-cutting literatures which speak to the returns to higher

hospital spending.


Area Variations Literature

As noted earlier, a common source of support for the contention that the U.S. wastes much of its

medical spending is the wide variation in area health care costs that do not seem to be associated

with improved outcomes. The seminal work in this area has been done by researchers at Dartmouth

University as part of the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care project. In particular, there is a large

literature investigating the relationship between regional variation in health care spending and

health disparities. The typical study compares patients hospitalized in high-spending areas to

patients in low-spending ares. Regions with greater health care assets have been found to provide

greater amounts of care across all patients. (Fisher et al. 1994, Stukel et al. 2005). These results

suggest that where a patient lives determines the quantity of care received following a health

problem (Chandra and Skinner 2003). Chandra and Staiger (2007) employ a Roy model where

physicians in an area specialize in more intensive surgical treatments over less intensive medical

treatments if there are relatively high returns to doing so, and productivity spillovers further

enhance the returns to intensive treatment. In this model, the spillover results in potentially worse

outcomes for patients who would benefit most from the less-intensive treatment because the region

has specialized in the intensive treatment to raise average outcomes. In such a model, restricting

the intensive areas to practice in the less-intensive style would result in worse health outcomes,

despite the potential for little difference in outcomes across areas in the cross section.

    These large disparities in spending are generally not found to contribute to improvements in

health outcomes (Fisher et al. 1994, Pilote et al. 1995, Kessler and McClellan 1996, Tu et al.

1997, O’Connor et al. 1999, Baicker and Chandra 2004, Fuchs 2004, Stukel et al. 2005, Sirovich

et al. 2006). As noted earlier, for example, Fisher et al. (2003) studied Medicare expenditure

data and found that end-of-life spending levels are 60% higher in high-spending areas compared to

low-spending ones in the U.S. Nevertheless, no difference in 5-year mortality rates is found across


                                                  5
regions following a health event such as a heart attack or hip fracture. This wide variation in

spending and the similarity of mortality rates were again found when the sample was restricted

to teaching hospitals (Fisher et al. 2004). Related studies have suggested that higher spending is

associated with worse health outcomes (Guadagnoli et al. 1995, Fisher and Welch 1999).


Hospital Differences Literature

There is also a sizeable literature on spending and outcomes at the hospital level. This literature

comes to mixed conclusions about the returns to higher spending. Several studies find significant

returns to measures of hospital treatment intensity. Allison et al. (2000) find that those treated

for Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) at teaching hospitals had roughly 10% lower mortality

than those treated at non-teaching hospitals, and that this effect persisted for two years after the

incident. Most recently, Romley et al. (2011) document that those treated in California hospitals

with the highest end-of-life spending have much lower inpatient mortality: inpatient mortality in

hospitals at the highest quintile of spending is 10-37% lower than at the lowest quintile across a

range of conditions.

   Other studies suggest no returns to higher spending. Glance et al. (2010) find that low inpatient

mortality is associated with lower costs. A middle ground is struck by Barnato et al. (2010), who

find small positive returns to higher end of life spending in terms of lower mortality, but find that

these effects fade quickly and are largely gone by 180 days after admission. These results suggest

little long-term benefit to higher spending.


Inference Problem: Patient Selection

A major issue that arises when comparing regions is that greater treatment levels may be chosen

for populations in worse health. For example, higher spending is strongly associated with higher

mortality rates on the individual level, even after risk adjustment. This is consistent with more

care provided to patients in (unobservably) worse health. At the regional level, long-term invest-

ments in capital and labor may reflect the underlying health of the population as well. Differences

in unobservable characteristics may therefore bias the results toward finding no effect of greater


                                                 6
spending.

      Research on area- or hospital-level returns to care recognizes the issue of patient selection

and notes that observable patient characteristics are similar across areas.1 Fisher et al. (2003)

found similar predicted mortality rates in higher-spending areas for hip fracture patients, though

somewhat higher predicted mortality in those areas for heart attack patients. Further, these studies

endeavor to control for patient mix with a variety of indicators of patient severity. But even the

best controls based on diagnosis codes and patient characteristics are only imperfect proxies for

underlying severity. Advanced risk adjustment techniques explain less than 10% of the year-to-

year variation in patient spending in the Medicare program, for example (Garber et al. 1998).

While some fraction of the unexplained variation is exogenous and therefore unpredictable, it is

likely that patient decisions to seek medical treatment are driven by health factors unobservable

to the researcher. A recent article by Zhang et al. (2010), for example, finds that the unadjusted

correlation between pharmaceutical spending and medical (non-drug) spending across high- and

low-spending Medicare regions is high (0.6), but that this finding is highly sensitive to patient

controls: the correlation falls to just 0.1 when patient health status is taken into account. In

addition, Doyle (2011) compared patients in Florida and again found that observable characteristics

were similar across areas that had significant variation in hospital spending levels. When the

analysis focused on tourists – a group that is arguably more comparable across areas and likely

does not affect the chosen level of treatment intensity in the area – higher-spending areas were

associated with substantially lower mortality.

      The use of claims-based diagnosis codes to control for underlying health may also be problematic

because the diagnosis measures themselves could be endogenous. That is, a patient listed with many

diagnoses could be in poor health or could have been treated by a high ”observation-intensity”

provider that tends to diagnose (and record) more illnesses. In a recent paper, Song et al. (2010)

find that Medicare patients who move to higher intensity regions experience a greater increase in

the number of diagnoses over time compared to similar patients in the area from which they moved.

Conversely, patients who move to lower-intensity regions accrue fewer diagnoses. In another recent
  1
      See, for example, O’Connor et al. (1999); Pilote et al. (1995); Stukel et al. (2005); and Fisher et al. (2003)




                                                            7
piece, Welch et al. (2011) find an inverse relationship between regional diagnostic frequency rates

and case fatality rates, suggesting that the marginal patient diagnosed in a high diagnosis-frequency

area may be healthier compared to patients diagnosed with the same condition in low-frequency

areas.

     To control for underlying health differences, another direct measure is the patient’s lagged

healthcare spending. Yet this too may be problematic when the goal is to describe areas as high

vs. low intensity, as intensity is autocorrelated. Clearly, with the limitations of standard risk

adjustment methods in mind, it is even more critical to develop a methodology that cleanly separates

provider assignment from patient health.

     Finally, one of the main sources of variation used in health economics is distance to the hospital

as an exogenous instrument for determining hospital assignment. Perhaps the most famous example

of such work is McClellan et al. (1994), who modeled the use of cardiac catheterization after a heart

attack as a function of the “differential distance” to a hospital with a catheterization laboratory

(relative to the distance to the nearest hospital). By using differential distance, they aimed to

control for the fact that individuals who live near a hospital are different than those who do not.

However, patients that live in ZIP codes near higher quality hospitals that have catheterization labs

may have differ in unobserved ways from patients that live in other ZIP codes. In contrast, this

paper offers a new lens to estimate effects of different hospital types on patient outcomes: patients

who live in the same ZIP code but are treated at different hospitals in an emergency.



II       Background on Pre-Hospital Care

The key ingredient of our approach is the recognition that the locus of treatment for emergency

hospitalizations is, to a large extent, determined by pre-hospital factors, including ambulance trans-

port decisions and patient location. Among the emergency cases we consider, 61% are brought into

the hospital via ambulance. In such cases, the level of care dispatched to the scene (e.g. Advanced

Life Support (ALS) using paramedics vs. Basic Life Support (BLS) using Emergency Medical

Technicians) may be chosen based on perceived severity (Curka et al. 1993, Athey and Stern 2002).

Critically, however, in areas served by multiple ambulance companies, the company dispatched is

                                                   8
usually chosen independent of the patient characteristics that can confound the area and hospital

comparisons reviewed above.

      Rotational assignment of competing ambulances services – as well as direct competition between

simultaneously dispatched competitors – is increasingly common in the U.S. For example, two

recent articles cite examples from North and South Carolina where the opportunity for ambulance

transport is broadcast to multiple companies and whichever arrives there first gets the business.2

Similarly, large cities such as New York, Los Angeles and Chicago have adopted a hybrid approach

under which private ambulance companies work in conjunction with fire departments to provide

Emergency Medical Services (EMS) (Johnson 2001). Another recent report found that of the top

10 cities with the highest population over 65, 5 contracted with both public and private ambulance

carriers, while 2 others contracted with exclusively private carriers (Chiang et al. 2006). In a

more recent 2010 survey covering 97 areas, 40 percent reported contracting with private ambulance

companies and an additional 23 percent utilized hospital-based ambulance providers (Ragone 2012).

      We are aware of no systematic evidence on the basis for rotational assignment of ambulances.

To understand the dispatch process we conducted a survey of 30 cities with more than one ambu-

lance company serving the area in our Medicare data. The survey revealed that patients can be

transported by different companies for two main reasons. First, in communities served by multiple

ambulance services, 911 systems often use software that assigns units based on a rotational dis-

patch mechanism; alternatively, they may position ambulances throughout an area and dispatch

whichever ambulance is closest, then reshuffle the other available units to respond to the next call.

Second, in areas with a single ambulance company, neighboring companies provide service when

the principal ambulance units are busy under so-called “mutual aid” agreements. Critically, under

either dispatch mechanism, every one of the respondents surveyed reported that ambulance assign-

ment was independent of patient characteristics (within BLS vs. ALS ambulances). Within a small

area, then, the variation in the ambulance dispatched is either due to rotational assignment or one

of the ambulance companies being engaged on another 911 call. Both sources appear plausibly

exogenous with respect to the underlying health of a given patient.
  2
      See Watson (2011) and Johnson (2001) for examples.




                                                           9
   There is some existing evidence that pre-hospital care is an important determinant of hospital

choice due to the “preferences” of ambulance companies to take patients to particular hospitals.

In the South Carolina example, the article explicitly points out that if an ambulance company

associated with a particular hospital gets to the patient first, the patient is much more likely to be

transported to that hospital.

   Directly relevant to our approach is research by the New York State Comptroller’s Office in

the wake of a major change in the rotational assignment of private and FDNY ambulances in New

York City. Skura (2001) found that patients living in the same ZIP code as public Health and

Hospital Corporation (HHC) hospitals were less than half as likely to be taken there when assigned

a private, non-profit ambulance (29%) compared to when the dispatch system assigned them to

an FDNY ambulance (64%). In most cases, the private ambulances were operated by non-profit

hospitals and stationed near or even within those facilities, so they tended to take their patients

there.

   This point is illustrated in Figure 1, from Skura (2001). This figure shows the location of three

hospitals, two of them private hospitals that operate ambulance service (St. Clare’s and New York

Hospital) and one public (Bellevue hospital). The author examined the rate at which ambulances

took patients residing in the Bellevue ZIP code to these hospitals. He found that for those picked

up by FDNY ambulances, 61% were brought to Bellevue, and 39% brought to the more distant

private hospitals. But for those picked up by private ambulance companies, only 25% were brought

to Bellevue, and 75% to the other hospitals (Figure 1). Similar results were found for other ZIP

codes within New York City as well.

   In summary, ambulance dispatch rules appear to effectively randomize patients to ambulance

companies. Previous case studies suggest that these ambulances have preferences about which

hospital to choose. Our empirical strategy exploits this plausibly exogenous variation in the hospital

choice, as described below.




                                                 10
III       Data

Our national data uses Medicare claims between 2002 and 2008. The use of these data was previ-

ously authorized under a data use agreement with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services

(CMS). In particular, the Carrier file includes a 20% random sample of beneficiaries, and from this

file we observe the ambulance claim. We then link these claims to inpatient claims, which include

standard measures of treatment, such as procedures performed, and up to 10 diagnosis codes. Pa-

tient characteristics are also recorded, such as age, race, and sex. The claims data also include

the ZIP code of the beneficiary, where official correspondence is sent. In principle, this could differ

from the patient’s home ZIP code. In addition, vital statistics data that record when a patient dies

is linked to these claims, which allows us to measure mortality at different timeframes, such as 30

days or one year.

       In addition to these usual controls in claims data, we discovered that the ambulance claims offer

a new set of control variables. These data include detailed information on the mode and method of

transport (Advanced Life Support vs. Basic Life Support; emergency vs. non-emergency3 ) and on

specific pre-hospital interventions administered by ambulance personnel (e.g., intravenous therapy

and administered drugs). While previous studies using Medicare data have been limited in their

inability to control for patient location (beyond using distance from the centroid of the patient’s

ZIP code), an innovation of our approach is that we also control for “loaded miles”: a billing term

referring to the exact distance the ambulance traveled to the hospital with the patient on board.

Finally, our Medicare claims also include an ambulance company identifier.4 This allows us to

construct empirical referral pattern measures that serve as the basis for our analytic strategy.

       The actual costs associated with the treatment of a particular hospitalization are not recorded in

hospital inpatient data, and there are several different proxies available for costs. The previous lit-

erature has typically used Medicare hospital expenditures, but expenditures are almost completely
   3
      While we study conditions and admissions that appear to be emergencies, ambulances are reimbursed at a higher
rate if they transport the patient under so-called “emergency traffic” (i.e.,“lights and sirens”) on the way to the
hospital.
    4
      Medicare only reimburses for ambulance transports to a nearby facility; patients who wish to be taken somewhere
else must pay the incremental cost of transport to that facility. There are a small number of such episodes in our
data, and the results are not sensitive to their inclusion.




                                                         11
driven by diagnosis coding and hospital cost add-ons rather than treatment differences within a

diagnosis code. An alternative is to measure costs by the facility charges for each hospitalization.

This measure overstates costs, however, as hospitals typically mark up list prices well beyond the

prices actually paid for their services. Another alternative is to renormalize this charge measure by

a hospital-specific cost to charge ratio, and this is the basis of our cost measure in the main results:

average hospital log costs.5 We report results when alternative measures are used, as well.

    Our other major data source is the universe of inpatient hospital discharges from New York

State, made available from the New York State Department of Health through the Statewide

Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS). These data include detailed information

on patient demographic characteristics, diagnoses, and treatments, as well as a unique patient

identifier that allows for longitudinal linking across facilities. A unique feature of these data is an

address field that allows us to identify the exact patient residence location for 90% of the discharge

records in our 2000-2006 sample (approx. 20.6 million records for all patients). These data are

matched to vital statistics databases from the entire state of New York, enabling the construction

of mortality measures extending up to 1-year.

    The SPARCS data complement our analysis in three ways. First, because the SPARCS data

include a residential address for each hospital patient, we can use narrowly defined geographic

areas such as census block groups for our analysis. These smaller areas are likely to be even more

homogeneous than the larger ZIP code areas. Second, these addresses allow us to match patients

to narrowly defined areas located near the ambulance-dispatch boundaries. Third, the New York

data allow us to compare patients throughout the age distribution and study patients not insured

under Medicare.


Sample Construction

In both data sets, our primary sample consists of patients admitted to the hospital through the

emergency room with 29 “nondeferrable” conditions where selection into the healthcare system is
   5
     A disadvantage of these cost-to-charge ratios is that they can be noisy measures. Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid (CMS) recommends replacing the cost-to-charge ratio for outliers with the median for that year. We
replaced the extreme 5% of the cost-to-charge ratios in this way.




                                                      12
largely unavoidable. Following Dobkin (2003) and Card et al. (2009), diagnoses whose weekend

admission rates are closest to 2/7ths reflect a lack of discretion as to the timing of the hospital

admission. Discretionary admissions see a marked decline on the weekend, but particularly serious

emergencies do not. Using our Medicare sample, we chose a cutoff of all conditions with a weekend

admission rate that was as close or closer to 2/7ths as hip fracture, a condition commonly thought

to require immediate care. These conditions represent 39% of the hospital admissions via the

emergency room, 61% of which arrived by ambulance. In New York, these nondeferrable conditions

account for 34% of all emergency patients whose primary payer is Medicare.

   For our analysis of the Medicare data, we are unable to consider beneficiaries who are part

of Medicare Advantage programs, as their claims are not available. These beneficiaries constitute

17% of the Medicare population in 2000 and 22% in 2008 (Kaiser Family Foundation 2010). We

further limit the sample to patients during their first hospitalization under the Medicare program,

in order to study outcomes after an initial health shock, and in an effort to exclude patients who

may have preferences for particular hospitals due to previous hospitalizations. By necessity of

the empirical strategy, we limit the analysis to those patients who are brought to the emergency

room by ambulance. We further remove a small number of observations with missing ZIP code

information, missing ambulance company information, as well as ambulance companies, ZIP codes,

or hospitals with fewer than 10 observations. Last, we restrict the sample to hospitals that are

within 50 miles of the patient’s ZIP code centroid. This results in a sample of 667,143 patients.

   The reliance on ambulance transports allows us to focus on patients who are less likely to

decide whether or not to go to the hospital. Appendix Table A1 shows that this sample has

more comorbidities, is slightly older, and has a higher 1-year mortality rate (37%) compared to

all Medicare patients who enter the hospital via the emergency room (20%). These are relatively

severe health shocks, and the estimates of the effects of hospital types on mortality apply to these

types of episodes. We caution against applying the results to more chronic conditions.

   For our analysis of the New York SPARCS data, pre-hospital care is not collected so we cannot

identify ambulance transports. To facilitate comparison of results using these data to the Medicare

sample, we restrict the analysis to patients who enter inpatient care via the emergency room



                                                13
and have a principal diagnosis considered nondeferrable. Our main results will also focus on the

first hospitalization in our data, as well as a restriction to Medicare patients. We also remove a

small number of observations with missing address information, patients whose residence is located

outside of New York State, and patients whose address could not be matched to a block group. We

again restrict the sample to patients receiving care at a hospital located within 50 miles of their

residential address. This results in a sample of 142,809 patients within 1 mile of a boundary, 213,968

patients within two miles of a boundary, and 281,036 patients within 5 miles of a boundary.



IV     Empirical Strategy

Ambulance Referral Patterns within ZIP Code Areas

Our first approach relies on differences in ambulance referral patterns within ZIP code areas.

Ambulance companies have some discretion over the hospital choice, with a typical tradeoff between

distance and the hospital with the most appropriate level of care. We compare patients picked up

by ambulances with different tendencies to favor particular types of hospitals (such as high-cost

hospitals) in these decisions. We then assess whether these different preferences lead to meaningful

differences in the type of hospital where patient is treated.

   We can illustrate that such “preferences” exist by essentially generalizing the New York City

example above using variation in hospital shares across ambulance companies serving the same

ZIP codes. Specifically, using observed ambulance-hospital frequencies within each ZIP code in

our Medicare sample, we estimate a Chi-square test of homogeneity. Consider, for example, a ZIP

code served by two hospitals in which we observe emergency patients taken to hospital h1 75% of

the time when they are picked up by ambulance company a1 , but only 33% of the time when they

are picked up by company a2 . Since there are only two hospitals, it follows that we would observe

25% of a1’s patients, and 66% of a2 ’s patients, being taken to hospital h2 . Given these observed

proportions, we wish to test whether there is statistical evidence that companies a1 and a2 have

different patient transport patterns.

   In our sample, we calculated test statistics for every ZIP code in our Medicare data with at



                                                 14
least 5 ambulance transports by comparing observed ambulance-hospital cell frequencies to those

expected under the null hypothesis, which is that ambulances distribute patients across nearby

hospitals at the same rates.6 Among the 9,125 ZIP codes where we can calculate these statistics,

38% have test statistics with p < 0.1. This provides evidence that there appear to be differences

in where patients are taken based on which ambulance company picks them up that well exceeds

pure chance (which would result in less than 10% of zips having test statistics with p < 0.1). This

type of variation is the basis of our first-stage estimation, which we turn to next.

       To operationalize ambulance preferences, we calculate an instrumental variable that measures

the treatment intensity of hospitals where each ambulance company takes its patients. For patient

i assigned to ambulance a(i), we calculate the average inpatient costs among the patients in our

analysis sample for each ambulance company:7

                                                                Na(i) −1
                                                       1         X
                                         Za(i) =                           Costj
                                                   Na(i) − 1
                                                                  j6=i

       This measure is essentially the ambulance company fixed effect in a model of hospital costs. We

exclude the given patient from this measure to avoid a direct linkage between Z and the average

cost in a given hospital – a Jackknife Instrumental Variables Estimator (JIVE) that is more robust

to weak-instrument concerns when fixed effects are used to construct an instrument (Stock et

al. 2002, Kolesr et al. 2011).

       We then use this measure to estimate the first-stage relationship between hospital costs, H, and

the instrument, Z: hospital costs associated with the ambulance assigned to patient i living in ZIP

code z(i) in year t(i):



                            Hi = α0 + α1 Za(i) + α2 Xi + α3 Ai + θz(i) + λt(i) + νi                                (1)
   6
      The resulting test-statistic (for ZIP z) is distributed χ2 with (Hz − 1) ∗ (Az − 1) degrees of freedom, where Hz
is the total number of hospitals treating patients from ZIP z, and Az is the total number of ambulance companies
transporting patients from ZIP z.
    7
      In practice, some ambulance companies serve large areas including multiple states. To compare patients at risk of
receiving the same ambulance company, we compute the instrument at the company-Hospital Referral Region level.
Hospital Referral Regions are relatively large area designed to capture markets for non-emergency care. This allows
us to retain information about the ambulance company’s preferences across hospitals within and outside the patient’s
(smaller) Hospital Service Area.



                                                           15
       where Xi is a vector of patient controls including indicators for each age, race, sex, miles from the

ZIP code centroid, and indicators for four common comorbidities: congestive heart failure, chronic

obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, and other comorbidity; Ai represents a vector of

ambulance characteristics including the payment to the company, which provides a useful summary

of the treatment provided in the ambulance; indicators for distance traveled in miles; whether

the transport utilized Advanced Life Support (e.g., paramedic) capabilities; whether intravenous

therapy was administered; whether the transport was coded as emergency transport; and whether

the ambulance was paid through the outpatient system rather than the carrier system.8 . We cluster

standard errors at the Hospital Service Area (HSA) level, as each local market may have its own

assignment rules. This choice is relatively conservative compared to clustering at the ambulance

company level instead.

       We also include a full set of ZIP code fixed effects and year indicators. This regression therefore

compares individuals who live in the same ZIP code in the same year, but who are picked up by

ambulance companies with different “preferences” across different types of hospitals (excluding the

patient herself). A positive coefficient α1 would indicate that ambulance company “preferences”

are correlated with where the patient actually is admitted.


Relationship Between Hospital Costs and Mortality

Our main regression of interest is the relationship between hospital costs on mortality, M , for

patient i:



                             Mi = β0 + β1 Hi + β2 Xi + β3 Ai + θz(i) + λt(i) + i                             (2)

       This OLS regression parallels the previous literature in modeling mortality of patient i who

goes to hospital h, as a function of average hospital cost. Mortality can be measured at intervals

such as 30 days, 90 days, or 1 year. As noted earlier, this regression suffers from the fact that

patients may be selected into certain hospitals based on characteristics which affect their mortality.
   8
    Claims for ambulances owned by institutional providers (e.g., hospitals) are found in the outpatient file, and
represent about 10% of all ambulance transports within our file. These data do not include the distance measure,
and for these observations the distance indicators were filled with the sample mean.


                                                       16
To address this, we estimate the model by instrumental variables, where the instrument is the

ambulance measure discussed above. That is, we use equation (1) above as a first stage to estimate

this model by instrumental variables.

   This empirical approach has four main limitations. The first is that ambulance company pref-

erences could be correlated with underlying patient characteristics even within ZIP codes. For

example, some ambulance companies could be expert at avoiding complicated cases that are likely

to die. Our survey evidence gives us confidence that this is not the case. In addition, the results

below investigate whether our results are sensitive to controls for observed patient characteristics.

   Second, some ambulance companies may serve only a certain part of a ZIP code, and these am-

bulance companies may disproportionately take their patients to particular hospitals. For example,

an ambulance company focused in a higher income part of a ZIP code could be more likely to take

patients to high-cost hospitals. In that case, we might find that high-cost hospitals are associated

with better outcomes through patient selection. We can address this concern to some extent in

our specification checks by restricting our sample to particularly homogenous ZIP codes using the

Summary File 3 (SF3) file issued by the U.S. Census. By restricting our analysis to ZIP codes with

little within-ZIP code variation in demographic characteristics such as household income and racial

composition, we hope to minimize the potential for ambulance selection within a ZIP code.

   A third concern is that the approach interprets differences in costs and outcomes as stemming

from different hospital assignment patterns across ambulance companies, but ambulance companies

may have a more direct impact on health. If ambulance companies that tend to take patients to

high-cost hospitals provide different levels of pre-hospital care, then the outcome differences would

be due to a combination of the two types of treatment. More subtly, part of the variation comes

from ambulance companies driving farther to reach a different hospital. If these distances were

systematically longer as ambulances travel farther to reach a high-cost hospital, then “high-cost”

ambulances may take more time to reach the hospital, resulting in worse outcomes. An innovation

in this project is that we study (and control for) differences in care provided by the ambulance

company, including the distance traveled to the hospital. We also investigate the timing of any

mortality reductions, as the direct effects of treatment delivered by the ambulance company will



                                                 17
likely be observed soon after admission.

   A final concern is that ambulance company assignment may only affect hospital choice for a

subset of patients, and the results would provide a local average treatment effect. For example, we

are unable to estimate effects for patients who always insist (and are taken to) high-cost hospitals.

Because of these limitations we turn to a second, complementary approach.


Borders Approach

Our alternative approach compares patients along borders that define distinct ambulance dispatch

areas. The idea is that patients could live in the same neighborhood yet go to very different hospitals

because they reside on opposite sides of a shared border. This parallels the analysis of Black (1999),

who compared those living on either side of school district borders to study the impact of school

quality on housing prices. For this analysis, we focus on New York State, where we have data on

exact patient addresses coupled with a detailed disptch grid we obtained from the New York State

Department of Emergency Medical Services.

   Each state-certified Emergency Medical Service (EMS) provider in New York is assigned to a

territory where they are allowed to be ”first due” for response via a certificate of need process,

subject to the terms of New York Public Health Law (Article 30). These territories are typically

delineated using county, city, town, village and fire district boundaries. Other areas may be entered

when the provider is requested for mutual aid.

   Using these data, we can identify census block groups in New York State on either side of an

ambulance dispatch area boundary. Census block groups are the smallest geographical units defined

by the U.S. Census Bureau for which demographic information is publicly available. These blocks

have an average population of 1,300 residents. Using the latitude and longitude coordinates of each

patient’s residential address as recorded in our hospital discharge data, we map each patient to

a unique census block group. We then identify individuals whose block group centroid is located

within a defined distance of an ambulance service territory border.

   Specifically, we include patients residing in block groups located within 1-mile, 2-miles, and

5-miles of an ambulance border. The smaller distance criteria allows us to compare patients who



                                                  18
live very near to one another and are likely a better matched comparison. The 5-mile criterion

allows us to retain more rural areas, however, as block groups are constructed based on population

counts and the centroid in these areas may lie outside the 1- or 2-mile restrictions.

       The estimating equations parallel the earlier analysis, but now the comparison is across areas

rather than ambulance companies. Rather than ZIP code fixed effects, we include matched-pair

fixed effects that allow us to compare patients who live on either side of the same boundary. For

patient i living in dispatch area a(i), the first-stage model takes the form:



                               Ha(i) = φ0 + φ1 Za(i) + φ2 Xi + θp(i) + λt(i) + ωi                                 (3)

       where Ha(i) represents the average costs in the area where the patient is treated, while Za(i)

is the average costs in the dispatch area where the patient resides, and θp(i) is a set of dummies

for each matched pair of census block groups. So this regression asks: are patients who live in

a dispatch area serviced by relatively high-cost hospitals more likely to be treated at high-cost

hospitals themselves compared to those who live nearby but across a dispatch area boundary?

Standard errors in these models are clustered at the dispatch-area level.

       We can then once again estimate a mortality-cost model of the form:



                                Mi = γ0 + γ1 Ha(i) + γ2 Xi + θp(i) + λt(i) + i                                   (4)

       where we instrument for hospital costs at the area level using the first stage relationship in (3).

       The borders approach augments the ambulance preference approach because differences in hos-

pital patterns within these small areas are plausibly due to differences in ambulance dispatch

patterns and not patient tastes. At the same time, there may be other factors that change at bor-

ders that could bias our findings. For example, in New York a common border for dispatch areas

is the county, and counties may differ in other factors that impact the choice of residence, such as

the quality of public services.9 Our analysis will control for differences in resident characteristics
   9
     Of the borders delineated by the New York EMS service file, borders that separate adjacent cities and adjacent
towns are most common (29.2%, and 18.7% respectively), while 15.5% of the borders divide counties and towns,
13.2% of the borders divide counties and fire districts, and 6.5% divide counties and villages. Other types of borders
(e.g. town-village, city-county, etc.) each comprise less than 5% of the border sample.



                                                         19
at the boundary using U.S. Census SF3 data. Of course, differences in unobserved characteristics

of patients across a border from one another remain a concern.

    In summary, we consider two different identification strategies using two different data sets.

Each has advantages and weaknesses, but taken together they can provide insights into whether

hospital costs are associated with health outcomes.



V       Ambulance Company Preference Results

Balance

The key underlying assumption of our approaches is that the sources of variation in the hospital

type have been purged of patient-specific factors which impact costs or outcomes. To assess whether

this is true at least along observable dimensions, Table 1 shows the balance of patient characteristics

across those patients with above and below median values of our ambulance preference instrument;

that is, those patients who are picked up by ambulance companies that go to more expensive

hospitals available to a ZIP code area versus those picked up by ambulances that go to less expensive

ones.

    The first row of the table shows that costs among those picked up by ambulance companies

with preferences for higher-cost hospitals is about 20 log points higher compared to those picked

up by ambulance companies with preferences for lower-cost hospitals. The next set of rows shows

that these two groups of patients are similar in terms of their overall health and demographic

characteristics. For example, the average age for low-cost ambulance companies is 78.5 vs. 78.0

for high-cost companies. Sex, race, and comorbidity rates are similar as well. Perhaps even more

comforting is that the two groups of patients look nearly identical in terms of their pre-hospital

treatment, as summarized by the ambulance payment ($291 vs. $296). They administer an IV

in 9.7% of cases in both groups. The high-cost ambulances are more likely to be Advanced Life

Support ambulances, and we will report estimates of a robustness check that limits the sample to

ALS ambulances. In addition, the high-cost areas had a 3% shorter distance, on average. While

time to the hospital matters for survival, and we control for distance, a 0.2 mile difference is unlikely



                                                   20
to drive the results. That said, we do consider 1-day mortality to begin to investigate effects of the

ambulance company treatment. At least in terms of observable characteristics, our sample appears

well balanced.


Basic Results

Table 2 shows the first-stage results for our ambulance company preference instrument, equation

(1) above. We begin by estimating the relationship between average hospital cost at the patient’s

hospital and the average hospital cost associated with the ambulance company assigned to the

patient, controlling only for year and ZIP code fixed effects: there is a very strong correlation

between the two, suggesting that if the ambulance company that tends to take other patients to

10% more expensive hospitals, the hospital where the patient is taken has 3.1% higher average

hospital costs. The subsequent columns add controls for patient and ambulance characteristics.

The result is remarkably robust to these additional controls.

   The source of the variation is evident from the coefficient being significantly less than one.

Consider the variation that stems from mutual-aid arrangements, for example. The instrument is

calculated with heavier weights on areas where the company usually operates. If it is called in

to help when another company is busy, the first-stage reflects that the company is more likely to

transport the patient back to its usual hospitals, but less so in the mutual-aid area than where it

usually operates. The mutual aid area likely has other nearby hospitals in the choice set.

   Table 3 shows the results of estimating equation (2) by OLS. We find a strong and highly

significant negative correlation between hospital cost and mortality. The results suggest that raising

costs by 10% (or about $1000) would lower one year mortality by 0.24 percentage points (or about

0.7% of baseline mortality). As noted earlier, this result suffers from potential selection bias due

to patient choice of hospital. It is worth noting, however, that the robustness of the results to

controls does not suggest much bias based on observables; we find quite different results in our

OLS estimates for New York, however.

   The next set of rows report the 2SLS estimates and the point estimates are much larger in

magnitude. In a model with year, diagnosis and ZIP code fixed effects, a 10% rise in costs is



                                                 21
associated with a 1.96 percentage-point lower mortality rate, or about 6% of baseline mortality. In

a model with full controls, the estimate declines to 1.44 percentage points. While the estimates do

decline with controls, the estimates are not statistically significantly different from one another.

    To put the estimate in context, this result implies that a two standard deviation increase in

average hospital costs, an increase of 0.8 log points, is associated with an 11.5 percentage point

reduction in mortality, or 31% of the sample mortality rate. Thus, we find compelling evidence that

higher-cost hospitals have significantly lower patient mortality, at least for emergency admissions.


Robustness

We next subject this striking finding to a series of robustness tests. First, we report results across

alternative mortality horizons up to two years. We are particularly interested in very short run

effects at one day after admission. If we are finding strong effects of differing pre-hospital care,

then those should show up right away and perhaps fade over time. More generally, it is interesting

to know whether these findings are reduced or increased as we extend the mortality horizon.

    The results of using different horizons are presented in Table 4. The OLS results in the top

rows show mortality reductions which are significant at every duration, and the magnitude grows

with duration along with the sample mean. In contrast, the 2SLS results show significant increases

in mortality at one day, which become reductions over time and are only significant by 30 days.

These findings are inconsistent with the notion that the main results simply reflect differences in

pre-hospital care. To the converse, it appears that the hospitals to which individuals are (effec-

tively) randomly assigned appear to undertake actions which raise mortality in the short run, but

reduce it in the longer run. Indeed, when we classify procedures by their 1-day mortality rate, we

find expensive hospitals are more likely to perform procedures with high 1-day mortality rates.10

Moreover, the longer-term mortality reductions do not fade out but continue to have important

mortality impacts even at 2 years, although part of the longer-run effects could be due to ongoing

care in the subsequent period rather than the effects of the initial hospital stay.
  10
     To characterize procedures, the 1-day mortality rate was calculated for all 3-digit principal procedures with at
least 30 observations, a mean of 5.5/1000. Using our IV strategy, a two-standard deviation increase in the hospital
cost measure was associated with a 1.99/1000 increase in this principal-procedure mortality rate (p < 0.001).




                                                         22
   Table 5 reports robustness checks of our findings along several other dimensions. The first panel

shows sizeable effects across different age groups. The next set examines the impact of ZIP code

heterogeneity on our findings. When we consider the standard deviation of income in the ZIP

code, the results are largest in the 2nd and 3rd quartile of this measure. Meanwhile, the effects are

remarkably stable across ZIP codes that vary according to racial concentration. This is inconsistent

with the notion that ZIP code heterogeneity is driving our results through patient/ambulance co-

location within a ZIP code. Last, the smallest geographic unit in our data is the ZIP code, and

we find a negative cost-mortality relationship across ZIP codes of different sizes: the largest effects

are found in the 2nd and 3rd quartiles of this measure. Again, the effects are not monotonically

related to ZIP code size in a way that would suggest systematic confounding variation.

   Appendix Table A2 reports further robustness checks. Results were similar when we restricted

the sample to: ambulance transports labeled “emergency,” patients who were transported from

home or a nursing home, patients transported in ALS ambulances, and patients who were not

transferred to another inpatient facility. Results were also similar when we varied the instrument

calculation to exclude the patient’s ZIP code rather than the patient, and when we used hospi-

tal charges rather than those charges deflated by a cost-to-charge ratio. Overall, the result is

remarkably consistent to all of these changes.



VI     Border Results for New York State

Balance

In this section, we turn to the second empirical strategy, relying on comparisons of individuals

living in close proximity but on either side of ambulance dispatch area borders in New York State.

Once again, we begin by showing that these samples are similar in terms of observed characteristics.

In Table 6 we divide each pair of census block groups in New York into those on the low-cost side

of an ambulance border, and those on the high-cost side. We find about an 11 log point difference

in hospital cost, on average, between these two groups. The remaining rows again show relatively

well-balanced compositions of the groups in terms of our control variables. The largest difference is



                                                  23
the distance from the patient’s home census block to the hospital, with a 0.25 mile shorter distance

for patients on the high-cost side. This difference fades away, however, and is not seen in the sample

of patients within 5 miles of a boundary.

    Since we are comparing different areas, we can also now consider differences in characteristics

of the block groups in which they reside. In the final rows of Table 6, we find that block groups

on adjacent sides of these borders are similar in terms of characteristics such as income, share

owner-occupied housing, and share urban.


Basic Results

Patients are more likely to attend a hospital in their district. Specifically, for patients with a

hospital located in their district: 72% of patients living within one mile of a district border are

treated at a hospital in their district, and this rate increases to 75% and 78% for those living within

2 and 5 miles of a border, respectively. This is borne out in the first-stage relationship reported in

Table 7. The point estimates range between 0.64 and 0.74, with F-statistics that range from 12.8

to 18.1.

    Table 7 also reports the OLS and 2SLS results. One salient difference between the New York

results and those for the national sample is that in our New York State sample we find that the

OLS results for mortality are much more sensitive to controls. These findings indicate substantial

selection bias in OLS when the models only control for year indicators: the coefficient on hospital

costs becomes much more negative as we add controls.

    As with the national sample, however, the results grow and stabilize when we use our 2SLS

approach. Using the border strategy, we find that a 10% increase in costs is associated with lower

mortality ranging from 0.47 to 0.54 percentage points, or about 2.0-2.3% of baseline mortality

rate, depending on the sample.11 This result implies a two standard deviation increase in average

hospital costs is associated with a 4.1-4.5 percentage point reduction in mortality, or 17-19% of

the baseline mortality rate.12 These results reinforce our findings from the ambulance company
  11
     The mortality rate in this sample is lower than in the Medicare analysis, as this sample is composed of all
emergency room admissions rather than ambulance transports.
  12
     The standard deviation of mean hospital log(costs) is equal to 0.415, 0.432 and 0.447 for the one-mile, two-mile
and five-mile samples, respectively.

preference strategy, as we again find compelling evidence that higher-cost hospitals have lower

mortality for emergency admissions.


Extensions

We undertake two extensions with our New York sample. First, in Table A3, we show the impact

of varying mortality horizons. Consistent with the OLS results from the ambulance preference

strategy, the OLS results in the first panel show mortality reductions that grow with duration for

all three distance samples. In contrast, point estimates for the 2SLS results show no change in

mortality at one day for patients. Over time, however, we find that for all of our distance samples,

reductions in mortality are significant for the 30-day mortality measure. Although the New York

data do not include information that allows us to control for pre-hospital factors (as was done with

the Medicare data), this pattern of results is again inconsistent with the notion that our results are

driven by differences in pre-hospital care which would likely be found most strongly at the shortest

mortality horizons.

    Second, one important extension that is available in New York is our ability to look at the

impacts of hospital costs on the non-elderly. To do so, we replicate our existing strategy for the

non-elderly sample, focusing the non-elderly, ages 18-64, and the “near elderly,” ages 50-64 (see

Appendix Tables A4 and A5). For both samples, we restrict analysis to the same non-deferrable

conditions analyzed in the Medicare sample. We find similar first-stage estimates in these samples,

and the OLS results are again sensitive to controls. In contrast to the results for the elderly, we find

no statistically significant impacts on mortality using 2SLS. As with the elderly, however, point

estimates for the 2SLS results are roughly twice as large in magnitude relative to the OLS estimates.

In addition, the point estimates imply a substantial mortality-cost relationship. For both groups, a

two standard-deviation increase in hospital costs is associated with a 15-30% reduction in mortality

compared to the sample mean mortality rate, magnitudes which are within the range of the New

York Medicare sample.13
  13
     For the nonelderly, a 2 standard deviation increase in costs (std. dev=0.42) is associated with a 0.9 to 1.6
percentage point reduction in mortality, or 15-30% of the sample mortality of 5.4%. Meanwhile, a two-standard
deviation increase in costs for the near elderly (std. dev=0.43) is associated with a 1 to 1.5 percentage point
reduction in mortality, or 18-28% of the sample mortality of 8.2%.

VII          Interpretation

“Unbundling” the Cost Results

Our analysis thus far has considered hospital costs as a summary measure of hospital characteristics

that might drive patient outcomes. But hospital costs may proxy for a “bundle” of hospital char-

acteristics that are correlated with costs. As we move from carefully documenting that hospitals

matter to understanding why they matter, it is important to begin to unbundle these findings.

       Of course, any other hospital characteristic that we relate to outcomes is potentially endogenous

due to patient selection, as is the case with average hospital cost. But we can use the same Medicare

ambulance preference strategy used for costs to instrument for these measures as well; for example,

we can effectively compare patients who are picked up by ambulances that prefer teaching hospitals

to ones that prefer non-teaching hospitals. In this way, we can provide selection-free estimates of the

impacts of these alternative quality measures. And, by including the instrumented quality measures

in the same regression as our instrumented cost regression, we can effectively run a “horse race”

to see if controlling for other quality measures drives out the cost result. Unfortunately, given the

more limited variation available in the New York data, we are unable to replicate this analysis on

that sample as well.

       In theory, there is a very large set of hospital characteristics that we could relate to outcomes.

We choose to focus on three sets of measures for this analysis. The first set of measures aims to

capture “leading edge” hospitals which should be at the forefront of patient treatment and therefore

might be both higher cost and have higher quality physical and human capital. The second measure

is an independent measure of quality based on the rate at which hospitals provide best-practice care.

The third measure focuses on a quantity measure of intensity rather than costs, which combines

variation in price and quantity.

       We use two indicators to characterize hospitals as “leading edge.” The first is teaching hospital

status. Our main measure includes hospitals that are recognized as teaching hospitals by the

American Medical Association, although results are similar when we use alternative definitions.14
  14
    Appendix Table A2 reports results for the more selective definition of hospitals that are members of the Council
of Teaching Hospitals, which represents 30% of our sample admissions.



                                                        26
41% of the patients in our sample are treated in a teaching hospital. Second, we define “high-

tech” hospitals using a technology-frontier index we constructed using hospital survey data from

the American Hospital Association (AHA). Values for this index were defined by identifying new

questions in each year’s AHA hospital survey between 1995 and 2008. For example, beginning in

2004 the AHA began asking whether hospitals had the capability to deliver shaped beam radiation

therapy, a technology that precisely targets radiation at tumors and legions. The addition of such

a question would be considered a “new” technology in our measure. For our 2002-2008 data we

allowed a “burn-in” period of 7 years from 1995 to 2001 to construct a base set of new technologies,

and then beginning in 2002 ranked hospitals based on the number new technologies they had in

each year. We identified “high-tech” hospitals as those in the top decile of this measure in a given

year, and hospital rankings are similar when we used alternative measures, such as a rolling five-

year average of the ranking. This measure is somewhat more selective than the teaching hospital

definition, with 30% of patients treated in these high-tech hospitals. Table A6 shows that both

teaching and high-tech hospitals are positively correlated with average hospital costs, with teaching

hospitals associated with hospital log costs that are 8 points higher than non-teaching hospitals,

and high-tech hospitals associated with 12 log point higher costs.

   The second hospital characteristic is an independent quality measure of the type endorsed by

CMS. This is a procedural quality score that measures the rate at which best practices are employed

for heart failure, heart attack, and pneumonia patients. In particular, the CMS quality score for

2005 is used to characterize the hospitals, and it is standardized to have mean zero and standard

deviation of one. Procedural quality measures have been shown to be negatively correlated with

treatment intensity at the area level (Baicker and Chandra 2004) and shown to be positively

correlated with survival gains for heart attack patients during the 1980s and early 1990s (Skinner

et al. 2006). In addition, Skinner and Staiger (2009) show that hospitals that were early adopters of

these best practices appear to have positive returns to spending. Table A6 shows that this quality

score is relatively unrelated to hospital costs in this sample.

   The results for different hospital types are shown in Table 8. The top panel shows the OLS

results, first including each measure separately, and then including each alternative measure along



                                                  27
with hospital costs in the same model. We find that each of the alternative measures is significantly

negatively associated with mortality, although the size of the coefficient on the CMS quality score is

quite small. Meanwhile, teaching and high-tech hospitals have conditional mortality rates that are

1 percentage point lower than other hospitals. When regressed together with hospital average costs,

the coefficient estimates for teaching and high-tech hospitals decline slightly but are qualitatively

similar. This slight decline is seen for hospital costs as well: controlling for these alternative

measures of quality does not dampen the estimated relationship between hospital cost and mortality.

In contrast, the CMS quality score coefficient is largely unchanged, but the point estimate on

hospital costs is lower and not significant at conventional levels. The main reason for the change

in the point estimate is the change in sample (the restriction to hospitals that are large enough to

report these measures).

   The second panel shows the same exercise using 2SLS to instrument for each of our quality mea-

sures, as well as hospital costs. The first stages for these models have larger coefficients compared

to hospital costs and are highly statistically significant (see Appendix Table A7). For teaching

hospitals and high-tech hospitals, we find that instrumenting significantly increases the point esti-

mates, suggesting that the OLS results are indeed biased downwards (in absolute value) by patient

selection. We find that going to a teaching hospital (due to ambulance preferences) lowers mor-

tality by 3.9 percentage points, which is over 10% of baseline mortality. The effect is even larger

for being brought to a high-tech hospital: 4.7 percentage points. For hospitals’ procedural quality

score, however, the coefficient continues to be small: a two standard deviation increase in this score

is associated with a 1 percentage-point reduction in mortality, and the result is not statistically

significant.

   Most importantly for our analysis, we once again find that the effects of hospital costs on patient

outcomes are not reduced by including these other quality measures in the regression. Moreover,

in the 2SLS case, focusing on hospitals with quality scores and controlling for these scores leads

to a point estimate that is larger in magnitude (-0.218). We conclude that higher-cost hospitals

appear to improve outcomes above and beyond the effects of being a high-quality hospital along

these dimensions.



                                                 28
       Finally, we consider the decomposition of our cost measure into its price and quantity compo-

nents. As a proxy for quantity, we compute for each patient the number of procedures performed

during his stay. We then measure the average number of procedures at the hospital (excluding the

patient himself). This averages 1.33 with a standard deviation of 0.58.

       Table 9 shows that more procedures are negatively correlated with 1-year mortality in the OLS

regressions, but the 2SLS coefficient is significantly larger: -0.161.15 This implies that a two-

standard deviation increase in this treatment-intensity measure is associated with an 18 percentage

point reduction in mortality. Next, we attempt to decompose the cost result by including aver-

age costs and average number of procedures in the same model. The coefficient on the quantity

measure declines only slightly, but the coefficient on average costs decreases by more than half to

-0.065 compared to -0.144 in the main results. These results suggest that much of the difference

in mortality at high-cost hospitals stems from larger quantities of care provided. Costs remain

significant, suggesting a remaining effect of spending above and beyond our proxy for quantity, but

quantities are substantively more important.


Diminishing Returns

The main results show that higher-cost hospitals are associated with lower one-year mortality,

but the point estimate may mask heterogeneity across the distribution of hospital costs. Our

methodology with a continuous treatment measure (hospital costs) provides a setting where local

instrumental variable techniques can be employed to estimate effects at different levels of hospital

costs (Heckman and Vytlacil 2005, Florens et al. 2008).

       These results can be shown in figures. Figure 2A reports average hospital costs for each per-

centile of the instrumental variable: hospital log costs averaged at the ambulance company level.

These variables were first regressed on ZIP code and year fixed effects to focus on the identifying

variation, and the residuals were then re-centered at the mean value. Figure 2A shows that these

hospital cost residuals are positively correlated (and fairly linear) with respect to average costs at

the ambulance-company level.
  15
    See Table A7 and Appendix Figure A1 for the first-stage relationship, which continues to be economically and
statistically significant for the procedure measure.


                                                      29
       Figure 2B shows the relationship between 1-year mortality and hospital costs. Again, these

variables have been residualized as in 2A. In addition, hospital costs along the x-axis are the

predicted value from a model of hospital costs on the instrument. Essentially, the x-axis here is

the y-axis from Figure 2A. As implied by Figure 2B, there is a downward-sloping portion until the

top percentiles. The estimates are from a local-quadratic regression, the preferred estimator when

the derivative is sought. Figure 2C reports the local IV estimates, which are simply the derivative

estimates from Figure 2B, evaluated at each percentile of hospital costs. Return estimates are very

large at the least-costly hospitals. The bulk of the data continue to suggest smaller returns as

hospital costs increase. The point estimate is zero at the 83rd percentile, after which higher costs

are actually associated with worse outcomes, with point estimates statistically significantly less

than zero for up to the 76th percentile. While the hospitals at either end of the distribution may

be outliers for a variety of reasons, the results suggest that for all but the highest cost hospitals

there are positive but diminishing returns to spending.16



VIII         Conclusions and Implications

Given the high and rising costs of health care in the U.S., with the attendant pressures on public

and private budgets, there has been great interest among policy makers in developing strategies

for “bending the cost curve” and lowering the ultimate share of GDP which will be consumed by

health care. A wide variety of potential solutions have been posed to the cost control problem,

but none holds more promise than the notion of saving money by ending over-reimbursement for

inefficient treatments. The results of the Dartmouth analysis, and parallel findings for hospitals,

have been used to suggest that a sizeable share of hospital spending does little to improve patient

outcomes, and so could readily be cut without harming patient health. Our results do not disprove

that conclusion - but they should give policy makers some pause before assuming that spending

can be easily cut without harming patient health, at least in the context of emergency care.
  16
    One caveat is that the “compliers” may be different at different levels of the instrument, so the heterogeneity in
returns could represent the decline in effectiveness for any hospital and/or a change in effectiveness for patients who
are treated differently at the highest-cost hospitals compared to patients who are treated in just slightly less costly
hospitals.




                                                          30
   In particular, using exogenous ambulance assignment to control for the endogeneity of patient

hospital choice, our results suggest that high-cost hospitals have better outcomes: 20-30% lower

mortality compared to low-cost hospitals. Other summary measures of hospital quality again

suggest that hospital choice matters: teaching hospitals and hospitals that are early adopters of

new technologies have lower mortality when similar patients are compared. Interestingly, even

controlling for teaching status or capital quality, high-cost hospitals have lower mortality. We rule

out many alternative explanations for this finding, and show that it is robust to two different

identification strategies.

   As with previous studies of this relationship, it is not possible to conclude that the treatment

intensity-mortality relationship reflects the effects of higher-cost inputs. Other aspects of the hos-

pital, such as physician or staff quality measures beyond those considered here, may be correlated

with overall costs and may achieve similar results with smaller budgets. To address that question,

a plausibly exogenous within-hospital source of spending variation would need to be found. The

fact that our spending results persist when we condition on other summary measures of hospital

quality suggests that treatment intensity itself may be driving the improved outcomes. It would

be particularly useful to extend this analysis to the non-emergent population, to assess whether

spending is productive for that group as well.

                 •   When a voluntary hospital ambulance picks up a patient in the zip code
                     area of an HHC hospital, it is far more likely than the Fire Department to
                     bring the patient back to the specific voluntary hospital that sponsors
                     that ambulance.

     Note: Panel A reports the first-stage relationship between ambulance-company hospital log cost and hospital log cost. Panel B reports local quadratic regression estimates
     of 1-year mortality on predicted hospital log cost, where the prediction was from a model of hospital costs on ambulance-company hospital log cost as described in the text.
     All variables were first residualized using models with ZIP code and year fixed effects. Each point represents the mean at each percentile of the x-axis variable, and the
     lines represent local-linear regression estimates in Panel A and local quadratic estimates in Panel B. Panel C reports the first derivative of the relationship found in Panel
     B. Dotted lines represent bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals. Pilot bandwidth: h=0.02.

     Note: The full sample includes the top 100 3-digit ICD-9-CM diagnoses among emergency room (ER) admissions, which compres 89% of all such admissions. Distance from
     ZIP to the hospital was calculated for the 50 closest hospitals, and the number of observations for distance in the full sample is 2,563,145. The nondeferrable sample includes
     diagnoses most likely to require immediate medical care, as described in the text. The number of observations for distance in this sample is 1,128,411. The ambulance
     sample includes measures of ambulance inputs, some of which are only available for data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid’s Carrier file, as opposed to outpatient
     reimbursement. These include ambulance distance, which is available for 693,376 observations. The analysis sample excludes observations that are not linked to a hospital
     service area (HSA), patients who were treated more than 50 miles from the ZIP code of their mailing address, patients with missing cost information, and a minumum of
     10 observations in the analysis sample for each ZIP code, hospital, and ambulance company.

     Note: Panel A reports the first-stage relationship between ambulance-company hospital (average number of) procedures and hospital (average number of) procedures. Panel
     B reports local quadratic regression estimates of 1-year mortality on predicted hospital (average number of) procedures, where the prediction was from a model of hospital
     procedures on ambulance-hospital procedures as described in the text. All variables were first residualized using models with ZIP code and year fixed effects. Each point




A7
     represents the mean at each percentile of the x-axis variable, and the lines represent local-linear regression estimates in Panel A and local quadratic estimates in Panel B.
     Panel C reports the first derivative of the relationship found in Panel B. Dotted lines represent bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals. Pilot bandwidth: h=0.02.
