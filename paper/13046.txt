Cigarette Taxes and Youth Smoking: New Evidence from National, State, & Local Youth
Risk Behavior Surveys

NBER Working Paper No. 13046
April 2007
JEL No. I1

                                            ABSTRACT

Several studies have examined the effects of state cigarette tax increases on youth substance use over
the 1990s, with most -- but not all -- finding that higher taxes reduce youth consumption of tobacco.
We advance the literature by using data from the 1991-2005 waves of the national Youth Risk Behavior
Surveys (YRBS), providing information on over 100,000 high school age youths. We also are the
first to make use of hundreds of independently fielded state and local versions of the YRBS, reflecting
data from over 750,000 youths. Importantly, these data are to our knowledge the only sources of relevant
information on youth smoking that were explicitly designed to be representative of the sampled state
or locality. We estimate two-way fixed effects models of the effect of state cigarette taxes on youth
smoking, controlling for survey demographics and area and year fixed effects. Our most consistent
finding is that -- contrary to some recent research -- the large state tobacco tax increases of the past
15 years were associated with significant reductions in smoking participation and frequent smoking
by youths. Our price elasticity estimates for smoking participation by high school youths are generally
smaller than previous cross-sectional approaches but are similar to recent quasi-experimental estimates.

1. Introduction

Voters in the state of California recently rejected the largest potential tobacco tax

increase in history: a 13 cent tax increase per cigarette, or a $2.60 increase in the tax on a

pack of 20 cigarettes. Television ads in support of “Prop 86” indicated that the new tax

would “reduce teen smoking by 43 percent.” The magnitude of this figure reflects the

conventional wisdom in research and policy circles that the smoking behaviors of youths

and young adults are highly sensitive to price, more so than for adults who as a group

may have better established habits.

       Despite this conventional wisdom, however, a series of recent studies in the

economics literature has called into question whether higher cigarette taxes will “put out

the fires”. Using panel data on youths from the National Educational Longitudinal Study

(NELS), DeCicca et al. (2002) find that once time-invariant state fixed effects are

accounted for, youth smoking initiation is statistically unrelated to cigarette taxes. More

recently, DeCicca et al. (2004, 2006) argue that the strong negative cross sectional

association between cigarette taxes and youth smoking may be more properly attributable

to cross-state differences in previously unobserved state anti-smoking sentiment. Using

novel data on adult attitudes about smoking, DeCicca et al. (2006) create state-specific

measures of anti-smoking attitudes; once they account for this anti-smoking variable in

the cross section, the negative price coefficient becomes small and statistically

insignificant.

       These recent findings stand in contrast to a body of research that has found teens

to be responsive to the price of cigarettes, usually proxied by state excise taxes. Much of

the earlier work on this topic used cross-section data and found a negative relationship




2
between youth smoking and state-specific prices and taxes (Lewit, Coate and Grossman

1981, Chaloupka and Grossman 1996, Harris and Chan 1999, and others). Importantly,

however, this relationship has also been found in studies that use quasi-experimental

methods. These types of approaches include state fixed effects as an alternative way to

account for factors that are typically unobserved (such as anti-smoking sentiment). In

this approach, within state changes in prices or taxes rather than interstate differences

identify the teen smoking effect. Significant tax responsiveness using this approach has

been estimated for: 1) teen mothers (Gruber 2000, Ringel and Evans 2001, and others); 2)

high school seniors (Dee 1999, Gruber and Zinman 2001, and others); and 3) young

adults age 18-20 (Sloan and Trogdon 2004). These quasi-experimental studies, however,

return estimates of the tax responsiveness of teen smoking that differ with time period

and sample and are not always significant.1

       In this paper we provide new evidence on the effects of state cigarette taxes on the

consumption of cigarettes by high school teens. Specifically, we use repeated cross

section data from the national, state, and local Youth Risk Behavior Surveys over the

period 1991-2005. Our econometric methods are straightforward and involve regression-

adjusted difference-in-differences estimation for all data sources, controlling for cigarette

taxes, demographics, clean indoor air laws, and area and year fixed effects. This

approach effectively compares the change in outcomes for youths in states that increased

their cigarette tax to the associated change in outcomes for youths in states that did not



1
  Gruber (2000), for example, does not find younger teens to be responsive to prices,
while Dee (1999) finds tax responsiveness only in the latter half of his sample period.
Ringel and Evans (2001) find teen mothers to be least responsive to cigarette tax hikes
(relative to older mothers), while Sloan and Trogdon (2004) find significant
responsiveness for 18-20 year olds but not 21-24 year olds.


3
experience a tax increase in that year. Across all of our data sources, we find statistically

significant evidence that higher cigarette taxes reduce youth smoking participation and

frequent smoking. Our separate analyses of the national, state, and local YRBS data

suggest that a one-dollar increase in the tax per pack would reduce smoking participation

by 3-6 percentage points, or about 10-20 percent. These estimates translate into price

elasticities of smoking participation for high school youths in the range -.23 to -.56,

which are slightly lower than most previous cross-sectional estimates but very similar to

other recent quasi-experimental approaches.

       Our research makes several contributions to the literature. First, we extend

previous national YRBS analyses (which have only used data through 1997) by making

use of data through 2005, the most recent year of the biennial survey. Using these more

recent data allows us to consider over twice as many cigarette tax increases as in previous

research using the national YRBS. Moreover, many of these tax hikes in the period

following the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) between US states and the

major cigarette companies were quite large. Few quasi-experimental studies have

examined tax responsiveness in the post-MSA era (Sloan and Trogdon (2004) and Tauras

et al. (2005) are important exceptions).

       Second, we provide new estimates from hundreds of state and local versions of

the YRBS coordinated by state and local public health departments. Together these

surveys include over three quarters of a million high school students over the period

1993-2005. Specifically, we use published aggregate statistics from these data to

estimate weighted least squares models of youth substance use in a common quasi-

experimental framework. No previous research has used these data to estimate the tax




4
responsiveness of youth smoking. A major advantage of these data is that – unlike nearly

all of the youth survey data used previously to estimate the tax/smoking relationship

(including Monitoring the future (MTF), national Youth Risk Behavior Surveys (YRBS),

NELS, the National Household Surveys on Drug Abuse (NHSDA) and the National

Longitudinal Surveys of Youth 1997 (NLSY97)) – these state and local YRBS surveys

were explicitly designed to be representative of the sampled state or locality. As such,

we are able to provide suggestive evidence on the degree of bias from using non-

representative surveys – an oft-cited limitation of this literature.

       Finally, we provide new results on the importance of controlling for state anti-

smoking sentiment, as recently highlighted by DeCicca et al. (2006). Specifically, we

use YRBS data to replicate their main qualitative finding that the cross-sectional

association between cigarette taxes and youth smoking is reduced when we directly

control for state adult anti-smoking sentiment (which itself is strongly and inversely

related to youth smoking). Despite this, the tax estimate on youth smoking remains

negative and statistically significant even after controlling for anti-smoking sentiment in

the cross section. We also show inclusion of anti-smoking sentiment does not alter the

conclusions drawn from our preferred difference-in-differences models.

       The paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2 we outline the empirical challenges

facing researchers in this literature and describe a handful of studies that use quasi-

experimental methods to evaluate the effects of state cigarette taxes on youth smoking.

Section 3 presents the data and empirical approach, and Section 4 presents the results.

Section 5 offers a discussion and concludes.

2. Motivation, Empirical Challenges, and Literature Review

A review of the microeconometric literature relating state cigarette taxes to youth

smoking is beyond the scope of this paper; we direct readers to Chaloupka and Warner

(2000) for an excellent review. Briefly, however, we note that a critical issue in this

research area has been the difficulty in accounting for typically unobserved state anti-

smoking sentiment. The concern is that state cigarette taxes and other tobacco control

policies are likely to be correlated with preferences of individuals in those states. In a

typical cross section analysis, this problem will tend to attribute too much explanatory

power to taxes and tobacco control policies; even in the absence of a true “causal” effect

of taxes on youth smoking, for example, this unobserved state anti-smoking sentiment

might produce a spurious negative association between state taxes and youth smoking.

       To be certain, researchers have long recognized this fundamental omitted

variables bias problem, and a variety of approaches have been used to address these

concerns. Several studies in this literature, for example, attempt to proxy for unobserved

state anti-smoking sentiment by including controls for whether respondents live in

tobacco producing states – where anti-smoking sentiment is likely to be low. Another

common approach is to include a control for aggregate, overall cigarette consumption in

the state (either current or lagged), while other studies include controls for percent of

state residents that belong to various religions. To the extent that these variables capture

the previously unmeasured state anti-smoking sentiment, their inclusion should reduce

the severity of the bias on the tax and other policy coefficients in a model of youth

smoking.




6
       An alternative approach for dealing with state anti-smoking sentiment has been to

estimate models that include year and state fixed effects. The advantage of this approach

is that it removes any time-invariant characteristics about states that are likely to bias tax

coefficients in models of youth smoking.2 Indeed, to the extent that state anti-smoking

sentiment does not change over time, this approach unambiguously purges tax and other

policy estimates from the associated bias. Of course, there are a handful of issues related

to the feasibility of state fixed effects models. First, they require multiple observations

on states; one-time cross-sectional surveys cannot support inclusion of state dummies. A

second complication of the quasi-experimental approach is that – even with repeated

observations on states – the empirical set up requires variation in the variable of interest

within states over time (else the tax variable will be perfectly collinear with state

dummies). That is, the data must span a period witnessing state changes in excise taxes

on cigarettes or other changes in public policy toward youth smoking.3

       Several studies using this quasi-experimental method have found strong evidence

that youth smoking responds to tax changes. Ringel and Evans (2001) used smoking

information from birth certificate records for teen mothers over the period 1989-1995.

They found significant tax responsiveness of smoking participation among these young

mothers in state fixed effects models, though the estimated sensitivity for teens was not

greater than for older women. Dee (1999) used data from the Monitoring the Future

2
  This approach to estimating price effects on health-behavior choices was introduced by
Cook and Tauchen (1982) and has become standard in the econometric literature (Cook
2007).
3
  A common diagnostic used to evaluate the severity of this problem in the context of
cigarette taxes is to regress the tax on state and year dummies. In this auxiliary
regression, a high R-squared (upwards of .90) is usually viewed as problematic. Our data
spanning many tax changes largely avoids this problem: the R-squared from a regression
of taxes on state and year dummies in the 1991-2005 YRBS is just .70.


7
study over the 1977-1992 period to estimate effects of state cigarette taxes on youth

smoking and drinking participation. He found a robust own-price effect on smoking for

youths, but only in the latter part of the sample period. Gruber (2001) and Gruber and

Zinman (2000) pooled data from the first four waves of the national YRBS (1991-1997)

and estimated reduced form models of youth cigarette consumption as a function of

individual demographic characteristics, state excise taxes on cigarettes, and clean indoor

air laws. They found a modest tax effect on consumption that was confined to older

youths (high school seniors).4 Sloan and Trogdon (2004) used data from the Behavioral

Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) on adults over age 18 and found a significant

price response of smoking among young adults age 18-20 in models with state and year

fixed effects. Across a variety of samples, then, cigarette taxes have been shown to

significantly reduce teen smoking even in models with state fixed effects, though not for

every sample.

       Despite this body of evidence, the real effects of cigarette taxes on youth smoking

from quasi-experimental models have themselves been called into question by a series of

recent papers that have used longitudinal data on youths from the National Educational

Longitudinal Study (NELS:88). This skeptical view was initiated by DeCicca et al.

(2002), who estimated discrete time hazard models of youth smoking initiation,

controlling for state fixed effects, and found no association between state cigarette taxes

and youth smoking. DeCicca et al. (2004) again reported a null finding in their analysis

of NELS data; they used variation in effective cigarette prices faced by youths who



4
  Gruber (2001) and Gruber and Zinman (2000) did not find consistent effects of clean
indoor air policies on smoking participation, though there was some evidence that
government worksite restrictions reduced smoking intensity.


8
“moved” across state lines versus youths who “stayed” in a state as an alternative

identification strategy.

        Most recently, DeCicca et al. (2006) analyze two waves of the NELS (1992 and

2000), and report results that support the absence of a substantive association between

state cigarette taxes and youth smoking initiation. This paper takes a different and novel

approach to dealing with concerns about state anti-smoking sentiment. Using data on

adult attitudes about smoking from the Tobacco Use Supplements of the Current

Population Survey (CPS) over the 1990’s and a standard factor analysis technique, the

authors create a state-specific anti-smoking measure. This allows them to directly control

for a newly observed measure of state anti-smoking sentiment instead of including

alternative proxies such as aggregate cigarette production or “tobacco producing state”

indicators. They found that the strong cross-sectional negative association between

cigarette prices and youth smoking initiation was not robust to inclusion of this anti-

smoking sentiment measure. Equally important, all of the variation in youth smoking

“loaded onto” the anti-smoking sentiment measure, which was a statistically significant

predictor of youth smoking in the NELS cross section. DeCicca et al. (2006) interpret

this result and the continued failure of state fixed effects models to return significant

youth smoking effects in the NELS as evidence that cigarette taxes are not an effective

means to reduce youth smoking initiation.

        Thus it is fair to say that there is still no consensus on whether taxes have a true

causal effect on youth participation in smoking.

3. Research Design and Data Description

To estimate the effects of state cigarette tax increases on youth smoking and drinking, we

employ restricted use area-identified versions of the 1991-2005 national Youth Risk

Behavior Surveys (YRBS), in conjunction with the independent state and local versions

of the YRBS. The national surveys – which are distinct from the state and local surveys

and were not designed to be representative below the national level – are coordinated

every other year by the Centers for Disease Control and are administered to high school

students at school in the spring.5 The purpose of the YRBS is to monitor the prevalence

of youth behaviors that most influence health, including use of alcohol, tobacco, and

other drugs.

       These data provide standard demographic characteristics, information on a variety

of behaviors, and the state of survey (requested in a restricted use version of the data

directly through CDC). We restrict attention to youths with no missing data on the

demographic variables and key outcomes of interest (smoking in the past month),

yielding over 100,000 youths. These data have been used by economists in policy

evaluations similar to ours (e.g. Gruber and Zinman 2001). The YRBS data produce

estimates of past month smoking that closely track the trends from other commonly used

data on youths, such as the Monitoring the Future Study and the National Household

Surveys on Drug Abuse (Gruber 2000).

       Specifically, youths are asked: “During the past 30 days, on how many days did

you smoke cigarettes?” We create a variable called Smoker that equals 1 if the person

5
 In the 2005 national YRBS, for example, a probability sample of 203 schools was
selected from the universe of public and private schools with at least one of the grades 9-
12. One or two classrooms from each grade of each of these sample schools was
administered a questionnaire (MMWR 2006, p. 2).


10
reported any days of smoking and zero otherwise. We also consider an indicator variable

called Frequent Smoker that equals 1 if the person reported smoking on at least 20 days

in the past 30 and zero otherwise. We chose these outcome variables because they are

consistently reported for every state and local YRBS in the MMWR publications

(described below).6

       We use a straightforward two-way fixed-effects framework to estimate the effect

of state cigarette taxes on youth smoking in the national YRBS data. Specifically, we use

standard logit-regression model of the form:

(1)    ln (pist/1- pist) = β0 + β1Xist + β2(Cigarette Tax) st + β3Zst + β4State + β5Year + εist

where pist is the probability that the individual has smoked in the last month (or smoked

frequently in the last month). Xist is a vector of individual demographic characteristics,

including dummies for: female, black, other race, Hispanic, grade, and age. Z is a vector

that includes the state unemployment rate and indicators for clean indoor air laws in

venues likely to affect high school students.7 State is a vector of state dummies, and Year

is a vector of year dummies. Cigarette Tax is the state tax on a pack of cigarettes in 2005




6
  The MMWR publications do not report measures of smoking intensity other than the
frequent smoking outcome. Cigarettes smoked per day, for example, is not reported.
Similarly, smokeless tobacco use (snuff or chew) is not consistently reported for the state
or local data. Given that we are interested in comparing tax estimates on smoking across
the national, state, and local YRBS data, we focus attention on the outcomes consistently
reported across all data sources.
7
  We use venue coding from the Robert Wood Johnson’s ImpacTeen program.
Specifically, we control for restrictions in government worksites, schools, private
worksites, shopping malls, and restaurants. Examples of venues we exclude include child
care centers. Results are not sensitive to including other venues, and no venue-specific
restriction was consistently significant in the predicted direction. These null findings are
similar to those from Gruber and Zinman (2000).


11
dollars.8 The coefficient of interest, β2, captures the relative effect of state cigarette taxes

on youth smoking by comparing within area increases in state cigarette taxes to the

associated outcomes for youths in states that did not experience a cigarette tax increase in

that year. Standard errors are clustered at the state level throughout (Bertrand, Duflo, and

Mullainathan 2004).

        In addition to the national YRBS, we also make use of aggregate statistics from

the state and local YRBS. These surveys are coordinated by public health officials in the

respective states and include standard questions that reproduce those in the national

survey. As described above, an important feature of these data is that the majority of the

state and local efforts were explicitly designed to be representative of the state or locality

in question. To our knowledge, these weighted state and local surveys are the only

consistent state/year panel of representative data on smoking among high school students.

The coverage of state surveys is extensive (see Appendix Table 5), while the local YRBS

modules are generally concentrated in large urban centers such as Los Angeles, New

York City, Boston, and Chicago (see Appendix Table 6 for a complete list). The state

and local YRBS are fielded every other year, and the aggregate estimates of the health

outcomes based on the underlying microdata are published in Morbidity and Mortality

Weekly Report. Included in each report are various characteristics for each site.

Specifically, we observe: the relevant sample size on which the estimates are based;

8
  These data come from The Tax Burden on Tobacco and the Campaign for Tobacco Free
Kids. We use the tax in effect as of March of the survey year (i.e. the current tax). Note
that we ignore the fact that a handful of localities also impose cigarette taxes. We are not
aware of a consistent state/year panel of local cigarette taxes, and previous research
similarly does not control for local taxes. We also estimated models that included
controls for the square of the cigarette tax in addition to the tax itself. The cigarette tax
estimate was large, negative, and statistically significant while the coefficient on the
squared tax was smaller and statistically insignificant.

whether the survey was unweighted or weighted to be representative; the overall, student,

and school response rates; the fraction of the school population that is white, black, other

race, and Hispanic; the fraction of the population that is in each grade (9-12); and various

aggregate outcomes with respect to substance use.

        For our state and local YRBS analyses, we estimate separate weighted least

squares models where the weights are the relevant sample sizes of the surveys on which

the substance use rates are based. In particular, we estimate the following OLS

regressions:

(2)     ln(Yat /1- Yat)= β0 + β1Xat + β2(Cigarette Tax) at + β3Zat + β4Area + β5Year + εat

where a denotes area (city or state) and t denotes survey year. Since we only observe the

aggregate outcomes reported in the MMWR publications, Yat is the fraction of the sample

reporting the behavior in question (smoking or frequent smoking). Xat is a vector of

sample characteristics that includes: overall response rate, school response rate, student

response rate, percent grade 10, percent grade 11, percent grade 12, percent black,

percent other race, and percent Hispanic. The variables in Z are as described above.

Area is a vector of either state dummies or city dummies, depending on the dataset. Year

is a vector of survey year dummies. β2 is again the coefficient of interest, and standard

errors are clustered at the state level.

        Appendix Tables 4 – 6 present the state/year and city/year combinations for which

we have national, state, and local YRBS data, respectively. We also shade the area/year

combinations in which a state increased its excise tax on cigarettes to illustrate the extent




13
of within-place variation over our sample period.9 Several patterns merit discussion.

First, the national and state YRBS surveys have a wide but far from complete coverage of

states. Second, there are numerous state policy experiments with respect to excise tax

increases that we can examine in these data. Third, the more recent data – since 1999, for

example – contains more data points and more policy experiments than the earlier 1991-

1997 data analyzed by previous research.



4. Results

We present descriptive statistics for the national, state, and local YRBS in Tables 1a and

1b. The national YRBS data suggest that over the entire period almost 30 percent of high

school youths smoked cigarettes in the past month, and 13 percent smoked on at least 20

of the previous 30 days. The state YRBS surveys produce similar rates of past month

smoking (Table 1b) but the local YRBS produce lower estimates. This difference likely

reflects the fact that the local surveys were concentrated in urban areas; only 19 percent

of the local samples are white students, for example. As such, the lower rates in the local

YRBS data are explained by the well-documented lower rates of teen smoking by non-

white youths. Table 1b also illustrates the key advantage of these local and state surveys:

the vast majority were explicitly designed to be representative (88 and 79 percent,

respectively).

9
  Note that because the surveys are administered at schools in the Spring, we are not able
to use all of the policy changes shaded in the Tables. If a state changed its excise tax in
the fall, for example, we highlight it in the Tables but any data observed in that year is
coded as being from the “pre” tax period. In all cases, we assume the surveys were
administered in March of the survey year. Individual discussions with survey
administrators and the CDC highlighted that while there is no way to verify when surveys
were administered, February and March are common months for administration of the
YRBS.


14
       Table 2 presents the baseline cross-section and quasi-experimental estimates for

the outcome indicating any smoking in the past month from the national, state, and local

YRBS data. Across all three data sources we find consistent evidence that state excise

taxes on cigarettes are negatively related to youth smoking participation. Importantly, we

find that the difference-in-differences estimates (based on regressions with fixed effects

included) are somewhat smaller than the “cross section” estimates without fixed effects,

consistent with the idea that the cross section estimates are biased because unobserved

state characteristics are correlated with cigarette taxes and smoking outcomes. Even after

accounting for time-invariant area characteristics, however, we find across all three data

sources that increases in state cigarette taxes significantly reduce youth smoking

participation. Appendix Table 1 presents detailed coefficients on the control variables in

the smoking participation model using the national YRBS data.10

       In Table 3 we present the estimates from the frequent smoking outcome (defined

as smoking on at least 20 of the past 30 days). The format of Table 3 mirrors that of

Table 2, with similar coefficient estimates (although in this case the inclusion of fixed



10
   We also estimated models separately by race in the national YRBS data (the only
source for which we have the microdata on race). Tax estimates for white youths were
slightly larger than the baseline estimates and statistically distinguishable from zero. Tax
estimates for nonwhite youths were negative, smaller than the baseline, and not
statistically significant (we could not rule out either large tax responsiveness or no tax
responsiveness). We also considered models separately before and after the Master
Settlement Agreement in 1998. The pre-MSA analysis on the national YRBS data
essentially mirrored Gruber’s (2001) finding: taxes were negatively related to youth
smoking, but the estimates were not significant in the full sample. The post-MSA
observations returned imprecisely estimated null tax estimates in the national data. We
also performed this same exercise on the state YRBS data and obtained the opposite
pattern: the pre-MSA tax coefficient (using only 1993, 1995, and 1997 observations) was
an imprecisely estimated zero, while the post-MSA tax coefficient was large and
negative. We therefore view the investigation into pre/post MSA differences in tax
responsiveness as inconclusive.


15
effects results in larger coefficients in two of three cases). To translate the point

estimates from the logit regressions into something more intuitive, we compute the point

estimate for change in probability of smoking (or frequent smoking) using as the baseline

the mean smoking rates over the sample period from the national YRBS (29.5% for

smoking participation and 13.5% for frequent smoking). We provide point estimates

based on the high and low estimates of responsiveness from the regression results. In

sum, a $1.00 increase in tax would reduce smoking prevalence from 29.5% to 26.8%

(state surveys data) or 23.6% (national survey). In other words, the reduction would be

2.7 – 5.9 percentage points. From the baseline of 29.5%, this is a reduction of about 9 –

Similarly, the reduction in the prevalence of frequent smoking ranges from 2.4 to 4.1

percentage points, which is about 18 – 30% of the sample mean (13.5%).

       Note that “frequent smoking” is the only measure of smoking intensity that is

available for all three sets of YRBS surveys, and that is why we focus on this measure.

The national survey, but not the state and city surveys, also includes an item on number

of cigarettes smoked in the last month. Appendix Table 1 reports the results of regressing

that measure (in log form) on the same specification as reported in Tables 2 and 3. The


16
coefficient estimate for the tax rate is essentially zero. Since the sample for that

regression is restricted to smokers, this result implies that those youths who continue to

smoke when taxes are raised smoke the same amount on average as the larger group who

smoked at the previous (lower) tax rate. One interpretation is that tax has no effect on the

intensive margin for smokers. Another interpretation is that the “zero” effect is the result

of two processes that tend to cancel out – those who quit in response to higher taxes tend

to be the lighter smokers (thus raising the average of those who continue), and those who

continue smoking in fact smoke less than they otherwise would have.

       In Table 4 we provide some evidence on the sensitivity of our main smoking

estimates to the quantity and quality of the data. Recall that our analyses of state and

local YRBS data have thus far restricted attention to observations that are constructed to

be unbiased, in the sense that sample weights were used in computing the population

estimates. Table 4 reprints the state and local YRBS estimates from this restricted data

set, and also displays the results of including other state YRBS observations for which

population estimates are computed from survey results without weighting (creating a real

possibility of bias). In the state YRBS analysis, this is a sizable number of observations –

about 50, or over one quarter of the sample size when using weighted surveys only. For

the local YRBS analysis, the absolute discrepancy is smaller (14), but as a percentage of

the weighted surveys (14%), it is still substantial. The estimates in Table 4 suggest that

restricting attention to the weighted estimates for the state YRBS analysis has very little

effect on coefficient and standard error estimates.

        In Table 5 we explore the robustness of our main smoking results to inclusion of

direct controls for state anti-smoking sentiment. Recall that this approach was recently




17
used by DeCicca et al. (2006) as an alternative way to test for the strength of the cross-

sectional relationship between taxes and youth smoking, as well as to provide a

commentary on the ability of previous approaches to appropriately capture state anti-

smoking sentiment. We use the direct anti-smoking sentiment measures created by

DeCicca et al. to examine whether their main empirical result holds up in the YRBS.11

        The results of these exercises are presented in Table 5 for smoking participation.12

First, in Row 1 we report the cross-sectional results (without fixed effects) for the state

cigarette tax and anti-smoking sentiment. When entered by itself the tax coefficient is

significantly negative (as was shown previously in Table 2). The same is true when we

enter sentiment directly without controlling for the state cigarette tax. When we include

both measures in Column 3, we reproduce the main DeCicca et al. (2006) finding: the tax

coefficient becomes smaller, with much of the estimated variation “loading onto” the

sentiment measure. Notably, however, our tax estimate remains negative, sizable, and

statistically significant at the ten percent level. That is, using this alternative approach for

dealing with state anti-smoking sentiment, we continue to find evidence for a significant

role for state cigarette taxes.13 This finding is consistent both with a significant tax




11
   The anti-smoking sentiment measure is created from the 1992/93, 1995/96, 1998/99,
and 2000/2001 Tobacco Use Supplements to the Current Population Survey. This yields
direct measures of sentiment for 1993, 1995, 1999, and 2001 in our data. In private
correspondence with Don Kenkel (12/08/2006) we have obtained a complete state
specific anti-sentiment measure for all years of our sample (1991-2005) based on linear
interpolations from the years for which direct sentiment values are observed. Models that
restricted attention only to those years for which the sentiment variable is directly
observed produced similar results.
12
   Models for frequent smoking produced similar results and are not presented here to
conserve space.

   The coefficient estimate suggests that a one dollar increase in cigarette taxes would
reduce youth smoking participation by 2.8 percentage points.


18
responsiveness of youth smoking and with the claim that failing to account for

unobserved anti-smoking sentiment overstates the magnitude of this relationship.

        In Row 2 of Table 5 we further explore this issue by presenting the associated

difference-in-differences estimates of youth smoking in models that do and do not control

for the state sentiment measure. Note here that there is very little within state variation in

state anti-smoking sentiment once state dummies are included in the model; as such, this

exercise is not intended to be a “test” of sentiment but rather a comment on the sensitivity

of the tax estimate to inclusion of sentiment in a model that includes state dummies. We

again find that in models that include state and year dummies, taxes and sentiment

entered separately are both negatively related to youth smoking (recall that higher values

of the sentiment measure reflect more anti-smoking attitudes). We also find that the tax

estimate remains largely unchanged (i.e. it is still large, negative, and statistically

significant) once we account for state anti-smoking sentiment in the difference-in-

differences model. Finally, we note that although the standard errors on the sentiment

variable become much larger once we include state dummies (given their strong

collinearity), the point estimates are largely unchanged. That is, the limited within state

variation in sentiment that does exist continues to have a large estimated negative

relationship with youth smoking that is very similar to the cross-sectional estimate.

Again, we interpret the patterns in Table 5 as consistent both with a strong effect of

cigarette taxes on youth smoking and with the possibility that state anti-smoking

sentiment exerts independently meaningful effects on smoking outcomes.

        The fact that we find significant effects of the cigarette tax raises a natural

question: do these estimates reflect “real” price effects or are they confounded by other




19
changes that tended to occur at the same time and place as the tax increases?14 To

partially address the possibility that the tax change was linked in that sense to other

changes influencing health behaviors, we experimented with other items found in the

national YRBS. Reassuringly, we found that none of the following were statistically

related to cigarette tax increases: the likelihood of using cocaine in the past month and

the likelihood of carrying a weapon in the past month.15 (The results are not reported

here but are available upon request). Thus, the significant cigarette tax effects we

estimate for tobacco consumption are unlikely to be attributable to, say, coincident public

health campaigns.



5. Discussion and Conclusion

The results in Tables 2-5 indicate that state cigarette tax increases of the past 15 years

were effective at reducing smoking participation and frequent smoking by high school

students. Across our analyses of three distinct data sets, we find qualitatively similar

estimates: an increase in the state cigarette tax reduces the probability a youth reports past

30 day smoking and frequent smoking.

       A remaining issue is whether the magnitude of our estimated cigarette tax effects

seems reasonable. Recall that television advertisements for the proposed $2.60 cigarette

tax increase in California claimed that it would decrease teen smoking by 43 percent.

How does that compare with our estimates? If we use the mean of smoking participation

14
   It could be, for example, that states use the funds raised from cigarette taxes to promote
general public health initiatives. In that case, one may worry that a negative association
between state cigarette taxes and “bad” youth outcomes, even in the presence of state and
year dummies, is not reflecting the effects of changing tobacco consumption per se.
15
   We also found that the likelihood of using snuff or chew in the past month was
unrelated to cigarette taxes.


20
in the national YRBS data as a baseline (29%), then from the results in Table 2, the range

of point estimates following a $2.60 increase is from 13.6% (national survey) to 22%

(state surveys). The proportional reduction in the first case is 53%, even larger than the

ad claim, but the second estimate is just a 24% reduction. It seems fair to say that if the

advertising is to be faulted, it is for conveying a false sense of precision rather than for

exaggeration.

        An alternative and useful way to think about magnitudes in this context is to

compare the implied price elasticities from our national, state, and local YRBS analyses

to those from the previous literature. DeCicca et al. (2002) report from several sources

that the “consensus” estimate regarding the price elasticity of youth smoking was about -

0.7, which suggests that a 10 percent increase in the price of cigarettes would reduce

youth smoking by about 7 percent. Given a mean tax in our national YRBS sample of 52

cents, we estimate a tax elasticity of teen smoking to be -0.106. Calculating the price

elasticity implied by this estimate requires information on the pass through of state

cigarette taxes to prices as well as the fraction of the total price attributable to the tax.

The latter figure is directly calculable from our data using information on real prices from

the Tax Burden on Tobacco; over our sample taxes constitute about 17 percent of the

retail price. For the pass-through of taxes to prices we use an estimate from Keeler et al.

(1996) of 1.11; that is, a one dollar increase in taxes increases the average retail price by

one dollar and eleven cents. Using these estimates in conjunction with our estimated tax

elasticity from the national YRBS data suggests a price elasticity of -0.56, which is fairly

close to the “consensus” estimate of -0.7. Our state YRBS estimates, however, produce a

notably smaller tax elasticity estimate of -0.047; this translates to a teen price elasticity of




21
smoking participation of about -0.25.16 This estimate is very close to the estimate of -

0.27 reported in Sloan and Trogdon (2004) for 18-20 year olds, which also was derived

from a model with state and year fixed effects and included the post-MSA period.

       Several caveats and limitations are in order. Some of these are typical to studies

that use youth survey data to evaluate public policies regarding youth consumption of

harmful substances. For example, the YRBS surveys are administered to youths at

school. This procedure necessarily excludes youths absent from school on the survey

day, as well as high school dropouts. These missing youths may be more or less

responsive to cigarette prices than those who answered the survey. Whether our

estimates can be reliably extended to the entire population of high-school-aged youths is

unknown. Second, the YRBS substance use data are all self reported. This is an obvious

limitation to studies such as ours, and there is little we can do to correct for systematic

errors in reporting. Reporting errors will lead to bias in coefficient estimates if the under

reporting rate is systematically related to changes in state excise taxes.17

       It should also be noted that we have not specified the mechanisms by which an

increase in cigarette taxes affect youth smoking decisions. Most high-school students are

16
   The price elasticity estimate from the city/local YRBS data falls in between these
estimates at -0.49.
17
   Only about three percent of youths do not report information on smoking outcomes. In
an evaluation context we were most concerned that failure to report smoking behavior
may be correlated with cigarette tax changes. To evaluate this problem, we first
estimated a model where we related the likelihood of missing information on smoking
outcomes to the cigarette taxes; although the coefficient on the cigarette tax was positive,
it was very small and statistically insignificant. Specifically, we estimated that a one
dollar increase in the state cigarette tax would increase the probability of missing data on
smoking outcomes by .06 percentage points, or only about 2 percent. Moreover,
recoding all observations with missing information on smoking as past 30 day smokers
(i.e. making the extreme assumption that all non-responders are actually smokers) did not
change our main results: the tax coefficient in this model was very similar to the baseline
presented below and remained statistically significant at the five percent level.


22
too young to legally buy cigarettes, and most of them obtain their cigarettes from social

sources (friends and family). An increase in cigarette taxes may make potential sources

more reluctant to provide youths with cigarettes, or lead them to charge more. The

prevalence of smoking among friends and family may also be influential through social

contagion processes (Krauth 2005, Powell and Chaloupka 2005, and others), so that the

increase in taxes influences youth smoking indirectly by influencing the smoking rates in

their social environment. Perhaps the best interpretation of our results is that they reflect

a reduced form of direct and indirect influences on youth decisions. Regardless, these

results offer new support for the belief that raising cigarette taxes will help discourage

youths from smoking.

Note: All models include area and year fixed effect dummies.
Each coefficient estimate is from a different regression.
An “unbiased” observation is a weighted average of survey responses for a particular
year and state or city; the weights are computed to produce an unbiased estimate of the
population rate for that area and year.
All models are estimated using least squares, weighted by the sample size on which each
observation is based.
Controls in all models include the overall response rate, school response rate, student
response rate, percent grade 10, percent grade 11, percent grade 12, percent black,
percent other race, and percent Hispanic state unemployment rate and ImpacTeen Clean
