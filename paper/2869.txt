            DYNAMIC SEIGNIORAGE THEORY: AN EXPLORATION


                                ABS TRACT




      This paper shows that the optimal extraction of seigniorage

 implies a strong tendency for inflation to fall over time toward

its socially optimal level. The point is made using a multi-period

model in which (i) the government can finance deficits through

bond issue or money creation,
                                (ii) private-sector expectations are

rational, and (iii) the government sets the inflation rate each

period in a discretionary manner. One way to view the model i as

a synthesis of the "tax-smoothing"
                                      theory of government deficits,
which predicts that the inflation tax follows approximately a

martingale, and of models of discretionary
                                               policy making, which
predict (absent reputation effects) that inflation is likely to

exceed its socially optimal level. Both predictions are modified

when the two approaches to
                                 explaining inflation are merged.
Reputation effects play no role in the analysis.

 Introduction

      High inflation can arise when the seigniorage derived from

money creation plays a prominent role in the public finances.

Economic research of the l950s and 1960s elucidated the allocative

effects of steady-state, fully anticipated inflation- - the resource

transfer to the government and the associated welfare loss of

consumers. More     recent work has aimed to explain observed
inflation rates, and has proceeded along two main lines. The first

of these focuses on the temptation to effect the resource transfer

more efficiently through surprise inflation. The second adds a

dynamic dimension to the problem, exploring official incentives to

issue debt so as to spread over time the distortionary burden of

the inflation tax      It is convenient to call the first approach to

explaining inflation the discretionary-policy approach,           the

second the tax-smoothing approach.

     Calvo (1978a,b), Barro (1983), and others have observed that

when policy is made on a discretionary, period-by-period basis,

the lure of surprise price-level movements may, in equilibrium,

lead to higher inflation and lower revenue than would result if

the goverrunent could bind itself to a         prior choice of the
inflation rate. The incentive to violate such a commitment        in

later periods is an example of the general problem of time

inconsistency: optimal government plans that affect private

choices may no longer appear optimal after the private sector has

made those choices.'

'See Kydland and Prescott (1977) and Calvo (l978a,b). Seigniorage
is not, of course, the only mechanism through which government


                                   1
     While   the discretionary-policy approach     predicts   that

inflation will be higher than is socially optimal (absent possible

reputation effects), the tax-smoothing approach implies that
inflation, whatever its level today, will be persistent. Barro

(1979) suggested that an intertemporally maximizing     government

with exogenous spending needs would find it optimal to formulate

contingency plans for taxes that equate over all future periods

the expected marginal loss due to tax distortions.            This

"permanent-income" view of tax-setting behavior has been extended

to the inflation tax by Mankiw (1987), Grilli (1988a,b), and

others, who argue that, at least as an approximation, a country's

inflation rate should follow a martingale if seigniorage is the

main force driving inflation.

     A look at some data gives cause for skepticism about both

views of inflation- -at least in the simple forms paraphrased

above. Chart 1 shows the time series of annual inflation rates in

the United Kingdom and the United States between 1871 and 1986.2

In both countries, inflation shows occasional sharp upward spikes

(for example, during the two world wars), but there is no clear

credibility problems may cause suboptimally high inflation
(although it has been a key mechanism at some time in many
countries). Some studies, for example, Kydland and Prescott (1977)
and Barro and Gordon (1983), focus instead on attempts to exploit
short-run   tradeoffs   between   unanticipated    inflation   and
employment.
2A number of au.thors have made the point that fairly long time
series might be needed to detect the mean-reverting behavior
tested for below. Given this need, it seems best to use data from
countries, like the U.K. and the U.S., which have maintained
stable political institutions over a long sample period. Vittorto
Grilli generously provided the data plotted in chart 1.

evidence of persistently high inflation. Indeed, when examined

over a long time period, inflation apparently has a tendency to

revert to a fairly low mean level.

     These visual impressions are confirmed by the more formal

econometric tests reported in table 1. For both countries, the

favored univariate statistical model       for    inflation   is   a

first-order autoregression with an autoregressive coefficent a

that is positive, but well below unity.          [The Dickey-Fuller

criterion rejects decisively the hypothesis of a random walk (a

1.) in favor of a stationary alternative.] The implied steady-state

annual inflation rate for the U.K. is 3.5 percent; that for the

U.S. is 2.2 percent.3

     Does a tendency for inflation to revert to a low level imply

that discretionary policy-making and tax smoothing should be

rejected as elements in a positive theory of inflation taxation?

In this paper, I argue, to the contrary, that both concepts are

central to understanding the dynamic behavior of seigniorage

revenue and inflation. Existing models stressing the potential

3Mankiw (198]) finds that 1952-85 U.s. data lend some support to a
version of the tax-smoothing theory of inflation. This finding may
be due to the relatively low power of a short sample period,
or it may reflect sub-sample instability, which Barsky (1987)
suggests is present in long time series of U.S. inflation. Using a
broader country (and time) sample, Grilli (1988b) and Poterba and
Rotemberg (1988) find evidence against the tax-smoothing theory's
general validity. The evidence in chart 1 suports Fischer's (1986,
p. 14) observation that "Going further back in history, it is
clear that inflationary bias is only a sometime thing. At the ends
of the Napoleonic and Civil Wars, and World War I, Britain and the
United States deflated to get back to fixed gold parities. These
episodes too deserve attention in the dynamic inconsistency
literature."    Indeed,   the    generalized    industrial-country
disinflation of the early 1980s provides a more recent example,
albeit less dramatic, of the type of event Fischer describes.

1966-1986, it is the ratio of nominal to real GNP from the Annual
Abstract of Statistics, various issues. (See Grilli l988a for

ratio of nominal to real income as reported in table 4.8 of Milton
Friedman and Anna J. Schwartz, Monetary Trends in the United

role of time inconsistency in inflation taxation do not offer

predictions about the equilibrium dynamics of government debt and

of tax rates; in contrast, monetary tax-smoothing models do offer

an account of these dynamics, but one that fails as an equilibrium

theory because of its failure to confront and resolve the

time-inconsistency issue. By merging the two approaches below

using a time-consistent equilibrium construct, however, I derive a

theory consistent with the story told by chart 1. The theory

predicts that at each point in time at which inflation is

positive, it is higher than it would be if the government could

precornmit itself to future tax policies. But the theory also

predicts that, given rational private expectations, government

tax-smoothing behavior results in an inflation rate with a

tendency to fall over time toward the government's preferred

long-run   inflation   rate   (zero   in my   model).   Reputation

effects play no role in this equilibrium.4

     In technical terms, the investigation pursued here is an

application of dynamic game theory to interactions between the

4See Lucas (1986) for accessible accounts of both the tax-
smoothing idea and the obstacles to implementation implied by
dynamic  inconsistency. Lucas  describes examples   in which
government debt management policies can be used to ensure the time
consistency of optimal plans. Were such schemes generally
feasible, the naive tax-smoothing models might be resuscitated as
viable positive theories. Particularly in monetary economies,
however, it appears that the scope for such fine-tuning is very
limited. The nature of these limitations is discussed in section V
below. Poterba and Rotemberg (1988) consider the role of time
inconsistency in tax-smoothing inflation models, but they do not
focus on the dynamics of tax rates and government debt. Bohn
(1988) uses a framework similar to the one developed below to
study government motives for nominal debt issue in a stochastic
environment.

public and private sectors. The endogenous State variable

responsible for the economy's dynamics is the stock of government

debt. In the time-consistent intertemporal (Nash) equilibrium

constructed below, the government's inflation policy reaction

function is optimal, given the private rule for forecasting
inflation; at the same time, private forecasts are rational, given

the government's objectives and constraints. Phelps and Pollak

(1968), in a model of        capital accumulation by successive

generations, presented an     early economic application of the

equilibrium concept applied here.5

     The structure of the paper is as follows. Section I sets up a

model economy in which the government maximizes an inter temporal

welfare criterion that is decreasing in current inflation but

increasing in private real money balances. Section II describes

the government's optimal p1 an in a Stackelberg game, and shows why

the plan generally is time inconsistent. Section III contains the

central result     that in   a time-consistent Nash   equilibrium,

inflation has a tendency to fall over time. Section iv provides a

closed-form linear example in which the earlier theoretical

results can be checked numerically. Section V examines some

special issues connected with domestic-currency public debt,

particularly (i)   multiple equilibriums and (ii)     the possible
elimination of the time-consistency problem through sophisticated

I. The Model

         The analysis is developed in a setting due to Brock (1974). A

single representative private agent consumes a single perishable,

nonproduced consumption good. At the start of period t, the

representative agent maximizes



                           + g + v(m)],



where c is private consumption; g is government consumption, which

enters linearly into private utility; m stands for real money

balances (nominal balances M divided by the price level P);

is the subjective discount factor; and v(m) is twice continuously

differentiable and strictly concave.

         Conditions necessary for individual optimality are well

known. The linearity of utility in consumption fixes the

equilibrium real interest rate between periods s and s+l,        at p

—   (1   -
              )/•6 Real money demand at time s, m, satisfies

background questions of the term structure of government debt.
Implications of this modeling strategy are mentioned at various
points in section V.

however, the measure relevant to the present setup. Notice that it

approaches an upper bound of 1 as the conventionally-defined

inflation rate becomes arbitrarily high. Thus, it has a natural

intepretation as a tax rate, with it — 1 the confiscatory rate.7

       The economy is endowed with a fixed "natural" output level y,

but the amount of output available to be consumed falls when the

actual inflation rate rises. Specifically, equilibrium private

consumption is

for example, the reduction in production efficiency often said to

accompany higher inflation. Alternatively, c(ir) allows inflation

"surprises" to inflict social Costs distinct from those of

perfectly anticipated inflation.

    The government must undertake a fixed level of consumption

each period, so g — g, a constant.8 In the model, however, only

two sources of public finance are available, the proceeds of money

creation and the proceeds of borrowing from the private sector.

The presence of nonmonetary taxes in the formal model would not

change any main predictions about inflation; but a model extended

along the lines of Phelps (1973) would have implications for tax
                                                    -   9
rates that might be useful in empirical evaluation.         As this

extension is not pursued here, the revenues from money creation

and from public debt issue are now described in turn.

creation over period s, a, is given by

Assuming money-market equilibrium leads to a useful formula for

III. The model as specified does not account for an endogenous
government spending level, however.
9Phelps argues that the inflation tax should covary positively
with other taxes. Poterba and Rotemberg (1988) and Crilli (1988b)
present empirical evidence on the covariation of inflation with
other forms of taxation. Their evidence is not entirely consistent
with Phelpss prescription.

a. Let p(ir1) be the money demand function implied by (1).

[Since v"(m) < 0, '(i) < 0.] Then seigniorage can be written


(3)      —        + (m5 -             —          +          -
                            m51)


This equation states that seigniorage is derived from two sources,

(i) the public's desire to maintain real balances in the face of

inflation and (ii) any desired Increase in real balances.

      The second means by which the government can finance budget

deficits (surpluses) is the sale (purchase) of price-level indexed

bonds that are not subject to default. Many of the dynamic results

derived below may continue to hold when government debt

obligations are denominated entirely in domestic currency, rather

than indexed. The introduction of nominal debt complicates the

technical analysis considerably, however, and also creates a clear

potential for multiple equilibriums. Consideration of these

difficulties is postponed until section V.

      A bond has a fixed real face value (of unity) and pays

interest p after a period. The stock of such instruments held by

the government at the end of period s, a, evolves according to



(4)   a — (1 + p)a1 +        -
                                 g.



By integrating this expression forward, applying the long-run

solvency condition lim (l+p)a             0, and using (3), one obtains

the government's intertemporal budget constraint,



                                      9
      (l÷p)a1 +(l+p)5 t[lrm

It   is assumed that the government's budgetary obligations always

lead to nonnegative inflation rates.

      The government maximizes an objective that is increasing in

private consumption (of private and public goods) and real balances,




(5) W _5       t[u(     + g) +    z(m)]          St{[       -   ()) + z(m)}.
The period utility function u(c + g) + z(m) appearing in (5) is

concave and twice continuously differentiable.                      is general

enough (given a change in the inflation-cost function ,c(ir)) to

admit government-specific socially preferred inflation rates. To

ensure (somewhat arbitrarily) that the inflation rate most

appealing to the government is zero, I assume that at the

real-balance level rn associated with a zero inflation rate [that

is, where v' (rn) —   p/(l+pfl,   z' (rn)        0. Thus, my choice for       does

 to maximize the welfare of the representative agent.'° Notice that

 '°In the model with c(O) — 0, equilibrium appears to be generically
 nonexistent if the government's objective function is the same as
 the representative agent's. One way to allow the two functions to
 coincide is to assume that output is lost when inflation deviates,
 not from zero, but from Friedman's full liquidity rate, -p. If it
 is assumed in addition that full liquidity occurs at a finite
 level of real balances m, with increments to real balances beyond
 this point yielding zero utility, then the economy converges, not
 to zero inflation as it does below, but to deflation at rate p,
                                                                  —

the formulation above assumes that the private sector and

government have the same discount rate, an assumption made in most

of the tax-smoothing literature. Consequences of relaxing this

assumption are discussed briefly at the end of section III.



II. Precommitment Equilibrium

     If the government can precommit to follow chosen policies,

the resulting equilibrium is the outcome of a Stackelberg game in

which the government moves first, and moves only once. If this

game is played at t — 1, say, the government announces its choice

of a policy path for the entire future, taking into account that

each private individual's best response under precommitment is to

believe the announcement. The equilibrium policy path is the one

that maximizes    of (5) when it is correctly anticipated by the

public. This section examines the precommitment solution and

describes how it breaks down as an equilibrium concept when

policies are not pre-set,       but are chosen instead on a
discretionary basis in the period of their implementation.

     In the model with precommitment, a government moving on

date 1 picks an inflation path tss—l that maximizes W1 subject to

the public-sector intertemporal budget constraint, the private

optimality conditions



pm. (In this long-run equilibrium, government interest earnings
in excess of g are simply used to retire circulating money.) The
problem with this formulation is its lack of realism: the kinds of
inflation costs summarized in the function k(,r) are difficult to
ascribe empirically to deviations of inflation from -p.

               p(751)     (s       1),



and given inherited levels of aggregate real balances, m, and

government assets, a0. Constraint (6) embodies the government's

rational belief that if all future policies are iriunutably set on

date 1, it will be in each private individual's interest to use

those known policy settings in forecasting inflation, and thus in

deciding how much money to hold.1'

      Strictly speaking, the government does not choose the path of

prices. That path is instead the outcome of a market equilibration

process that the government controls indirectly through the amount

of money it issues. Given the announced inflation path, the

government must engineer a path for nominal money consistent with

market clearing on each date. The constraints on the government's

plan ensure that such a money-supply path exists and is unique;

and if speculative price-level bubbles are ruled out, that unique

money-supply path necessarily produces, in equilibrium,          the

announced path of prices.12

      To derive necessary first-order conditions (for an interior

maximum) from the standpoint of date 1, let ''—l be a sequence

of multipliers associated with the finance constraints (4), and

consider the Lagrangian

11Notice that the price level in the period prior to government
choice, P0, is an historical datum. Therefore, choice of the price
level's path from t —          I   on is equivalent to choice of the
inflation rate from t — 1 on.
12A formal proof could be constructed along the lines of Calvo
(l978b, appendix 1). On mechanisms for ruling out price-level
bubbles, see Obstfeld and Rogoff (1983, 1986).

         Three    aspects    of       this     precommitment equilibrium                  are


important:

         1. Equation (8) implies that inflation is constant at a level
 *         *                                  *                         *
     —    it     (say) for s > 1.            (it1 need not equal it          ,       though.)
Given that g is constant, government assets remain constant (at

a1) after date 1. The precomnhitment solution thus entails perfect

tax smoothing after the initial period. At inflation level it*, the

marginal value of the additional seigniorage from a perfectly

foreseen one-period rise in inflation equals the marginal Cost of

that rise. The additional revenue from raising inflation for a

period s, leaving other periods' inflation rates unchanged, is (in

terms of period-s goods) i(i +                       (it) +   (l+p)jf (it)       -   ' (it)   =

               - t(it)j;5   this sum multiplied by                  is the marginal

141n what follows, it is assumed that the precommitment optimum
exists, is unique, and is characterized by (7) and (8). (Section
LV describes a linear problem, closely related to this one, in
which existence and uniqueness can be verified.) As (8) makes
clear, a necessary condition for the validity of these assumptions
is that rj not exceed unity everywhere. The important role of the
interest elasticity of money demand is discussed further in a
moment.

the increase in it
                                  f   (it) —      p' (it)   comes from the effect of
                            on money-demand growth in periods s-i and s:

given it1 and       money demand growth falls by s' (it) in period
s-I and rises by that amount in period s. The net effect on the
period-s value of government revenues is negative and proportional
to p. This "stock-shift' effect of a change in inflation on money
demand was emphasized by Auernheimer (1974) in his discussion of
the transition between inflationary steady states; its presence
explains why the interest elasticity of money demand, not the
expected-inflation elasticity, is relevant to the discussion here.

marginal cost of the foreseen increase in ir                                           is the sum of the
                                                                                  S

       2. At an interior optimum, the interest elasticity of money

demand, e, is always less than 1. To see this, imagine that the

government has formulated a plan in which, in some period s, t(,r)

  I.   The argument in the preceding paragraph shows that a foreseen

decrease in ir                leads to an increase in seigniorage over period s.

There is thus a feasible plan in which inflation is no higher on

all dates and lower on at least one. It follows that the original

plan could not have been optimal.

       3. The precommitment solution would be time inconsistent if

the government were, in fact, unable to precomnhit to the plan

chosen on date 1. To see why, suppose the public believes the

date-i plan when it is announced, but that on date 2, the

authorities suddenly find themselves able to reoptimize. They can

thus choose a new optimal initial inflation level                                                           and the

inflation rate                 ir        optimal for dates 3, 4, etc. Time consistency

Because      >   0   (at positive inflation rates), and because the last

term on the right-hand side of (9) is nonnegative, (9) cannot hold

if the three inflation rates appearing in it are the same, as

required for time consistency. Thus, the optimal policy under

precommitment is time inconsistent: on date 2, the planner, if

free to do so, would                           an initial inflation rate ir'
                               :h00se
different from the rate it previously planned on date 1.

       The time-inconsistency problem is perhaps most striking when

u' (it) —   0; this is the case studied by Calvo (1978b) ,             in   which

price-level "surpises" are not costly and inflation inflicts harm

exclusively through its role as a tax on real balances. Provided

      > 0, it is optimal to set it1 at its maximal value of 1 in this

case.16 This policy amounts, in effect, to an official declaration

on date 1 that the existing currency is valueless, an action that

allows the government sell a "new" currency to the public for use

in subsequent periods, Of course, when the next period arrives it

becomes optimal to have another currency "reform" if               >   0.'
        Even when the government puts no weight on money-demand

distortions [z(m) —           0]   ,     but    instead cares only about the

current-output costs of inflation, equation (9) shows that the
16          *
     Since ALmS > 0 and, from the perspective of date 1, no social
costs depend on irk, it is optimal on that date to maximize current
inflation. Obviously, the solution for inflation is not interior
in this special case. If some it1 < 1 left the government with
enough interest income to cover its expenditure forever without
recourse to inflation,                 would be zero.

       owe this interpretation to Cuillermo Calvo. (Notice that the
date-l   price     level,   measured  in   the new currency,     is
indeterminate.)

precommitment solution is time inconsistent. In planning the

future (constant) inflation rate 7r* on date 1, the government, as

shown above, balances marginal revenue--equal to Js(lr*)[l                -




(*)]against      marginal cost each period.     Once date 2 arrives,

however, the marginal revenue from raising it2 from the planned

value of      is simply ,.L(lr*), while the marginal revenue from
                                              *          *
raising subsequent it's from it   is still (ir )[l -   c7r   )].   Marginal
costs don't vary as time passes in the present case. The optimum,

as seen from date 2, will thus call for an initial inflation rate

higher than that in later periods, in contrast to the flat

inflation rate from date 2 onward called for by the date-I plan.

In other words, on date 2 the government need no longer take

account of the effect its choice of it2 has on date-l money demand.


III. Time-Consistent Equilibrium

     The time     inconsistency of the        precomlnitment solut ion

disqualifies it as an equilibrium of a dynamic economy in which

all agents continually reoptimize. Private agents who understand

the government's objectives and constraints will attempt to

forecast the government's actions on the basis of its budgetary

conditions, and perhaps other variables. The government, in turn,

will consider the effects of its policies on private forecasts;

but it is likely to view itself as influencing private forecasts

only through current and past policies, and not through the mere

announcement of future policies. In such a setting, equilibrium is

most naturally analyzed in terms of policy and forecasting rules

that relate actions to the variables defining the economy S


                                   17
current state. A time-consistent equilibrium is decribed by a

policy rule that maximizes the government's objective function

each period, given that private agents forecast on the basis of

the rule and that the government takes the private forecasting

rule to be beyond its control.

     In this section, the foregoing notion of time-consistent

equilibrium is explored. The Nash game considered here posits

decision rules for private individuals that are parametric for the

policyTnaker and that depend, through the system's state variables,

on past and current policies, but not on announced future
policies. These features of the setup ensure time consistency.

     In the present context, the state of the economy on any date

t is assumed to be fully described by the predetermined variables

entering the government's budget constraint for that date,

and ai. This assumption means that only policy and forecasting

rules without memory are considered. The state of the economy

could conceivably include (in addition to mi and ai) policy

actions taken in the past or even extrinsic variables, but this

study does not adopt so broad a view. In particular, possible

 reputational equilibriums of the type Rogoff (1989) critically

 reviews are ignored.'8

 '8Barro and Gordon (1983) and Grossman and Van Huyck (1986) are

 reputational equilibrium idea is generalized by Chari and Kehoe's
 (1987) notion of a "sustainable plan," which allows players'
 reaction functions to depend on state vectors that may explicitly
 include past government actions along with the more conventional
 state variables (for example, asset stocks) usually considered.
 (Chari and Kehoe refer to these vectors as "histories.") The
 equilibrium singled out below corresponds to the Markov perfect
 equilibrium studied, in a quite different setting, by Maskin and


                                 18
        Given the foregoing exclusion of strategies with memory, it

is natural to assume that individuals base forecasts of

price-level change between any two periods s and s+l on aggregate

real balances m and on a , the same variables that determine the

expected inflation by the rule 7r'÷l —                  e(m,a),   and if the number

money demand is

      One would expect 8€/3m to be positive for two reasons. First, a
 rise in last period's real balances raises the base for the
 inflation tax,  thereby raising the marginal revenue from
 inflation. Second, a rise in last period's real balances, all else
 the same, lowers the increase in real money demand over the
 current period, thereby lowering government wealth and raising ).,
 the marginal value of government revenue.

     Necessary condition (10) equates the marginal output cost of

inflation to the shadow value        of marginal revenue, which is

proportional to last period's real balances. The second, inter-

temporal condition, (11), equates the current marginal value of

public resources, A, to the payoff from raising government saving

by a unit in period s and then returning government assets to

their initial path in period s+1.

     The latter payoff can be viewed as the sum of three

components. The first sununand on the right-hand side of (11) is

the direct marginal value product of an additional unit of saving,

that is, the discounted gross rate of return on saving, fl(l+p),

valued at next period'.s resource shadow price, A÷l. If this term

described fully the marginal return to government saving, then

since (l+p) — 1,      A would be constant over time, as in the

precomniitment solution. The two remaining sumniands on         the

 right-hand side of (11), however, capture additional,     indirect

 effects of government saving on the government's objective
 function. Both indirect effects are a consequence of the

 assumption '   (a)   <   0,   which implies that higher government

 wealth, by lowering expected inflation, increases money demand.

      Consider first the expression

         1 —    ' [e(a)]€' (a)

in (11). This term reflects the effect of an additional unit of

government saving on the social utility derived from private

real-balance holdings. Notice that the total indirect effect of

additional government saving on government assets is not just

i'             (a): that term measures only the first-round impact of

higher period-s government saving on real money-demand growth over

period s. There are further feedback effects that magnify this

first round effect by a "multiplier" 1 -               ' [e(a)Jf' (a).   To make

the government's problem meaningful, the multipler process through

which successive increments to a                    raise money-demand growth,

raising a            further,      is assumed to converge, not explode.

Convergence requires that

               1 —   ' {€(a     ))e'   (a)

reflects the fact that the additional period-s money-demand growth

induced by higher government saving in period s affects government

revenue in periods s and s+l. All else equal, higher money-demand

growth in period $      implies   lower growth in period s+IL, but there

is a net positive effect, proportional to p, on the period-s

present value of revenues. In addition, the inflation-tax base for

period s+l is higher, with a revenue effect proportional to

    While the additional terms in (11) measure complicated

effects, the basic message of the equation is simple: the marginal

physical return to government saving exceeds the simple gross

return on bonds, I + p. As a result the government will be

motivated to accumulate assets over time when 8         l/(l+p). This is

the main economic factor driving the declining time path of
inflation described below. The rest of this section is devoted to

analyzing the model's dynamic equilibrium.

     To start, consider the implications of conditions (l0)-(l2)

for the government's policy rule. Because m —        [(a)]    for s    1,

equations (l0)-(12) can be reduced to a (generally nonlinear)

difference equation system in the costate variable A                  and

government assets a. Given m0 and a0, an initial costate value

determines it1   [via   (10) for s — 1] and thus a1 [via (12) for s

1]; the subsequent paths of A and a are then determined by the

first-order conditions, with inflation rates coming from (10). An

optimal plan entails an initial choice A such that the resulting

path of the economy maximizes the government's objective function.
          A
     Let V(m 1,a l be the value function for the government's

problem at the start of period s, when the previous period's real

balances and government assets are m51 and a1 respectively. As

 shown in the appendix       ,
                                  the costate A* can be interpreted as

particular,       Xl — 88V(m0,a0)/3a0. Equation (10) therefore implies

that inflation is chosen to satisfy the equation



       -u' ()      — [8V(m1,a1)/3a1]m1

which implies, in turn, a government inflation rule of the form


                           A
              —
       s+l

The reason for this rule's dependence on the private forecasting

mechanism denoted by           is   clear.22

     A time-consistent equilibrium can now be defined. It is a

Kydland and Prescott (1977) explained how a time-consistent

equilibriuni can be viewed as the limit of a sequence of iterations

in which, at each step, private forecasting rules are updated to

reflect fully the policy rules that were optimal in the previous

iteration, given the private forecasting rule then being used. In

this equilibrium, it is optimal each period for the government to

use the rule         —   -y   (m,a), given that the private sector forms
its expectations using the same rule, 7r÷l —          -y   (m,a). No general

results concerning the existence or uniqueness of this type of

equilibrium seem to exist, except in the linear case (see Cohen

and Michel). Section IV,         below,   contains a linear example that can

be viewed as an approximation to the present model.23

     Having defined a time-consistent equilibrium, the next step

is to characterize it. Suppose that the public bases its forecasts

on the rule              ;(ma) which, at the same time, describes

the government's best inflation response given this rule. As shown

earlier, the forecasting rule can be expressed, in equilibrium, in

the alternative form r1— .y*(a), where y*(a) solves the
                                 —
equation in              s+l          1p(1r÷i),a]. Along the equilibrium

th, the actual       inflation rate ir          is given by -y (m 1a1)

   (1i (a     1fl,a } —           (ai).
     Return now to the intertemporal necessary condition (11) Use

 (10) to eliminate            and A+i, substitute i          for the arbitrary
                                                      (a5)
 expectation rule €(a), and rearrange to obtain:

 231f there are multiple time-consistent equilibriums, it is at
 least conceivable (but far from obvious) that the government will
 be a dominant player, in the sense that the public will follow it
 if it announces a time-consistent plan. Such a dominant-player
 role could allow the government to coordinate expectations on the
 time-consistent equilibrium that leads to the highest value of its
 objective function. Barro and Gordon (1983, p. 112) seem to have
 this idea in mind when they assume, in their setting, that the
 government can choose the reputational inflation equilibrium it
 prefers.

To interpret this condition further, note that if expectations are

unresponsive to government assets                  (a)     —   0],    the result is

the condition u' (r)/mi — u' (1r5÷1)/m5 appearing in Mankiw (1987)

and Grilli (1988a, 1988b): it is optimal for the government to

stabilize the ratio of the marginal output cost of inflation to

the inflation-tax base, which, with constant money demand, would

require a flat inflation path and an unchanging government asset

level. Since the government is taking money demand as given                          in


this special case, inflation costs caused by reductions in the

utility from money use [and represented by the function z(m)] do

not appear in the intertemporal smoothing condition.

       When    (a) < 0,         however, (14) shows that the ratio

              and thus inflation itself, declines over time. As

observed earlier, additional government saving now yields a gross

physical return li-p plus the extra benefits from the induced

 increase in money demand [see (11)1. Since the government's

 discount factor is just l/(l+p), the government will accumulate

 bonds, which it can do by always setting inflation higher than the

 level consistent with an unchanging stock of government assets.




                                      26
      Let A(a5) denote the right-hand side of equation (14) and

B(a1) the left-hand side. Then on the assumption that A(a) is

invertible, the difference equation



       A(a) —   B(a1)

describes     the   evolution        of        government     assets   along   a


time-consistent equilibrium path for s              2.

      It is simple to find the stationary state of this system, .

If     —   g/p, the government can finance its consumption without
recourse to the inftion tax. It has also been assumed that at

the level of real balances i(O) corresponding to an inflation rate

of   zero, z' [(O)] — 0. Thus, -y (a) — 0 in any time-consistent

equilibrium. Equation (14) confirms that                 —   g/p is the long-run
equilibrium stock of government, assets.

      Figure 2 illustrated th dynamics of convergence (in the
relevant region where a < ) under the assumption that                   (a) < 0.

Equation (14) shows that for any asset level a < a, A(a) > B(a).

Since A(a) has been assumed invertible, there is a unique path

converging to budget balance along which government assets
rise- -and inflation falls- -monotonically. Notice that the path

described by figure 2 is showr as beginning with a1 rather than

with a0. The asset stock a1 depends on a0 (and m0), however,

through the government's finance constraint and its initial

inflation choice.

      It was mentioned in section I that the above model is special

               the difference equation A(a)   B(a5_1)
in assuming that the government and private sector share a common

discount   rate.   Under plausible   assumptions,     however,    the

government discount rate will exceed the private rate. For

example, policymakers may discount the future more heavily than

private agents because they face some probability of being removed

from office. In formal terms, a positive difference between the

government and private discount rates amounts to lowering          in

(14) while holding p constant. Clearly, a —   g/p,   with 1 (a)    0,

remains a stationary state of the model; however, the A(a)

schedule in figure 2 may now cross the B(a1) schedule to

the left of the origin, a possibility that would give rise to

multiple stationary states, alternately stable and unstable.

     Notice that the model does not imply that governments always

run surpluses. As in any model with some tax smoothing, the time

pattern of deficits depends on the time pattern of government

spending which, for simplicity, was assumed above to be flat. The

model is easily extended to account for an exogenously varying and

perfectly foreseen path of government spending. Just respecify the

equations in terms of a state variable equal to government assets

less the present discounted value of future government spending:



(15) a -         (1)h+l
           h—0


     Rewriting the model in terms of the state variable (15)

leads to some predictions about the relation between expenditure

changes and deficits. Sufficiently large, sufficiently temporary



                                28
innovations in public spending, for example, will induce the

government to engage in partial tax smoothing by raising inflation
and running a larger deficit. (Inflation will be more sensitive to

expenditure innovations than in a model with complete tax

smoothing, however.) Once spending has returned to normal,

however, inflation will not remain at a permanently higher level,

but will instead tend to come do.in over time.

    The steady-state of the economy is now one in which the

deficit is zero on average: absent unexpected shocks, asset income

just covers the annuity value of the government expenditure path,

and there is no need ever to use the inflation tax.



IV. A Linear ExampLe

     A closed-form linear example illustrates the characteristics

of the equilibrium described in the last section. For the purpose

of the example, I assume that z(m)    0, so that inflation reduces

welfare only through its negative effect on current output.

     The key trick in obtaining a linear example is to redefine the

model, not in terms of inflation, but in terms of the inflation

tax levied on money holders, r, where

this inequality certainly holds in the example just given [since p

did the assumption         < 1 in previous sections: it ensures that a

fall in inflation-tax revenue does not raise total seigniorage a.

      The solution method is to solve first for the time-consistent

inflation policy along an equilibrium path, that is, a path on

which past as well as current expectations of future inflation

taxation coincide with the policy. Once a solution along
equilibrium paths is in hand, a general solution, valid for

arbitrary values of the economy's state variables, can be

inferred. Define the variable d ash-O

function of the beginning-of-period government debt alone, r —

be optimal today. This requirement will be shown to determine a

V. Nominal Government Debt

       The model has assumed until now that all public debt takes

the form of promises to deliver specified amounts of real output

on future dates. In many countries, however, much (or most) public

debt is denominated in local currency, not output. This section

briefly sketches some ways in which the presence of home-currency

government debt could change conclusions reached above.

       There are two main differences compared with the previous

analysis. First, nominal debt may lead to multiple equilibriums

through a channel absent above,           the effect of inflation

expectations on nominal interest rates.28 If all public debt is

nominal, however, there still appears to be a time-consistent

equilibrium in which inflation falls over time.

       The second main difference, which I regard as a theoretical

 curiosity because of its knife-edge nature, arises when the

 government can issue indexed and nominal debt side by side. Once

 28Calvo (l988a) analyzes a two-period model in which such
 multiplicities can occur.

the period-s nominal interest rate. If a denotes the real value

of net nominal government claims on the public at the end of

period s, the government's finance constraint takes the form

by analogy with the tack taken before, it is natural to seek a

reduced-form rule ir÷l —           €(a)     governing expectations formation

along an equilibrium path. Use of Fisher equation (26) shows that

such a rule is the solution to the equation in


                   A
                                                                —

      If the government is indebted to the public (atm <                                         0),
equation (27) may have multiple solutions, an outcome that could

incentive to inflate, and lowers real balances, lowering the

incentive to inflate. In the case shown, c(lr÷1,a) has two

intersections with the 450 line; but more generally, it could have

more than two intersections or none.29


291 have pushed aside issues of term structure in assuming that all
nominal debt matures after one period. Calvo (1988b) has showit
that even under a constant real interest rate, as here, the
government may have incentives to issue longer-term obligations
when all public debt is currency-denominated. The presence of such

       Only at the low-inflation intersection in figure 4 is it the

case    that higher government assets a (which shift            the

c-function downward) lower equilibrium inflation expectations; at

the high-inflation intersection, public asset accumulation appears

to worsen the inflation outlook. Given a favorable outcome in

figure 4, however, the government has the additional motives for

asset accumulation that drive the results of the last two

sections. If a time-consistent equilibrium exists in this case,

one would therefore expect the earlier analysis to go through much

as before, despite the currency denomination of the public debt.

       Equilibrium dynamics in an economy where the unfavorable

forecasting rule is adopted remain mysterious. It seems doubtful

to me that a time-consistent equilibrium           (in which    the

intertemporal government budget constraint is met) can exist in a

setting where increasing public deficits are accompanied by
                     30
falling inflation.

given a nominal public debt in the form of consols, the analogue
of equation (29) has a unique solution because 3c/37r÷i         <0
everywhere. (Higher inflation expectations would lower the real
present value of future public debt-service obligations if debt
took the form of nominal consols.) In Calvo's (l988b) model, the
presence of real as well as nominal government debt, as in the
next case considered below, removes the motivation for a richer
nominal term structure, given the fixed real interest rate.
300f course, there could be a third, higher-inflation intersection
in figure 4, at which the c-function crossed the 45° line from
above. There, just as at the low-inflation intersection, higher
government assets would lower equilibrium expected inflation.

will face in future periods. Open-market switches between real and

nominal debt, at a given price level, alter the inflation-tax base

faced in the following period, and may allow the government to

sustain the precommitment solution as an equilibrium.

       If the government's price-level indexed bond holdings are a

       Suppose that on date 1 the government rearranges its asset

where starred values are the (time-invariant) values associated

with the government's date-l optimization. Then (8) and (29) imply

        In a nonxnonetary setting, Lucas and Stokey (1983) suggested a

method of managing the term structure of government                             debt that
sustains a precommitment optimum under                       discretion.         Persson,

Persson, and Svensson (1987) argued that the natural extension of

the Lucas-Stokey idea to a monetary economy involves an exact

balancing of the government's net nominal bond holdings against

its monetary liab ilities, that is, a zero net position in home

currency. Because Persson, Persson, and Svensson assumed away any

explicit cost of inflation surprises, a zero net position in home

currency appears necessary, in their framework, to ensure time

consistency; but as Calvo and Obstfeld (1988) have shown, that

prescription is also sufficient only under quite unrealistic

conditions. Appropriate debt management avoids time inconsistency



                                           42
above because the real interest rate is fixed (so that the term-

structure issues raised by Lucas and Stokey don't arise), because

all nominal debt matures after a single period, and because

unanticipated as well as anticipated inflation is socially costly.

     Real interest rates vary in practice and governments do deal

in long-term instruments; so the above scheme cannot be taken

literally as describing official behavior in actual economies.31 The

example nonetheless highlights incentives that may infuence

governments to some degree. Unfortunately, the problem of modeling

equilibrium with both real and nominal securities appears to be

quite difficult once a setting of any generality is assumed.

Success in this area would yield, not only positive predictions

about government deficits and inflation, but insight into the mix

of real and nominal government debt issue actually observed.

     It is worth noting that the paper's central conclusions about

the dynamics of time-consistent equilibriums would probably

survive the introduction of a variable real interest rate. With

a flexible marginal utility of consumption, a declining inflation

path would imply rising output and a falling real interest rate.

A tendency for the real interest rate to fall would, in turn,

reinforce the tendency for public-sector deficits and inflation to

decline over time. Such an extension of the present model could

help explain the "stylized" fact that real interest rates are high

at the beginning of hyperinflation stabilization programs.




 3LThis is probably fortunate, since few (if any) governments have
 positive net holdings of domestic-currency bonds.

                                 43
VI. Conclusion

     This paper has explored the dynamic behavior of seigniorage

in a time-consistent equilibrium with government borrowing and

lending. A major positive implication of the paper is that in the

absence of unforeseen shocks, governments will shrink their budget

deficits over time so as to reduce the need for inflationary

finance (or, for that matter, for other distorting taxes).

     Before matching theory to data, stochastic disturbances (to

government spending requirements, say) would have to be worked

into the model. At least as an approximation, such a model should

replicate the stationary behavior of inflation evident in chart 1

of section I. The underlying cause of this behavior- -that in a

time-consistent equilibrium,       there are incentives for debt

reduction beyond the physical return on assets--should still

operate in a stochastic setting.

     Although the model yields predictions consistent with the

long-term behavior of U.K. and U.S. prices, it is less clear that

it captures well the apparently chronic inflation in many

developing countries, where seigniorage        is typically more

important than in the industrialized world. The model helps

explain, however, why governments in budgetary crisis often
sharply devalue their currencies in the foreign exchange market,

 thereby spurring domestic inflation but (hopefully) promoting

 increases in official foreign reserves.32 A partial rationale for

devaluing at the outset of stabilization is to lower future

is subject to serially correlated shocks beyond goverrunen:

control. So at best, the theory set out above explains one of th

underlying tendencies driving inflation, not all of inflatt:'r

Empl.oyment and distribution goals, two factors absent from         the


paper's model, appear particularly important.33 Nonetheless, the

paper seems useful as a first attempt at explaining one
factor- - the   key one in some countries- -driving the dynamics of

inflation under discretionary policy formulation.




33The results of table 1 show long-run inflation rates for the U.K.
and U.S. that are positive rather than zero. This result is
inconsistent with a literal interpretation of the paper's model,
but could be explained by a government target inflation rate that
(for some reason) exceeds zero, or by policy considerations
independent of the public finances that influence inflation
choices.
Appendix. Interpreting the Government's Value Function

       This appendix derives the link between the costate variable

   associated with a solution to the maximization problem of

section III and the partial derivatives of the value function

V(m1,a1) for the problem.

       After substituting [(a5)] for m in government finance
constraint (12), one can write that equation in the form



(Al)         a    —




[Inequality       (13) is still assumed.] With the aid of this notation,

the value function can be defined as



(A2) V(m1,ai) —                max    +



                           +




       The       partial derivatives of (m1,a1,1r) are easily
computed. For example, the partial derivative              is




                  —
                      m1/(l '[€(a)]E'(a))
                               -              >0.


Thus, the first-order condition for a maximum can be written




                                     46
(A3)     u' (ir) +    z' (m)if [(a):' (a)(8/L)

In view of (Al) and the constraint m —                         p(E(afl,   (A3) gives the

          choice of irs as a function i(m                             of initial asset
