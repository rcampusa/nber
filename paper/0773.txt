     This paper develops a general equilibrium two country, two commodity

dynamic simulation model of international trade in commodities and financial

claims. The model generalizes the Heckscher—Ohlin static theory of trade

by incorporating costs of quickly adjusting levels of capital stocks in

particular industries; i.e., capital mobility in the short run is permitted,

but at a price. The model predicts Heckscher—Ohlin relationships, including

factor price equalization, in the long—run, but not during the economy's

transition path to its ultimate steady—state. An interesting feature of

the model is that it provides a determinate solution to the long—run inter-

national allocation of the world's capital stock. This is true despite

the fact that the Rybchinski—theorem holds in the long—run.

     The simulation model of international trade with costly capital stock

adjustment appears capable of explaining many features of the patterns

of factor price equalization, international investment, and changes in

comparative advantage that have characterized the post—war period.

              The International Economics of Transitional Growth --

                        The Case of the United States


      The poor absolute performance of the U.S. economy in the 1970's and

the poor relative performance of the U.S. economy vis-a-vis those of Japan,

Germany, and other Western European countries over the past three decades

is today the object of intense public concern. Economic growth has emerged

as the foremost goal of the new administration. The U.S. government has,

itself, been identified as the major impediment to national growth and

prosperity. While government regulation, bureaucracy, and taxation

have surely played some role in U.S. economic stagnation, the poor

absolute and relative performance of the U.S. economy in the post.-war

period is better understood to be the result of dramatic, but predictable

changes in the international marketplace, changes that, for the most part,

have been and continue to be beyond the control of anyone in the U.S.

     The U.S. economy has been and is engaged in a process of international

economic growth that may entail poor relative and, indeed, absolute

economic performance for years to come. The United States emerged in

1945 with its industrial plant and equipment largely unaffected by the

ravages of the second world war. In contrast the capital stocks of western

European countries and Japan were largely destroyed. The lead thereby af-

forded the U.S. in capital per man has predictably, been shortened over time

as major trading partners of the United States have accumulated capital

at a much faster rate than the United States. In 1958 over 50 percent

of the world's capital stock was situated in the United States. Today's
                                    *
figure   is less than 35 percent.       For particular commodities, changes in

    the world distribution of capital allocated to the production of those

-
    commodities has been even more dramatic since the industrial distribution
    of investment outside the U.S. contrasts greatly with the distribution

    within the US. This accumulation of productive capacity around the

    world has been accompanied by a boom in world trade of unprecedented magni-

    tude and a rapid leveling of wages of workers in the industrialized coun-
             *
    tries.       Although this process has largely reached its equilibrium among

    the developed economies, there remain vst differences in capital per

    nian between the developed and underdeveloped world. The scene that has

    been played out by the industrialized countries may soon be replayed on a

    grander scale.

         The Heckscher—Ohlin-Samuel son model with equal numbers of factors

    and goods is incapable of explaining these events. One of its implica-

    tions is that factor prices are equalized around the world. Although

    the international economy is involved in a long term process of factor

    price equalization, factor prices across industrialized countries have

    been and remain today quite disparate. In 1967 average U.S. wages in

    manufacturing were 1 .8 times the average manufacturing wage in OECD

    countries. Ten years later average U.S. wages were still 1.3 times

    as large as those in the OECD. Economic evidence supports a rejection

    of a short-run Heckscher-Ohlin model. Kotlikoff and Learner (1981) find

    that national wages are systematically related to national endowments of

    productive factors.

         The simple Heckscher-Ohlin model may be altered in many ways to elimin-

    ate the factor-price equalization theorem. This paper provides a theoretical

 structure which seem capable of explaining the events of the last three

 decades. The theoretical model takes factor-price equalization to be a

 feature of the steady-state equilibrium, but allows for costs which delay

 adjustment to this equilibrium. Costs could be incurred by either capital

 or labor. Here, as in Mussa (1978) and Mayer (1974), we allow labor to

 be costlessly mobile within each country, while capital is mobile,but

 subject to increasing costs. Summers (1980) provides econometric evidence

supporting a putty—clay model of capital forniation that involves signifi-

cant marginal costs of quickly adjusting the size of the capital stock

devoted to the production of any particular commodity.   In recent years

models of economic growth incorporating costly capital adjustment have been

developed by Summers (1980), Lipton and Sachs (1980), and Sachs (1982).

Each of these analyses have related investment to Tobin's q, the ratio of

a firm's market value to the replacement cost of its capital. Lipton and

Sachs (1980) and Sachs (1982) have analyzed the dynamics of international

growth with costly adjustment under the assumption of complete specializa-

tion in production. This paper extends this literature by considering the

case of international growth with incomplete specialization and costly ad-

justment. The model generalizes the Heckscher-Ohlin theory of international

trade and factor compensation; the model we present reduces to the Heckscher-

Ohlin model with internationally mobile capital under the assumption of zero

adjustment costs. With positive adjustment costs, the model predicts

Heckscher-Ohlin relationships, including factor price equalization, in the

long-run, but not during the economy's transition path to its ultimate

steady-state. An interesting feature of the model is that it provides a

determinate solution to the long-run international allocation of the world's
                                                                              4




    capital stock. This is true despite the fact that international capital

-
    mobility   is permitted and despite the fact that the Rybchinski-theorem holds

    in the long-run.

        The dynamic model that we construct is to be simulated for hypothetical

    technological and preference parameters under the assumption of both rational

    and myopic expectations. The simulations presented here assume myopic ex-

    pectations. A computer program simulating the rational expectations transi-

    tion path of dynamic international economies is currently being tested.

    The method of simulation under rational expectations is that of Lipton,

    Poterba, Sachs and Summers (1980). The simulations provide considerable

    insight concerning the time required for long-run factor price equalization

    and the relationship between domestic and foreign wages during the economic

    transition.

          The second part of this paper tests the structural relationships

     posited by the model using industry specific investment, employment and

    wage data from the United Nation's Yearbook of International

     Statistics. Of particular interest is the extent to which the short-run

    industrial allocation of each nation's capital stock influences the short—

    run industrial allocation of each nation's labor force.     In addition we examine

    the degree to which international investment responds to international

    differences in investment profitability and the consequences of such inter-

    national, industry specific investment for employment in the corresponding

    domestic industries.

         The paper proceeds as follows. The first section provides a statis-

    tical overview of the course of post-war international investment and factor

     price equalization.    In Section 2 the 2-good 2-factor Heckscher-ohlin model

     is generalized to incorporate capital stock adjustment costs and economic

growth. This section describes the long-run steady-state properties o

the model as well as the economics of transitional growth. Section three

tests the theory with the limited international data that is available.

Section four summarizes and concludes the paper.

I. An Overview of International Investment and Factor Price Equalization

     This section presents various types of evidence describing both the

rapid post—war accumulation of capital in developed foreign countries

and the course of international wage equalization. The changes in relative

international capital endowments are substantial and appear to be having

a profound influence on wages in the United States.

     Table 1 indicates how the international distribution of the world's

capital stock has changed in the past several decades.     These capital

stock numbers are generated using the perpetual inventory method assuming

20 year asset lives. The values of the U.S. share of world capital for the

years 1958 and 1966 are most likely biased downward because of an under-

estimate of     U.S. benchmark capital stock in 1948. (See Learner (1980)).

In the 1950's over half of the world's capital stock was

located in the U.S. Today the figure is roughly 30 percent. The increase

in the share of world capital located in Japan and Germany is almost large

enough to account for the loss in the U.S. share. Japan now holds over 15

percent of the world's structures and equipment; 20 years ago less than 5

percent of the world's capital was located in Japan. Germany's share of world

capital has almost doubled in the post-war period. The fraction of

total world capital placed in Korea remained roughly constant for much of

the last two decades. In recent years, however, Korea's share has also

increased markedly.

capital formation. The information conveyed in this diagram reinforces the

findings of Table I, yet does not incorporate a number of technical assump-

tions required to estimate actual capital stock numbers. The figure

 indicates that the U.S. share of gross capital formation exceeded 50 percent

 in the early l950s; by the mid-1970s the U.S. share was approximately 30

 percent. To compare foreign countries investment flows with those of the

U.S. each foreign country investment series was converted into U.S.

dollars using annual exchange rates. This procedure may overstate the

recent reduction in the U.S. share of total world investment because of

the significant depreciation of the U.S. dollar in the l970s. A measure

of capital accumulation that avoids this exchange rate issue is given in

Table II.

     Table II details the substantial difference in country specific in-

vestment rates that have generated the Table 1 changes in the distribution

of world capital .   The Japanese investment rate is the most striking.

For many of the past twenty years the Japanese investment rate has been

more than double that of the U.S. German investment rates, while much lower

than those of the Japanese, have still exceeded U.S. rates by 25 to 50

percent. Indeed U.S. investment rates have been and are currently among

the lowest of developed countries. Korea's investment rate shot up in

the 1970's and now exceeds the L!,S, rate by about 40 percent.

     These large differences in domestic investment rates have for the most

part been associated with large differences in domestic savings rates. Neither

the high Japanese nor German investment rates reflect the import of foreign

capital. On the contrary, as Table III reports, both Japan and Germany

have experiences trade surpluses in the past two decades. In 1977

for example, Germany savings exceeded German investment by 11.43

percent. The Japanese have run much smaller surpluses as a fraction

of their investment. In selected years the U.S. and the U.K.

have been heavy importers of foreign capital. In 1977 alniost 10

percent of U.S. domestic investment resulted from foreign investment in

the U.S. In the past two decades the U.K., Italy, Canada, and Korea have

tended to import capital for purposes of domestic investment. Korea has

been a particularly impressive importer of foreign capital. In certain

years foreigners have invested more in Korea than have domestic residents.

     The numbers in Table III suggest that the post-war placement of capital

would not have been markedly different had net international capital flows

always been zero. On the other hand, rates of net foreign investment have

been high in certain years for certain countries, and this suggests that

at least small variations in domestic savings rates would have left domestic

investment rates unaltered.

     The substantial international differences in savings rates are primarily

the result of international differences in private household consumption be-

havior. Table IV reports the ratio of private household consumption to gross

domestic product less government consumption.   In 1977 private U.S. citizens

consumed 77 cents of every dollar of national output left over after govern-

ment consumption.   In contrast Japanese citizens spent only 64 cents of every

dollar of output not consumed by the Japanese government. Converted into

savings rates, the 1978 Japanese savings rate out of output left over after

government consumption was over 50 percent greater than that of the U.S.

     The composition of domestic investment with respect to residential

versus non-residential capital formation has been roughly similar in the U.S.,

Japan, Germany, and Korea. Table V indicates that the Japanese have allo-

cated a somewhat higher fraction of their domestic investment to business

     While the type of investment undertaken in recent years has been similar

in these countries, the industrial allocation of investment has differed sub-

stantially. Table VI compares Japanese, German and Korean 1967 to 1977

cumulative investment shares by industry with those of the U.S. Over the

period 1967 to 1977 the Japanese invested disproportionately more in iron and

steel, non-ferrous metals, pottery and glass, transport equipment, and tobacco

than did the U.S. The Germans have invested relatively heavily in metals as

well, but also in machinery, beverages, leather products and footwear. Korean

investment is highly concentrated in textiles, leather products, wearing ap-

parel, tobacco, rubber, iron and steel and non-ferrous metals.   In contrast

the U.S. has concentrated its investment in recent years relatively more in

food products, wearing apparel, furniture, paper, printing, chemicals, petrol-

eum, metal products, and professional goods and other industries.

     While the numbers in Table VI indicate that foreign patterns of invest-

ment have been quite different from that in the U.S. in recent years, they

do not indicate how investment patterns within the United States have changed

over time. Table VII describes changes in the U.S. industrial composition of

investment over the period 1967-1977. As the model to be presented below

suggests, changes in the allocation of domestic investment provide excellent

early predictors of changes in the structure of comparative advantage. Con-

sider the metal industry as an example. Despite the fact that the U.S. de-

voted relatively more of its total investment to the metal products industry

from 1967-1977 than did Japan, Germany, and Korea, the share of U.S. invest-

ment allocated to metal products declined continuously from 1967 through 1977.

The 1967 share was 5.6 percent; in 1977 the share was 4.7 percent, 16 percent

lower than in 1967. Textiles, leather products, footwear, rubber products,

iron and steel, non-ferrous metals, metal products, and electrical

equipment are all industries that have suffered major reductions

in their share of new U.S. capital formation.   In contrast plastic products,

wood/furniture products, transport equipment, tobacco, and the chemical in-

dustry are industries that enjoyed sizable increases in their share of total

U.S. investment. The long-run reallocation of industrial capital suggested

by these numbers is quite likely to be associated with a siriilar long-run

reallocation of U.S. labor across industries.

     The Table Vi differences in the allocation of national investment across in—

tries imply differences in the allocation of any particular industry's in-

vestment across countries. Table Vlllindicates the U.S. share of total

world investment by industry for 1967 and 1977 as well as the percentage

change in these shares. The most dramatic changes in the international dis-

tribution of industrial investment have occurred in the

rubber, iron and steel, non-ferrous metals, metal products and electrical

equipment industries. In 1967 over a third of the leather products industry's

investment took place in the U.S. Today's figure is roughly one-fifth. The

U.S. share of footwear investment has halved over the period, while the

share of investment in the metal industries has fallen by 25 percent.   The

Japanese and Germans increased their share of world steel investment from

33 percent to 42 percent.

     In the textile industry the U.S. has maintained its investment share

at about 30 percent, while the textile investment shares of other countries

have changed considerably. In 1967 Korea accounted for less than 2 percent

of world textile investment. The current figure is close to 13 percent.

Much of this Korean textile investment is substituting for Japanese textile

investment. The Japanese formerly accounted for 16 to 20 percent of world

textile investment. They now account for 12 percent. Investment in the

wearing apparel industry has, on the other hand, increased in both Japan

and Korea. Their combined investment share in 1967 was 8 percent, in

1977 it v.as 16   V3rcent.
     Post-war international differences in investment behavior have led

to remarkable changes in international capital labor ratios. As Table IX

points out the U.S. ratio of capital to labor exceeded the Japanese ratio

by almost 9 to one in 1958. By 1975 the U.S. capital-labor ratio was

less than 30 percent greater than that of the Japanese. German growth

in capital intensity has been equally impressive. The Table IX estimates

obtained from Learner's (1980) data suggest that the German capital labor ratios

actually exceeded the U.S. ratio by the mid-l970's. Korea has also experi-

enced a phenomenal increase in capital intensity, but the differential

today between the U.S. and Korean ratios of capital to labor is greater

than the 1958 differential between the U.S. and Japan. Clearly the

international equalization of the ratio of capital to labor is an on-going

process that will continue for years if we can extrapolate the trends of

the past.

     The narrowing of international differences in capital-labor ratios

has been associated with a rapid process of international factor price

equalization. Figure II presents the ratios of U.S., German, Japanese,

and Korean wages in manufacturing industries to the employment weighted

average manufacturing wage among the developed western economy's plus

Japan. In the decade from 1967 to 1977 the U.S. relative wage advantage

declined by 25 percent; in 1967 the average U.S. manufacturing wage

 was 1.8 times the international
                                    average. By 1977 the U.S. average annual

 manufacturing wage was only 1.35 times the international average considered

 here. As the data on growth in capital-labor ratios would suggest, Japanese

 and German relative wages have
                                  grown considerably. Not withstanding a doubling
 in the Japanese relative wages over the decade from .38 to .83, U.S.
                                                                      wages
 were still 60 percent greater than Japanese wages in 1977. Korea has also

 evidenced sustained growth in relative annual
                                                 manufacturing wages. The
 Korean ratio was .087 in 1967; it was .175 in 1977.

      Despite the rapid growth of capital intensity abroad, the equalization

 of international wages can not be fully explained by the equalization of

 international capital labor ratios. For example, our data suggests that

 the ratio of the Japanese capital labor ratio to that of the U.S. increased

 by almost 160 percent between 1967 and 1975. If one assumed that wages

were determined by a linear homogeneous Cobb-Douglas production function

with a capital coefficient of .3, this growth in relative capital labor

ratios would imply a 48 percent increase in relative wages. However,

from 1967 to 1975 Japanese relative wages themselves increased by almost

160 percent. A similar set of numbers holds true for Germany. Over the

period 1967 through 1975 German capital intensity relative to that of

the U.S. increased by 82 percent, but German relative wages increased by

120 percent over the time period.

     In addition to foreign acquisition of capital, foreign acquisition of

technology appears to be a major determinant of foreign wage growth. Table

Japan, and Korea. The analysis is based on Learner's (1980) data on national

  with a capital coefficient of .3. Our productivity measure is output per

  unit input where inputs (capital and labor) are geometrically weighted by

  their factor shares.

       The computed productivity growth rates vary greatly frOm period to

  period. However, over the period 1958—1975 as well as the sub-period 1966-

  1975, Germany, Japanese, and Korea technological growth rates all exceeded

  those of the U.S. The Japanese growth rate in technology is striking; it

  averaged 4.67% over the 17 year period; this is 3.54 percentage points larger

  than the comparable U.S. growth rate. The close to 5 percent differential in

  technological growth rates between Japan and the U.S. during the period 1966

  to 1975 can by itself account for a 56 percent increase in the Japanese-U.S.

 relative wage. Over the period 1958 to 1975 German growth rates were, on

 average, 40 percent greater than U.S. growth rates.   In more recent years

 (1966-1975), the German-U.S. growth rate differential has averaged close to

 2 percentage points and could explain a 19 percent increase in the relative

 German wage from 1966 to 1975.

      For the most part the process of international wage equalization has

 occurred uniformly across all industries. With a few notable exceptions,

 U.S., German, and Japanese industrial wage structures have remained constant

 while absolute wage rates across all industries have grown closer to

 their foreign counterparts. Table XI exanhines changes in the industrial

 wage structure by country over the period 1967 to 1977 for the U.S., Japan,

 Germany, and Korea. With the exception of tobacco, iron and steel

 leather   products, and rubber,experienced relative wage changes of more
 than 10 percent. In Germany there were also only three industries, food
 products, tobacco, and leather products. For the U.S., Japan, and

 Germany   these data support a view of internal labor mobility that
 precludes large inter-industry wage differentials. Surprisingly Korean
 data suggests quite sizable changes in relative industrial wages from 1967

 to 1977. For example, relative wages in beverages rose by 37 percent, while

 relative wages in leather products declined by 35 percent.

      To summarize this section, post-war data on investment, employment and

 wages indicate that the international economy is engaged in a process of

 transitional growth, with low wage developed and developing countries

 accumulating capital at a faster rate than the U.S. While most of this

 capital formation has been internally financed,international investment

 has been a significant factor in total investment in certain countries,

 in certain years.    These high rates of foreign capital formation have

 raised the level of capital   per workers and have an important if not
decisive role in raising foreign wages relative to those in the U.S. The

 process of international wage equalization appears, for the most part, to have

occurred uniformly across industries within the various countries, which

suggests a freely mobile internal domestic labor market.

     While international wage and capital intensity equalization has been

remarkable in the past 30 years, a large gap in both wages and levels of

capital per worker still remains.

     The next section of this paper presents a model of international

growth and wage equalization that captures many of the features of the

international economy suggested by the data. The model assumes that domestic

labor forces are costlessly mobile across domestic industries, but that
                                                                                28




    financial capital is internationally mobile. The key element of the model
-
    the   assumption of costly adjustment of industrial capital stocks, leads

    to a series of predictions about the course of factor accumulation and

    factor price equalization that seems quite consistent with the stylized

    facts presented in this section.

  II. A Generalized Heckscher-Ohlin Model of Economic Growth with Adjustment

          Costs

          The key feature that differentiates our model from the standard

 Heckscher.-Ohlin model of international trade is the assumption that firms

 incur costs to altering their level of capital in any finite period of

 time. The adjustment cost technology that is considered here expresses

 adjustment costs as an increasing function of the rate of investment (or

 disinvestment). Since the rate of investment depends on both the absolute

 level of the firm's (industry's) existing capital stock as well as the

 absolute level of new investment, a firm's investment decision today will

 affect its capital stock tomorrow and, therefore, its marginal adjust-

ment costs tomorrow. This formulation of the problem links the production

and investment decisions of the firm at one point in time to these deci-

sions at other points in time as well. Rather than equate the marginal

product of capital to a common rental rate as in the standard static trade

model ,    firms   in this environment alter their capital stocks over time

to maximize the present value of profits where profits are net of adjust-

ment costs. The relative immobility of physical capital does not pre-

clude perfect national and international mobility of financial capital.

The model assumes that economic agents are free to invest anywhere in the

world and will continue to do so until annual net rates of return to invest-

nent in a particular industry are equated across all industries. This

equality of net rates of return across industries substitutes for the standard

static equilibrium condition that net rental rates on capital are equated.

While the model departs from tradition in its treatment of capital, the

standard trade theory assumption of costless domestic, interindustry labor

mobility is maintained.
                                                                           30




     The implications of these assumptions for the short run behavior of

the model are the following. First,wage rates will differ across countries

in the short run despite the fact that countries have identical technologies,

are incompletely specialized in production, and financial capital is inter-

nationally mobile. The world relative price of the two commodities is

not sufficient here to determine wage rates. In the short run marginal

revenue products of labor are equated across domestic industries, but

marginal revenue products of capital are not. It is the satisfaction

of both of these sets of conditions that leads to factor price equaliza-

tion. However, as we demonstrate below, both conditions are satisfied

in the long run when the economy has converged to a steady state characterized

by incomplete specialization. Hence, if the economy converges to such a steady

state, wage rates across different countries must converge as well

     A second feature of this model is that positive investment may

take place even in those industries exhibiting low marginal revenue products

of capital. The reason is simply that concentrating substantial levels

of new investment in any given industry or set of industries within any

year entails increasing adjustment costs; this will prove unprofitable relative

to investing in low marginal revenue product, but low marginal adjust-

ment cost industries.

     Even if disinvestment occurs, the rate of disinvestment will be slow,

again because of the assumption of increasing costs to that activity. A

consequence of this is that specialization in production is an international

economic phenomenon that will occur gradually if at all.

                                                 The Model

        The demand side of the model is formulated as follows. Citizens                               'in


 each country maximize an interteniporal utility function that for simplicity

 is taken to be of the form given in (1). Utility is a function of the

 consumption of goods 1 and 2. Good 1 is the numeraire good in the

 economy and is both a consumption good as well as the economy's single

 capital good.

                          0

 In (1)    is the rate of time preference, n is the economy's population

growth rate, u is a consumption share preference parameter, and p deter-

mines both the elasticity of substitution between consumption of the two

different goods at a point in time and consumption of the same good at

different points in time. All variables in the model are expressed per-

capita. A similar function holds for the foreign country with subscripts

F on all the variables.

       The home country's budget constraint is given by:
                                             t

Equation (2) states that the present value of domestic expenditures on

the two commodities                 is the relative price of good 2) equals the

present value of total domestic assets, A0. These assets include human
                                                                                                   32




capital H0, as well as claims to physical assets K10, K20, and z0. The

doiiiestic capital stocks in industries 1 and 2 at time zero are K10 and K20

respectively. The term z0 corresponds to domestic ownership of industry

l's capital in the foreign country. Since there is no uncertainty in this

model and returns on investment are equated world-wide, domestic residents

are indifferent between holding foreign capital in industry 1 or in

industry 2. Hence,there is no behavioral consequence for the model in

assuming that domestic residents concentrate their foreign portfolio in

industry 1

      Maximization of (1) subject to (2) yields the demand expressions:

                                                      t

In the steady state per-capital consumption of each of the two goods stays

constant; hence, r                ci. in the steady—state. A similar set of equations

hold for the foreign country.

      The supply relationships of this model are derived by noting that

firms maximize the present value of profits.                             In industry 1, for example,

profits are given by:
                                                           t

        =                                                           dt

 In (5)             is industry l's total investment expenditure in year t inclusive

of adjustment costs. We let                  stand for the actual installation of new

units of capital and parameterize the investment relationship in (6):


 (6)                        +
        'it



The second term on the right hand side of (6) reflects the costs of varying

the level of the industry's capital stock and exhibits increasing marginal

costs to such activity. The industry increases its net capital stock

according to formula (7) where d is the depreciation rate.


                =

Maximization of (5) subject to (6) and (7) leads to the following first

       Equations corresponding to the three above hold for the production

decisions of foreign firms. Under the assumption of linear homogeneous

production technologies, the marginal prOduct terms, e.g., FL1 and FK1

can be written as functions of their respective capital labor ratios, e.g.,

K1t

       The equilibrium conditions for this economy, (14), (15), and (16),

reflect, respectively, the requirements of full employment, international

financial arbitrage, and market clearance.

 The DIV terms in (15) correspond to the dividend paid out by the firm and

 are implicitly defined in equations (10) and (13) for the home country.

tions for the home economy:

equilibrium values of r, —, w,            and P. The foreign analogues to (19)
              K1              Ll      2
determines          which, in turn, determines w as in (20). Given wE,
                                                  I                          I
              L1F
the foreign equivalents to equation (21) and (22) give two equations in P
    K2F
and i—. But since P is determined in (18) through (22), the model is seemingly
    L2F
overdetermined. However, if the foreign and domestic technologies are

identical ,   the   pre-determined value of P is the solution value for these

foreign equations as well. If technologies are identical, then w =
                                                                                 WE

in the steady state. If technologies are not identical, specialization must

occur in the long run. This is simply a restatement of the standard

analysis of the static trade model with internationally mobile

capital.

     Another feature of equations (18 )      through   (22 )   and their foreign

counterparts in that there is nothing in these equations that pins down

the absolute level of the capital stock in each country in each industry.

This is the standard Rybczynski result, but there is a twist. Given a

steady state distribution of the world's capital stock, steady state

equilibrium requires that the distribution remain constant. Any departure

from the steady state distribution would require additional non-remunerative

adjustment costs and, hence, would not be incurred.

     While the final steady state international distribution of the worlds

capital stock cannot be determined from the steady state equation above,

the steady state distribution is determined by the world economy's initial

conditions. Consider some perturbation of the initial steady state level

of capital in any of the four industries in the model. Profit maximization
                                                                           37




will involve choosing that transition path back to steady state equilibrium

that, ceteris paribus, involves the smallest present value of adjustment

costs. Since the adjustment costs depend on the actual capital in place,

the placement of incremental capital will be determined by the initial

placement of capital .   Hence, the final steady state capital stock distribu-

tion will be a function of the initial capital stock distribution.

                                Simul ations


      The dynamic model presented above was simulated for a set of

technological and preference parameter values under the assunìption

of myopic expectations. The authors are still developing procedures

for   conducting these simulations for the case of rational expectations.
To implement the myopic expectations assumption, the equations pre-
sented above are rewritten with all price variables reflecting

changes set equal to zero. Thus economic agents act as if they

believe that current prices will remain at their current values

forever. While a systematic comparison of rational expectations with

myopic expectations remains to be done, there is good reason to believe

that simulations based on myopic expectation will exhibit faster con-

vergence to the new steady state than will similations based on rational

expectations. The reason is simply that agents will not take sufficient

account of future general equilibrium dampening effects on prices in making

current investment and consumption decisions. For example, an increase

today in the marginal revenue product of an industry will be taken to last

forever, when in fact the increased industry investment that will occur

today will reduce that commodity's relative price as well as marginal

physical product in the future. Hence, there will be an overreaction to

exogenous shocks in a myopic expectations model that will more quickly

return the economy to long run equilibrium.

       the simulation parameters are given the following initial values; the

capital coefficient in the assumed Cobb-Douglas production functions in both

industries equals .3, depreciation rates equal .03, the consumption preference
                                                                                39




     share is .5, the time preference rate is equal to .1, the value of p is .5,
-


    and the population growth rate is equal to zero. The adjustment cost coef-

     ficient, y, is set to 5. This value implies that 7 percent of steady

    state investment corresponds to adjustment cost expenditure.

          Initial steady state values of the model are calibrated by simulating

    the model until a steady state is reached starting with initial values of

    all capital stocks in both countries equal to 1.8. The initial value of z,

    domestic ownership of foreign assets, is set equal to zero.

         The final steady state that was generated based on these country symmetric

    initial values was itself symmetrical across countries. The capital stock

    in industry 1 at home and abroad, Kl and K1F, obtained long run values

    of 1.586. The long run values for K2 and KLF were 1.414. In both countries

    53 percent of the labor force is allocated to the production of commodity 1.

    That more resources are devoted in the long run to the production of

    commodity one is not surprising given that commodity one serves as both

    a consumption good and the world's single capital good. The steady

    state interest rate is .1 , equal to the pure rate of time preference, ,

    and the steady state wage is .923. The fact that production functions in

    both industries are identical implies that the steady state relative price,

    P, equals unity.

         The first experiment conducted involved a 25 percent reduction in the

value of Kl ,    the domestic country's capital in industry 1.     Figures III and

IV illustrate the transition path of wages and capital stocks back to the

steady state. Table XII presents the values of various endogeneous variables

for different years along the transition path. The year 80 is taken as the

first year of the transition. As the figure and table indicate, domestic

wages fall by seven percent in the first year after the capital

stock reduction. Interestingly foreign wages are also reduced

in the first year after the capital stock reduction, but only by two percent.

Wages rebound quite promptly in this simulation. After four years half of

the gap between the initial value of w, .907, and its final value of .973

has been closed.

     As mentioned, the economy's history determines the final steady

state distribution of the world's capital stock. In this case Kl is per-

manently reduced from its initial steady state magnitude of 1 .586 to a new

steady state value of 1.482. Final steady state K1F is 1.690. This long

run relative capital stock distribution between the two countries is reversed

in the case of capital in industry 2. The home country ends up with 15

percent more capital in industry 2 than the foreign country. There is an

associated 6 percent long run reduction in domestic employment in industry

1 and a 6 percent increase in domestic employment in industry 2. These

domestic changes, however, take place gradually. The first year there is

only a 3 percent employment reallocation. The foreign employment effects

are more pronounced. Employment in foreign industry 1 rises by over 8 per-

cent in the first year to .573 and then gradually declines to .563. L2F

falls immediately from .471 to .427 and then rises slowly to .437.

     These long run changes make intuitive sense. The reduction in capital

in domestic industry 1 lowers the world capital labor ratio. Demand for

capital is stimulatedboth at home and abroad. The relative price of good 2

falls by 5 percent in the first year after the capital shock. This higher

relative price of good 1 raises q1 and q- and induces more investment in
                                                                              44




industry 1 both home and abroad.      q1 rises initially 'to 1.356, 20

percent above its long run value of 1.125.        rises to 1.19. The reason

for this differential is the higher initial foreign wages. These relatively higher

foreign wages coupled with the low price of good 2 depress the foreign stock

market price of industry 2,         by 15 percent. q2, on the other hand,

only falls by 3 percent, again primarily because of the lower domestic

wages. These stock market revaluations lead to accelerated investment

in the capital goods industry at home and abroad and to actual short run

world wide disinvestment in industry 2. This disinvestment is more

pronounced in the foreign country.      Net capital formation is negative for

6 years following the shock in industry 2 abroad, it is negative for only

one year for home industry 2. FigurelV indicates that capital stocks can

overshoot their final steady state values.       K2F provides an example of

this; it reaches its minimum value about 8 years after the capital shock.

     Domestic ownership of foreign assets, z, moves from an initial steady

state value of zero to a final steady state value of -.20. This means

that foreigners end up owning 6 percent of the domestic capital stock

and are permanently better off than domestic residents.

     To determine how the rate of wage convergence depends on the adjust-

ment cost parameter, i, a simulation identical to that just presented was

performed for y =   8;   this constitutes a 60 percent increase in adjustment

costs relative to the first simulation and implies that 11 percent of steady

state investment is spent on capital installation costs. Despite the

higher adjustment costs, international wage convergence still occurs quite

rapidly. Half of the gap between initial domestic wages and long run
                                                                             45




wages is closed within 6 years. About 6 years is also required for K1

to close half of the gap between its initial and terminal values. The

general characteristics of the capital stocks transition paths are quite

similar to those of the previous sample.

     Figures V and VI ëpict the transition paths of domestic and foreign

wages as well as capital stocks in response to a shock to the system con-

sisting of a 25 percent reduction in domestic capital in both industries.

As one might expect, initial domestic wages fall by more than in the previous

case in which only K1 is reduced. However, the marginal reduction in domestic

wages is not very great. First year domestic wages fall by 7 percent when

K1 alone is reduced by 25 percent; they fall by 9 percent when both K1 and

K2 are reduced by 25 percent. Since the reduction in K2 eliminates part of

the relative scarcity of commodity 1, the first year relative price falls

by only 2 percent, rather than 5 percent. This appears to have an impact

on long run K2F. In contrast with our first simulation, long run K2F

is now greater than its initial value. Long run K1 ends up slightly higher

than its initial long run value as well.

     Simulations were next performed based on the same initial set of

parameter values with the exception of the capital coefficient in the produc-

tion functions of industry 2 both at home and abroad. This coefficient was

set equal to .4 rather than .3. Additional simulations were run with varying

values of the consumption share p,   the time preference parameter y, and

the preference parameter p. The general pattern of transitional response

to capital stock shocks in these exercises was quite similar to those described

above. Capital stocks essentially reach long run equilibrium values within

20 years; wages are extremely close to their long run values after 25 years.

     The final simulation conducted represents an attempt to roughly

reenacted world conditions as of the early 1960's. The developed European

countries and Japan are taken as the foreign country, while the U.S. is

taken to be the home country. Learner's (1980) data on national endow-

ments indicates that in the early 1960's the U.S. labor force was half that

of the European developed countries plus Japan, while it's capital stock

was roughly equal in size. Foreign capital labor ratios were, therefore,

about half of U.S. capital labor ratios. To incorporate these facts,

the model was altered to give the foreign country twice the labor

force of the home country. Next a simulation was performed taking the

initial capital labor ratios in the foreign country to be half those of the

home country.

     In contrast with their terminal steady state values of .973, the foreign

country's wage in the first year of the transition is .767 while the home

country's wage is .945. The initial wage differential between the

two countries is almost 20 percent; after 5 years the wage gap has closed

to 6 percent. While the home and foreign wage differential is sizable, it

falls far short of the actual wage differential observed in the early 1960's

between the U.S. and her principle trading partners (see Figure II). On the

other hand the model predicts a fairly rapid convergence of international wages,

which is a striking feature of the postwar data (see Figure II).

     It is interesting to note that increasing the size of the foreign

country in terms of its labor force makes the home country wages more

sensitive to foreign developments. If the foreign country were the same

size as the home country initial home country wages would have been .773

rather than .767 and foreign wages would have been .952 rather than .945.
                                                                               49




 Throughout these simulations the world ratio of capital to labor has af-

 fected a country's wages even given its own capital-labor ratio.    In this

 example the larger is the foreign country, the larger is the reduction in

the world capital labor ratio associated with a given percentage reduction

 in the foreign country's capital-labor ratio.

     These simulation exercises have important implications for wage and

measured productivity growth. One conventional measure of productivity

growth is output per man hour.   In the model presented here output per

man hour can be written as a function of the economy's wage; hence,

productivity growth and wage growth are equivalent here. The exercises

indicate that during a period of international economic transition, wages

in countries with low levels of capital per worker will grow at much faster

rates than those with high capital labor ratios. In the simulation just

mentioned, for example, foreign wages grow by 5 percent in the first year

of the transition while domestic wages grow by less than .5 percent.

     The general picture that emerges from these simulations is one

of fairly rapid international wage equalization as well as capital

stock restoration; these processes are consistent with the international

data described in section I. The simulations suggest that the inter-industry

reallocation of the labor force associated with international capital stock

shocks of the kind associated with World War II can be substantial

in magnitude and persist indefinitely.

     Future research will explore the extent to which the rate of inter-

national wage convergence depends on the expectations mechanism assumed.

It may well be the case that international economic convergence is a

much slower process for rational expectations economies than for myopic

expectations economies.

III. Empirical Analysis of Investment, Employment and Wages

       This section uses United Nations Industrial Statistics to test a number

of theoretical relationships posited in the model of section II. The data

covers the years 1967 to 1977 and details levels of employment, investment,

value   added, and wages for the set of manufacturing industries included
in   the tables of section I.      The country coverage is somewhat limited
due to non-reporting of data. While certain countries are omitted in

certain regressions because of lack of data, our basic set of countries

include   the western developed economies of Europe and North America pluS

Japan, Korea, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Australia, New Zealand, the
Phillipines, Turkey and Greece.


                         Determinants   of International Investment
       The putty-clay growth model of section II suggests that the rate

of investment may be expressed as a linear function of Tobin's q, the ratio

of the industry's market value to its replacement cost:


                 I

(1)
                     t

In the absence of stock market data detailing the industry's market price

we express      as the discounted value of total current profits divided by

the current capital stock:



(2)
                                                                                           51




This formulation of        is appropriate for the case of myopic expectations,

but should serve as a reasonable proxy for the case of rational expecta-

tions as well.

for our 23 industries. Profits,                  is    computed as an industry's value

added less its total employee compensation. The investment and profit

series were first converted to dollars using annual exchange rates and then

deflated by the U.S. non-residential fixed investment deflator. This proce-

dure insures that the replacement cost of capital is always unity. The

real interest rate, r, is assumed fixed over the 10 year time period.

between investment rates and profit rates. 40 of the 46 profit coefficients

exhibit the correct sign. 3] of these coefficients are significant at the

5 percent level .     Only 2 of the 6 coefficients with incorrect signs are

statistically significant.

     The absolute value of the coefficient on current and lagged profits

are quite close in magnitude as the specification would suggest. Investment

in the pottery/glass products industry is most sensitive to profitability.

For this industry, a dollar increase in current profits leads to a 23 cent

increase in current investment. If we take V in equation (3) to be of the

order of .1, then , the coefficient of q in (1) is .023. The order of

magnitude of this coefficient accords well with Summers (1980) regression

findings. Summers (1980) examines the response of corporate investment rates

to values of q adjusted for taxes. His most preferred regression equation

(Table 2, equation 5) produces a coefficient of .027. The Table

suggest quite large costs of adjustment and, therefore, slower rates of wage

convergence from those simulated above. The .023 coefficient implies that

a 50 percent increase in stock market values would generate less than a 2

percent increase in the industry's investment rate.    In addition, steady

state adjustment costs equal almost 40 percent of total investment expendi-

tures when     is .023. The empirical evidence of large adjustment costs

implies that our static expectations model should be a fairly good approxi-

mation to the rational expectations model. In the limit as adjustment costs

become infinite the two models will yield identical results. The advantage

of the static expectations simulation model is that its computer costs are

significantly less than those of the rational expectations model.


                    The Effect of International Wage

                Differentials on International Investment


      Given a set of international commodity prices the model presented in

Section II suggests that differences in q's across countries for the same

industry should reflect international differences in wage rates.

      Under the myopic expectations assumption q equals:


(4)
               q=
      fr/K is the marginal revenue product of capital. For an industry that
                                                                            55



hires labor competitively, it/K can be related to the industry's wage rate,

w, according to the factor price frontier. For example, in the case of an

industry with Cobb-Douglas technology and capital coefficient of ct,


                              1/ c-l/a
                =
                    - ((l-a)P) w
Equations (4) and (5) suggest a cross-country regression of investment rates

on international wage rates. Since our data set does not include industry

specific capital stocks we could not directly run investment rates (invest-

ment divided by initial capital stocks) against international wage rates.

In addition there is no transformation of the equation such as in (3) that

generates a simple linear relationship between the variables in our data set.

In the absence of a satisfactory specification, we experimented with several

ad hoc time series specifications. The share of world investment in industry

i placed in country j was related to the country's lagged investment share

and the country's relative wage. Other regressions related the logarithm

of investment to its lagged value as well as to the logarithnof the wage.

     The results of these ad hoc specifications were quite disappointing.

For virtually all industries the wage variable coefficients were both the

wrong sign and very significant. Cross—country differences in wage rates

may be proxying for other unmeasurable factors that influence investment such

as country's degree of political stability There is also a strong presumption

that international differences in true wages are miss-measured; our data set

does not permit us to control for the quality in terms of education and exper-

ience of workers across countries. Hence, what appears to be a high relative

U.S. wage could in fact be a low relative wage per effective worker once ac-

count is taken of the amount of human capital embodied in the typical U.S.

worker.

               Determinants of Industrial Labor Demand


     The adjustment cost model of Section II assumes that capital is rela-

tively immobile in the short run. An obvious implication of this assump-

tion is that an industry's demand for labor depends on its capital stock in

place as well as the wages it has to pay.   In Table XIV we test this prop-

osition by running cross country regressions of industrial labor demand for

the year 1977. The measure of capital in each industry in each country for

1977 was derived by summing the net amount of capital in 1977 that resulted

from real investment flows during the period 1967 to 1977. A 5 percent rate

of depreciation was used in the calculations. These capital stock figures

clearly contain measurement error. This perpetual inventory method of com-

puting 1977 capital stocks takes the benchmark values of capital stocks in

1967 to be zero, which is obviously untrue. However, in the absence of such

benchmark data, the alternative is to use our "noisy' measure of the capital

stock as in Table XIV or to relate labor demand to investment flows. We tried

both procedures.

     The first regression procedure which is described in Table XIV worked

remarkably well. Despite the errors in variable problems, all 19 industries'

capital coefficients are highly significant and positive. The variables in

the regression are measured in logarithms. The fact that all of the capital

stock coefficients are close to unity lends support to the choice of the

Cobb-Douglas production function in the simulation models, since the Cobb-

Douglas function exhibits unity deiiiand elasticities with respect to the

level of capital. While the wage coefficients are smaller than those sug-

gested by the Cobb-Douglas specification (a coefficient of approximately -3),

18 of the 19 coefficients are significantly negative. Holding capital stocks
                                                                            57




 and world relative prices constant, countries with higher wage rates exhibit

 smaller demands for labor than countries with low wage rates.

      The second regression procedure involved relating annual industrial

 labor demands to current and past levels of investment. The relationship

 between current labor demand and current and lagged investment and wages

 implied by the logrithmjc labor demand equation of Table XII is highly non-

linear. Non-linear least squares was used to estimate the elasticities of

labor demand with respect to capital and wages with the annual investment

and wage data. The results were quite poor. While the wage coefficients

tended to exhibit negative signs and were of similar magnitude to those of

Table XIV, the estimated capital stock elasticities were positive, but quite

small, of the order of .10, for all industries.

     In addition to these attempts to relate annual labor demand to invest-

ruent flows, a series of ad hoc regressions were tried. For example, the

logrithm of labor demand was regressed on its lagged value and the current

and lagged values of the logrithms of investment and wages. While exhibiting

the correct sign, the investment coefficients were quite small in magnitude.

     To summarize these empirical results, for those specifications suggested

by the model that could be addressed in a straightforward manner with the

data available, the results are highly supportive of the assumptions under-

lying the model   international investment •responds to international differences

in profitability, the industrial employment of labor depends on the industrial

allocations of the capital stock, and labor demands are negatively related to

national wage levels.

               Conclusion and Ideas for Future Research


     A model of international trade with costly capital stock adjustment ap-

pears capable of explaining those patterns of factor price equalization, in-

ternational investment, and changes in comparative advantage that have

characterized the post-war period. The model presented here, while cap-

turing a good deal of the economics of transitional growth falls short

of capturing historical reality in three important respects. First, post-

war wage differentials have been substantially greater than those predicted

by the model. Second, certain countries such as Germany and Japan with

initially low levels of capital per worker have historically run surpluses

on current account. Our model predicts current account deficits for those

countries that are rapidly accumulating capital. Third, different countries

appear to have permanently different savings rates. The model presented

here implies that during the economic transition countries with lower than

average capital labor ratios will have higher than average savings rates, but

that savings rates will equalize in the long run. The Table IV figures in-

dicate only minor convergence of international savings rates in the last two

decades. Future research will address these issues in three ways. First,

the model described here will be altered to allow for acquisition of and

investment in technological knowledge. An optimal technology investment

function will be derived that is similar to those investment functions that

have been derived in the context of the acquisition of human capital. The

technology investment function will have the property that countries with

the least amount of technological knowledge will have the greatest incentive

to accumulate such knowledge. Initial international differences in tech-

nology will permit larger simulated values of initial wage differentials.

     The second shortcoming of the model, its prediction about current ac-

count balances, will be addressed by specifying government policies that

are aimed at "improving" the current account. The policies will include

export subsidies and taxes on the repatriation of income from capital.

While improving the current account these policies are likely to reduce

the welfare of domestic residents. Hence, the dynamic welfare costs of

such policies will be analyzed as well.

     Final y, international differences in savings rates can be analyzed

by including life cycle savers as well as infinite horizon utility maxi-

mizers in the model. With such a model, one could trace out the effects

of government deficit policies on current account balance and determine

the impact of a foreign stimulus to demand on domestic welfare.
