                                           ABSTRACT

Implementation of workplace policies--whether through enforcement of laws or administration of
programs--raises the question of the interaction between institutions created to carry out laws and
the activities of workplace based agents that directly (e.g. unions) or indirectly (e.g. insurance
companies) represent the interests of workers. This paper argues that there are two distinctive roles

required for agents in the implementation of workplace policies. First, the agent must somehow help

solve the public goods problem inherent in workplace regulation. Second, the agent must be able
to reduce the marginal cost of exercising rights conferred to workers that are an important feature
of most regulatory programs. This article examines these issues in regard to implementing
workplace policies in the U.S. and analyzes the comparative effectiveness of different workplace

agents- from labor unions to alternative dispute resolution systems- in fulfilling these roles.

I. Labor Market Institutions and the Regulation of Labor Markets

       The Committee recognizes that accomplishment of the purposes of this bill cannot be
       totally achieved without the fullest cooperation of affected employees.

               –Senate Report No. 91-1292, 91st Congress, 2d. Session (October 6, 1970), p. 10.

So concluded members of the Senate in drafting the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970.

Despite the fact that the new Act created an extensive government enforcement system charged

with improving workplace safety and health, the architects of OSHA recognized the centrality of

workers to its implementation. The same might be said for a gamut of federal and state labor

market regulation from the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to the Family Medical Leave Act

of 1993 to state workers compensation and unemployment benefit systems.

       As representatives of individual employees, labor market institutions can affect the

process workplace regulation in two very different ways. First, they can affect the political

process in passing legislation and through executive agencies in promulgating regulations—that

is, the enactment of labor policies. Second, they can affect the way that those laws and

regulations are enforced or administered—that is the implementation of laws.

       There is a significant literature on the role of interest groups in political processes that

can inform the specific question of what alternative institutions might play the role of “employee

lobbies” in the enactment of workplace policies. Although the specific constellation of factors

that underlie political coalitions around employment issues differ from those underlying other

public policy issues, the theoretical notions bounding the creation of such coalitions have

parallels with those in surrounding other areas of policy concern. 1 I therefore do not focus on the

role for new labor market intermediaries in the realm of policy enactment here.




                                                                                                      4
        Implementation of workplace regulations arises either from the enforcement of standards

created by that legislation or through the administration of programs created by legislation. For

example, the federal Davis-Bacon Act that establishes floors for wages in the construction

industry is implemented by enforcement actions that either directly or through deterrence effects

indirectly raise the wages paid by construction companies to the “prevailing wage” set for that

craft in a geographic market. Workers compensation legislation is implemented via

administrative activities in two ways: first through the incentive effect provided by experience

rating of employers covered by the system on safety policies and second by the filing of claims

by workers injured on the job.

        Implementation--whether through enforcement or administration--raises the question of

the interaction between institutions created by labor policies to carry out laws and the activities

of workplace based institutions that directly (e.g. unions) or indirectly (e.g. insurance companies)

represent the interests of workers. To examine the need for alternative workplace institutions in

this area of labor market activity requires one to establish what role institutions—regardless of

form—play in the first place. It then requires one to examine the relative abilities of different

types of institutions to play these roles.

        This paper argues that there are two distinctive roles required for agents in the

implementation of workplace policies. First, the agent must somehow help solve the public

goods problem inherent in workplace regulation. Second, the agent must be able to reduce the

marginal cost of exercising rights conferred to workers that are an important feature of most

regulatory programs. One of the major costs in this regard is that of employer discrimination

arising from exercise of those rights. Although a variety of institutions may be capable of

stepping into the fray and serving as agents in the enactment of legislation, the roles required for

                                                                                                       5
implementation are more difficult to embody in a labor market agent. Laying out the theoretical

requirements for such agents focuses attention on the features of “emerging labor market

institutions” most important to the implementation of workplace policies.

       This chapter begins with a discussion of federal labor regulations in the U.S. and the roles

they establish for workers through the provision of individually-based worker rights. It then

presents a model concerning the decision by workers to exercise those rights. Based on insights

from the model, it analyzes the requirements of workplace institutions in fulfilling those roles.

The third section evaluates a variety of labor market institutions--beginning with labor unions as

a benchmark—that potentially serve the role as agents. Based on this evaluation, the paper

concludes with a discussion of how policies might be adapted to foster agents better able to serve

the two central roles of labor market intermediaries in implementing labor regulations.


II. Individual Rights and the Need for Collective Agents

IIA. Federal regulations and worker rights

       Federal workplace regulations provide employees with important roles directly affecting

the implementation of those statutes. Much of workplace regulation dating back to Fair Labor

Standards Act (FLSA) of 1938 and going forward to the Family Medical Leave Act passed

almost sixty years later provides workers with an opportunity to participate in one or more

aspects of the regulatory process. Most important of those rights is that of triggering regulatory

activity itself. Although the right to trigger inspections dates back to some of the earliest state-

level labor legislation (Common and Andrews 1936), regulations promulgated during the two

most recent surges of workplace legislation / executive orders (in 1963-74 and 1986 - 1993) have

increased the number of regulations providing workers with a right to initiate civil actions under


                                                                                                       6
such laws as Title VII, ADA, PPA, and WARN. This has resulted in an enormous increase in the

number of cases filed under employment law, relative to other categories of litigation. 2

        Table 1 depicts a subset of these roles under Federal workplace regulations: the right to

initiate an agency action and the right to pursue private action in courts either as the first step in

seeking to change employer behavior or after administrative remedies have been exhausted.

Most federal legislation also establishes reporting / disclosure requirements that seek to inform

employees of their rights, employer duties; or employer performance under the statute (these are

depicted in the final two columns of Table 1). In addition to these rights, many workplace

statutes enumerate employee rights regarding participation in various stages of the regulatory

process, such as by providing workers (or their designated representatives) with a right to

accompany government officials during inspections (OSHA, MSHA), and to appeal decisions or

participate in hearings arising from inspections (OSHA, MSHA, CWHSSA).

        There is little reason to believe that workers uniformly exercise rights granted them under

labor policies. Studies in several different areas indicate that the propensity to exercise rights

varies along systematic lines across different groups. A number of empirical studies have shown

different propensities for individuals to litigate civil claims (see, for example, Hoyman and

Stallworth 1981, Shavell 1987). Other studies have documented factors affecting workers' use of

grievance procedures in union and nonunion workplaces (Peterson (1992); Feuille and Delaney

(1992 ); Chachere and Feuille (1993)). This literature suggests that factors related to the

individual (sex, education, demographic background), the workplace environment (size, degree

of conflict, management and union policies), and the specific grievance or civil problem

involved affect under what circumstances individuals use their rights. Given the limitations of

government resources towards enforcement, the conditions under which employees exercise their

                                                                                                         7
rights either to initiate suits or agency action fundamentally affect achievement of policy goals in

the workplace. In a somewhat different vein, labor market programs like workers compensation

and unemployment insurance require that workers initiate the process leading to the issuance of

benefits provided by those programs.



IIB. A Threshold Model of the Exercise of Individual Rights

       The degree to which individual employees exercise rights granted them under labor

regulations can be expected to depend on the perceived benefits versus costs of exercising rights

from the perspective of an individual worker. The benefits of exercising a right are a function of

the impact of labor legislation on the outcome of concern to the worker. For example, initiating

an OSHA inspection potentially improves working conditions for the worker by diminishing or

removing the risk of an injury or illness. The greater the level of perceived risk faced by the

worker, the more likely they are to initiate an inspection or otherwise seek to affect redress of the

problem. Similarly, the greater the divergence between the wages paid to workers and the wages

that they are entitled to under the law (e.g. because of premium pay required for overtime), the

more likely a worker is to exercise rights to initiate actions under the FLSA.

       In order to ascertain the magnitude of these benefits, workers must acquire information

on the current and legally permissible level of a regulated outcome. The costs of exercising

rights are primarily a function of the costs of gathering this information. These are composed of

costs associated with: (a) obtaining information regarding the existence of basic rights as well as

the standards to which employers are held accountable 3 ; (b) gathering information on the current

state of workplace conditions—a particular problem if the risks are complex as in the case of

safety and health (Viscusi 1983, Viscusi and O'Connor 1984); and (c) learning about the specific

                                                                                                    8
details of how the law is administered (e.g. the procedures to initiate a complaint inspection). In

addition to information-related costs, workers face significant costs arising from potential

employer retaliation (the economic losses associated with retaliatory reassignment or, in the

extreme, being fired 4 ) as well as the potential cost of job loss arising from the chance that

compliance will force a firm to reduce employment in the long run.

         The decision facing a worker on whether or not to exercise a right is represented

diagrammatically in Figure 1. The horizontal axis, Xj represents the difference between current

workplace conditions (e.g. exposure to a health risk; actual wage rate for hours of work) and the

regulatory standard fo r that workplace outcome for workplace j. The value of Xj is defined

where:



                Xj < 0: If the current workplace provides conditions above permissible levels (i.e.
                        the firm goes beyond compliance required by the standard);
                Xj = 0: If the current workplace provides conditions equal to the required levels
                        (i.e. the firm is exactly in compliance with the law);
                Xj > 0: If the current workplace provides conditions below permissible levels (i.e.
                        the firm is out compliance).

This means that as Xj increases, a workplace falls further out of compliance with the regulatory

requirement. In the case of health and safety regulations, this means that as Xj increases, worker

exposure to risk increasingly goes beyond the risk levels if workplaces complied with standards;

for regulations related to compensation like FLSA or Davis-Bacon, this means that actual pay

increasingly falls below that required under the statute. For a program like workers

compensation, increases in Xj imply that the earnings received by the injured worker diverge

more and more from those he or she is entitled by the program.




                                                                                                      9
       Given this definition of Xj, the figure presents two marginal benefit functions. The lower

function (MBi) represents the marginal worker i in a workplace j who has the highest individual

preference for compliance with the regulatory standard. As such, this function represents the

worker who will first exercise his or her statutory right in the workplace. I assume that the

marginal benefit of exercising a right that moves the firm into greater compliance with the

standard is positive and increasing in Xj.

       Since a violation of a workplace standard typically affects many workers and is often

associated with violations of other standards that might not directly affect the worker triggering

the inspection, employee exercise of workplace rights displays positive externalities.    Because

of this, the marginal benefit for the workplace as a whole is always higher than that of the

marginal worker for any Xj .The upper marginal benefit function in Figure 1 represents workers

at the workplace as a whole (MBj), and reflects the vertical aggregation of benefits for all

affected workers for any given state Xj. 5

       Figure 1 first presents a simple case where the costs of exercising a right are invariant

across the different levels of Xj and the same for an individual worker as they are for the

workplace as a whole (the upper line, where MC i = MC j ). If rights are vested at the individual

level, worker i will choose to exercise the rights at the state of the workplace Xi* where MBi =

MC i. Given that the decision is made by the marginal worker with the greatest preference

workplace conditions consonant with regulatory standards (i.e. the lowest tolerance for current

conditions being out of compliance), Xi* represents the level of non-compliance that will trigger

the exercise of rights for that workplace, when left to the decision of this “threshold” individual

worker.



                                                                                                    10
        Given the public good character of the benefits ensuing from the exercise of rights, Xi* is

not optimal for the workplace as a whole, because the marginal worker decides only on the basis

of his or her individual preference. Accounting for all workers in the workplace, the optimal

threshold in Figure 1 is Xj* , where Xi* > Xj* . That is, the exercise of right taken at the

individual level leads to a "higher" threshold (i.e. current conditions being more out of

compliance with standards) than the threshold that would prevail if the preferences of all workers

were considered. Workplace rights therefore will be underutilized because the collective

benefits arising from their action are not factored into the individual decision.

        If the cost of exercising a right exhibits increasing returns to scale, such as because of

efficiencies gained from collecting information at the workplace, or multi- workplace level, the

divergence between threshold for an individual versus collective group of workers grow even

further. Protections against discrimination for exercise of rights afforded by a method of

collectively exercising rights may represent a second reason that the marginal cost of exercise

may be far lower for a group of workers. In either case, this situation is depicted in Figure 1 as

MC j', the lower dotted horizontal line, which is below the marginal cost function faced by an

individual. The collective threshold for exercise of rights now occurs at Xj**, arising in an even

larger gap from the individual threshold for exercising the right, Xi*.

        Thus, the problem arising from the structure of workplace regulations is that if left to the

individual worker, the threshold for exercise of rights lies above the threshold optimal from the

workplace—and societal—level. In order to close this gap, one must surmount the problem of

(1) aggregating preferences across workers and (2) reducing the marginal cost of exercise of

those rights.



                                                                                                     11
IIC. Workplace Agents and the Exercise of Rights

        A collective workplace agent can potentially solve the problem described above. It can

do so first by internalizing the positive externality to workers arising from a claim as a

representative of all workers in the unit. A workplace agent can also gather and disseminate

information thereby lowering the cost of information acquisition faced by individuals. The

specific elements required of such an agent are straightforward and flows from the threshold

model in Figure 1:

        1) Interests allied with workers--specifically an interest in representing the collective

        preferences of workers in regard to working conditions;

        (2) A means of efficiently gathering and disseminating information on rights,

        administrative procedures, and the nature of workplace risks;

        (3) A method of providing protection from employer discrimination against individual

        workers for their exercise of rights. 6


The need for an agent to play these roles points to a conundrum embedded in many workplace

regulations. Although many of the policies listed in Table 1 create rights focused on the

individual worker, exercise of individually-based rights requires an agent operating in the

collective interest.

        The above discussion also raises a related issue often overlooked in examining workplace

regulation. One cannot detach the role of “command and control” regulatory systems from the

operation of labor market institutions, even where labor market intermediaries are not explicitly

set out in the legislation as the explicit agent for implementation. It is often assumed that under

traditional regulatory structures, the government alone acts as the agent of enforcement. Yet as


                                                                                                      12
the review of labor regulations and the threshold model indicates, implementing workplace

policies includes a role for workers and in that way for labor market intermediaries. The fact that

an important avenue for enforcement of those laws is the exercise of individual rights belies a

more complex interaction built into the structure of regulatory systems.


III. Alternative Labor Market Institutions

IIIA. Unions and the Enforcement of Labor Policies

       While a number of different arrangements can potentially satisfy the conditions for a

workplace agent, labor unions potentially fulfill many of them through their basic agency

functions. 7 Specifically, unions act as purveyors of workplace-based public goods regarding

labor policies both by internalizing the benefits relating to worker exercise of rights across

workers in the unit and by lowering the costs of information acquisition.

       As the elected representative of workers, a union has incentives to act on behalf of the

collective interests of members in the bargaining unit. This means that a union will not base

perceptions of the benefit of pursuing a claim under laws based on the preferences of an

individual worker at the margin, but based on infra- marginal evaluations of those benefits. In

facing this allocation problem, a union can vertically aggregate preferences for the "public

goods" represented by workplace regulations, following the model of public goods seminally

described in Samuelson (1955). 8

       Unions can efficiently gather and disseminate information on the existence of workplace

laws and rights created by those laws. Unions provide this information formally through

educational programs, in apprenticeship training, or through supplying educational materials.

Informally, union leaders or staff can alert members of their rights where a problem or issue


                                                                                                  13
arises. Unions also provide information on the existence of specific underlying problems,

particularly in the area of safety and health (see Viscusi 1983). This information may be

collected and disseminated through formal programs or channels, or informally via the union

structure or fellow workers.

       Unions also offer individual workers assistance in the actual exercise of their rights. This

may result from the operation of committees established under collective bargaining, as is

common in safety and health or via the help of union staff who can trigger inspections, oversee

pension fund investments, or assist members file unemployment claims. Most importantly,

unions can substantially reduce the costs associated with potential employer discrimination by

helping affected employees to use anti-discrimination provisions of the labor policies and

providing this protection via collective bargaining agreements regulating dismissals. The formal

protection offered by a collective agreement provides security unavailable in the vast majority of

nonunion workplaces, even where a grievance procedure exists (Feuille and Delaney 1992).

       Thus, if unions act on behalf of the collective preferences of the workers in the

bargaining unit, they can be expected to induce greater usage of rights. This sets up a testable

empirical hypothesis: Government labor market policies should be more fully implemented in

unionized workplaces than in otherwise comparable nonunion workplaces.

       This hypothesis can be tested by examining empirical studies of labor market regulations

that have measured union / nonunion differences in implementation. Table 2 summarizes

evidence of union impacts on both enforcement and compliance under a wide array of labor

policies. It confirms the predicted presence of systematic differences between union versus

nonunion enforcement and compliance outcomes across diverse labor regulations and workplace

policies. This includes regulations dating back to early labor legislation like the Fair Labor

                                                                                                   14
Standards Act, where unions appreciably raise the probability of compliance with premium pay

for overtime. Unions also increase an array of enforcement outcomes and compliance with health

and safety standards under both OSHA and MSHA, as well as provisions of ERISA. Unions also

raise enforcement and compliance under some of the newest labor policies such as the Worker

Adjustment and Retraining Act (WARN), Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and the

Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Finally, unions substantially increase the probability that

workers will receive benefits that they are eligible for under the two major workplace programs

administered at the state level: unemployment insurance and workers compensation. 9 Thus, with

the exception of their neutral impact on contract compliance reviews under EO 11246, empirical

studies of labor market enforcement indicate that unions act as agents that assist employee

exercise of rights.

        This review suggests that unions seem capable of surmounting the problem of the

divergence between individual and collective exercise of rights under many different regulatory

policies. This provides a useful benchmark to compare other potential agents that might play this

role in the absence of union presence at the workplace.


        How do other labor market intermediaries stack up in solving the problem posed by the

individual versus collective exercise of rights? We evaluate six potential intermediaries below,

each evaluated along the same three dimensions developed in Section II. The following sections

do not provide an exhaustive review of these mechanisms, many of which are discussed

elsewhere in this volume. The intention instead is to examine each of the alternatives against the

two dimensions described above and indicate the relative strengths and weaknesses of each.




                                                                                                15
This provides an analytic backdrop for the other papers that look into some of these mechanisms

in greater depth.



IIIB. National issue organizations / Legal service organizations

       Christine Jolls (2000) describes the activities of national issue organizations that deal at

least in part with employment law (e.g. ACLU; NAACP Legal Defense Fund; National

Employment Law Project) and legal service organizations (primarily the organizations

administered by the Legal Services Corporation, created by Congress in 1974) as alternative

institutions that assist employees exercise their rights. The role of national issue and legal service

organizations lie either in terms of their impact on the public goods problem or in lowering the

costs of exercise of rights (including the costs arising from employer discrimination).

       Both types of organizations can act on the public goods aspect of the problem to the

extent that they can serve as an agent to aggregate preferences for collective actions or lead

workers to do so. One obvious mechanism for legal organizations to do so is by undertaking

class action suits on behalf of groups of workers. Illustrative of this role are several recent cases

of legal organizations doing so on behalf of agricultural workers and apparel workers in regard to

violations arising under the FLSA (citation).

       What incentives and capacities do these organizations have to play this role? The

evidence presented in Jolls suggests that the nature of funding for the two organizations creates

incentives that lead both organizations away from the role of solving the workplace public goods

problem. National interest organizations tend to focus on fundraising and involvement in high

profile litigation focused on setting larger legal precedent. Legal service organizations, in

contrast, tend to focus on specific cases that arise from individuals coming to those

                                                                                                      16
organizations. Thus, national interest organizations focus on “high profile, publicly-charged

issues…[working on] a few influential cases” while legal service organizations “tend to work on

many routine cases...” (pp. 30-31).

         The different character of the subject matter of legal activities suggests a fundamental

agency problem in both organizations that undermine them from playing a role analogous to that

of labor unions in the workplace. National interest organizations act at least in part as agents of

their principal sources of funding—private donors and foundations. Those parties seek to

maximize their investment (donations / grants) in terms of public impact (or at least perceptions

of public impact). This tends to push those organizations away from workplace- level

interventions and towards cases involving major precedent and public controversy.

         Legal service organizations, in contrast, are agents of their very different funding source,

the U.S. Congress. Although Congress cannot be considered a principle with a single utility

function, Jolls’ evidence is consistent with a story that the long term coalition necessary to

sustain funding is one where the median Congressional voter seeks to focus those organizations

on the modest goal of lowering the cost faced by low income individuals in pursuing civil

claims. The median Congressional voter however has historically rejected the notion that legal

services should act as an agent for larger groupings of individuals. 10 In this view, legal service

organizations might lower the marginal cost of exercise of rights, but only on an ad hoc basis,

driven by the individual worker decision to approach legal services for assistance in the first

place.




                                                                                                      17
IIIC. Other public interest organization

       There are many other public interest groups that have been organized to deal with the

workplace issues, with less focus on legal assistance than the organizations studied by Jolls.

These include “COSH” groups (Committees on Safety and Health) organized in a number of

states focused on safety and health; disabled workers groups focused on issues of workers

compensation, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and to a lesser extent OSHA; and groups

focused on workplace regulations affecting low wage workers in specific industries (e.g.

“sweatshop” problems in apparel; child labor problems in agriculture or retail). One activity of

many of these groups is lobbying and participating in legislative and executive forums at the

state- and federal- level. In this capacity, they attempt to affect either the enactment of laws /

regulations or appropriations towards existing programs, as opposed to the implementation issues

of central interest here (see Hersch 2000 for discussion of the role of new labor market

institutions on legislative enactment).

       However, a second set of activities pursued by these groups is direct worker assistance.

In the 1970s, for example, many COSH groups formed in states to provide information and

assistance to workers under OSHA. The intention of many of these groups was to provide

workers—in particular nonunion workers—with information regarding their rights under the

newly passed act. A comparable group was formed for nonunion miners to assist them exercise

rights under MSHA (McAteer 1985).

       These groups tend to receive their donations from a mix of labor unions (a significant

source of funding for COSH and disabled worker groups in particular), foundations, and small

individual workers / donors. The importance of labor unions as a funding source as well as small

donors (often those with a personal connection to the issue) tends to lessen the agency problem

                                                                                                     18
discussed in regard to either national interest or legal service organizations. This potentially

leads to better alignment between the objectives of the groups and those of the workers they

intend to assist. 11

        The main difficulty facing these groups is that they operate outside of the workplace,

although one of their intentions is to help solve the public goods problem that exist within it.

This limits their potential impact on the exercise of rights primarily to an informational role—

that is towards reducing the marginal costs of exercise of rights. However, even here their

impact is modest: Their lack of presence at the work site means that they can have limited impact

on the threat of discrimination arising from exercise of rights, perhaps the highest cost facing

workers. It is noteworthy that COSH groups in many states have concentrated much of their

efforts over time in their work in conjunction with unions and unionized workplaces, where they

take advantage of an established agent (comparable to the effects of workplace committees

described below). 12

        The threshold problem presented by workers compensation and unemployment insurance

is somewhat different than that posed by OSHA or MSHA. Here, the public goods aspects of

providing information and assistance regarding benefits are somewhat less than in regulatory

programs (that is, the benefits provided by the program look less like public goods). The

threshold problem therefore arises more from the difference between the marginal costs of

disseminating information to workers on a collective versus individual basis. The potential for

employer discrimination is also much less for these benefit programs, in part because the their

financing (and therefo re the potential costs to employers) is disconnected from the provision of

benefits. As a result, the network of disabled worker organizations can potentially play a more

fruitful role —outside of the workplace—in providing information on the availability of benefits

                                                                                                    19
and assistance in filing claims. Although alternative institutions potentially could assist workers

in the area of unemployment insurance in a comparable way, there is an absence of a large

network of such organizations in this realm. 13



IIID. Mandated Workplace Committees:

       A number of states mandate that employers establish workplace safety and health

committees. Rogers (1995, p. 388) describes the potential role of such mandated committees

succinctly:

       In principle, a system that lodges responsibility for monitoring compliance with health
       and safety committees, who should be better informed about problems than government
       inspectors, and that gives those committees some authority to address problems should
       enlist the knowledge of regulated actors in findings ways in particular settings of
       satisfying publicly determined standards. That is does so in a context of declared
       representation rights, moreover, mitigates use of costly litigation.


As suggested by this quote, workplace committees conceivably fulfill the two roles for a

workplace intermediary for implementing labor policies. First, by being mandated by the

government (rather than voluntarily adopted by employers) the committee can serve as an agent

of employees at the workplace. In this way, it has an intrinsic interest in vertically aggregating

preferences for the public goods created by workplace regulations. Second, a well functioning

committee can provide information on worker rights, workplace conditions, and administrative

procedures, thereby lowering MC j. Finally, a workplace committee might also provide a

protective shield for individual workers who might be more inclined to report problems before,

during, or after inspections than they would in the absence of such committees. As a result,

mandating committee structures potentially fulfill the major roles described above.



                                                                                                     20
        The primary question in evaluating workplace committees concerns whether mandated

committees function effectively. One major concern comes back to the agency problem: If

workers view the committee primarily as a creature of the employer, the nature of the agency

relation between the committee and workers is weakened, and it will be less effective in its

public goods provision role, as well as in lowering the perceived costs arising from

discrimination. A second question concerns its capacities to undertake activities effectively

(even if it functions independently of the employer). This will affect its ability to appreciably

lower the marginal costs of exercising rights.

        The experience of mandated health and safety committee in the state of Oregon provide

one indication of the determinants of their effectiveness. Weil (1999) examines the impact of

committee mandates on the union effect on OSHA enforcement. Comparing OSHA inspection

outcomes for two years preceding and following implementation of committee mandates, he

finds that mandated committees significantly increase the differential between union and

nonunion enforcement, arising from considerable strengthening of enforcement activity in union

workplaces and only modest increases in enforcement in nonunion workplaces. The only

exception to this is in the case of large nonunion establishments where committees have more

appreciable impacts on enforcement activity.

        The results suggest that mandated committees do not represent a simple solution to the

problem of finding alternative workplace institutions to help implement labor policies.

Effectiveness in filling the roles laid out in Figure 1 is a function of at least two factors. First,

the regulations mandating committees in the first place must allow the establishment of

independent workplace structures. Safety and health committee mandates vary enormously in

terms of their delegated roles, authority, and the methods in which they are established (see

                                                                                                        21
Bernard (1995); Reilly, Paci, and Holl (1995); Rogers (1995); U.S. GAO (1992)). Second,

committee effectiveness is related to antecedent conditions in the workplace itself, in particular

characteristics of workforce that affect committees’ capacity to take on its activities as well as its

ability to function independently. In addition to the size of the workplace, factors might include

worker turnover, skill and education level, and factors affecting informal worker organization.



IIIE. Third Party Monitors

        In recent years, the use of third party monitors as regulatory agents has been discussed as

a possible solution to limited government enforcement resources. Proposals for the use of third

party monitors (such as accounting firms) in the area of safety and health gained public attention

and became the subject of criticism when it appeared as part of Vice President Al Gore’s

“Reinventing Government” proposals for the federal sector.

        In more recent years, third party monitors have been used as part of innovative efforts for

enforcing the Fair Labor Standards Act provisions on minimum wage and overtime in the U.S.

apparel industry. In particular, the Department of Labor has secured agreement by apparel

manufacturers to use third parties to monitor aspects of compliance with the FLSA as part of

larger settlement agreements with the Department. The role of these monitors is to be able to

conduct surprise inspections on behalf of the manufacturer among subcontractors used by the

manufacturer. The results of the inspections can be used by the manufacturer to monitor cases

where non-compliant contractors are violating the Act, thereby exposing the manufacturer to

civil penalties and more importantly supply disruptions (U.S. Department of Labor 1999).

        Monitors can either be drawn from the private sector (accounting firms; for-profit

enterprises specifically created for this function) or the not- for-profit sector (that is, independent

                                                                                                     22
organizations that created to act as workplace monitors). In the case of monitors created under

“Compliance Program Agreements” between the U.S. Department of Labor and apparel

manufacturers, their structure, funding, and activities are negotiable, although the Labor

Department has “model provisions” that it encourages manufacturers to adopt (U.S. Department

of Labor 1998).

       The agency relations of third party monitors are complex in that—at least on paper--they

act as agents of government. However, in reality they are agents of other private parties who

have an interest in allowing them to take on certain quasi- governmental activity. In the area of

apparel, third party monitors are usually the agents of manufacturers who use them to monitor

their subcontractors in terms of compliance with minimum wage and overtime laws required by

FLSA. Manufacturers have the incentive to agree to use such outside monitors to ensure that

their sewing contractors comply with labor standards because of concern that noncompliance

with laws can lead their goods to be embargoed by the Department of Labor. Resulting delays in

shipments to retailers can have costly consequences to the manufacturer (Weil 2000). As a

result, the interests of third party monitors, though agents of the manufacturer, are also aligned to

some extent with those of the government. 14

       Third party monitors, then, may help deal with the threshold gap depicted in Figure 1

more in their capacity to supplement the enforcement activities of the Department of Labor, than

in their potential role as an institutional agent for workers. Although the presence of a third

party monitor raises the probability that a given workplace will be inspected, and that workers

might have an opportunity to report problems, the threshold problem is much the same as under

the traditional regulatory system. Monitors may, however, lower the marginal cost associated

with worker exercise of rights, particularly if they provide a “shield” against discrimination if

                                                                                                    23
workers bring labor standards violations to their attention. The degree to which they play this

role has in large part to do with the specific monitoring protocols negotiated between

manufacturers, monitors, and the government. Examining how different types of protocols affect

the exercise of rights and implementation of regulations presents an important area for future

study.



IIIF. Alternative dispute resolution systems

         On the surface, alternative dispute resolution (ADR) systems may not seem to fit the

description of an emerging labor market institution, in that ADR describes a process of resolving

disputes arising under workplace regulation rather than being a workplace entity per se. ADR

has been used in a variety of forums, but is discussed here in its specific use as a means for

resolving employment disputes arising under labor statutes through mediation, arbitration, or

some combination of the two (for an overview of the use of ADR in this capacity and others, see

Dunlop and Zack 1997, 2001).

         Under ADR, an employee seeks recourse to a problem such as discrimination via an

internal mediation / arbitration procedure rather than through the relevant agency or via the

courts. Because these procedures are administered within the company and rely, at least at initial

stages, on mediation, disputes can in theory be resolved more rapidly.

         Two major Supreme Court decisions, the Gilmer decision of 1991 and the Circuit City in

2001 raise the stakes of ADR as a means of resolving such claims. 15 Both Gilmer and Circuit

City extend the Federal Arbitration Act from its historic focus on commercial disputes to those

involving employment contracts. Specifically, they support the right of an employer to require

employees to sign pre-hire agreements compelling them to use company-sponsored dispute

                                                                                                  24
resolution (usually arbitration) for statutory disputes rather than using the administrative

channels established in the legislation (as described in Table 1). In effect, employees forgo their

right to pursue such claims through administrative channels as a condition of employment.

       Not surprisingly, the Gilmer and Circuit City decisions are controversial, most notably

because of doubts that employees will receive a fair hearing in company-sponsored arbitration

systems. In fact, many companies in the immediate wake of Gilmer adopted arbitration

procedures that were decidedly tilted towards the employer in that companies unilaterally chose

the arbitrator, established rules of the procedure (including barring formal depositions or even

written records of the arbitration), and held the right to unilaterally change those procedures. In

response to the employer bias of many post-Gilmer ADR systems, a number of the institutions

drawn upon by companies to serve in arbitration proceedings (including the American

Association of Arbitrators and the American Bar Associations) created a “Due Process Protocol”

which establishes that signatory associations and their members will only serve as arbitrators in

systems that adhere to basic conditions of procedural fairness. 16

       Even assuming that the “Due Process Protocol” assures a modicum of fairness in such

proceedings in nonunion workplaces, does establishing internal procedures for mediation and / or

arbitration of statutory disputes provide a solution to the rights problem portrayed in Figure 1?

On one hand, ADR can be seen as a means of lowering the marginal cost of exercise of rights in

that it makes (potentially) the cost for the disputant lower than under the traditional system

where workers must press their own claims under various federal labor statutes. By lowering the

costs of exercise, the gap depicted in Figure 1 narrows.

       On the other hand, the use of ADR by parties in nonunion workplaces still presupposes

that an employee comes forward with a claim. Yet the exis tence of an internal procedure (and

                                                                                                    25
the requirement to use that system via pre-hire agreement) does not inherently create an agent for

those employees. 17 The fact that the procedure is governed by the employer rather than a third

party (i.e. the government) may further dampen the extent to which workers collectively might

pursue a claim involving more widespread violations of a statutory right.

       As a result, ADR may be most beneficial in those cases where the divergence between

individual and workplace marginal benefits is relatively small, such as in resolving disputes

arising under workers compensation or very specific claims under statutes like FLSA or ERISA.

But in most areas of workplace regulation—particularly regarding workplace discrimination that

has motivated many nonunion companies to adopt internal arbitration systems 18 —ADR does not

provide a solution to the public goods problem. It remains to be seen if the growth of ADR

potentially fueled by the Circuit City decision will induce existing institutions (e.g. labor unions,

workers’ rights groups, law firms) to serve a new role as third party representatives within

nonunion firms.



IV. Concluding Thoughts and Implications

       It is easy for politicians, or reformers, or trade union officials to boast of the laws which
       they have secured for labor, and it is just as easy to overlook the details, or
       appropriations, or competent officials that are needed to make them enforceable.
       (Commons and Andrews 1936, p. 448).

       Can emerging labor market institutions play the role of collective agent in a workplace

that draws heavily upon the exercise of individual rights for implementation? Are there

emerging labor market institutions that plausibly can take up this role where labor unions are not

present?




                                                                                                   26
       Table 3 summarizes the analysis of the ability of alternative workplace institutions

surveyed above to do so. An implication of the foregoing analysis is that it may be difficult for a

single institution to play the varied roles required of a collective agent across a range of

workplace regulations. In particular, absent a labor union, it is difficult to devise an institutional

arrangement that effectively aligns its interests with those of the workforce and at the same time

has the kind of access to the workplace necessary to act upon those interests. Nonetheless, Table

3 suggests that a mixed approach, incorporating different institutions for different areas of

regulation might help to close the gap arising in implementation of workplace regulations. Posed

in this way, the policy question shifts from a focus on the agent per se and to the functions that

must be performed to assure that the objectives of workplace regulations are achieved.

For example, one set of policy options revolves around reducing the marginal cost of exercise of

rights. This might include finding new means of making workers aware of their statutory rights

or reducing the perceived cost of exercise by improving protections against employer

discrimination (e.g. administrative procedures that protect employees’ identity in the case of

triggering inspections). Recent efforts by OSHA to create an extensive “workers’ page” on their

web site provides one example of interventions of this type. The page includes instructions on

filing a complaint with OSHA (including downloadable complaint forms), information about

statutory coverage, employee rights, and health and safety standards. 19

       Another range of policy options involves creating incentives to foster new workplace

institutions that might provide some of the core functions of a collective agent. One approach

would be to restructure aspects of regulatory systems to create incentives on the regulated parties

themselves to fashion agents (such as private monitors) that provide at least some of the

functions of collective agents. One example of this type of policy described above is the U.S.

                                                                                                     27
Department of Labor “No Sweat” enforcement strategy that induces manufacturers to create third

party monitors to oversee the activities of subcontractors.

       Alternatively, public policies might assist existing labor market institutions sharpen their

abilities to undertake the central aspects as collective agents. Policy proposals in this vein

include improving the access that public interest groups and other institutions have to employees

at workplaces thereby enhancing their potential role as third party representatives in ADR

systems. By improving employee access to potential outside representation, ADR systems

(which will undoubtedly become even more prevalent in the wake of the Circuit City decision)

will be better prepared to deal with systemic workplace problems. Developing a more robust set

of institutions capable of representing nonunion workers in such company-based mediation and

arbitration procedures may prove an important new means of improving the exercise of

individual rights in nonunion workplaces.

       Commons and Andrews recognized at the dawn of the modern era of workplace

regulation that enactment of labor regulations did not assure implementation. Along with

guaranteeing that the agencies vested with enforcement or administrative authority receive

adequate appropriations and are staffed with competent personnel, this essay underscores the

need to develop complementary institutions in the labor market to assure full implementation.

Creating and fostering the institutions capable of taking on these functions may prove to be one

of the most challenging aspects of regulating the labor market in the 21st Century.

    For example, Stigler (1974) explains the significant influence of certain small interest

groups arises from their ability to surmount the free rider problem among supporters as a

result of their potentially high payoff from political action and the ability of members of

the coalition to sanction non-participants. In this view, an employment lobby

representing individual workers faces a far greater problem of funding its political

activities because of the more diffuse benefits conferred to individual workers arising

from supporting the lobby’s agenda and the difficulty of denying benefits or instituting

sanctions because of non-participation. Unions address this free rider problem by

allocating a portion of dues revenues to political activities directed towards workplace

issues (see Masters 1997 for a recent discussion). Whether other institutions can play a

comparable role is discussed in Hersch (2000).

    This can be seen in the relative growth in five categories of employment related

lawsuits filed in federal district courts between 1971 and 1991. The fastest growing

category in relative terms over the period has been litigation on employment law, which

went in absolute terms from 4,331 cases filed in 1971 to 22,968 cases in 1991. As a

result, employment law went from comprising about 6% of the 69,465 civil cases filed in

federal district courts in 1971 to about 16% of the 146,790 civil cases filed in 1991.

These figures are reported in Commission on the Future of Worker-Management

Relations (1994), Exhibit IV-3, p. 134.

    This is a recurring problem under workplace regulation. For example, a survey of

OSHA compliance officers by the GAO concluded that "...many OSHA inspectors

believe workers' participation [in OSHA] is limited by their lack of knowledge about




                                                                                               45
their rights and lack of protection from employer reprisal" (U.S. GAO 1989). The

decline in the “take up” rate for unemployment insurance has been partly ascribed to the

lack of information to workers about their access to unemployment benefits (Wandner

and Stettner 2000). Freeman and Rogers (1999, Chapter 6) also present survey evidence

indicating pervasive worker misperceptions regarding their rights under employment and

labor laws.

    The costs of retaliation may be even more severe, such as in the well-known 1996 case

of apparel workers in El Monte, Ca, held in virtual captivity by their employer who used

physical intimidation to prevent the workers from leaving.
5
    The degree to which MBi diverges from MBj will differ across workplace regulations.

For example, there are greater divergences between the functions for regulations like

OSHA, FLSA, or policies dealing with discrimination where the risks or problems faced

by one worker will likely be more pervasive and therefore affect many other workers as

well. In contrast, under benefit programs like workers compensation or unemployment,

the spill-overs are likely much smaller since the program primarily confers benefits to the

worker directly affected. The implications of these differences are discussed in Section

III.

    Strictly speaking, this third condition is really an aspect of the second condition.

Discrimination for use of a right represents a cost to a worker arising from discipline or

    Williamson (1985: 254) points out, "(u)nions can both serve as a source of information

regarding employee needs and preferences..." In addition to Williamson, the role of

unions in providing basic agency functions is discussed in Freeman and Medoff (1984),

particularly in regard to personnel practices and benefits.

    There might also be divergences in behavior arising from a number of sources. Median

voter models of union behavior would predict that union leadership would tend to pursue

policies reflective of more senior members of the unit which might not be synonymous

with the public goods solution to benefit valuation. Alternatively, principal / agent

divergences in interest may also lead away from optimal behaviors from the perspective

of collective worker interests. For example, the union may have incentives to "overuse"

certain rights for strategic reasons unrelated to the workplace regulation, for example as a

source of pressure in collective bargaining or strikes (U.S. GAO 2000). However,

principal / agent divergences in behavior may be moderated both through electoral

processes and by worker recourse via duty of fair representation claims which tend to

induce unions to pursue activities consonant with the preferences of represented workers.

    This latter effect of unions as workplace agents is particularly important given the long

term decline in benefit recipiency under these programs (Wandner and Stettner 2000).

     Jolls cites a number of examples of Congress curtailing class action activity by legal

service attorneys. The median voter hypothesis advanced here could be more rigorously

tested by examining changes in legal service activities over time given shifts in political

coalitions in Congress over time.
11
     This is not to argue that the alignment between these organizations and workers is as

close as found in the case of labor unions. For example, donors to COSH or disabled

worker groups may be similarly interested in “large impacts” as those funding national

interest organizations which may skew institutional activities in a similar manner. The



                                                                                              47
importance of union funds may also lead these organizations to direct their resources

towards certain nonunion workplaces of strategic interest to unions. Even more, union

funding could lead COSH groups to devote their resources supplementing the activities of

unions in already organized workplaces. There is some evidence of the latter behavior, as

described below.
12
     Indicative of this is the history of “New Directions” grants provided by OSHA in the

1970s and 1980s that provided financial assistance for promotion of private health and

safety programs. The majority of these grants went either to unions or to joint COSH /

union initiatives.
13
     Differences in the presence of worker groups to assist disabled workers versus

unemployed workers once again raises the economics of interest group formation

discussed by Stigler and others. The longevity of the effects of workplace disability as

opposed to the transient nature of une mployment creates greater incentives for the

formation of sustainable organizations concerning the former issue, and the difficulty of

sustaining organizations (particularly over the course of business cycles) in the latter

area. Thus, to the extent that workers groups have formed over the latter issue, they have

been linked to industries facing periods of intense crisis (e.g. steel) or deep recessions.

After crises pass (or industry restructuring occurs and workers find other employment)

these groups tend to disband. See Hoerr (1988) for a discussion of these types of

assistance groups in the steel industry.

     Where monitoring has been adopted out of strictly voluntary agreements and lacking

the “teeth” of government sanctions like the right to embargo goods, the identification of

third party monitors with regulatory objectives will be far weaker. This raises one of the



                                                                                              48
limitations of using third party monitors in the international arena to police labor

standards, where there is no comparable government authority underlying the

agreements. Third party monitors in the international labor standards arena are discussed

in Elliot and Freeman (2000).

     Among those conditions, the Protocol specifies that the arbitration system provide

employees with a right to representation in proceedings, and a right to participate in the

selection of an arbitrator / mediator drawn from “…a demographically diverse panel of

trained mediators and arbitrators…” (Dunlop and Zack, 2001, p. 6). The Due Process

Protocol has been adopted by a wide variety of institutions drawn on by companies for

arbitration.
17
     Note that this argument also supports the use of ADR in cases where some form of

worker representative is already present, such as in unionized workplaces. Here, ADR

can lead to more speedy and cost effective resolution of statutory disputes at the same

time that workers’ interests are protected through third party representation.

     The Gilmer case involved a case of age discrimination; Circuit City involved

discrimination because of sexual preference.
