                  COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE AND LONG-RUN GROWTh


                                  ABSTRACT


    We construct a dynamic, two-country model of trade and growth in which

endogenous technological progress results from the profit-maximizing behavior

of entrepreneurs. We study the role that the external trading environment

and that trade and industrial policies play in the determination of long-run

growth rates. We find that cross-country differences in efficiency at R&D

versus manufacturing (i.e. comparative advantage) bear importantly on the

growth effects of economic structure and commercial policies. Our analysis

allows for both natural and acquired comparative advantage, and we discuss

the primitive determinants of the latter.

I       Introduction

        What role do the external trading environment and commercial policy play

in the determination of lona-run economic performance? This central question

of international economics has received surprisingly little attention in the

theoretical literature over the years.

        Previous research on trade and growth has adopted the neoclassical

framework to focus on factor accumulation in the open economy. (See the

surveys by Findlay (1986) and Smith (1984)). This research largely neglects

the effects of trade structure on rates of growth, however, addressing instead

the reverse causation from growth and accumulation to trade patterns.' The

direction that the research followed almost surely can be ascribed to the

well-known property of the standard neoclassical growth model with diminishing

returns to capital that (endogenous) growth in per capita income dissipates in

the long run. For this reason, the familiar models which incorporate

 investment only in capital equipment seem ill-suited for analysis of long-run

growth.

        The available evidence collected since the seminal work of Solow (1957)

 also leads one to look beyond capital accumulation for an explanation of

 growth. Exercises in growth-accounting for a variety of countries generally

 find that increases in the capital to labor ratio account for considerably

 less than half of the last century's growth in per capita incomes.2 Although

 econometric efforts to explain the residual have been somewhat disappointing,

    (see e.g. Criliches (1979)) professional opinion and common sense continue to


         I An exception is Corden (1971), who studies how the opening up of trade
    affects the speed of transition to the steady state in a two-factor
    neoclassical growth model with fixed savings propensities.

         2 See Maddison (1987) for a recent, careful exercise in growth
    accounting.
                                        2

impute much of this residual to improvements in technology.3 We share the

view, expressed by Romer (1986, 1988), that a full understanding of growth n

the long run requires appreciation of the economic determinants of the

accumulation of knowledge.

     In this paper, we draw on the pioneering work by Rorner to construct a

model that highlights the roles of economies of scale and technological

progress in the growth process. As in Romer's work, our model implies an

endogenous rate of long-run growth in per capita income, and we study its

economic determinants. Our primary contribution lies in casting the growth

process in a two-country setting. We provide, for the first time, a rigorous

analysis linking long-run growth rates to trade policies and other

international economic conditions. Moreover, we find that recognition of

cross-country differences in economic structure impinges upon conclusions

about the long-run effects of domestic shocks and policies.

     Our model incorporates the essential insights from Romer (1988) ,   although
we introduce some differences in detail. The building blocks are an P&D

sector that produces designs or blueprints for new products using primary

resources and previously accumulated knowledge, an intermediate-goods sector

consisting of oligopolistic producers of differentiated products, and a

consumer goods sector in each country that produces a country-specific final

output using labor and intermediate inputs. As in Ethier (1982), total factor

productivity in final production increases when the number of available

varieties of differentiated inputs grows. Thus, resources devoted to R&D



       The benefits of education and experience undoubtedly contribute part of
the explanation for the growth residual. See, for example, Lucas (1988) and
Becker and Murphy (1988) for growth models that highlight the role of human
capital accumulation as a source of growth.
                                        3

contribute over time to productivity in the production of final goods, as well

as to the stock of scientific and engineering knowledge.

     The new elements in our analysis stem from the assumed presence of cross-

country differences in the effectiveness with which primary resources can

perform different activities; i.e. comparative advantage. For simplicity we

specify a one-primary-factor model, and allow the productivity of this factor

in the three activities to vary internationally. We suspect thst similar

results could be derived from a multi-factor model with inter-industry

differences in factor intensities. In any event, we find that many

comparative dynamic results hinge on a comparison across countries of

efficiency in R&D relative to efficiency in manufacturing the goods that make

use of the knowledge generated by R&D, namely middle products. The effects of

policy in a single country, of accumulation of primary resources in a single

country, and of a shift in world tastes toward the final output of one of the

countries all depend upon the identity of the country in which the change

originates in relation to the international pattern of comparative advantage.

     We provide a more complete verbal description of the economic setting,

followed by a formal statement of the model, in Section II immediately below.

Then, in Section III, we derive the dynamic equilibrium of the world economy,

discuss conditions under which there exists a steady-state equilibrium with

positive growth of per capita income, and calculate two reduced-form equations

that determine the steady-state growth rate. In Section IV we investigate the

structural determinants of long-run growth. There, the implications for

 growth of variations in consumer preferences, primary-input coefficients in

 one or both countries, and stocks of available primary resources are

 considered. Section V contains policy analysis. We study barriers and
                                        4

inducements to trade in consumer goods and subsidies to research and

development. Then, in Section VI, we introduce an important elaboration of

the model. There we extend the analysis to incorporate lags in the

dissemination of knowledge and asymmetries in the speed of diffusion within

and between countries. We use the extended model to reconsider the effects of

trade policies on the steady-state rate of growth. Finally. Section VII

provides a brief summary of our findings.

          Before proceeding, a brief disclaimer may be in order. Our results

in this paper concern steady-state rates of growth. Because we perform steady

state comparisons and also because growth rates have no immediate implications

for discounted utility, we do not mean to confer upon our findings any

normative interpretation. We do hope to report on the welfare properties of

our model in a future article.



II. The Model

     A.   General Description

     In Figure 1 we provide a schematic representation of our model. We study

a world economy comprising two countries. Each country engages in three

productive activities: the production of a final good, the production of

varieties of differentiated middle products (i.e., intermediate inputs), and

research and development (R&D). The two final goods are imperfect

substitutes, and both are demanded by consumers worldwide. A single primary

factor is used in production, and is taken to be in fixed and constant supply

in each country. Although we refer to this factor as "labor, we have in mind

an aggregate of irreproducible resources that for any given level of

technical know-how limits aggregate output.
                                        5

    We follow Romer (1988) in assuming that R&D generates two distinct

outputs. First, as in our earlier paper (Grossman and Fielpean, 1988; see also

Judd, 1985). research effort produces "blueprints" for new products. The

returns to this component of R&D output, coming in the form of an infinite

stream of monopoly profits, are assumed to be perfectly avoroprieble by the

originator due either to perfect and indefinite patent protection or technical

barriers to imitation. Blueprints are not tradable, so the manufacture of

each middle product takes place in the country in which it was developed.

     Second. R&D contributes to the stock of disembodied knowledge. Knowledge

here includes all general scientific information, as well as some forms of

engineering data with more widespread applicability, generated in the course

of developing marketable products. Knowledge contributes to the productivity

of further research efforts, by reducing the amount of labor needed for an

inventor to develop a new product. Due to the more general and non-

patentable nature of this product of the R&D effort, appropriation of the

resulting returns by the creator becomes problematic. We assume to begin with

that general knowledge disseminates immediately and costlessly throughout the

world. This approximates a situation in which information spreads through

technical journals, professional organizations, and interpersonal commercial

contacts, and where literature, scientists, and businessmen move freely across

international borders (see Pasinetti, 1981, ch.ll). We relax this assumption

by introducing lags in the dissemination of knowledge in Section VI.

     Once developed, middle products are manufactured with labor alone under

conditions of constant returns to scale. These products are freely traded

between the countries. The middle products, along with labor, serve as inputs

into the production of the final goods in each country. Given the number of
                                         6

available varieties, the production function for each of the final goods

exhibits constant returns to scale. But an increase in the number of

varieties of middle products used as inputs raises total factor productivity.

This specification, which we borrow from Ethier (1982), captures the notion

that an increasing degree of specialization generates technical efficiency

gains. In effect, the economy's potential for augmenting the degree of

specialization by developing new middle products implies the existence of

dynamic scale economies at the industry level that are external to the

individual final-good-producing firms.

    At each point in time, competitive producers of final goods earn zero

profits. Patent holders for middle products engage in oligopolistic

competition, earning monopoly rents. Forward-looking entrepreneurs in each

country elect to devote resources to R&D if the present discounted value of

future profits exceeds the current cost of development. Free entry into R&D

ensures that this activity earns at most a competitive return. Finally,

consumers maximize intertemporal utility, with savings devoted to the

acquisition of corporate bonds or ownership claims in input-producing firms.

We assume that financial capital is internationally mobile, although many of

our results also hold in the absence of international borrowing and lending.

     We shall study the dynamic evolution of this world economy. Over time,

the number of available varieties of middle products grows, affecting both

profitability in the intermediate-goods sector and productivity in the final

goods sector. The stock of technical knowledge also expands, reducing the

resource cost of inventive activity. Under certain conditions, the world

economy approaches a steady-state rate of growth of per-capita income, the

determinants of which are the focus of our attention in Sections IV and V.
                                              7

We turn now to the formal specification of the model.



       B.   Consumers

       Consumers worldwide share identical, homotlietic preferences. We

represent these preferences by a time-separable intertemporal utility function



(1)         U —    f   ett) log u[y1(r),y2(r)Jdi-


where p is the subjective discount rate and y1(r) is consumption of final

goods from country i in period r. The instantaneous sub-utility function u()

is non-decreasing, strictly quasi-concave and positively linearly homogeneous.

       A typical consumer maximizes (1) subject to an intertemporal budget

constraint, which requires that the present value of all future expenditures

not exceed the present value of factor income plus the market value of current

asset holdings. With u(S) linearly homogenous, this problem can be solved in

two stages. First, the consumer maximizes static utility for a given level of

expenditure at time r, E(r). The solution to this sub-problem generates an

indirect utility function, v(p11(r),p12(r)JE(r). where pyj is the price of y1.

In the absence of barriers to trade in final goods, these prices are common to

consumers in the two countries. The second-stage problem now can be

formulated as one of choosing the time pattern of expenditures to maximize



 (2)        Vt —   C e_5(t_t)(log v(p1(r).p52(r)J   +   log   E(r)1 dr



 subject to

                                          8

where R(t) is the cumulative interest factor from time 0 to time t (R(O)—l).

w(r) is the consumer's wage rate at time r, L is his labor supply, and Z(t) is

the value of his time t asset holdings. The interest factor in (3) is common

to all individuals as a result of trade on the integrated world capital

market, but the wage rate may vary across countries, with residents of country

I receiving w1(r).

       From the first-order conditions to this problem, we see that the optimal

path for expenditure obeys

Savings are used to accumulate either ownership claims in input-producing

firms or riskLess bonds issued by these same firms.4 Arbitrage ensures that

the rates of return on these two assets are equal, and in equilibrium

consumers are indifferent as to the composition of their portfolios.



       C. Producers

       At a point in time, output of final goods in country I is given by




               —                       0 < a. < 1,
                   gj1;ø[fx(w)aw]&,

where L represents employment in the final goods sector. x(w) denotes the

input of middle product w, and n is (the measure of) the number of varieties




       Firms that produce final goods earn zero profits, hence their stock
market value is nil. Input-producing firms command a market value equal to
the discounted value of their future operating profits.
                                                     9

of middle products available at that time.5 Notice that the production

functions are the same for both countries except for the productivity

parameter A. This productivity parameter may represent differences in

technology or in the endowments of sector-specific inputs.

       Competition in this sector ensures marginal-cost pricing. Hence, by

appropriate choice of the constant B, producer prices satisfy



                                                 0

             p —                                                       >   j

where p5(w) is the price of variety ,.               Final-good   producers worldwide pay the

same prices for (freely traded) middle products.

       At every moment in time the existing producers of middle products engage

in oligopolistic competition. Each producer takes as given the prices of his

rivals, as well as the outputs and prices of final goods. The producer of a

variety u in country i chooses p5(w) to maximize profits,

 where       is the unit labor requirement for production of intermediates in

 country i. This expression for profits comprises the product of profits per

 unit (in square brackets) and derived demand for variety w, where the latter

 incorporates the assumption that neither prices nor volumes of final

 production vary with p5(o). The first-order condition for a profit maximum

implies the usual fixed-markup pricing rule,




(6)           ap5(w) —



        It   is clear from (6) that varieties originating from the same country

bear the same price. Letting Pxj represent the price of a variety produced in

country i and n1 be the number of intermediate inputs produced there,

equations (5) and (6) imply




 (1)
                  — ()10 np1')
                      —

With these prices, profits per firm can be expressed as



(9)               —   (l-a)p1X1/n1


where         is aggregate output of intermediates    in country i (n times per-firm

output) and is given by

                                     fl(E p5Y)
                              j xi

        The number of intermediates produced in country i evolves over time

 according to the amount of R&D that takes place there. If resources are

 devoted to R&D in country i at time t, then the present value of future
                                              11

operating profits -     - discounted   to time t - -   must   be equal to the current cost

of R&D, denoted by c(t). We write this analog to the zero-profit condition

of static, monopolistic-competition models as



                et    t)R(t)Js(r)dr — c1(t)


Differentiating       this condition with respect to t, we find



            r   +e"
 (11)           cUI


Equation (11) expresses a standard no-arbitrage condition. Recognizing that
c1(t) represents the value of an input-producing firm in country i at time t,

(11) equates the instantaneous rate of return on shares in such a firm (the

aiim of dividends and capital gains) to the rate of interest.

        As we have discussed above, R&D produces a joint output; new varieties of

middle products and additions to the stock of knowledge. if L units of

labor engage in research in country i. they generate a flow of new products

n given by



(12)            —



where K is the current stock of knowledge and a,1 is a country-specific

productivity parameter. We assume until Section VI that the by-product

contribution to knowledge occurs instantaneously and that diffusion is

worldwide. Also, we take the stock of knowledge to be proportional to

cumulative experience in R&D; i.e. •        there   are no diminishing returns to
                                         12

research in adding to scientific understanding. 8y choosing units for K so

that the factor of proportionality is unity, we have K—n and




(13)        K —   1

Finally, since knowledge is a free input to each individual entrepreneur, the

Cost of product development in country i can be written as




(14)        c, — w1a1/n



This completes our description of the model.



III. Eouilibriuin Dynamics

        During the course of the development of our model in the previous

section, we provided some of the equilibrium conditions. For example, we

derived pricing equations for goods and a no-arbitrage condition relating

equilibrium asset returns. In this section we complete the list of

equilibrium requirements by adding conditions that stipulate market clearing

in factor and final-goods markets. We then derive and discuss a reduced-form

system that describes equilibrium dynamics.

        Static equilibrium in the markets for the two final goods implies




 (15)        pY — sE


 where sj(py1,p2) is the share of world spending allocated to Y and E is

 world spending on consumer goods. The share function is, of course,
                                            13


homogenous of degree zero. We establish below that relative commodity prices

are constant in the vicinity of a steady state with active R&D      sectors   in both

countries. For this reason, we take s to be constant in our subsequent

analysis, and omit its functional dependence on relative prices.6

       The labor-market clearing conditions equate labor supply and labor demand

in each country. Using (7) and Shephard's lemma, we see that final-goods

producers demand (l-$)p5Y/w workers. The demand for labor by middle-

products producers is             while (12) and the fact that K—n imply demand

for labor by product developers of (aj/n)n. Hence.



(16)        (ath/n)nj + aLXj + (l-fl)p5Y/w1 —



where L is the labor force available in country       t.
        Since we neglect here the monetary determinants of the price level, we

may choose freely a time pattern for one nominal variable, it proves

convenient to specify the numeraire as follows:




(l7a)        Pxi   — n(a1/a1)11


We show in Appendix A via equations (8)-(ll) and (14) that, with this

normalization, a necessary condition for convergence to a steady state with

positive R&D in both countries (i.e., non-specialization) is



 (17b)       PX2 —



      6 Of course, if u(S) takes a Cobb-Douglas form, then expenditure shares
 are independent of relative prices in any equilibrium.
                                               14

Together, (Va) and (17b) imply that relative prices of middle products are

constant along the convergent path, which further implies with (8) the

constancy of relative wages, and with (7) the constancy of relative prices of

final   goods. This last fact justifies our treatment of expenditure shares as

constants.

        Let g denote the rate of growth of the number of products and the stock

of knowledge; i.e., g—n/n—K/K. Then from (17) and (8) we see chat prices of

intermediates and wages grow at rate g. while from (14), product development

costs are constant. Moreover, equations (9)-(ll), (14), (15), and (17) imply




(18           x   —   i1b   E

and



(19)              —
                        Enb
where b — (athj/aj)m.           The coefficients b will serve as our measures of

comparative advantage. Country 1 enjoys comparative advantage in conducting

R&D   if   and only if b1 < b2.

        Since wages grow at the same rate as n, it proves convenient to define

e—E/n. Letting a—n/n be the share of products manufactured in country i and

noting that g—En/n, (16), (15), (17), (8), and (18) imply



(20)



where we have defined }I.ZLI/athl, the total effective labor force, cEcb1.

a weighted average of the comparative advantage parameters with product shares

as weights, and                     Observe that the parameter a, which provides a

useful sJmmary of the static intersectoral resource allocation, grows

(shrinks) over time if and only if the growth rate of the number            of   differ-

entiated middle products in the country with comparative disadvantare in R&D

exceeds      (falls short of) that of the other country.

          We are now prepared to derive two equations that describe the dynamic

evolution      of the world economy. From the definition of e, we have c/c —

E/E   -
           g. or, substituting (6). (19), and (20),



 '.   '        e
                   aO   + a    se   H



Hence, the rate of increase of spending per middle product is larger the

greater is spending per product and the smaller is the share of the country

with comparative disadvantage in R&D           in   the total number of varieties.

          Now, from the definition of the product shares a, their rates of change

are given by a/oj —           nj/nj - n/n.   Using (16) together with (17), (8), (18),

and (20), we obtain




  (22)



where h—L/a.j is effective labor in country i. and                       Since the

 evolution of the two product shares are related by Eo—O, we can replace (22)

 by a single differential equation in a. Making use of the fact that c—E1cb1.

 we find

        Equations (21) and (23) constitute an autonomous system of differential
equations in e and a. The solution to this system, together with (3), (20),

and the definition of a, provide a complete description of the evolution of

spending and the number of products in each country. From these, the paths

for outputs, employments and final-goods prices are easily derived. Thus, we

shall use this two-equation system to analyze equilibrium dynamics.

        Equations <21) and (23) do not apply if the steady state falls outside

the shaded region in Figure 2; i.e., a must lie between the smaller and larger

of the b1s, while the growth rate must fall between zero and p. A negative

growth rate is impossible, because the number of blueprints cannot decline.

And a steady-state growth rate in excess of the subjective rate of discount

would imply unbounded utility and thus invalidate our use of (4) in describing

the evolution of spending. The shape of the iso-growth-rate curves

(increasing and concave) follows from (20). We limit our attention to

economies with parameter configurations that ensure a steady state in the

interior of the shaded area.7

        Contrary to the impression given by the figure. the likelihood of

reaching a steady state in the indicated region does not depend directly on

the spread between b1 and b2. This point is seen most clearly by considering


     7 A further restriction that we have not explicitly taken into account to
this point is that product development must be non-negative in each country.
This condition certainly is satisfied in the neighborhood of a steady-state
equilibrium with positive growth, but it need not hold all along the con-
vergent path to such an equilibrium. Thus, strictly speaking, the equilibrium
dynamics that we describe below apply for sure only in the vicinity of a
steady state.

the case in which neither country enjoys comparative advantage in R&D, a case

that is of some interest in its own right. When b1—b—b, the shaded area

collapses to the vertical line segment between points 1 and 2 in Figure 3.

However, in this case, h—bH and s—I/b, which implies via (23) that a—O for

a—b. irrespective of the value of e. When considerations of comparative

advantage are absent, any intersection of the two curves inevitably falls

within the horizontal width" of the relevant region.

       Consider next the shape and location of the curve depicting stationary

points for e. We draw the e—0 locus as increasing and concave (see (21)). To

understand the positive slope of this curve, observe from (19) that the

interest rate can be expressed as




(24)       P. —   fle/o(e-l)


Comparing (24) and (20), we see that an increase in spending per product

increases the interest rate and reduces the rate of growth of n (the former

because the profitability of R&D rises with derived demand, the latter because

more spending means less savings and hence less investment). Since an

increase in the interest rate raises the rate of growth of nominal spending,

and the rate of growth of e is just the difference between the rates of growth

of E and n, it follows that an increase in e raises the growth rate of e. To

compensate for this acceleration in spending per product, if e is to be

stationary, a must rise. An increase in a lowers the interest rate and raises

the rate of growth of n, thereby reducing the rate of growth of e.

       In the figure, the e—0 curve intersects the a—O line at point 3, which

 lies between points I and 2. Clearly, there are many constellations of
                                            18

parameters    values that admit a steady state with g in the permissible range.

In the figure. we also indicate with arrows the direction of the system's

movement. Point 3 is seen to be unstable. The intertemporal budget

constraint can only be satisfied with equality if the initial value of e

corresponds to the ordinate of point 3. Hence, in this case of no comparative

advantage. e jumps immediately to its long-run value, and the world economy

remains always in a steady state.

       Now let us reintroduce comparative advantage. We distinguish two sub-

cases depending on the relative sizes of h/H and 1/s. It can be shown that

h/H >   1/s   if and only if (b2-b1)(h2b2/s2 - h1b1/s1)   > 0.    If the shares of the

two countries' final outputs are in proportion to their relative effective

labor forces, then the second inequality will be satisfied. But a bias in

size relative to budget share of final output can reverse the inequality and

thus the relationship between h/H and 1/s. We consider the alternative cases

in turn.

        Figure 4 depicts equilibrium dynamics when I/s >         h/H.   Both I/s and h/H

must    lie between       and b,. The 0—0    curve here is everywhere downward

sloping, crosses the horizontal axis at h/H, and is discontinuous at u—I/s.
The slope of the curve is understood as follows. For o—o, we must have o—O,
which    requires that the resources available for R&D in each country be just

sufficient to preserve the country's shate in the world's number of varieties.

Consider country 1 and suppose for concreteness that this country has com-

 parative advantage in R&D. Then an increase in a lowers o. thereby reducing

 the resources needed for production of middle products. The fall in o also

 reduces the amount of R&D country I must perform to preserve its share in the

 number of products. Ceterus naribus, o would tend to rise. An increase in
                                         19

e, on the other hand, diverts resources away frous R&D to production of middle

and final products in country I. But it also causes the world's rate of

product growth to fall, thereby diminishing the amount of R&D      country   1 must

undertake to maintain its share of middle products. The relative magnitudes

of these two effects depend upon   country    l's relative size, and on the share

of its final product in aggregate spending. In the case under consideration,

the second effect dominates, and so the o—O curve slopes downward.

     In this case, there exists a unique steady-state point, labelled I in the

figure. For initial values of a not too different from that at point 1, a

unique trajectory (saddle-path) converges to the steady state. This

trajectory, labelled SS, fulfills all equilibrium requirements and satisfies

the intertesiporal budget constraint with equality. Along this trajectory (in

the vicinity of the steady state), the interest rate and profit rate are

declining (see (24)) and nominal expenditure E is rising. If the country with

comparative advantage initially has a share of products that is smaller

(larger) than its steady-state share, expenditure rises more slowly (rapidly)

than the number of products.

     The second case arises when h/H >   1/s.     Then the a—U schedule slopes

upward, as depicted in Figure 5.    If the curve intersects the c—U locus in the

positive orthant at all, it must intersect it twice, as at points I and 2.8

The lower point (point 1) represents the steady state with the higher rate of

growth (growth rates increase as we move down along the e—O schedule, as we

demonstrate below) and indeed the growth rate corresponding to point 2 may be


      8 The geometry supports this claim, once we recognize that the a—O curve
 asymptotes to the horizontal line at aH/s(l-). whereas the e—O curve
 asymptotes to the horizontal line at a(H+p)/s(l-fl). The algebra provides
 confirmation, as simple manipulation reveals that the steady-state growth rate
 solves a quadratic equation.
                                       20

negative. More importantly, as we show in Appendix B, the equilibrium at

point 1 exhibits saddle-path stability, whereas that at point 2 is locally

unstable.9 To the right of point I, the saddle-path leading to that point

remains trapped in the area bounded by the e—0 locus and the line segment

joining points 1 and 2, and is everywhere upward sloping. Thus, the

qualitative properties of the dynamic trajectory that leads to a stable,

positive-growth equilibrium in Figure S mimic those of the stable saddle-path

in Figure 4.

     For the remainder of this paper, we shall restrict our discussion to

stable steady-state equilibria with positive growth rates. That is, we focus

our attention on equilibria such as those at the points labelled 1 in Figures

4 and 5. In the steady state there occurs intra-industry trade in middle

products and inter-industry trade in consumer goods, with the long-run pattern

of trade determined by comparative advantage, productivities in the tim final-

goods industries, and consumer preferences.



IV. Determinants of Lone-Run Crowth

     Our model generates an endogenous rate of long-run growth. We now are

prepared to explore how economic structure and economic policy affect this

growth rate. In this section, we derive the implications of sectoral

productivity levels, country sizes and demand composition for the steady-state


       We strongly suspect, however, that whenever there exist two positive-
growth, steady-state equilibria in the admissible range, there also exists a
third (saddle-path stable) steady-state equilibrium with zero growth. We have
established the existence of such an equilibrium for some parameter values,
but so far have been unable to construct a general existence proof. Since the
equilibrium at point 1 in Figure 5 can only be reached if the initial value of
o is less than that at point 2, we suspect that initial values of a in excess
of that at point 2 (and perhaps only these) imply convergence to a steady
state with zero growth.
                                                         21

growth rate. The influence of trade policies and of subsides to R&D are

treated in the next section.

        We calculate the steady-state values,                    and a, from the following pair of

equations, derived form (21) and (23) with e and a set to zero:




(25)         00       0


 (26)
             l-   -
             —— e(1-as)

                                + oH — h      -




Whenever 1/s >     h/H,       these equations provide at most one solution for (i,)

consistent    with g > 0.            When 1/s <      h/H,   there may be two such solutions, in

which case we select the stable equilibrium; i.e., the one with the smaller

values for e and a. Stability implies, in this latter case, that the c—0

curve intersects the e—O curve from below (see Appendix B). We make use of

this condition, namely

             (H+p)&2                 aM - h


in signing the comparative-dynamics derivatives below.

        The growth rate of the number of varieties in the steady-state

equilibrium can be derived from the solution to (25) and (26), together with

(15). From this, we can easily calculate the growth rate of output. In the

steady state nominal expenditure grows at rate ,                      while   (7) implies that Pyj

grows at rate 1 -             /(1-Eflg.           From these facts and (15), we deduce that final

Output grows at rate flg/(l-).

        It is worth noting at this point that the steady-state equations (25) and
                                         22

(26), as well as the equation for g, do not rely on our assumption of perfect

capital mobility. In the absence of capital mobility, the steady state would

be the same as long as consumers worldwide share identical preferences (and

therefore common subjective discount rates)1°

        it Is instructive to begin the discussion with the case in which neither

country exhibits comparative advantage in conducting R&D; I.e., b1—b2—b. As

we noted in Section III, this case has h—bH and s—l/b. Then (25) and (26)

provide a unique solution for e and ;,    which upon substitution into (20).

yields the long-run growth rate



 (28)          — ______ -


This equilibrium growth rate shares much in common with that derived by Romer
(1988) for a closed economy. In particular, the growth rate rises with

effective labor H and declines with the subjective discount rate. Our

measure of effective labor adjusts raw labor for productivity in R&D (recall

that H—L1/a), so greater effectiveness in research In either country, as

well as a larger world labor force, necessarily mean faster growth. Long-run

growth does not, however, depend upon coefficients that determine absolute

productivity in the intermediate or final goods sectors (such as A or arn).

Nor do properties of the instantaneous utility function u(), including the

product composition of final demand, play any role in the determination of g.

As we shall see presently, all these features (except for the absence of an



      10 The cases of perfect and imperfect capital mobility do differ in their
 implications for the steady-state share of each country in aggregate spending
 E. However, as should be clear from (25) and (26). the cross-country compo-
 sition of E does not matter for the issues taken up In the present section.
                                         23

effect of A1 on g) are special to a world without any comparative advantage.

        Consider next the case with 1/s > h/H. The curves e—O and c—U in Figure

6 describe the initial situation, with a unique initial steady state at point

1. Now suppose that preferences change so that s increases. This corresponds

to a shift in tastes in favor of the final good produced by the country with

comparative advantage in perfonsing R&D. From (25), we see that the e—0 curve

shifts down, say to e'—O in the figure. Equation (26) implies that the o—O

schedule shifts out (in the positive orthant) to a'—O. The new steady state

occurs at a point such as 2. But observe that all points on e'—O to the right

of its intersection with ray OR are characterized by slower steady-state

growth than at point I. This claim follows from (20) and (25), whence




 (29)          —            -
                   (c-l)ã

Since the intersection of o'—O and e'—O necessarily lies to the right of the
intersection of the latter curve with OR, we have established that an increase

in s reduces steady-state growth.

        When tastes shift unexpectedly toward the final good of the country with

comparative advantage in R&D, resources there must be reallocated to satisfy

the relatively higher consumer demand. A process begins whereby labor there

shifts out of R&D and the manufacture of middle products. Products accumulate

more slowly in this country than in the other, and over time its share of

middle products falls (i.e., a rises). Output per middle product changes by

 the same proportion in both countries (see (18)).    So, in the new steady

 state, the country with comparative disadvantage in R&D is responsible for s

 relatively larger share of the world's innovation, with adverse consequences
                                               24

for the common steady-state growth rate, Of course, the opposite conclusion

applies when s falls. Moreover, the same results obtain at stable equilibrium

points when I/s <    h/H)"    We have thus proven:



Proposition 1: Stronger relative demand for the final good of the country with

comparative advantage in R&D        lowers   the long-run share of this country in the

number of middle products and slows long-run growth of the world economy. In

the absence of comparative advantage in R&D, the long-run growth rate is

independent of the relative demand for final goods.



        Next we consider the dependence of growth on the sizes of the effective

labor forces. Effective labor may grow without affecting cross-country

comparative advantage either because the stock of irreproducible resources

expands, or because the productivity of labor in all uses (or in R&D and

intermediate-good production) rises equiproportionately. In the first

experiment. suppose that both countries experience equiproportionate, once-

and-for-all increases in the sizes of their effective labor forces. We have

already seen that this change would augment world growth in the absence of

comparative advantage. Now H and h both rise, with their ratio unchanged. We

illustrate in Figure 7 the resulting impacts on the long-run equilibrium for

the case in which 1/s >      h/H.    The increase in H shifts the e—O curve up to

e'—O.      Once again we draw the ray OR through point 1. along which do is

equal to its initial long-run level. Comparing points I and 2 (where the

latter is the intersection of e'—O with OR), we see from (25) that expenditure



        11 In this case the o—O curve rotates to the right in the relevant
region.
                                              25

per product differs by de—adil/s(l-fi). Since in the comparison of these two

points. do—ode/c. we find e higher in percentage terms at point 2 by



          d.c   —   dH     oH       dli

                    H(l-fl)se
                                          -
                                     H


The inequality stems from the fact that the o—O curve intersects the vertical

axis at ah/(l-fi) and h/H C 1/s. The implication we wish to highlight is that

in moving from point 1 to a point such as 3 (which has the same ordinate as

point 2). the proportionate expansion of expenditure per product exceeds that

of the world's effective labor force.

     Now, from (26), the global expansion of the world's labor force also

shifts up the o—O curve. The vertical shift of this curve exceeds that of the

e—O locua (compare (25)), and indeed is exactly equal to dR/H. So the

intersection of the new a—0 schedule (not drawn) with the vertical line

through point I must fall above point 4 but below point 3. This implies.

finally, that the new steady-state point lies on e'—O between points 2 and 4.

For all these points, a is higher than at point I, and --       since   the new point

is above OR - -   so   is the growth rate.

     Figure 8 depicts the case in which 1/s C h/H. Again in this case, an

equiproportionate increase in the effective labor forces of the two countries

accelerates growth, although here the share of products in the country with

comparative advantage in R&D rises. To verify these claims, note that the

o'—O locus lies above the o—O curve in proportion to the increase in H. The

new e—O schedule (not drawn) intersects the vertical line through point 1

below point I' .       Consequently, the new steady-state equilibrium occurs at a
point such as 2, to the left of point I and above the ray OR. This proves
                                       26




Proposition 2: An equtproportionate. once-and-for-all increase in the

effective Labor forces of both countries accelerates long-run growth. The

middle-product share of the country with comparative advantage in R&D rises if

and only if I/s < h/H.



     The interesting aspect of this proposition concerns the case where

uniform expansion of effective labor reduces the share in world R&D of the

country that is the relatively more efficient innovator. We have shown that,

even in this case, where the market-share effect certainly is detrimental to

world growth, the direct growth-augmenting effect of a greater resource base

dominates. Greater resources generate higher growth rates in our model

essentially because dynamic scale economies characterize long-run production.

     We investigate next the effects of an increase in the effective labor

force of a single country. Conceptually, it proves convenient to decompose

this change into two elements. First, we increase h and H by the same

percentage amount equal to the product of the share of the expanding country

in the world's effective stock of labor and the percentage increase in

effective labor force that this country experiences. This accounts for the

total percentage change in H when H changes. Then we adjust h with H fixed

to arrive at the appropriate change in h.

     As an intermediate step, let us consider the effects of an increase in h

alone. This corresponds to an increase in the effective labor of the country

with comparative disadvantage in R&D. and a decrease in the effective labor of

the other, so that the sum remains constant. This imaginary reshuffling of

the world's resources shifts the a—U schedule upward when 1/s >   h/H.   and
                                               27

downward otherwise. In either case, the e—O curve is unaffected and the new

steady-state point lies on this curve to the right of the original point.

Noting (29), this establishes



Leia 1: A reallocation of resources between countries that maintains a

constant world stock of effective labor raises the long-run growth rate and

increases the long-run product share of the relatively R&D efficient country

if and only if the share of this country in effective labor increases.



       When the effective labor force of only country I (say) increases, h rises

by proportionately more or less than H, according to whether country 1 has

comparative disadvantage or advantage in R&D.          If country   1 has comparative

advantage in R&D. then both the uniform increase in H and h and the adjustment

(lowering) of h, that together comprise the effect of an increase in H, serve

to accelerate world growth. Rut if country I has comparative disadvantage in

R&D,   the   two   effects   work in opposite directions. The increase in resources,

by Proposition 2, speeds growth; but the reallocation of given resources, by

Lemma 1, slows growth. The net effect is ambiguous, as the examples that we

present in Appendix D serve to demonstrate. We have established:



Proposition 3: The long-run growth rate is higher the larger is the effective

labor force of the country with comparative advantage in R&D. A larger

effective labor force in the country with comparative disadvantage in R&D may

be associated with faster or slower growth, depending upon the extent of

productivity differences. In the absence of comparative advantage, long-run

growth is faster the larger is the effective labor force of either country.
                                         28




      These results suggest that findings reported by Krugman (1988) may be

somewhat special. A country need not enjoy faster growth by joining the

integrated world economy, if the country enjoys substantial comparative

advantage in R&D. Moreover, growth in resources or improvements in the

productivity of existing resources do not guarantee faster long-run growth in

a world equilibrium with free trade. If resources expand or become more

efficient in the country with comparative disadvantage in R&D, then the

resulting intersectoral reallocation of resources worldwide might slow

innovation and growth everywhere.



V.    Economic Policy

       In this section we discuss the effects of tariffs, export subsidies, and

R&D   subsidies   on long-run growth. In order to do so. it is necessary for us

to introduce the relevant policy parameters into the equations that describe

instantaneous and steady-state equilibrium. To avoid repetition of the

detailed arguments presented in Section II, we present here only the necessary

modifications of the model, and then explain their implications for the

steady-state conditions. We restrict attention to small taxes and subsidies;

 this restriction facilitates exposition, as the channels through which

economic policies affect long-run growth can be seen more clearly. We also

 confine our analysis of trade policies to those that impede (or encourage)

 trade in final goods.

       The introduction of taxes and subsidies to the model necessitates

 consideration of the government's budget. As usual, we assume that the

 government collects and redistributes net revenue by lump-sum taxes and
                                         29

subsidies. In a static framework, this specification suffices to determine

completely the government's budgetary policy. But in a dynamic framework, the

budget need not balance period by period, so budgetary policy in general must

specify the Entertemporal pattern of lump-sum collections and transfers.

However, with perfectly-foresighted and infinitely-lived agents, our model

exhibits the Barro-Ricardo neutrality property. Hence, we need not concern

ourselves with the intertemporal structure of budget deficits so long as the

present value of the government's net cash flow equals zero.

       The presence of the aforementioned policies modifies the decision problem

for consumers in country I in two ways. First, we replace the price of good I.

in (I) by T1p, , where T1—l. Vith this formulation, p remains the

producer price of final good I, T2 > 1 represents a tariff in country 1 on

imports of consumer goods, and T2 < 1 represents a subsidy by country 2 on

exports of final output)-2 Second, we add the present value of net taxes to

the right-hand-side of (3) as a lump-sum addition to consumer wealth. The

amount of this collection or redistribution will differ across countries

according to their policies.

       These modifications do not affect (4), which continues to describe the

optimal interteisporal pattern of expenditures for consumers worldwide as a

function of the pattern of equilibrium interest rates. In a steady state with

e—0, (4) reduces to



(30)




     12 The effects of a country 2 import tariff and a country I export
subsidy can be derived symmetrically, so we neglect these policies here and
leave the maximand for consumers in country 2 as before.
                                          30

Notice that (30) implies that in any steady state in which countries grow at

the same rate, long-run equalization of interest rates obtains. This property

of our model holds irrespective of the presence or absence of international

capital mobility, and the presence or absence of tariffs or export subsidies

on final goods and subsidies to research and development.

      Turning to the production side, our policies do not alter equations (7)-

(12) describing pricing and output relationships in the intermediate and final

goods sectors and the technology for knowledge creation. However, R&D

subsidies do change the private cost of R&D. We replace (14) by




(14')        c1 — wlathj/nSi



where S1 > 1 represents subsidization of research costs in country i. It also

proves convenient to redefine our numeraire to normalize for the effect of the

R&D   subsidy   on the price of intermediate inputs in country 1. Our new

normalization dictates a modified equation for the price of intermediates

produced in country 2 as well. Together, these relationships, which replace

 (l7a) and (17b) can be written as




 (17')       p11 —




         As for the market-clearing conditions, the factor-markets equation (16)

 is not affected, but we must replace (15) by




  (IS')       p1Y1 —      +    s12E2
                                                 31


where E1 denotes aggregate spending by consumers in country I, and the shares

of spending devoted to good I by residents of country 1 and country 2 are

sjs(Py. p52T2) and t2j(Py1' p52), respectively. Although import
tariffs and export subsidies on final goods do not affect steady-state

producer prices of final output in our modelj3 the direct response of

spending shares in country I to changes in trade policy must now be treated

explicitly for utility functions with an elasticity of substitution between

the final goods other than unity. Moreover. R&D subsidies, if introduced at

different rates in the two countries, will affect the steady-state value of

i1/2. and may influence, therefore, the long-run spending shares in both

countries.

       This completes the necessary modifications of the equilibrium

relationships. We can now use the extended model to derive the equations

describing steady-state equilibrium in the presence of policy intervention.

In a steady state, employment in the R&D              sector   is given by athLnL/n —

agj.      Making use of (8), (9), (Il), (30), (14') and (17') (which together

imply c—O in a steady state), we find employment in the manufacture of

middle products equal to aa1(g÷p)(c-l)/S. Substitution of these terms

into (16) yields the steady-state labor-market-clearing condition,



(31)             +   (c-l)(i-p) ,   +       1-fl          —

where q1.p1Y/n. Next, from (8)-(1l), (30), and (17') we obtain

                                        fi E14     —0

       13 This statement can be verified using equations (7), (8) and (17').
                                         32


Naturally, we also require

Finally.   (15') implies



 (34)          —      +



It    is straightforward. now, to verify that (31)-(34) imply (25) and (26) when

t—S—l for i—l,2 (with e—Se±). This provides a consistency check on the

extended model with policy instruments.

        A complete solution to the model requires specification of the deter-

minants of the cross-country composition of world spending; i.e., e for

i—l,2. For this, we need to distinguish between alternative csses based on

the presence or absence of international capital mobility. When international

capital flows are ruled out, steady-state spending per middle product by

consumers in each country is proportional to the sum of that country's (per-

product) labor income, operating profits, and net transfers from the

 government (including interest on internal debt). When capital flows do take

 place, on the other hand, spending per product is proportional to the sum      of
 these components of income plus income on net foreign asset holdings. In this

 latter case, it is not possible to calculate the comparative dynamic response

 of      to a policy change without accounting for the effects of that change on

 foreign debt accumulation along the entire trajectory leading to the steady

 state, Fortunately, the long-run responses to "small" doses of policy do not

 depend on whether or not financial assets are tradable, so there is no need
                                               33

for us to deal in what follows with the entire equilibrium trajectory.

       We consider trade policies first. From (34), the ratio q1/q2 satisfies



             1 —     111ë1 + &12e2
(35)
            q2     21é1/T2 +



Now, for given expenditure levels e,         equations    (31)-(33) and (35) -   - which
constitute a system of five equations         - - provide a   solution for

(g,c11o2,q11q2).     In   this system, the   trade   policy parameters appear only in

(35). Therefore, the long'run effects of trade policy depend only on their

effects on 41iâ, taking into account the induced adjustment in the spending

levels e1 and e2. Moreover, for small trade policies (i.e. with an initial

value of T2—l), the spending shares are equal across countries (s11—s12), so

the effect on q1/q2 of changes in the cross-country composition of aggregate

spending "washes out".

       Further inspection of (35) reveals that an increasa in T2 starting from

free trade with T2—l (i.e., a small import tariff in country 1) unambiguously

raises 1142J4 A tariff shifts demand by residents of country 1 toward home

consumer products, and since relative producer prices do not change in the

long run, steady-state       relative   quantities must adjust. The effect of this



       14 The easiest way to see this is to write the right-hand-side of (35) as

        '71.2) (#1(f1.T2f52)e1 +                                    +

where #(') is minus the partial derivative of v(') from (I) with respect to its

    argument divided by v(•). Then an increase in T2 with        constant clearly
raises demand for final good 1 in country I (the first component of the
bracketed term in the numerator increases) and lowers the demand there for
final   good 2 (the first component of the bracketed term in the denominator
falls).
                                         34

change on the steady state is quslitatively the same as   for an exogenous

increase in world preference for final good 1, such aa we studied in   the


previous section when we varied s. Similarly, a small export subsidy in

country 2 (a reduction in T2 to a value slightly below one) biases country 1

demand in favor of foreign final output. So we may apply directly our results

from proposition I to state:



proposition 4: The imposition of a small tariff on imports of final goods

reduces a country's steady-state share in middle products and R&D. It

increases the rate of long-run growth in the world economy if and only if the

country has comparative disadvantage in R&D.



oppsition 5: The provision of a small export subsidy for consumer products

 reduces a country's steady-state share in middle products and R&D. It

 increases the rste of long-run growth in the world economy if and only if the

 country has comparative disadvantage in R&D.



 Commercial policies 4   affect   long-run growth rates in our model. They do so

 by shifting resources in the policy-active country out of the growth-

 generating activity (R&D) and into production in the favored sector. At the

 same time, a resource shift of the opposite kind takes place abroad in the

 dynamic general equilibrium. The net effect on world growth hinges on the

 identity of the country that favors its consumer-good industry. If import

 protection or export promotion is undertaken by the country that is relatively

 less efficient in conducting R&D. then growth accelerates; otherwise, growth

 decelerates.
                                            35

     Next, we investigate the effects of small subsidies to R&D, introduced

from an Initial position of      la1sse faire. For these policy     experiments, T2—l

before and after the policy change, so the expenditure levels e1 cancel from

(35). Suppose first that both countries apply substdie at equal ad valorem

rates; i.e., S1—S2—S. In this case, relative prices of final output do not

change across steady states. Therefore, the spending shares            do not

change. In Appendix C we totally differentiate (3l)-(33) and (35) with

respect to S to prove:



Prooosition 6: A small R&D subsidy by both countries at a common rate

increase the rate of long-run growth in the world economy.



This proposition is not surprising, and corresponds to a similar result for

the closed economy derived by Romer (1988). Since R&D represents the only

source of gains in per capita income in our model, stimulation of this

activity promotes growth.

    What   is   more interesting, perhaps, is the effect of a small R&D subsidy

in a single country. As for bilateral subsidies, a unilateral subsidy

promotes growth by bringing more resources into product development in the

policy-active country. But now, relative final-good prices change, so the

spending shares in (35) must be allowed to vary unless the utility function

has a Cobb-Douglas forn. Depending on whether the elasticity of substitution

between final products exceeds or falls short of one, this induced change in

the pattern of spending can be conducive to or detrimental to growth.

Moreover, an R&D    subsidy   in a single country will alter the   relative   shares of

the two countries in product development. If the subsidy is introduced by the
                                         36


country that is relatively less efficient at performing R&D. this effect too

can impede growth. In Appendix D we show, by means of a numerical example

using a Cobb-Douglas utility function, that an R&D subsidy introduced by the

country with comparative disadvantage in R&D might (but need not) reduce the

world's growth rate. We also prove in Appendix C that, for the case of

constant spending shares, an R&D subsidy must encourage growth if it is

undertaken by the country with comparative advantage in R&D. Thus we have



Proposition 7 The provision of a subsidy to R&D in one country increases

long-run growth if spending shares on the two final goods are constant and the

policy is undertaken by the country with comparative advantage in R&D.

Otherwise, the long-run growth rate may rise or fall.



VI. Lass   in   the Diffusion of Knowledse

     We have assumed above that research and development creates as a by-

 product an addition to the stock of knowledge that facilitates subsequent R&D.

 Moreover, we supposed that the knowledge so created becomes available

 immediately to scientists and engineers worldwide. We now relax the latter

 assumption, in recognition of the fact that privately created knowledge, even

 if non-appropriable, may enter the public domain via an uneven and time-

 consuming process. Also, since legal and cultural barriers may inhibit the

 free movement of people and ideas across national borders, we shall allow here

 for the possibility that information generated in one country disseminates

 more rapidly to researchers in the same country than it does to researchers in

 the trade partner country. We shall use the extended model to reconsider the

 effects of trade policies on the steady-state rate of growth.
                                              3/

        in place of our earlier assumption that world knowledge accumulates

exactly at the rate of product innovation (eq. 13)), we suppose now that R&D

expenditures    contribute to country-specific stocks of knowledge according to




(13t)        I(1(t) — Ah   f   e'n1(r>   +
                                             A J' et)nj(,)dr

where K(t) is the stock of knowledge capital at time t in country I. With
this specification, the contribution of a particular R&D project to general

knowledge is spread over time. At the moment after completion of the project.

none of its findings have percolated through the scientific and professional

community. After an infinite amount of time has passed, the R&D project

makes, as before, a unit contribution to knowledge. After finite time, the

contribution lies between these extremes of zero and one, as given by the

exponential lag structure in (13t). The parameters Ab and        (with Ak

distinguish within-country and cross-country rates of diffusion.

        The introduction of lags in the diffusion of knowledge alters two of the

fundamental equations of the model. First, (12) becomes



(l2f)        n — LajKj/a,j


Second,    we have in place of (14),




(14t)        c1 —



Since these two equations are the only ones in the development of the model in

which the productivity parameter aL,,I appears, the change in specification
                                             38

compels us to substitute ath/Kl for aLflL/n in all equilibrium      relationships

where the latter term appeared formerly.

        In a steady state with n1—n2—g. we have n1(r) —    n1(t)e5(Tt).   so that




             i(1(t) —    n1(t) +      n(t)

 (36)
                    —          +      a] n(t) —

So in the steady state, knowledge in each country once again is proportional

to the total number of middle products, but the factor of proportionality           has

become country-specific and endogenous. This means that the steady state

labor-input coefficient for R&D in country i, a1/s, also is endogenous:

 i.e., relative productivity in R&D depends now not only on relative natural

 abilities in performing this activity, but also on relative cumulative

 experience in research, as summarized by the at's. This consideration          leads

 us to draw a distinction henceforth between natural and acquired comparative

 advantage in R&D.

         From (36) we see that, when AhAf -.      (i.e., when diffusion lags a very

 short), p1—p2 •    1, and the extended model reverts to the earlier formulation.
 For AhAf finite, p1—p2, so that the ratio of the natural-plus-acquired

 productivity parameters for each country is the same as for the natural

 productivity parameters alone. In this case, the pattern of comparative

 advantage cannot be reversed by endogenous learning, and all results from

 before continue to apply. We concentrate here on cases in which the rates of
                                             39

diffusion   are unequal   but   the difference between them is small.15

     We derive the long-run effects of trade policy in the extended model

using equations (31)-(33) and (35), but with S1—S2—l (no R&D      subsidies),    with

b1 replaced by b1/" (natural plus acquired comparative advantage in place of

just natural comparative advantage), and with h replaced by               (natural

plus acquired effective labor in place of natural effective labor). For

clarity of exposition, we shall also assume for the remainder of this section

that the spending shares s are constant. Recall that this assumption

corresponds to taking static preferences as Cobb-Douglas.

     The new elements that diffusion lags introduce to the analysts of policy

stem from the effects of relative sire and demand-side bias. Before

considering these new aspects, let us suppose that labor forces are equal and

demand for the two final goods is symmetric. By totally differentiating the

system of steady-state equations (see Appendix E), we establish



Proposition 8; Suppose L1—L2, s1—s2, a1—a2 and A,,-). small. Then a

tariff   on imports of final goods in country 1. raises the   long-run growth rate
if and only if       > a,,3.




     In this case, the effects of acquired comparative advantage necessarily

reinforce those of natural comparative advantage. The country that is



          A large difference between the within-country and across-country
rates of diffusion may imply that, in the steady-state equilibrium, all R&D is
carried out by one country. Such specialization, which is common in models
with a national component to increasing returns to scale, necessarily occurs
here if static preferences are Cobb-Douglas and A—O (i.e., all spi].lovers are
internal). Then, the equations that we have developed to describe the steady-
state equilibrium (which presume non-specialization in each country) would not
be valid.
                                           40

relatively more   productive   in creating new blueprints will attain, in the

steady-state equilibrium prior to the introduction of policy, a aaiajortty       share

of the world's middle products. By its greater concentration in R&D,        it   will

gain more experience in research and attain a higher steady-state stock of

knowledge. Thus, the effects of learning will augent its initial comparative

advantage in R&D. Then, when policy is      introduced   in one country or the

other, the implications of the dynamic resource reallocation for the global

efficiency of R&D will be all the more significant.

     Now suppose that the two countries differ initially only in (effective)

size, as measured by h. Recall that, with equal rates of diffusion, a small

tariff in either country does not affect the long-run rate of growth. We find

now, however,



Proposition 9: Suppose b1—b2. s1—s2 and -A small. Then a small tariff on

 imports of final goods raises the long-run growth rate if and only if the

 policy is introduced by the country with the relatively smaller effective

 labor force.



      Here, the larger country will come to acquire comparative advantage in

 R&D, though it starts with none. The reason is as follows. With differential

 rates of diffusion, knowledge takes on the characteristics of a local public

 g. The larger country will have more (effective) scientists to benefit

 from this non-excludable good as its share in world R&D exceeds one half. So

 it acquires over time a relatively larger knowledge base and hence a

 relatively more productive corps of researchers. Trade policy that serves Co

 divert resources away from the R&D sector in the larger country once
                                           41

comparative advantage has been established must be detrimental to growth.

      The effects of demand-size bias are similar. We    have


Prooosicipn 10:     Suppose b1—b2. h1—h2 and A,-A small. Then a smalL tariff on

imports of final goods raises the long-run growth rate if and only if the

policy is introduced in the country whose final good captures a majority share

of world spending.



The argument should be apparent. The country whose good is in relatively

greater demand must devote relatively more of its resources to final-goods

production. Thus, its R&D sector initially will be smaller. This country

develops over time a comparative disadvantage in R&D, as its learning lags

that in its trade partner country. Protection in this country will improve

world efficiency of R&D and thereby speed growth.

      Once we allow for lags in the diffusion of scientific knowledge an

differential speeds of diffusion within versus between countries we find a

richer set of possibilities for the long-run effects of trade policy.

Comparative advantage continues to play a critical role in determining whether

policy in one country will speed or decelerate growth. But comparative

advantage now must be interpreted with care, since its measure combines

natural ability and the (endogenous) benefits from cumulative experience.16

Since steady-state productivity in R&D varies positively with the size of the

R&D   sector,   all determinants of the equilibrium allocation of resources to


     16 Endogenous comparative advantage also plays a central role in
Krugman's (1987) analysis of commodity-specific learning-by-doing. There, as
here, productivity increases with cumulative experience. But each good is
produced in only one country in Krugutan's model, so long-run comparative
advantage is fully determined by the initial pattern of specialization.
                                       42

this sector come to be important in the analysis of policy.



VII. Conclusions

     In this paper, we have analyzed a dynamic, two-country model of trade and

growth in which long-run productivity gains stem from the profit-maximizing

behavior of entrepreneurs. We have studied the determinants of R&D. where

research bears fruit in the form of designs for new intermediate products and

in making further research less costly. New intermediate products permit

greater specialization in the process of manufacturing consumer goods, thereby

enhancing productivity in final production. In order to highlight the role of

endogenous technological improvements as a source of growth, we have

abstracted entirely from factor accumulation. But Romer (1988) has shown that

capital accumulation can be introduced into a model such as the one we have

studied without affecting the analysis in any significant way.

     The interesting features of our analysis arise due to the assumed

presence of cross-country differences in efficiency at R&D and manufacturing-

Considerations of comparative advantage in research versus manufacturing of

 intermediate goods bear importantly on the Implications of economic structure

 and economic policy for long-run patterns of specialization and long-run rates

 of growth. We find, for example, that growth in world resources or

 improvements in R&D efficiency need not speed the rate of steady-state growth,

 if those changes occur predominantly in the country with comparative

 disadvantage in R&D. Similarly, shifts in preferences in favor of the final

 good produced by the country with comparative advantage in R&D will reduce the

 long-run rate of world growth.

      Concerning policy, we find for the first time a link between trade
                                       43

intervention and long-run growth. Any (small) trade policy that switches

spending toward the consumer good produced by the country with comparative

advantage In R&D will cause long-run growth rates to decline. Subsidies to

R&D will accelerate growth when applied at equal rates in both countries, but

need not do so if introduced only in the country with comparative disadvantage

in R&D. When knowledge spillovers occur with a time lag and diffusion is

faster within the country of origin than across national borders, comparative

advantage becomes endogenous. Once we recognize that comparative advantage

can be acoutred as well as natural, we find a role for country size and

demand-size bias in determining the long-run effects of policy.

     Our emphasis on comparative advantage in research and development

highlights only one channel through which trade structure and commercial

policy might affect long-run growth. In other contexts, the trade environment

might influence the rate of accumulation of human capital or the rate at which

a technologically lagging (less developed) country adopts for local use the

existing off-the-shelf techniques of production. Investigation of the links

between trade regime and these other sources of growth seems to us a worthy

topic for future research.
