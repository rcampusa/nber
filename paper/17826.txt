China's Potential Future Growth and Gains from Trade Policy Bargaining: Some Numerical

                                             ABSTRACT

Numerical simulation analysis of bargaining solutions is little developed in existing literature. Here
we use a multi country, single period numerical general equilibrium model which captures China and
her major trading partners and examine the outcomes of trade policy bargaining solutions (bargaining
over tariffs and financial transfers) over time as China grows more rapidly than her trade partners.
We compute gains relative to non-cooperative Nash equilibria for a range of model parameterizations.
This yields a measure of both absolute and relative gain to China from bargaining. We calibrate our
model to base case data for 2008 and use a model formulation where there are heterogeneous goods
across countries. The gains from trade bargaining accrue more heavily to other countries when we
use 2008 data rather than later year data.

We then consider the impacts out into the future of different country growth rates which sharply increases
China’s relative size. Our objective is to assess how China’s gains from bargaining change over time;
whether they grow at a faster rate than GDP growth and for which parameterizations. Our simulation
results indicate that China’s welfare gain from trade bargaining will increase over time if countries
keep their present GDP growth rates for several decades, but there are major difference when using
different bargaining solution concepts. These differences have not been noted in existing literature
but have an intuitive explanation. Our results also indicate that if China jointly bargains along with
India, Brazil and other developing countries with the OECD, China’s gain will further increase. Bargaining
gains are also sensitive to country size. When we use PPP to adjust China’s relative GDP size; China’s
trade bargaining welfare gain increases by about 37%.

1. Introduction

    China’s trade has grown rapidly in recent decades and has generated large trade

surpluses, which have financed an accumulation of foreign reserves. Exports have

become one of its main engines of economic growth which in turn have generated

adjustment resistance in importing countries. Increasingly over time this will take

China to more and more trade policy bargaining to try to use access for foreign

suppliers to the growing Chinese market as the bargaining chip to keep protection

abroad as low as possible given China’s export lead growth strategy. Given this

situation, an interesting question to ask is how China’s welfare gains from trade

bargaining might change over time if countries keep their present GDP growth rates

and China’s relative size in the global economy progressively grows further. Our

focus is the impact of growth on bargaining power over several decades. Our aim is

not only to capture China’s welfare gains from bargaining over time, and to

investigate China’s future shifting bargaining power, but also assess how calculated

gains from bargaining behave over time. Do they increase more or less rapidly than

relative GDP growth? Do they increase at an accelerating rate?

    Existing literature on bargaining is theoretical and analytical rather than

numerical (Nash, 1950; Johnson, 1965; Kalai and Smorodinsky, 1975; Rubinstein,

1982; Roth et al, 1991; Trejos and Wright, 1995; Johnson et al, 2002; Cahuc et al,

2006; Kennan, 2010). The focus is on bargaining solution concepts and bargaining

theory, and only a few papers have used numerical techniques to compute bargaining

solutions (Trifon and Landau, 1974; Calmfors et al, 1988; Coles and Muthoo, 1998;
                                          3
Carpenter, 2002). With the exception of Abrego et al (2001) this numerical literature

on bargaining does not use general equilibrium structures to numerically solve for

bargaining outcomes. They are instead mostly based on partial equilibrium models

and few of them have been used for simulation analyses related to concrete policy

issues. Our focus and methods, however, differ sharply from Abrego et al (2001) in

examining the links between bargaining power and growth rather than the links

between environmental policies and trade bargaining that they explore.

    Our global general equilibrium model captures five countries, each of which is

endowed with two factors and produces two goods which are heterogeneous across

countries. Countries are linked through trade and they bargain on their own import

tariffs which, for simplicity, we assume are at uniform rates across goods imported

from a country, but can vary across country sources. Since, for now, China’s trade

partners are more heavily developed countries, we assume China bargains bilaterally

with the whole of the OECD. Using this model structure, we then explore bargaining

solution outcomes and simulate welfare gains for each bargaining partner under

various scenarios which reflect changes in country size as growth proceeds.

    We adopt 2008 as our base year and build a benchmark data set which we use to

calibrate model parameters. We then analyze China’s welfare gains over time at ten

yearly intervals from 2010 to 2100 as China’s endowments grow at different rates

from those of other countries. These gains are computed as a sequence of single

period comparisons of numerical bargaining solutions using different solution

concepts (Nash (NBS), Kalai-Smorodinsky (KS)) relative to non-cooperative Nash

                                          4
outcomes to yield measures of country gains from bargaining in both absolute size of

utility gain and each country’s relative gain. We evaluate China’s welfare gain over

time using both Nash bargaining and KS bargaining with the OECD, thus yielding the

change in China’s welfare gain over time from bargaining. We also evaluate China’s

welfare gain when bargaining jointly with the OECD with India and Brazil. We finally

compute China’s bargaining welfare gains over time using a purchasing power parity

(PPP) adjustment for China’s relative size in the 2008 base year data. We additionally

conduct sensitivity analysis of China’s bargaining welfare gains to elasticity

parameters.

     Our simulation results show that China’s welfare gains from bargaining with the

OECD increase over time if all countries keep their present GDP growth rates. Using

the NB solution concept, China’s share of global bargaining gains grows to 41% in

2010; 67.7% in 2050 and 88.7% in 2100. This shows growth in bargaining gains at

roughly the rate of increase in relative GDP. China’s annual average growth rate in its

trade bargaining welfare gain using Nash bargaining is about 11%, just a little higher

than its GDP growth rate and the OECD’s is about 6%, higher than its GDP growth

rate. But using the KS-solution concept, things are different. China’s share of global

gains is only 10.6% in 2010, but grows much more rapidly to 70.9% in 2050 and to

99.1% in 2100; initially proportionally smaller but growing much faster, with the

opposite result for the OECD. This implies important numerical differences when

using Nash and KS bargaining solution concepts for numerical policy based work.

With asymmetric shifts in the utility possibility frontier due to growth, Nash

                                           5
bargaining using tangencies between an implicit Cobb Douglas function and the

frontier, and the KS use of a utopia point proportional to intersections with axes which

behaves differently.

     Additionally, when China joins with India and Brazil to jointly bargain with the

OECD or when we use a PPP adjustment for the GDP measure in 2008 for China’s

base case economic size, China’s welfare gain from bargaining increases by 40% and

37% compared to the Nash China-OECD bargaining case. Thus, if we take account of

China’s relative size via purchasing power parity, China’s welfare gain would be even

larger. It also emerges as a good strategy for China to join with other developing

countries to jointly bargain with the OECD exerting its bargaining power.

     For computational reasons we use strong assumptions to conduct our analysis,

and these affect results. One key issue is that we use a balanced trade structure in our

general equilibrium model which neglects China’s trade surplus position and likely

over estimates China’s bargaining power since imports are smaller in reality due to

the surplus. However, this may not be as severe a problem as it may seem because

although we adjust trade data for each country’s trade to be balanced; for China we

only change ROW’s exports and imports to yield this result. Trade between China,

OECD, India and Brazil does not change and are the same as actual data in our

analysis. The balanced trade structure thus does not fundamentally change China’s

trade position with OECD, India and Brazil, and may not impact China’s trade

bargaining power. We do not, however, capture the potential bargaining component

for China from the strategic use of reserves to drive down exchange rates unless

                                           6
market access for exports is preserved.

     This paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we discuss China’s current trade

situation with other countries, and briefly discuss how future growth may change this.

Section 3 describes the model structure and the bargaining solution concepts we use.

Section 4 sets out our data used in calibration and reports calibrated parameters.

Section 5 reports simulation results and computes China’s trade bargaining welfare

gains for the growth scenarios discussed above. Section 6 offers conclusions,

implications and final remarks.

2. Background to China’s Trade Policy Bargaining

    China’s trade has grown quickly in the past few decades. In 1980, export and

import values were only US$18.12 billion and US$20.02 billion, and the trade

imbalance was -1.9US$ billion. By 2010, China’s export and import values had

increased to US$1577.93 billion and US$1394.83 billion respectively, and the trade

balance was US$183.1 billion. China’s exports had thus increased 87.1 times and

imports 69.7 times over 30 years (CSY, 2010).

    Large trade surpluses and export volumes bring trade disputes and China has also

been one of the largest recipient of trade disputes. In 2010, China’s trade disputes

included 64 antidumping cases, which covered US$7 billion in exports (MCS, 2010).

In the presence of these trade disputes, trade policy bargaining naturally occurs. By

the mid-2000s China was involved in negotiations with 27 countries and regions

regarding free trade agreements (FTAs) or Closer Economic Partnership Agreements

(CEPA). These now cover over one-fifth of China’s total trade. China has also signed

FTAs with the ten-member ASEAN group, Chile, Pakistan and New Zealand and is in

FTA negotiations with the six-member GCC, the five-member South African Customs

Union, and also Australia. In addition, China is also looking into the feasibility of

China–Japan–South Korea, China–Japan and China–South Korea FTAs (Hoadley and

Yang, 2008).

    In the bargaining process, as we model it, China exchanges access commitments

to her own market in return for access commitments abroad. Globally joint gains will

be maximized under free trade, but bargaining can also involve financial transfers
                                          8
which move countries along the global utility possibilities frontier. Bargaining

outcomes can also be represented analytically using a range of bargaining solution

concepts. Here we use Nash (1951) bargaining and an alternative solution concept

proposed by Kalai and Smorodinsky (1975). We measure the gain to China from trade

policy bargaining as the utility difference between that achieved under bargaining and

that represented by a disagreement outcome represented by a non-cooperative Nash

equilibrium. These are computed for the model presented below. Our interest is to

assess how China’s welfare gains from bargaining might change over time if all

countries were to keep their current country growth rates over different periods.

China’s high growth rate relative to other countries is expected to enhance her

bargaining power.

     China’s trade with developing countries grew quickly over the last 10 years. If

we take India and Brazil as examples (Figure 1), China’s exports to and imports from

India increased 26 times and 15 times between 2000 and 2010. Brazil’s trade with

China has also grown quickly, and in this period the average annual growth rate

reached 154.5% (UN, 2010). Developing country growth rates of trade with China are

much higher than the average total trade growth rate for China between 2000 and

2010 (annually about 25%). But, although China-South trade has grown quickly,

China’s main export markets remain the developed countries, and we assume China

gains by cooperating with other developing countries to jointly bargain with

developed countries through our period of analysis, even though in reality differing

country growth rates could reverse the incentives.

3. Model Structure and Bargaining Solutions

     We compute both non-cooperative and cooperative bargaining solutions utilizing

a 5 country numerical general equilibrium model with each country producing 2

goods and using 2 factors. We use the Armington assumption of product heterogeneity

by country in consumption and each country has import tariffs. We numerically

compute a sequence of Nash equilibria and alternative bargaining solutions over time,

treating each solution as corresponding to a single period outcome. These numerical

solutions vary over time due to the higher Chinese growth rate. We compute welfare

gains from bargaining as the utility difference between cooperative and

non-cooperative solutions for each period in time and do so for each bargaining

solution concept. We do this for each country in the model and under different growth

and size scenarios.

     3.1 Model Structure

     The model has five countries with each country producing two goods with two

factors. The five countries are China, OECD, India, Brazil and the rest of the world

(ROW). The two products are tradable goods and non-tradable goods, and the two

factor inputs are labor and capital.

     On the production side of each economy, we assume CES functions in each

country and Figure 2 outlines the production structure we use. On the consumption

side, we assume a one level CES utility function for consumers in each country

(Figure 2). Under this treatment, individuals choose among domestic and imported

tradable goods and domestic non-tradable goods. The Armington assumption applies
                                         11
for imported goods. Under this, domestic and imported goods are heterogeneous and

this removes specialization problems from the model.

     The model assumes balanced trade as is conventional in general equilibrium

trade models; but we comment later on how to modify the model to account for

China’s large trade imbalance. Thus, in equilibrium, each country’s export

expenditures equal its import expenditures, i.e.

      P
      i   h
                       i

where PCi jh is the consumer price of good i in country j importing from country h.

Equation (5) is not a condition for equilibrium; it is instead a property of equilibrium

in our model structure.

     3.2 Bargaining Solutions

     We compute both bargaining and non-cooperative solutions to trade policy

games in the model by including import tariffs in the model. Countries mutually

consistently set strategically determined tariff rates in a Nash equilibrium and free

trade with tariffs between countries supporting bargained outcomes with appropriate

inter country lump sum transfers. For simplicity, in comparisons of Nash equilibrium

we assume country j has a uniform ad valorem import duty ti j across goods i, which

                                                                   13
implies that:

     PCi jh  (1  ti j ) Pi h ，   jh                                          (6)

     For the global general equilibrium model set out above, we use a benchmark data

set to calibrate parameters, then numerically solve for bargaining solutions and

non-cooperative Nash equilibrium and then calculate each country’s welfare gain.

     The non-cooperative tariff game we analyze is as originally formulated by Nash

(1950). After his initial characterization of a bargaining solution (closely related to

Cournot’s bilateral monopoly formulation) much subsequent work has generated other

solution concepts. Some of these are surveyed in Roth (1979), Kalai (1985), Peters

(1987, 1992), and Thomson (1985, 1994).

     Despite the large numbers of solution concepts that have been introduced in the

literature, three play a central role in theory as it is widely used today (Thomson,

1994). One is Nash’s original solution concept, which selects the point at which the

product of utility gains is maximal. The second is a solution concept due to Kalai and

Smorodinsky (1975) named the KS-solution, which selects the point at which utility

gains are proportional to their maximal possible values within the feasible utility

possibilities set. Finally comes the Egalitarian solution (Thomson, 1983) that equates

utility gains relative to non-cooperative outcomes among players. We use Nash

bargaining (NBS) and KS solutions as our concepts in solving for bargaining

outcomes in our model as China’s size grows in the following ways.

     3.2.1 Nash Bargaining Solution

     Our formal statement of Nash’s cooperative two-person bargaining formulation

                                          14
is as follows: Two agents have access to any of the alternatives in a set, called the

feasible set. Their preferences over these alternatives differ. If they agree on a

particular alternative, that is what they get. Otherwise, they end up at a prespecified

alternative in the feasible set, called the disagreement point. Both the feasible set and

the disagreement point are in utility space. Let them be given by S and d respectively.

Nash’s objective was to help to predict the compromises that agents would reach. He

specified a class of bargaining problems which conformed to his analysis, and he

defined a solution to be a rule that associates with each (S, d) in the class a point in S,

and interpreted this as the compromise. He formulated a list of properties, or axioms,

that he thought solutions should satisfy (Thomson, 1994).

     Specifically, the NBS is obtained by maximizing the product of utility gains

relative to the disagreement point, that is, N(S, d) is the maximization of

     Max ( X i  di )      X  S, X  d                                             (7)

Where Xi is the NBS utility of individual i, d is the disagreement point, and di is the

disagreement utility for individual i. Figure 3 depicts this solution concept for these

two cases.

     3.2.2 KS-solution Concept

     The KS-solution concept focuses on utility gains relative to the disagreement

point as proportional to the agents’ most optimistic expectations. For each agent, these

expectations are defined as the highest utility they can attain in the feasible set,

subject to the constraint that no agent should receive less than his coordinate at the

disagreement point.

                                            15
     More precisely, for a given bargaining problem (S, d) we can define the utopia

point u *  (u *A , uB* ) by

      ui*  Max{ui | u  S , u j  d j for i  j}                 i  A, B                               (8)

     The KS-solution is then given by

      u KS ( S , d )  d   (u*  d )                                                                   (9)

Where   max{  IR | d   (u  d )  S} . In a two-person bargaining case, the

KS-solution can be described by the solution to:

      Max[(u AKS  d A )  (u BKS  d B )]
                    u AKS u *A                                                                           (10)
            s.t.         
                    u BKS u B*

where A and B are two bargaining partners. Figure 3 depicts the Nash and KS

solutions.

      3.3 Using A Numerical GE Model to Analyze Bargaining and

Non-cooperative Nash Equilibria

      We first compute non-cooperative equilibria and then using the same

parameterization of the model for the year at issue explore cooperative bargaining

outcomes for a sequence of model formulations which vary over time in the size of

China relative to other countries. To compute non-cooperative Nash equilibria, we
                                                             16
iterate over calculations of optimal tariff policy responses by individual regions to

tariff settings of other regions; subject to the constraint of full general equilibrium

within the period. We then iterate across country tariffs and then countries until

convergence to a non-cooperative Nash equilibrium is achieved. We then compute

cooperative     NBS    and     cooperative      KS      solutions   associated   with      these

parameterizations as the next step.

     In computing cooperative bargaining equilibria, we take the non-cooperative

Nash equilibrium utilities as representing the disagreement point, iteratively generate

the utility possibilities frontier under cooperation, and apply both the Nash or KS

criterion to the product of the differences in region utilities along the frontier and

disagreement utilities (Abrego et al, 2001).

     In   computing        non-cooperative      equilibria,   we    adopt   Nash’s       (1951)

non-cooperative solution concept. In the five-country general equilibrium model, the

method for computing non-cooperative Nash equilibrium is to iterate over

calculations of optimal tariffs by individual countries, which are

     Max(ui )    s.t. GE          i  country                                           (11)


where GE denotes a five country complete general equilibrium. We use (11) to obtain

convergence to a Nash equilibrium.

     After computing non-cooperative equilibrium tariffs, we can determine the

disagreement point and then simulate the utilities possibilities frontier under

cooperation, and apply the Nash bargaining criterion

     Max (ui  di )         s.t GE          i  A, B                                (12)


                                                17
to obtain the cooperative Nash bargaining equilibrium.

     A solution to (10) determines the KS bargaining outcome. In the process of

solving for a KS bargaining solution, we need to calculate the utopia point

utility u *  (u*A , uB* ) , which we get by separately maximizing each bargaining partner’s

utility subject to the constraints of GE.

     3.4 Welfare Gain from Bargaining and Bargaining Power

     The country welfare gain from bargaining is taken to be the utility difference

between the disagreement point and a NBS or KS-solution. We use

     gaini  uiNBS / KS  di  uiNBS / KS  uinon cooperative       i  country    (13)

                                                   NBS / KS
to denote the welfare gain from bargaining where ui         reflects utility in the

presence of Nash or KS bargaining. We also compute the welfare gain by country

                  gaini          uiNBS / KS  d i
     sharei                                                    i  country        (14)
                  gaini
                  i
                                 (uiNBS / KS  di )
                                 i


This latter index represents a country’s bargaining welfare gain as their share of the

total bargaining welfare gain.

4. Data and Calibration of Model Parameters

      We use calibration of our general equilibrium model to base year data as in

Shoven and Whalley (1992) to generate the parameters for our model. We take 2008

as our base year and build a benchmark general equilibrium data set in which, also

following Shoven and Whalley (1992), all the model general equilibrium conditions

hold. In this data set, there are five countries China, OECD, India, Brazil and the

ROW, two sectors involving tradable goods and non-tradable goods, and two factor

inputs (capital and labor). We take services as non-tradable goods1 and manufactures

as tradable goods as in Abrego et al (2001). We use data for the world minus China,

OECD, India and Brazil to generate data for the ROW.

      The data we use for the base case equilibrium in model calibration are shown in

Tables 1 and 2. Chinese data come mostly from the Chinese Statistical Yearbook

(CSY), OECD data from the OECD statistical database, and India and Brazil data

from the World Bank database. ROW data are calculated as a residual from world data

which are taken from the US CIA (Central Intelligence Agency) database. All bilateral

export and import data come from the UN database and the OECD statistical

database.

      All data are converted to US$ at market exchange rates. Production, capital and

trade values in the tables are in billion US$. Export and import values for the OECD

are less than the sum of country statistics, because we have removed export and

import values between OECD countries. In numerical general equilibrium analysis, it
1
  Non-tradable goods in our calculation includes: (1) wholesale and retail trade, repair, hotels; (2) Financial
intermediation, real estate, renting and business activity; (3) other service activities.

is usual to adjust data so as to set both producer and factor prices equal to 1. We have

so adjusted each country’s factor input and the ROW’s export and import data.

        The production and utility functions in our model are all CES; and the elasticity

specification used affects model results. There are no available estimates of

elasticities for China either on the demand or production side (Dong and Whalley,

2010). Many of the estimates of domestic and import goods substitution elasticities

for other countries are around 2 (Betina et al, 2006) and so we set all these elasticities

in the model equal to 2 (the same as Whalley and Wang (2010)). We later change

these elasticities in sensitivity analysis to check their impacts on simulation results.

                                                                        20

        In order to calculate bargaining partners’ welfare gains over time from 2010 to
2100, we use each country’s GDP growth rate in the future. We take each country’s
average annual GDP growth rate in the last decade (from 2001 to 2010) as the future
annual factor endowment growth rate in the model for the next 90 years from 2010 to
21002. We assume these growth rates are constant over time, and it is the differential
growth rates for China and other countries that enhances China’s bargaining power
over time.
        Countries’ GDP growth rates between 2001-2010 are displayed in Figure 4. We
take the world growth rate as the ROW growth rate. From these data we see that
China’s and OECD’s annual average GDP growth rates in the last decade are 10.47%
and 1.66%; while the growth rates of India, Brazil and ROW are 7.85%, 3.62% and
2.50% (Table 4).

  Here we use endowment growth to realize GDP growth in the same rate may not very accurate, the reason is we
have not taken account of the productivity growth, and some country’s GDP growth may rely more on one factor
growth.

5. Simulation Results

     We next report our simulation results. In reality, China’s trade bargaining

partners are for now mainly developed countries. Even though they may change over

time with different country growth rates, we assume, for simplicity, that China will

always bargain with the OECD in all the years considered by our model. Both China

and its bargaining partner’s welfare gains from bargaining changes over time (from

2010 to 2100) and are computed using five different scenarios. These are from single

NBS bargaining with OECD; under KS bargaining solution concepts; for sensitivity

analysis of gains to elasticities; from China, India and Brazil jointly bargaining with

the OECD; and from bargaining after a PPP adjustment to China’s and other countries

size in the base case data. We report these welfare gains in three different ways: in

value, in shares and average annual growth rates of the gain. These values reflect

equation (13), and the shares reflect equation (14). The average annual growth rates of

the welfare gains from bargaining are calculated separately.

    5.1 China’s gain over time under bargaining with OECD

    We first report welfare gains for China from bargaining singly with the OECD

over time between 2010-2100 with estimates reported for each 10 year period. We

calculate non-cooperative equilibria and cooperative bargaining solutions for each

year, and then calculate bargaining gains. Table 5 presents these results for 10 yearly

intervals between 2010 and 2100.

    Under Nash bargaining, in 2010 the share of the welfare gain for China is 41%

and the OECD gain is 59%. As China grows, its welfare gain share of the total welfare
                                          23
gain for China and the OECD increases to 67.7% in 2050, with the OECD share

32.3%. In 2100, China gets 88.7% of the total welfare gain and the OECD gets 11.3%.

It is thus clear that China’s welfare gain from bargaining will increase over time.

     The welfare gain China receives from NB is 111.6 in 2010, 2313.8 in 2050 (a

more than 20 times increase), and 84980 in 2100 which is 761 times compared to

2010. The OECD has a utility gain of 160.4 in 2010, 1106.3 in 2050 which increases

6.9 times, and 10807.1 in 2100 which increases 67.4 times compared with 2010

(Figure 5). If we compare China’s welfare gain with that of the OECD, we find that in

2030 China’s welfare gain will exceed that of the OECD if all countries keep their

present GDP growth rates.

     We have also used the KS solution concept to compute China-OECD bargaining

results and their welfare gains. Table 6 reports welfare gain shares, and value and

growth rates for both China and the OECD.

     China’s share in 2010 is only 10.6%, much smaller than under NB. In 2040 it

increases to 53% and exceeds that of the OECD. In 2050 China’s share is 70.9% and

reaches 99.1% in 2100; much larger than NB. On the value side, China’s welfare gain

is 28.7 in 2010, 2424.3 in 2050 and 94921.4 in 2100; increasing about 84 times and

3307 times compared to results for 2010. OECD’s gain increases about 4 times by

2050 and 3.5 times in 2100 compared to 2010. These growth factors are much larger

for China under KS than NB, but much smaller for ROW. From the growth results,

China’s welfare gain grows rapidly in the early years and gradually grows more

slowly in later years. The OECD gain growth rate is also comparatively higher in the

early years, but becomes negative after 2070.

    When we compare welfare gains for China and OECD using the KS and NB

solution concepts, we find that before 2050, China’s welfare gains under NBS are

more than under KS, and OECD’s welfare gain under NBS is less than under KS. But

after 2050, gains for both China and OECD change to the opposite relationship

(Figure 7). Welfare gain variation trends do not change under different solution

concepts.

    We next compare both China and OECD welfare gain shares and growth rates

under different bargaining solution concepts. These results are reported in Figure 8.

Share results are the same as for values, and before 2050 China shares are more under

NBS but after 2050 China’s share is more under KS. The growth rates of welfare

                                                              26
gains change a lot for both China and OECD. They are both larger before 2050 and

become less after 2050. For the OECD, its growth rate becomes negative after 2070.

    These sharp differences in results across these different solution concepts are

especially interesting since this different numerical behavior of the concepts has not

been noted in previous literature and has a seemingly intuitive explanation; a link in

our view which affects the relative attractiveness of the two solution concepts. For the

KS case, welfare gains reflect bargaining by comparing maximal utility along the

utility possibility frontier. As China grows and especially in later years after 2050,

there is an asymmetric shift in the utility possibility frontier and its maximal utility

will increase much more than the OECD. Under KS, therefore, China will receive

most of the welfare gain. Under NBS, the product of each partner’s utility gain is

maximized. This allocates the total welfare gain by region without paying attention to

the asymmetric utility possibility frontier shift. Thus China’s welfare gain after 2050

                                                          27
is much less under NB than under the KS solution concept.

      These different bargaining results thus give sharply different values showing a

major numerical difference in bargaining solution concepts between NBS and

KS-solutions. As we indicate above, these sharp differences in numerical behavior

have not been noted in existing research literature.

       5.3 The Sensitivity of China’s Bargaining Gains to Elasticities

      We check the sensitivity of China’s and OECD’s welfare gain values to

elasticities in single China-OECD Nash bargaining in this part. These results can help

us assess the robustness of our simulation results.

      Note: For simplicity, we just change elasticities in the last simulated non-cooperative equilibrium utility and
NBS utility stage to check the sensitivity of each bargaining country’s welfare gains. We have not recalibrated the
model as elasticities change, and have not changed the elasticities in computing non-cooperative equilibria import
tariffs and NB solutions.

      We change all of the elasticities in production and consumption for each country

simultaneously from 1.2 to 2.8. Results are presented in Table 7.

     It is clear that as elasticities increase, China’s welfare gain value will increase

and the positive trend has not changed; in the meanwhile, OECD’s welfare gain value

also increases as elasticities increase except when elasticities are equal to 1.6.

Additionally China’s welfare gain share has nearly no change in every year under

each elasticity value. This suggests that our simulation results are robust and credible.

     5.4 Welfare Gains When China, India and Brazil Jointly Bargain with the

OECD

     China and other developing countries’ trade partners are mostly developed

countries, and they often have trade disputes with developed countries. Thus, if China

can join with other large developing countries to jointly bargain with the OECD, it

will increase China’s bargaining power and yield more welfare gains.

     In this part we assume China joins with India and Brazil to jointly bargain with

the OECD and then simulate their welfare gains. It is complicated to deal with four

way bilateral bargaining, so we compute two-person bargaining solutions to simplify

the calculation. We add China, India and Brazil together as one country, and this one

bigger country bargains with the OECD. After we get the Nash equilibrium import

tariff rates, we separate these countries again to compute each country’s welfare gain

from the bargaining.

     We show the welfare gain results in this case in Table 8. For the welfare gain

share, China’s share in 2010 is 40.5%, 64.2% in 2050 and 79.2% in 2100; this exceeds

the OECD share in 2020. China receives most of the welfare gain, and then comes the

OECD, but after 2080 India’s gain is also more than that of the OECD. Trends in

welfare gain changes for each country are the same as for the shares. For the annual

average growth rate, China’s and India’s growth rates are both higher than the

OECD’s in all of the years.

values under Joint NB in Figure 9. The results show that China will benefit more from

joint bargaining in all years, and China’s welfare gain will increase about 40% under

jointly bargaining. OECD’s welfare gain value shows nearly no change. Although the

OECD suffers from China’s improved bargaining power it can also gain from the

import tariff reductions by India and Brazil.

     We compare the welfare gain growth rate for China and the OECD under NB in

Figure 10. These results reveal that China’s gain growth rates under joint bargaining

are higher than under single bargaining except in the year 2020. This means that

China has benefitted from joint bargaining in terms of gain growth. OECD’s gain

growth rate in the early years before 2060 is reduced by joint bargaining, but it also

benefits from joint bargaining after 2060. The reason may be that as China and India

become larger, the OECD can also benefit from their increased economic scale and

demand.

    5.5 China’s Gain Over Time from Bargaining Under PPP

     A widely argued idea is that China’s foreign exchange rate has been undervalued

and that the RMB’s real currency purchasing power is higher than its market rate

measure. Therefore if we adjust China’s economic scale with PPP (Purchasing Power

Parity) to simulate bargaining welfare gains, China’s gain may increase more. We

choose a PPP conversion factor from the World Bank world development indicator

database to adjust China’s economic size in base case data. From this database, the

conversion indicator of US$/RMB¥ is 4 in 2008, not 6.83 as for the nominal exchange

rate. After adjusting China’s economic scale for PPP and adjusting the benchmark

data set and recalibrating the model, we compute bargaining solutions and welfare

gains again and show the results in Table 9.

     These results suggest that China’s welfare gains from bargaining will exceed

those of the OECD in 2030; and China’s share will reach 69.3% in 2050 and 89.2% in

2100. China’s welfare gain values increase separately by about 21 times and 752

times in 2050 and 2100 compared with 2010. For the welfare gain growth rate, China

averages 10.8% and the OECD average is about 5.9%.

     Figure 11 compares welfare gains both for China and the OECD under PPP with

gains under the market foreign exchange calculation. We find that both country

                                                 32
welfare gain values have increased, and China’s gain has increased by about 37%.

This implies that China’s increased scale has benefitted both itself and the OECD in

absolute welfare gain from bargaining.

rates under PPP with results using market exchange rates. An apparent trend is the

PPP adjustment to China’s economic scale which increases China’s gain share and

decreases the OECD’s gain share. OECD’s gain growth rates also decline after PPP

adjustment, but China’s gain growth rates increase before 2060 but decrease after

2060 compared to results without PPP adjustment.

6. Concluding Remarks

     We use a five country, two goods two factors per country general equilibrium

model to numerically compute trade bargaining solutions and calculate China’s

welfare gains from bargaining over time between 2010 and 2100 under different

scenarios. Our findings are as follows.

     Firstly, China’s welfare gains from bargaining with the OECD increases over

time if its GDP keeps its present high growth rate. By 2030 China’s gain will exceed

that of the OECD. China’s share of the global welfare gain from cooperative Nash

bargaining in 2010 is 41%, and increases to 54.8% in 2030, 67.7% in 2050 and 88.7%

in 2100. China’s average annual growth rate of welfare gains from bargaining is about

11%, a little higher than its GDP growth rate. OECD’s gain growth rate is about 6%,

much higher than its GDP growth rate, which suggests China’s high growth will

benefit the OECD.

     Second, under the KS-solution concept, China’s welfare gains from bargaining

decrease before 2050 but increase later (after 2050) compared with NBS. The OECD

is the contrary case. China’s welfare gain share in 2010 under the KS-solution is just

10.6% but reaches 99.1% in 2100. Both countries show a gradually slower annual

average growth rate, especially for the OECD, its growth rate after 2060 becomes

negative. These results allow us to compare differences in numerical behavior for

different solution concepts for NBS and KS-solution, which has not been done in

previous literature.

     Third, when China joins with India and Brazil to jointly bargain with the OECD,
                                          35
its welfare gains from bargaining increase by about 40% compared with single

bargaining results, and the annual average growth rate of its welfare gain increases to

about 11.4%, a little higher than under single country bargaining. In the meanwhile,

OECD’s welfare gains show almost no reduction compared with single bargaining

results. Therefore, it is a useful strategy for China to join with other developing

countries to improve its bargaining power.

     When we use PPP to adjust China’s economic scale, its welfare gains from

bargaining increase about 37% compared with the results without a PPP adjustment;

and China’s annual average growth rate of its welfare gain is about 10.8%, nearly the

same as without PPP adjustment. These results suggest that China’s welfare gains

from bargaining will be larger if we take account of purchasing power parity.
