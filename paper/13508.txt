Is Real-Time Pricing Green?: The Environmental Impacts of Electricity Demand Variance

NBER Working Paper No. 13508
October 2007
JEL No. L51,L94,Q53

                                            ABSTRACT

Real-time pricing (RTP) of electricity would improve allocative efficiency and limit wholesalers' market
power. Conventional wisdom claims that RTP provides additional environmental benefits. This paper
argues that RTP will reduce the variance, both within- and across-days, in the quantity of electricity
demanded. We estimate the short-run impacts of this reduction on SO2, NOx, and CO2 emissions.
Reducing variance decreases emissions in regions where peak demand is met more by oil-fired capacity
than by hydropower, such as the Mid-Atlantic. However, reducing variance increases emissions in
more US regions, namely those with more hydropower like the West. The effects are relatively small.

1     Introduction

Economists have long advocated for electricity pricing that accurately reflects time-varying
production costs.1 In particular, they have argued that real-time pricing of electricity (RTP)
would improve the eﬃciency of electricity consumption and investment and would lessen
the potential harm from market power. However, these recommendations have met serious
political opposition despite advances in real-time metering and in technology for responding
to real-time prices.2 Recently some environmental groups have supported real-time pricing
for its potential to reduce pollution.3 Indeed, the conventional wisdom seems to be that
RTP will yield environmental benefits.4
    RTP may aﬀect the environment in several ways. In the short run, changes in generation
will aﬀect emissions, water discharge, nuclear waste production, and fossil fuel use. In the
long run, RTP will aﬀect investment decisions for generation and consumption. For any of
these impacts, this paper is the first to examine whether RTP is green. We focus on the
short run impacts on emissions of sulfur dioxide, SO2 , nitrogen oxides, NOx , and carbon
dioxide, CO2 , for various U.S. electricity regions.5
    RTP may aﬀect emissions by changing the distribution of electricity load.6 The demand
for electricity varies throughout the day due to hourly changes in, for example, temperature
and economic activity. If the retail prices do not vary, customers conserve less than would
be eﬃcient during peak periods, but conserve more than would be eﬃcient during oﬀ-peak
periods. For example, during a peak period (e.g., on a hot afternoon in Texas), the wholesale
price of electricity is higher than the flat retail price. If customers faced the higher real-time
price, each would use less electricity, and the system load would be smaller. Conversely,
in an oﬀ-peak period (e.g., late at night), the wholesale price is lower than the flat retail
price, and the system load would be greater under RTP. Since real-time pricing decreases
load in the peak periods and increases load oﬀ-peak, the eﬀect on average load is ambiguous.


                                                1
However, real-time pricing would likely decrease the variance of load.7
   Decreasing the variance of load can increase or decrease emissions. Firms use diﬀerent
power sources to produce electricity including fossil fuel sources (coal, natural gas, and oil)
and non-fossil power sources, which have no emissions, like nuclear and hydropower. Firms
generally use generating units in order of their marginal costs.8 Since fuel costs are a large
component of marginal costs, low-cost generating units of a given fuel type generally are
newer, use fuel more eﬃciently, and pollute less per megawatt-hour (MWh). In this case,
decreasing the variance of load then causes the more eﬃcient, cleaner units to generate
more and the less eﬃcient, dirtier units to generate less, thereby reducing total emissions.9
Similarly, if peak generation is oil fired, which typically has high emissions rates, reducing
variance will reduce emissions. On the other hand, reducing variance may increase emissions.
This occurs, for example, if base-load generation is met by coal-fired units while peak load
generation is met by cleaner, gas-fired or hydro units. These diﬀerent eﬀects imply that
the changes in emissions depend on the relative cleanliness of the available technologies.
Therefore, we estimate the eﬀects separately for various regions of the U.S.
   This paper exploits exogenous variation in load to analyze the eﬀect on emissions of
changing the distribution of load. Daily changes in temperature and economic activity lead
to variation in the distribution of load within and across days. This variation also leads to
variation in emissions. By estimating this relationship, we can analyze the environmental
impacts of real-time pricing.10 Furthermore, the results are applicable to any policy, such as
demand-side management or critical peak pricing, which would lead to a reduction in load
variance.
   In using historic data, our retrospective analysis will not capture adaptation to RTP
by generators, consumers, and entrepreneurs. Furthermore, RTP may induce a change in
the locational distribution of load. Finally, investment in generation, transmission, and
consumption technology will likely be aﬀected by RTP. Our analysis only addresses the

                                              2
short-run eﬀects of reducing load variance and does not capture all of the ways in which
RTP may or may not be green.
      Section 2 presents the empirical model. Section 3 compares generation technologies in the
various regions and describes the data. In Section 4, we discuss the empirical results for the
parametric approach. Section 5 tests the robustness of these findings using a nonparametric
model. The empirical results are analyzed in Section 6 using the production technologies in
each region. Section 7 concludes.



2       Empirical Model

Exogenous changes in the distribution of load directly aﬀect the generation decisions of firms,
and these generation decisions aﬀect emissions.11 We examine the relationship between the
distribution of load and emissions.12 The equation that we estimate separately for each
region is:


                ln(Et ) = −β · ln(V ARt ) + γ 1 [ln(MEANt )] + γ 2 [ln(MEANt )]2            (1)
                            X
                            S∗12                X 48
                          +      δs T EMPst +        φm MOY Rmt + t ,
                              s=1               m=1


where Et is emissions in the region on day t; V ARt measures within-day variance of the
region’s load; MEANt is the region’s mean daily load; T EMPst is one of 12 functions of
the temperature for one of the S states bordering the region; and MOY Rt is an indicator
variable for each of the 48 months from January 1997 to December 2000. The error term,

 t,   models the idiosyncratic shock.
      The variable V ARt describes the load distribution on day t and could be defined in
many ways. We report results for the coeﬃcient of variation of hourly load, but explore
the robustness of our results to five other possible summary statistics of variation.13 The


                                                3
negative log-log functional form allows β to be interpreted as the elasticity of emissions with
respect to a reduction in the variance measure.14
   The nonlinear relationship between emissions and generation across days is captured by
using logarithms and higher order terms of MEANt . The elasticity of emissions with respect
to mean daily load is therefore γ 1 + 2γ 2 ln(MEANt ). Below we use this elasticity to simulate
the eﬀects of a reduction in across-day variance.
   The estimating equation controls for other factors that explain daily emissions for a
region. The production decisions (and therefore pollution levels) depend on opportunities
outside the region. To control for unobserved imports and exports, the equation includes 12
measures of temperature in nearby states. For each neighboring state, daily mean, minimum,
and maximum temperature variables enter as quadratic functions with coeﬃcients allowed
to diﬀer for cooling degree days (when temperature measure is above 65◦ F) and for heating
degree days (when temperature measure is below 65◦ F). For each month in the sample, a
month-year fixed eﬀect captures diﬀerences in costs and abatement technologies across the
diﬀerent time periods. Finally, the error term is tested and corrected for heteroskedasticity
and first-order autocorrelation.15
   To address potential concerns about the functional forms of both V ARt and MEANt , we
also include a nonparametric analysis, which is independent of the specific functional forms.
Instead of aggregating the hourly data to the daily level, we determine whether each hour is
a high or low demand hour on a high or low demand day. Using deciles, this defines a ten
by ten matrix of bins into which each hour is sorted. For example, if the rows are based on
the decile of mean daily load and the columns are based on the decile of the hourly load for
that type of day, then the upper left bin would contain the low demand hours on low demand
days and the upper right bin would contain the high demand hours on low demand days.
Specifically, for each hour τ , we let the dummy variable BINτdh equal one if hour τ occurs
on a day which is in the dth decile of mean daily load and in the hth decile of hourly load

                                              4
on dth decile days.
                                                                     Eτ
    We define the dependent variable, system emissions rate, as      qτ
                                                                        ,   where qτ is the hourly
load. For hour τ , the model estimated is:


          Eτ   XX10   10                    XS∗12             X M
             =         β dh · BINdh (qτ ) +     δ s T EMPsτ +     φm MOY Rmτ +         τ.      (2)
          qτ   d=1 h=1                      s=1               m=1


As above, the temperature variables control for imports and exports and the month-year
fixed eﬀects control for changes in relative costs. With the systems emissions rate as the
dependent variable, we can simulate the eﬀect of RTP by analyzing how the emissions rate
changes by moving a MWh from a high-load hour to a low-load hour for a given decile of
average load.



3     Data

As is common in electricity modeling, our level of analysis is a North American Electric
Reliability Council (NERC) region (see Figure 1 for the ten regional definitions).16 The
council initially defined the regions in order to ensure a reliable, adequate, and secure system,
and there is substantial transmission and communication within each region. For example,
during our sample period, only seven percent of local demand was met by generation from
other NERC regions.17 We could have defined a coarser level (such as interconnection) or
finer level (such as utility or control area) of analysis. We argue that NERC regions are the
appropriate level of aggregation because of the trading that occurs within NERC regions
and because of the transmission constraints between NERC regions.18
    The environmental impacts are likely to be sensitive to the production technologies in
each of the ten NERC regions. Table 1 describes the fuel shares of installed capacity and
generation for each region. Because coal and nuclear power tend to have low marginal costs,


                                                    5
their shares of generation are larger than their shares of capacity. Coal is the dominant fuel
source in many regions and has the largest share of generation in all of the regions except
ERCOT and NPCC. Coal is typically the dirtiest of the fossil fuels.19 Oil and gas have
high marginal costs, and their shares of capacity are higher than their shares of generation.
Gas-fired generation has eﬀectively no SO2 emissions and much lower NOx emissions rates
than coal. Most oil-fired units are dirty and have similar emissions rates to coal-fired units.
There are two types of hydropower. First, run-of-river dams generate based on the natural
flows of the river and have low marginal costs. Second, storage reservoirs (predominantly
in the West) capture seasonal run-oﬀ and use this fixed stock of water to generate power
throughout the year. The marginal opportunity cost of these units thus includes the scarcity
cost of the exhaustible stock.
   The load data are from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Form 714.20
Table 2 shows summary statistics (the average and the standard deviation) of each region’s
mean and maximum daily load. WSCC and SERC are the largest regions, with more than
four times the average load of some of the smallest regions: MAPP, SPP, and FRCC. We
compare variation across days by normalizing the standard deviation of mean daily load.
The regions with the most variation across days are SPP and ERCOT.21
   The table also summarizes the within-day load variation using the coeﬃcient of variation.
The regions with the greatest variation are FRCC and NPCC while ECAR and MAIN are
those with the smallest within-day variation. The diﬀerences between these regions are not
quite as substantial as in the across-day variation measures.22
   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) provides temperature
data on daily mean, minimum, and maximum temperature for hundreds of weather stations
nationally. We calculate 12 statewide functions of temperature. Table 2 reports the summary
statistics for the daily mean temperature in each region.23 The hottest regions on average
are FRCC, ERCOT, and SERC while MAPP and NPCC are the coldest. Regions with high

                                              6
temperature variation are not necessarily those regions with high within-day or across-day
load variation.
   Emissions data are from the Environmental Protection Agency’s Continuous Emissions
Monitoring System (EPA’s CEMS). For almost all of the fossil power plants in the U.S., the
CEMS data report hourly emissions of SO2 , NOx , and CO2 .24 By region, Table 3 summarizes
the emissions data. A daily system emissions rate is calculated as the ratio of mean daily
emissions to mean daily load. ECAR is clearly the dirtiest region with the highest emissions
per MWh of SO2 and NOx , and second highest levels of CO2 . On the other hand, WSCC is
the cleanest region in all pollutants.25 Each region’s rates vary substantially day to day.
   To understand the diﬀerences in system emissions rates, we also compare the share of
load met by fossil fuel generation across regions.26 The CEMS data report hourly gross
generation at each unit.27 Table 3 presents summary statistics on the daily gross generation
as a share of total load. In the dirtiest region, ECAR, the average ratio is 0.98 while the
cleanest region, WSCC, has an average ratio of 0.36.28
   To visualize the unconditional correlations in the emissions and load data, we use kernel
regressions to estimate a smooth relationship between emissions and demand in each region.
Figure 2 graphs kernel regression estimates for hourly pounds of SO2 on hourly load for each
of the ten regions. For some of the regions, there appears to be a general linear relationship
between emissions and generation suggesting little impact of variance on emissions. However,
for regions like ERCOT, SPP, and WSCC, the concave shape of the kernel estimates imply
that reducing the likelihood of both extreme high and low demand hours will result in higher
emissions. However, simply analyzing the shape of these estimates may be misleading since
the kernel regressions do not control for covariates.

4     Results of Parametric Estimation

To estimate the eﬀect of a change in load variance on emissions, Equation 1 is estimated
separately for each NERC region and for each of the three pollutants.29 Since there are
hundreds of estimated coeﬃcients, we first focus on those for within-day variance, i.e., V ARt .
Next we simulate across-day variance using coeﬃcients on MEANt . Finally we analyze
changes in gross fossil generation.


4.1    Within-Day Variation

Within-day variation is measured by the coeﬃcient of variation. Table 4 presents the coeﬃ-
cient estimates and standard errors for the negative logarithm of the coeﬃcient of variation
for all three pollutants in all ten regions. Each coeﬃcient is from a regression described in
Equation 1 where the dependent variable is the log of SO2 pounds emitted in column (i), the
log of NOx pounds emitted in column (ii), and the log of CO2 tons emitted in column (iii).
These coeﬃcient estimates are conditional on mean daily load, fixed eﬀects, and tempera-
ture.30 The coeﬃcients are the eﬀect on emissions of a reduction in within-day variance; for
example, a positive coeﬃcient suggests that RTP would increase emissions.
    The estimates for SO2 vary across the ten regions. For four regions (ECAR, ERCOT,
SERC, and WSCC), the coeﬃcient estimates are positive and significant at the five per-
cent level. In these regions, we estimate that a reduction in within-day load variance would
increase SO2 emissions. In one region, MAIN, the negative coeﬃcient indicates that a re-
duction in within-day load variance would decrease SO2 emissions. Note that the estimates
are quite small. The largest eﬀect, in WSCC, implies that a 10% reduction in the coeﬃcient
of variation would imply only a 0.4% increase in SO2 emissions.31
    The estimates for NOx and CO2 are similar to the SO2 estimates. For NOx , three of
the regions have positive eﬀects and three have negative eﬀects. For CO2 , five regions have


                                               8
positive coeﬃcients, and two regions have negative coeﬃcients. For both pollutants, the
coeﬃcients are generally more negative than the SO2 coeﬃcients but are still relatively small
(the estimated elasticity with the largest magnitude is -0.04).
   These coeﬃcient estimates show positive eﬀects for all three pollutants in two regions and
for two pollutants in three regions. For these five regions (ECAR, ERCOT, MAPP, SERC,
and WSCC), the estimates imply that a reduction in within-day variance, for example, from
RTP adoption, would increase emissions. However, this eﬀect is not universal. Three regions
(FRCC, MAAC, and MAIN) have negative coeﬃcient estimates implying that a reduction
in within-day variation will lead to a reduction in emissions. Finally, SPP and NPCC show
no eﬀect.32 In Appendix A, we show that these results are robust to other measures of
within-day variation.


4.2    Across-Day Variation

We now turn to the coeﬃcients on the log of mean daily load. As described above, these
coeﬃcients can be used to compute the elasticity of emissions with respect to mean daily
load. The elasticities are unity if emissions are proportional to load.
   Table 5 presents the elasticities over the observed ranges of mean daily load for each of
the three pollutants for each region. The estimated elasticities are all positive indicating that
emissions, as expected, are increasing in system load. Most of the elasticities are decreasing
in system load, indicating that a change in system load has a much larger proportional eﬀect
on small load days than at large load days.33 For example, in the WSCC, a percent increase
in system load on the lowest-load day leads to a 1.4% increase in SO2 emissions, whereas a
percent increase on the highest-load day leads to a small increase in SO2 emissions (0.04%).34
   Although these elasticities are suggestive of the eﬀect of a reduction in load variation
across days, they show only the proportional eﬀect. To describe the eﬀect of a reduction in



                                               9
load variation across days, we use the elasticities to simulate the change in emissions from a
marginal change in the extremes of the load distribution. Specifically, we use the elasticities
to calculate the percentage change in emissions from shifting one percent of the average load
from the highest-load day to the lowest-load day. The results of this simulation are presented
in Table 6.35
   As with the within-day variation, there are regional diﬀerences. In ECAR, MAPP, and
SERC, the reduction in across-day load variance leads to statistically significant increases in
all three pollutants. In the WSCC, the reduction leads to significant increases in SO2 and
NOx , but not in CO2 . Recall that these regions also show positive eﬀects from a reduction
in within-day variance. In other regions, the reduction in across-day variance can decrease
emissions for all three pollutants (NPCC and MAAC) or for two pollutants (MAIN and SPP).
For MAIN and MAAC, we also predict a reduction in emissions from reducing within-day
variance. The results for ERCOT and FRCC are mixed.36
   Since the simulation results describe a percent change in emissions from a one percent
change in load, they can be compared with the within-day elasticities. We note that mar-
ginal changes in across-day variation have larger eﬀects than marginal changes in within-day
variation. Here the largest elasticity in magnitude is -3.4 compared to the largest within-day
elasticity of -0.04. This suggests that the largest environmental eﬀects are likely to come
from policies that reduce variance across days rather than within days.


4.3    Variance Eﬀects on Fossil Generation

To understand the eﬀects on emissions described above, we analyze the eﬀects of changes
in within- and across-day variation on gross fossil generation. We estimate an equation
similar to Equation 1 where the dependent variable is now the log of gross fossil generation
in MWh–instead of emissions.37 The independent variables are identical to those in the



                                              10
regressions reported in columns (i) to (iii) of Tables 4 and 6.38
   Column (iv) of Table 4 reports the estimates for the regressions with gross fossil gen-
eration as the dependent variable. Several coeﬃcients deserve note. First, the ERCOT
coeﬃcient is not statistically significant despite being very precisely estimated. Since ER-
COT is not interconnected with other regions and has limited hydroelectric resources, fossil
generation must follow load directly.39 Second, the positive coeﬃcient for WSCC likely re-
flects the significant hydro capacity in the West. Decreasing within-day load variance thus
would decrease the demand for peak-shaving hydroelectricity. Finally, the four regions with
significant eﬀects in the East are closely interconnected and neighboring regions have coeﬃ-
cients with opposite signs. Thus, as the coeﬃcients of variation are correlated across regions,
the decreased fossil generation in ECAR likely is oﬀset by the increased fossil generation in
either MAAC or MAIN.40
   We find statistically significant eﬀects on fossil generation in five of the ten regions.
Reducing within-day variance results in more gross fossil production in ECAR, MAPP, and
WSCC, and weakly in SERC. Note that these are the regions where we estimate increases
in emissions. In two regions, MAAC and MAIN, higher within-day variance is associated
with less gross fossil production. These are the regions where reductions in emissions are
seen. Although two regions, ERCOT and FRCC, show some environmental eﬀects but have
no change in fossil generation, the majority of the environmental eﬀects from changes in
within-day variance seem to be driven by changes in fossil generation.
   We now turn to the across-day variance eﬀects on fossil generation. Column (iv) of Table
5 reports the elasticity ranges for fossil generation with respect to mean daily load. Since
most (seven of ten) of these elasticities are decreasing, fossil generation accounts for a smaller
proportion of load on the highest-load day than on the lowest-load day in most regions.
   Column (iv) of Table 6 reports the simulated eﬀects of the percentage change in gross
fossil generation of shifting one percent of the average load from the highest-load day to

                                               11
the lowest-load day. Five of the eﬀects are positive and four of the eﬀects are negative.
The most important thing to note about these eﬀects is that they coincide closely with the
environmental eﬀects. Thus, as with the within-day environmental eﬀects, the across-day
environmental eﬀect seem to be driven largely by changes in fossil generation.



5     Robustness using Nonparametric Model

Since the estimates of Section 4 depend on specific functional forms, we evaluate the con-
straints of the parametric model using the nonparametric model described in Section 2. We
estimate Equation 2 and correct the standard errors for serial correlation and heteroskedas-
ticity.41 With ten regions, three pollutants (plus generation), and 100 bins each, there are
thousands of coeﬃcients. Instead of presenting all of these coeﬃcients, we simulate the
impacts of real-time pricing.42
    We simulate a reduction in within-day variance by comparing the various coeﬃcient
estimates of emissions rates. For each mean daily load decile, we move one MWh from the
lowest decile of hourly load to the second lowest decile, and also move one MWh from the
highest hourly load decile to the second highest decile. Then, we average these impacts over
the ten mean daily load deciles. Therefore, the coeﬃcients represent the average change in
emissions given one fewer MWh in the first and tenth deciles of hourly load and one more
MWh in the second and ninth hourly load deciles.43 Table 7 reports the findings of this
simulation.44
    We compare the within-day eﬀects of the parametric method (Table 4) with those of the
nonparametric method (Table 7). The primary diﬀerence between the two estimators is that
the nonparametric estimator puts more weight on the tails of the distribution. About half (24
of 40) of the parametric estimations are significant across the ten regions and four dependent
variables (SO2 , NOx , CO2 , and gross fossil generation). The nonparametric simulations


                                             12
support these findings qualitatively in 17, or 71%, of these regressions. However, of the
34 significant eﬀects that the nonparametric simulations predict, only half of them are also
predicted by the parametric models.45 These diﬀerences suggest that the environmental
eﬀects of RTP may depend on how it aﬀects the entire load distribution.
    Next, we use the nonparametric estimates to simulate the impact of reducing across-day
variation. For each hourly load decile, we move one MWh from the lowest decile of mean
daily load to the second lowest decile, and we move one MWh from the highest mean daily
load decile to the second highest decile. Then, we average these impacts over the ten hourly
load deciles. Table 8 reports the findings of this simulation.
    For the across-day eﬀects, the parametric models predict significant eﬀects in 35 of the
40 models. Of these 35 eﬀects, the nonparametric simulations are qualitatively similar in
21, or 60%. The nonparametric simulations are significant in only 27 regressions. Therefore,
78% of these regressions are supported by the parametric models.
    We conclude that the nonparametric model supports our findings in Section 4. For
most regions and pollutants, the parametric and nonparametric simulations are qualitatively
similar.46 Furthermore, we find that the across-day variance eﬀects are larger than the
within-day eﬀects.47



6     Discussion

The results of Section 4 imply that a reduction in within- or across-day load variance, whether
through RTP or some other means, would have diﬀerent environmental impacts in diﬀerent
regions. In particular, we found that the results were correlated with changes in fossil
generation, i.e., emissions tended to increase in a region if fossil generation in that region
also increased with a reduction in load variance. In this section, we attempt to understand
these changes in emissions and fossil generation by analyzing the production technologies


                                              13
and capacities in each region.
   To understand the diﬀerences in how load variance aﬀects the mix of fossil and non-
fossil generation (and thus emissions) across regions, recall the capacity shares from Table 1.
On days with more within-day variation, firms are likely to use technologies that ramp up
and down quickly rather than slower base-load technologies. The peaking units are either
fossil fired–typically burning either natural gas or oil–or are hydroelectric plants. Table 9
reports the shares of peaking capacity, which we define as hydroelectric, oil, and natural gas
generation.
   If hydro generation is a significant share of peak capacity, then a reduction in load
variance will reduce peak hydro and may increase dirtier base-load fossil generation. On net
this would increase emissions. Oil-fired peaking units have relatively high emissions rates.
In regions where oil-fired generation is a significant share of peak capacity, a reduction in
within-day variance may reduce emissions if base-load generation is relatively clean.48
   The regions with hydro shares larger than oil shares are ECAR, ERCOT, MAPP, SERC,
SPP, and WSCC. In all of these regions (except SPP with no eﬀect) we find that a reduction
in within-day variance leads to an increase in emissions (see Table 4). For most pollutants
in these regions, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that reducing load variance
leads to less peak hydro and, therefore, more emissions.
   The regions with large oil shares, relative to hydro shares, are FRCC, MAAC, MAIN,
and NPCC. These relatively large oil shares would suggest that a reduction in within-day
variance should reduce emissions. This is consistent with our results for all of these regions
except NPCC in which we find no eﬀect.
   The relative capacity shares of hydroelectricity and oil-fired generation help to understand
the diﬀerent eﬀects that we estimate for the various regions. Note, however, that the hydro
eﬀect has an interesting implication for the environmental impacts of a reduction in load
variance. Since hydropower has low marginal production costs and quick ramping rates, it

                                              14
can be used to adjust to rapid changes in load. A reduction in load variance would imply
that less hydropower is needed during the extreme peak loads and could potentially oﬀset
other emissions. This suggests that the adverse environmental eﬀects estimated here for some
regions might be partially mitigated by using peak hydropower to oﬀset fossil generation.
    To address this concern, we examine the relationship between emissions and the amount of
load that is not met by hydropower. In so doing, we are assuming that reducing load variance
will not aﬀect the dispatch of hydropower.49 Given data constraints, we use our measure of
gross fossil generation as a proxy for load net of hydropower. This measure is imperfect as it
does not account for net imports nor the conversion of gross to net generation. Furthermore,
it is endogenous: an outage at a large fossil power plant will reduce emissions and gross fossil
generation. Therefore, we instrument using our measures of the load distribution.50 We find
that our results are robust to this model, particularly in regions with little inter-regional
trading.51 We conclude that our findings are consistent with a model that accounts for the
dynamic optimization of hydropower.
    Understanding the implications of reducing across-day variance is less straightforward.
For this measure of variance, most regions with relatively large hydro shares are predicted
to see an increase in emissions. However, in SPP we predict a reduction in emissions and
in ERCOT the eﬀects are mixed. We estimate that most regions with relatively large oil
shares will see a reduction in emissions if across-day variance is reduced. However, FRCC
has mixed results.



7     Conclusion

Economists have advocated for real-time pricing in an attempt to improve the eﬃciency of
investment and the allocation of electricity. Conventional wisdom, previously untested, has
claimed that RTP has an additional benefit, namely, reduced emissions from reduced peak


                                              15
demand. This paper analyzes the short-run environmental impacts of real-time pricing by
estimating the eﬀect of load variation on emissions of SO2 , NOx , and CO2 . We find that
the impacts of a reduction in load variance are diﬀerent for diﬀerent regions. In particular,
contrary to the conventional wisdom, RTP may actually increase emissions in some regions.
   We estimate a reduction in within-day load variance would decrease emissions of some
pollutants in three of the ten regions (FRCC, MAAC, and MAIN). However, a reduction in
within-day load variance would actually increase emissions in most of the rest of the US. In
fact, for ECAR and SERC, emissions of all three pollutants would increase and for ERCOT,
MAPP, and WSCC, emissions would increase for two of the three pollutants. Similar to our
results for within-day variance, we find that a reduction in across-day load variance would
lead to a reduction in emissions in some regions (MAAC, MAIN, NPCC and SPP) but would
lead to an increase in emissions in other regions (ECAR, MAPP, SERC, and WSCC).
   Our results are robust to alternate empirical specifications. We measure within-day
variance using five other measures of variance and find very similar results. We also test
a nonparametric specification of the model and find similar results. These findings do not
support the conventional wisdom that RTP will reduce emissions and even suggests that
RTP will increase emissions in many regions.
   To understand the diﬀerent eﬀects across regions, we test the eﬀects of a reduction in
load variance on fossil generation and compare the generation technologies in the various
regions. We find that changes in emissions are similar to changes in fossil generation. In
particular, if a reduction in load variance leads to an increase (decrease) in fossil generation,
then it also leads to an increase (decrease) in emissions for most pollutants.
   Since changes in emissions are driven by changes in fossil generation, we compare the
generation technologies across the regions. We find that the results are consistent with the
relative shares of hydroelectric and oil-fired capacity. In particular, a reduction in within-
day load variance leads to an increase in emissions only for regions with more hydroelectric

                                               16
capacity than oil-fired capacity. This supports the hypothesis that the environmental benefits
of RTP come from reducing peak demand, but only if peak capacity is oil fired rather than
hydroelectric.
   Several points should be noted in interpreting our results. First, SO2 and NOx are
regulated in many regions by cap-and-trade programs. If the total amount of emissions
is capped, then emissions cannot increase. However, our results reflect the demand for
emissions. For example, if our coeﬃcient estimate is positive (i.e., an “increase in emissions”)
we are predicting that RTP would lead to an increase in demand for emissions permits and
that the permit price would increase.
   Second, our estimates hold average load constant. If the average load increases or de-
creases substantially with RTP adoption, the environmental eﬀects may be quite diﬀerent.
Holland and Mansur (2006) calculate an increase in average load from RTP adoption in
one region. However, other regions may show decreases in average load depending on the
relevant demand and supply elasticities.
   Third, this paper does not capture ways that generators, retailers, and consumers may
adapt to RTP. For example, generators (and load serving entities) may adapt by changing the
types of retail contracts oﬀered. In addition, our estimates do not capture the environmental
eﬀects of investment. Reduced investment may benefit the environment if the siting of new
power plants causes environmental damage. Since investment under regulation is based on
peak capacity requirements and RTP reduces the peak load, RTP may reduce investment
in regulated markets. For competitive markets, Borenstein and Holland (2005) show that
investment could theoretically increase with RTP adoption. Thus the long-run environmental
benefits of RTP adoption are unclear. Finally, our results are not specific to RTP and apply
equally to regulatory programs or market mechanisms aﬀecting the variance of the electricity
load in the short-run.

Notes

   1
       See, for example, the peak-load pricing literature pioneered by Steiner (1957) and

Boiteaux (1960). More recently, time-varying pricing under regulation has been discussed by

Borenstein et al. (2002), and Borenstein and Holland (2005) study real-time pricing, defined

as prices that vary hour by hour, in competitive electricity markets.

   2
       Currently RTP is oﬀered in just a few U.S. pilot programs, e.g., Georgia and New York.

Time-of-Use pricing is more widely available but does not reflect hour-by-hour variation in

production costs.

   3
       An environmental group in California has proposed a RTP scheme to remove the need

for construction of additional generation capacity in the city of San Francisco. Another

environmental group, Environmental Defense (2001) argued for RTP in California citing its

environmental benefits.

   4
       Hirst and Kirby (2001), Swoﬀord (2001), Kiesling (2002), Smith and Kiesling (2003),

and Nevada Power (2003) claim environmental benefits in their arguments for RTP.

   5
       Some argue that anthropogenic emissions of CO2 may actually be beneficial. We make

no assertions about the net benefits of CO2 emissions. RTP may aﬀect other emissions not

studied here, including particulate matter and mercury.

   6
       See Borenstein and Holland (2005) and Holland and Mansur (2006) for detailed theo-

retical models of RTP adoption.

   7
       Given prices and elastic demand, variance must decrease with RTP adoption if average

load is greater than all oﬀ-peak loads and less than all peak loads. Hypothetical examples


                                              23
can be constructed in which load variance increases.

   8
       “Generating units” typically consist of boilers, turbines, and generators. A power plant

may have several units.

   9
       In addition to changing the technology used to generate electricity at diﬀerent times of

day, RTP can reduce emissions by reducing the frequency of restarting units and of ramping

production up and down.

  10
       The answer to how will RTP change demand and the market equilibrium depends on

the relevant own- and cross-price elasticities of demand. Demand elasticities have been

estimated for various industries and retail pricing programs; see, for example, Patrick and

Wolak (2002), Train and Mehrez (1994), Herriges et al. (1993), Taylor and Schwartz (1990),

and Caves and Christensen (1980). Demand response varies greatly across industries and

customer classes. While beyond the scope of this paper, Holland and Mansur (2006) simulate

the eﬀect of real-time pricing on load.

  11
       Electricity wholesale demand is extremely inelastic (see Borenstein, 2002). For identifi-

cation, we treat it as exogenous to supply shocks.

  12
       Our estimation can be interpreted as a “reduced form” of a two stage model. Namely,

emissions are a function of generation, which is likely endogenous. We could instrument

generation with load distribution variables. However, to simulate RTP, we would need to

perturb the instruments and measure the eﬀect in each of the two steps. Instead, we estimate

the indirect eﬀect of load distribution on emissions.

  13
       Coeﬃcient of variation is the ratio of standard deviation to mean. The other measures



                                                24
include the relative mean deviation, the standard deviation of logarithms, and the Gini

coeﬃcient as in Atkinson (1970). In addition, we analyze the max/min ratio (daily maximum

to minimum ratio of load) and the inverse load factor (daily maximum to mean ratio of load).

  14
       We assume this constant elasticity functional form. The nonparametric model discussed

below allows us to test whether our results are robust to a general model specification.

  15
       Equation 1 is estimated using generalized least squares to account for an AR(1) error

structure using the Prais-Winsten method. Robust standard errors use the White correction.

  16
       The Department of Energy’s National Energy Modeling System (Energy Information

Administration, 2003) uses 15 NERC regions and subregions, and Resources for the Future’s

Haiku model (Paul and Burtraw, 2002) uses 13 NERC regions and subregions.

  17
       Platts reports energy trading data between the 150 control areas. Over 80 percent of all

the energy traded occurred within NERC regions.

  18
       If we separately analyze California, the results diﬀer from the results for the WSCC.

A large share of California’s demand for energy is met by imports over the AC network

(about 22 percent) and direct DC lines to Los Angeles from coal plants in neighboring states

(another 20 percent) (California Energy Commission, 2006). Therefore, ignoring importers’

emissions could yield spurious results. Without developing a detailed model of transmission

constraints, we argue that the WSCC coeﬃcients approximate how emissions would change

with RTP adoption in California.

  19
       For example in MAAC, the SO2 emissions rates (in lbs per MWh) are 20.3, 0.0, and 7.0

for coal-, gas-, and oil-fired generation. NOx emissions rates are 5.8, 0.9, and 3.5 respectively,



                                               25
and CO2 emissions rates are 2198, 1423, and 1790. These data are described in Holland and

Mansur (2006).

  20
       For each of more than 200 U.S. electric utilities, the 714 data report hourly load. We

aggregate these utility data to the NERC region level. Our aggregation data are consistent

with NERC monthly load data.

  21
       The coeﬃcient of variation of mean daily load for SPP and ERCOT are 0.194 and 0.193,

respectively. In contrast, the coeﬃcient in the WSCC is only 0.088.

  22
       With the exception of FRCC at 0.20, the coeﬃcients are similar across regions (averaging

0.11 to 0.15). FRCC likely has greater within-day variation because of residential customers’

demand for air conditioning (over 50 percent of FRCC load is residential whereas it is

approximately 33 percent in other regions).

  23
       We report statistics on the unweighted average daily temperatures for states in each

region.

  24
       All units over 25 megawatts and new units under 25 megawatts that use fuel with a

sulfur content greater than .05% by weight are required to measure and report emissions

under the Acid Rain Program. CEMS data are highly accurate and comprehensive for most

types of fossil units (Joskow and Kahn, 2002).

  25
       The WSCC SO2 system emissions rate is less than a tenth that of ECAR and even a

third of the next cleanest region, ERCOT. To a lesser extent, this is also seen in the system

emissions rates for NOx and CO2 .

  26
       The remainder of load is met by nuclear, hydroelectric, and imports (net of exports).



                                               26
  27
       Gross generation diﬀers from net generation because of the discrepancy between elec-

tricity generated by a unit and the amount of electricity sold onto the grid. This discrepancy

arises from internal power usage for water pumps, conveyor belts, etc.         Informal data on

gross to net ratios suggest an average ratio of 1.05 to 1.1.

  28
       These ratios can exceed one since a region may export electricity and since electricity is

used internally at power plants.

  29
       A detailed examination of the results for one equation, ECAR SO2 , are presented at:

http://www.som.yale.edu/faculty/etm7/papers/holland_mansur_rtp_pollution_append.pdf

  30
       For all regions and pollutants, the temperature variables are jointly significant at the

6% level while the month-year indicator variables are jointly significant at the 1% level.

  31
       As noted by a referee, these small eﬀects may be an artifact of the SO2 market, which

has already dramtically reduced emissions.

  32
       In SPP, the coeﬃcients are not significant despite being very precisely estimated. This

implies that there would be no eﬀect on emissions from a reduction in within-day variation.

In NPCC, the coeﬃcients are not significant but are less precisely estimated.

  33
       The estimated elasticities decrease significantly in load in ECAR, FRCC, MAPP, SERC,

and WSCC for all pollutants and in NPCC for some pollutants. Elasticities only increase

significantly for some pollutants in MAAC and SPP. We determine significance based on the

significance of the coeﬃcient on the log of daily demand squared in Equation 1.

  34
       This is not surprising since peak loads in the WSCC tend to be met with hydropower.

  35
       The standard errors are calculated from the covariance matrix of the parameter estimates



                                                27
using the delta method.

  36
       FRCC has a negative eﬀect in SO2 but positive eﬀects in NOx and CO2 . ERCOT has a

negative eﬀect in NOx but a positive eﬀect in CO2 .

  37
       These regressions analyze the gross fossil generation and cannot be used to analyze

changes in the gross to net ratio separately from changes in net fossil generation.

  38
       Load not met by fossil generation is served by imports or other fuel sources such as

nuclear, hydropower, renewables, or small peaking units, which do not appear in the CEMS

data. Transmission line losses and internal plant usage might also account for some of the

discrepancy between gross generation and load.

  39
       Since the electrical grid must be balanced at all times, generation must equal load. If

fossil generation is positively correlated with the coeﬃcient of variation, then either imports

or hydropower must be negatively correlated with the coeﬃcient of variation since nuclear

power cannot respond to within-day changes in load.

  40
       The correlations among these coeﬃcients of variation are high: corr(ECAR, MAAC)=0.78,

corr(ECAR, MAIN)=0.87, and corr(MAIN, MAPP)=0.87. These high correlations suggest

exploring whether the eﬀects in these four regions should be estimated jointly. We find that

conditioning our estimates for each region on the load variance measures in each of the other

three regions (plus NPCC for MAAC) does not change our results substantially. In particu-

lar, all of the coeﬃcients for ECAR, MAIN, and MAPP agree in sign with those in Table 4

and they are all significant. However, the coeﬃcients for MAAC are now insignificant.

  41
       As this section attempts to estimate the impacts of real-time pricing using a nonpara-



                                               28
metric approach, we use a nonparametric technique to correct for serial correlation and

heteroskedasticity as well. We use the Newey-West method assuming a six hour lag struc-

ture.

  42
        See Appendix B for a depiction of one of the regressions.

  43
        This is equivalent to calculating a change in the weighted average emissions rates by

giving less weight to extreme events.

  44
        The standard errors in Tables 7 and 8 are estimated using the delta method.

  45
        For example, the decreased emissions in MAIN are no longer significant with the non-

parametric estimator.

  46
        In 38 of 80 tests, both the parametric and nonparametric results agree in sign and signif-

icance. Seven tests were insignificant using both methods. For 26 tests, one method found

significant results while the other did not. Finally, nine tests reached opposing significant

conclusions.

  47
        Comparing Tables 7 and 8, the impact of reducing across-day variance is about twice as

large as the impact of reducing within-day variance.

  48
        Natural gas typically has lower emissions rates than oil though is dirtier than hydroelec-

tric.

  49
        Run-of-river power cannot change and reservoir hydropower is dispatched during the set

of hours with the highest prices. While reducing the variation of load will alter prices, it is

unlikely to change the set of hours when prices are greatest.

  50
        Specifically, we regress the log of daily emissions on the log of the coeﬃcient of variation



                                                  29
of gross fossil generation, the log of the mean daily gross fossil generation (and its square),

and the other covariates as above. The coeﬃcient of variation and the two measures of mean

daily generation are endogenous so, in a first stage, we regress each of these variables on the

coeﬃcient of variation of load, the two mean daily load measures, and the other covariates.

In order to address serial correlation, we assume a first order autocorrelation process as

above and quasi-diﬀerence the data.

  51
       The coeﬃcients on the coeﬃcient of variation for ERCOT, FRCC, NPCC, and SPP are

nearly exactly the same as those in Table 4. Those for WSCC and SERC are slightly smaller

in magnitude but are qualitatively similar. The Midwestern regions of ECAR, MAAC,

MAIN, and MAPP are more integrated, as discussed in footnote 36, and the results are not

robust in these regions. However, this part of the U.S. has very little hydroelectric power.

 Notes: Table displays the sample mean with standard deviation in brackets. Emissions
 rates are system-wide averages of total pollution (SO2 and NOX in lbs and CO2 in tons) to
 total demand (in MWh). The sample period is from January 1997 to December 2000,
 except MAPP does not include 2000. Days of daylight savings transitions are dropped.

Notes: We simulate a reduction in across-day variation in the following manner. First we
measure a one percent change in average load (deltaload). We then increase the
minimum mean daily load by deltaload and decrease the maximum mean daily load by
deltaload. The resulting change in pollution is normalized by the average daily pollution
in that region. The estimates can be interpreted as elasticities. Standard errors are in
parentheses and are computed using the delta method. We note significance at 5% level
using (*) or at 10% level using (#).

Notes: Table presents simulation based on OLS coefficients. Standard errors, in parentheses,
have been corrected for heteroskedasticity and serial correlation using the Newey-West method
assuming a six hour lag structure. We note significance at 5% level using (*) or at 10% level
using (#). Regression includes month-year fixed effects, quadratic function of log of daily mean
quantity demanded, and daily mean, minimum, and maximum temperatures for all states
bordering each region.

   Appendix A

   Table 4 reports the regression results using the coeﬃcient of variation as the within-day


measure of variance. Since these results could be specific to the coeﬃcient of variation, we


explore five other distribution summary statistics of “within-day variance”: the max/min


ratio, inverse load factor, relative mean deviation, standard deviation of logarithms, and


Gini coeﬃcient.


   These six measures do capture diﬀerent aspects of within-day variance since they are not


perfectly correlated. Calculating the correlations of these six measures for the ten regions


shows that all but one of the 150 possible correlations are positive and the average correlation


is 0.72. The smallest correlation (-0.01) is between the Gini coeﬃcient and the inverse load


factor in FRCC. In general, the Gini coeﬃcient is less correlated with the other measures


(an average correlation of 0.46) while the standard deviation of logarithms is correlated the



                                              42
most with the other measures (an average correlation of 0.82).


   Despite the imperfect correlations, the coeﬃcient estimates on the measures of variance


are very robust to the diﬀerent measures. We estimate Equation 1 for each of the six measures


of variance for each of the three pollutants for each of the ten regions. The SO2 results are


particularly robust. For nine of the ten regions, the coeﬃcients on the measure of variance


agree in sign and significance for all six measures of variance. In the remaining region,


WSCC, four of the six estimates are positive and significant while the other two estimates


are positive but not significant. For NOx , in eight of the ten regions, all the coeﬃcients had


either the same sign or the same significance.52 For CO2 , in nine of the ten regions, all the


coeﬃcients had either the same sign or the same significance.53 Note that no region has


coeﬃcients on any of the measures of variance that are significant but of opposite sign.

rates in ECAR. All of the other covariates have been demeaned and the regression does not


include a constant. Therefore, each coeﬃcient equals the average emissions rate for the hours


in a given bin. Consistent with the sample mean in Table 3, the average of the emissions


rate coeﬃcients is 14.9 lbs per MWh. The rates range from 13.6 to 15.5 lbs per MWh. The


lowest rate occurs when demand is in the bin with the highest decile of mean daily load and


the highest decile of hourly demand for that type of day. The greatest emissions rate occurs


in the highest decile of mean daily load but in the lowest decile bin of hourly demand for


that type of day. Generally in ECAR, the SO2 emissions rate decreases with hourly demand.


Across regions and pollutants, we find substantially diﬀerent patterns.
