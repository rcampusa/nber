                                            ABSTRACT

Recent theoretical models based on dynamic human capital formation, or social influence, suggest
an inverse relationship between criminal activity and economic opportunity and between criminal
activity and deterrence, but predict an asymmetric response of crime. In this paper we use three
different data sets and three different empirical methodologies to document this previously-unnoticed
regularity. Using nonparametric methods we show that the behavior of property crime is asymmetric
over time, where increases are sharper but decreases are gradual. Using aggregate time-series U.S.
data as well as data from New York City we demonstrate that property crime reacts more (less)
strongly to increases (decreases) in the unemployment rate, to decreases (increases) in per capita real
GDP and to decreases (increases) in the police force. The same result is obtained between
unemployment and property crime in annual state-level panel data. These results suggest that it may
be cost effective to implement mechanisms to prevent crime commission rates from rising in the first
place.

                                 ASYMMETRIC CRIME CYCLES




         Traditional economic models of crime predict an inverse relationship between criminal

activity and economic opportunity, and between criminal activity and deterrence. This prediction is

obtained from standard static models as well as more recent dynamic ones; and it is confirmed by

empirical analyses (Mocan and Rees (forthcoming), Corman and Mocan (2005), Levitt (2002), Gould,

Mustard and Weinberg (2002), Freeman and Rodgers (2000), Corman and Mocan (2000), Grogger

(1998), and Levitt (1996)). One implicit assumption that prevails in theoretical and empirical work on

crime is that the impact on crime of economic conditions (such as unemployment rate) and deterrence

(such as the size of the police force) is symmetric. More specifically, it is assumed that if a given

improvement in economic conditions reduces criminal activity by a certain amount, an equivalent

deterioration in economic conditions would generate an increase in crime by the same absolute value.

For example, if the elasticity of crime with respect to the unemployment rate is 0.4, this would imply

that a 10 percent increase in the unemployment rate increases crime by 4 percent. It also implies that

a 10 percent decrease in the unemployment rate decreases crime by 4 percent. Same type of

symmetry is assumed to hold for crime-deterrence relationship.

         In this paper we test whether the response of crime is symmetric to changes in economic

conditions and deterrence. The basis for the possibility of asymmetric crime movements can be found

in recent theoretical work. Consider, for example, the model of Mocan, Billups and Overland

(forthcoming). If an individual engages in criminal activity during an economic downturn, his legal

human capital depreciates and his criminal human capital appreciates, which makes it difficult to

switch back to the legal sector (or to decrease time spent in crime) after the recession is over. Thus,


                                                   1
hysteresis in crime is predicted, which implies that the extent of the decrease in crime during

economic recovery is expected to be smaller than the increase in crime observed during a downturn:

crime is asymmetric over the business cycle. The same asymmetric behavior in crime can be triggered

by a change in deterrence: the increase in criminal propensity following a reduction in deterrence will

be larger than the decrease in that propensity due to enhanced deterrence because of appreciation of

criminal human capital and depreciation of legal human capital during enhanced criminal activity.

         In a related, but different framework, Harris and Gonzales Lopez-Valcarcel (2004)

formulate a model of information externality in the context of smoking, where a young person, who is

uncertain about the costs and benefits of smoking, gathers information about risks and benefits from

peers’ smoking behavior. This model generates the hypothesis of asymmetric social influence, and

suggests that smoking rates may increase quickly but decline sluggishly.

         We use aggregate data from the United States and find evidence of asymmetric behavior of

criminal activity regarding to the extent of its expansions and contractions. Furthermore, we present

evidence that the impact of business cycles on crime is asymmetric. We also present supplemental

evidence from New York City on asymmetric crime movements over the business cycle, and over

increases and decreases of the police force. Finally, we detect the same asymmetry between crime

and unemployment in state-level panel data.

         Section II summarizes the theoretical underpinnings that motivate the paper. Section III

describes the parametric and nonparametric methods that are applied to test the asymmetry

hypothesis. Section IV describes the data. Section V presents the empirical results. Section VI

concludes the paper.




                                                   2
          The theoretical foundation of asymmetric behavior in criminal activity can be obtained from

a two-stage dynamic stochastic model, where individuals are endowed with legal and criminal

human capital (Mocan, Billups and Overland; forthcoming). Potential incomes in legal and criminal

sectors depend on the level of the relevant human capital, their rates of return, and random shocks.

Both types of human capital can be enhanced by participating in both sectors. Legal human capital

can also be enhanced through investment. Each type of human capital is subject to depreciation.

Individuals maximize expected discounted lifetime utility, which depends on consumption. The

extent of criminal activity and the level of criminal human capital determine the probability of

incarceration. If incarcerated, the person goes to prison, where the extent of the punishment is

represented by a loss of income. The individual decides in each period on the allocation of time

between sectors, and after the realization of income in that period, he decides on the optimal amount

of consumption. A particular decision (e.g. the proportion of time allocated to crime) has

implications for both future decisions as well as the choices available to the individual in later

periods.1

          Within this framework, during a recession the individual may find it optimal to increase the

time allocated to the criminal sector. However, participation in the criminal sector during the

recession increases the individual’s criminal human capital and depreciates his legal human capital.

This decrease in his legal human capital, coupled with the increase in criminal human capital that

took place during the recession, makes it difficult to switch back to the legal sector after the

recession is over. The criminal trap, or hysteresis in criminal activity emerges because an increase

in the extent of criminal activity of the person influences future decisions: the individual is not the

same person after the recession.

       This generates a testable hypothesis. In a recession, where the unemployment rate rises,

the property crime rate is expected to increase; but after the recession is over and when the

unemployment rate declines, the crime rate will not revert back to its original level as quickly.

Put differently, property crime is predicted to exhibit asymmetric behavior over the business

cycle. Note that the predicted asymmetry in crime is driven by the individuals’ dynamic

decisions regarding utility maximization which involves crime-legal work decisions which affect

their income. Thus, the hysteresis in crime should be more applicable to property crimes in

comparison to violent crimes.

       It should be noted that the hysteresis in property crime can also be triggered by non-

economic factors. For example, a number of factors can motivate an individual to increase his

participation in the criminal sector. Examples include a decrease in the probability of

apprehension due to a reduction in deterrence, a decrease in risk aversion, and a decrease in the

severity of punishment.     An increased criminal participation following such a change will

simultaneously increase the criminal human capital and decrease legal human capital, thereby

making the switch back to the legal sector more difficult, which implies that in the aggregate,

crime commission rate will increase at a faster rate in comparison to its subsequent decrease.

       Harris and Gonzales Lopez-Valcarcel (2004) formulate a learning model of cigarette

smoking where each young person gathers information about the risks and benefits of smoking

from the behaviors of the peers. The information contained in each peer’s behavior is used to

update the priors about the benefits (safety, social acceptability, etc.) of smoking. This kind of

social interaction within peers (or within the household) generates the possibility that the

influence of a peer who is involved in the activity may be different in magnitude from the

                                                4
influence of a peer who is not involved in that activity, which yields hysteresis in aggregate

behavior.




A. Non-parametric Analysis

       We first perform a non-parametric analysis to test the asymmetry in the time-series

behavior of crime. Following Neftci (1984), consider a time-series Xt with T+1 observations.

Define a new series It such that It = +1 if Xt > 0 and It = –1 if Xt                           0. Assume that It can be

represented by a stationary second-order Markov process. Let                            ij   (i=0,1; j=0,1) represent the

transition probabilities as follows:

                                   λ11 = Pr( I t = 1 | I t −1 = 1, I t − 2 = 1)
                                   λ00 = Pr( I t = −1 | I t −1 = −1, I t − 2 = −1)
                                                                                                                 (1)
                                   λ10 = Pr( I t = 1 | I t −1 = 1, I t − 2 = −1)
                                   λ01 = Pr( I t = −1 | I t −1 = −1, I t − 2 = 1)

       If the series Xt exhibits sharp increases but gradual decreases, then {It} remains longer in

the state –1, than in the state +1. This suggests that the transition probability associated with

movements from –1 to –1 will be greater than the transition probability associated with

movements from +1 to +1, which implies that                    00      >     11.   On the other hand, if the series is

symmetric over the cycle,     00   =    11.   Similarly, as Neftci (1984) indicates, a stronger version of

symmetry implies the additional condition that                10   =       01,   which suggests that two consecutive

increases followed by one decrease is equally likely as two consecutive decreases followed by an

increase.




                                                          5
           Given a realization ST of {It}, the likelihood function can be written as

      L( ST , λij , π 0 ) = π 0 (λ11 ) N11 (1 − λ11 )T11 (λ00 ) N 00 (1 − λ00 ) T00 (λ01 ) N 01 (1 − λ01 )T01 (λ10 ) N10 (1 − λ10 ) T10   (2)

where the parameters N11, T11, N00,… represent the number of occurrences in each state implied

by transition probabilities, and                 0   is the probability of the initial state. Because the sample we

use is not “large” and because the first observation in the sample (t=1) is obviously not the true

starting point of It, we follow Neftci (1984), Falk (1986), and Sichel (1989), and parameterize                                             0

                                                                                    2
as a nonlinear function of transition probabilities                              ij.


           The investigation of asymmetry in the time-series behavior of the crime rate is performed

by maximizing the unrestricted likelihood function in equation (2), and then by maximizing it

under the symmetry restriction (                     00   =    11   ,   10   =    01).   As explained by Neftci (1984), monthly

data impose too much noise for this analysis. Imagine that the series is indeed asymmetric with

steep increases and gradual decreases. If a white noise series is added to the original series, the

runs in –1 will be broken more than the runs in +1 because runs in –1 downward movements

have a small derivate. Such a distortion will be less likely with quarterly data as white noise

errors are likely to be averaged out.

            The empirical analyses are first performed using quarterly U.S. data on property crimes.

The hypothesis is that increases in property crime are sharper than the decreases it exhibits over



                                                                              [(1 − λ00 )( λ10 )]

    If the initial state is +1, and +1, π 0 =                                                                         .
                                                          [(1 − λ11 )(1 − λ00 + λ01 )] + [(1 − λ00 )(1 − λ11 + λ10 )]

time. To the extent that violent crimes of murder and rape are not motivated by economic

conditions, we do not expect to observe an asymmetric behavior in these crimes. We therefore

analyze the behavior of murder and rape for comparison to that displayed by property crime. We

repeat the analysis with New York City crime data.



B. Parametric Analysis

       Standard static crime models and their dynamic variants postulate a negative relationship

between job market opportunities and criminal activity. At the aggregate level, this implies that

α1>0 in equation (3) below, where CRt stands for the crime rate and URt represents the

unemployment rate. The existing literature provides empirical evidence that the crime level (or

crime rate) is indeed positively related to the unemployment rate (Corman and Mocan (2005),

Raphael and Winter-Ebmer (2001), Grogger (1998), Cook and Zarkin (1985))

                                     CRt = α 0 + α 1URt + ε t .                              (3)

Note that in equation (3) the implied relationship between UR and CR is symmetric. That is, α1

represents the increase in CR in reaction to a given increase in UR, which can be viewed as the

impact of a recession. At the same time, α1 signifies the decrease in crime in response to a

decrease in unemployment.       This would mean the decline in crime in times of economic

recovery. In this standard setting, the impact on crime of an increase in unemployment is

postulated to be equal to the impact on crime of a decrease in unemployment.

       The theoretical framework summarized in Section II suggests that these impacts are

asymmetric. That is, the decrease in crime after the recessions (when the unemployment rate is

declining) will not be as large as the increase in crime during a recession. To test this hypothesis,


                                                  7
we define the crime rate as an asymmetric function of the unemployment rate, where the

conditional mean of the crime rate is specified to follow two different paths depending on the

change (increase or decrease) in unemployment rate:

                                  CRt = α 0 + βURt+ + γURt− + ε t                                                     (4)

                           URt if URt ≥ URt −1                                    URt if URt < URt −1
where            URt+ =                                   and URt− =                                       .
                           0     if URt < URt −1                                  0      if URt ≥ URt −1


Put differently, URt can be used to construct two variables URt+ and URt− based on the change in

URt between time periods.3 A simple example demonstrates the creation of URt+ and URt− :



                      1990               1991                          1992                  1993              1994
     URt               5.6                   6.8                         7.5                 6.9               6.1
    URt+                  --                 6.8                         7.5                  0                 0
    URt−                  --                 0                            0                  6.9               6.1


This implies that

                          E (CRt ) = α 0 + βURt+                       for       URt – URt-1 ≥ 0

                          E (CRt ) = α 0 + γURt−                       for       URt – URt-1 < 0

          We estimate various distributed lag models using monthly U.S. data and test if β=γ.

Symmetry is obtained if β=γ since URt+ + URt− =URt. We entertain alternative lag-specifications,

such as

                                              k                    k
                               CRt = α 0 +          β iURt+−i +          γ iURt−−i + ε t .                            (5)
                                             i =0                 i =0

  A similar parametric specification is used by Bali (2000) to test the presence and significance of
asymmetry in the conditional mean and conditional volatility of interest rate changes.

and test the hypothesis of symmetric impact of the unemployment rate on crime by investigating

           k             k
whether          βi =          γi .
          i =0          i =0


        For a check of robustness, we repeat the empirical analyses using monthly data from New

York City. Because we have monthly police force data from New York City, we also investigate

the differential impact of increases and decreases in the police force using the framework of

equation (5), where URt+ and URt− are replaced by POL+t and POL−t .

        Finally, we use state-level annual panel data and investigate whether increases and

decreases in state unemployment rates have symmetric impacts on state property and violent

crime rates. In this analysis we estimate specifications such as

                          CRit = α 0 + β URit+ + γURit− + X it Ω + µ i + Ψt + Γit + ε it .        (6)

where CRit represents property or violent crime in state i for year t, X it stands for a vector of

state characteristics, µ i represents unobserved state attributes that influence the crime rate, Ψt

stands for year effects, Γit represents state-specific time trends, and ε it is the error term.

        Annual crime data for the Unites States are obtained from the Uniform Crime Reports.

The same publication reports the distribution of each crime by month in each year. Using this

information, monthly crime values are calculated, separately for burglary, motor-vehicle theft,

larceny, murder and rape. The sum of burglary, motor-vehicle theft and larceny gives the

property crime. Monthly population figures reported by the Bureau of Economic Analysis are

used to calculate monthly crime rates (crimes per 100,000 population).           Crime rates are

seasonally adjusted.

       Figure 1 displays the seasonally-adjusted U.S. monthly property crime rate between

January 1981 and December 2000. Figures 2 and 3 display the homicide rate and the rape,

respectively, for the same time period.     Figure 4 presents the seasonally-adjusted monthly

unemployment rate obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Figure 5 shows the seasonally-

adjusted monthly growth rate in per capita real GDP, obtained from the Bureau of Economic

Analysis. During the period covered by our data, NBER has dated two business cycles. One is

from July 1981 to November 1982; the second one is from July 1990 to March 1991. Figures 4

and 5 are consistent with these dates as they display an increase in the unemployment rate and

negative income growth, respectively, during these periods.

       Figure 6 displays the time-series behavior of property crime in New York City. It

consists of burglary, grand larceny theft and motor-vehicle theft.    Figures 7 and 8 pertain to

murders and rapes in New York City. All data are seasonally adjusted. The crime data are

obtained from the Crime Analysis Unit of the New York City Police Department. Figure 9

displays the seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate for New York City, obtained from the

Bureau of Labor Statistics. For New York City, crime data are available starting in January

1970. Therefore, in New York City we are able to capture four business cycles, as dated by

NBER. More specifically, we also capture the November 1973-March 1975 recession and the

January 1980-July 1980 recession, although the latter is short and does not register significantly

in New York City unemployment rate (see Figure 9). Figure 10 presents the size of the police

force in New York City.

       The third data set we employ in the paper is a state-level panel from 1977 to 2002. The

obvious advantage of this data set is that it allows us to exploit significant state-level variations

that exist in crime and unemployment over time, and it allows us to remove the influences of

unobserved omitted variables. By including year fixed-effects we control for unobserved factors

that impact all the states, and including state fixed-effects and state-specific time trends allows us

to control for unobserved differences between states. The data include state-level violent and

property crime rates, state unemployment rate, percentage white, black and Hispanic, the age

distribution of state population and the proportion of state population in urban areas. Crime data

are obtained from the Bureau of Justice Statistics. State population, age representation, ethnic

and racial distribution, and urbanization are obtained from the U.S. Department of Commerce,

Bureau of the Census.

        Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) tests are used to determine the presence of a unit root

in time series variables employed in the paper: the property crime rate, murder rate, rape rate,

unemployment rate and the per capita growth rate of GDP for the U.S. monthly data covering the

period from January 1981 to December 2000, and for property crime, murder, rape,

unemployment and police force for New York City monthly data that span the period from

January 1970 to April 2000.4

       The results, which are detailed in Appendix A, provide no evidence for unit root in the

U.S. per capita GDP growth, the U.S. property crime rate, and the U.S. unemployment rate.

Evidence for a unit root is found for the U.S murder rate and the U.S. rape rate. Therefore, the

proper specification of equation (5) is to use level of the U.S. property crime rate and the first-

  We tested for unit roots and obtained the same results when monthly data were aggregated to quarterly
frequency.

difference of the U.S. murder and rape rates as dependent variables. The U.S. unemployment

rate and per capita GDP growth rate enter in levels as explanatory variables as they do not

contain unit roots.

       For the variables pertaining to New York City, the ADF tests revealed that the hypothesis

of a unit root cannot be rejected. We employed the Johansen (1988) cointegration test for

property crime, murder, rape, the unemployment rate and the police force for NYC. As shown in

Appendix B, the likelihood ratio tests strongly reject the null hypothesis of no cointegration. In

all cases, we obtained one cointegrating vector for crime (property, murder, or rape) and

unemployment, and crime and police. We also tested the presence of cointegration for crime and

the two unemployment variables ( UR + and UR − ) and two police variables ( POL+ and POL− )

that we employ for tests of asymmetry. In all cases (property, murder, or rape), UR + , UR − ,

POL+ and POL− with or without the deterministic trend, we found evidence for one

cointegrating vector at the 5% significance level.

       Stock (1987) shows that if the variables are cointegrated, an OLS regression yields a

“super-consistent” estimator of the cointegrating parameters because the OLS estimates converge

faster than in OLS models using stationary variables. Since crime variables and unemployment,

and crime and police are co-integrated for New York City data, equation (5) is run on levels for

NYC.

A. Nonparametric Analysis

       To investigate whether expansions and contractions in property crime take place at the

same rate, we maximized the likelihood function in equation (2) using quarterly U.S. property

                                                12
crime rate data. Because the unit root tests revealed stationarity, we employed the data in levels.

Table 1 displays the results. The transition parameter         00   is estimated to be 0.599, while   11   is

0.494. Similarly,    10   and   01   are different from each other. The likelihood ratio test rejects the

hypothesis of the equality of the transition parameters (symmetry hypothesis) at the 2% level.

This means that the U.S. property crime rate exhibits asymmetry, where the increases are steeper

than the declines.

       We performed the same exercise for the U.S. murder rate and the U.S. rape rate. Because

the Dickey-Fuller tests indicated unit roots in these variables and no unit roots in first-

differences, to ensure stationarity (see Neftci (1984), Sichel (1989)), these variables are first-

differenced before estimating the transition parameters. The results, which are also reported in

Table 1, show that the hypothesis of symmetry cannot be rejected for these crimes. When we de-

trended these variables using a Hodrik-Prescott Filter (e.g., Mocan (1999), Blackburn and

Morton (1992)), we obtained the same result of symmetry.

       These results are indicative of asymmetry in the behavior of U.S. property crime rate,

where increases are sharp, but decreases are gradual. On the other hand, rape and murder rates

do not exhibit asymmetry in expansions and contractions over time.



B. Parametric Analysis of U.S. Time-Series Data

       Table 2 presents the results of the model where the seasonally-adjusted U.S. monthly

property crime rate is regressed on the contemporaneous value and the two lagged values of UR +

and the contemporaneous value and the two lagged values of UR − . Column (1) displays the

point estimate of the sum of the UR + coefficients along with robust standard errors.



                                                      13
         The sum of the three UR + coefficients is 14.67, and the hypothesis that it is equal to zero

is rejected at the 1% level. The point estimate indicates that a one percentage-point increase in

the unemployment rate increases the property crime rate by 14.67 (per 100,000 people). The

mean value of the property crime rate in the sample is about 388, implying a 3.8 percent increase

in the property crime rate. The sum of the coefficients of UR − is 11.18, implying that a one

percentage-point decline in the unemployment rate is associated with a decrease in property

crime by only 2.9 percent. In column III we report the results of the Wald-test where the

hypothesis of the equality of the sum of UR + and UR − coefficients is tested. The statistic has a
 2
     distribution with one degree of freedom. Column III shows that the hypothesis of the equality

of the UR + and UR − coefficients is rejected at the 1% level.

         The mean value of UR + is 3.01 and the mean value of UR − is 3.45. This indicates that

the implied unemployment elasticity of property crime is 0.114 during economic contractions

(when unemployment is rising), but the elasticity is 0.097 during expansions (when

unemployment is declining).

         The coefficients imply that a one-percentage point increase in the unemployment rate is

associated with 36,924 additional property crimes (burglaries, motor-vehicles thefts and larceny

thefts) per month. On the other hand, a one-percentage point decrease in the unemployment

generates only 28,140 fewer burglaries, motor-vehicle thefts and larceny thefts per month.

         Panel A of Table 2 demonstrates that the same result is obtained when the lag lengths of

the unemployment rate are increased to 4 or 6. In all cases, the impact of an increase in

unemployment, reported in column I, is larger than the impact of a decrease in unemployment,




                                                  14
reported in column II. Column III shows that the equality of the impact of unemployment during

recessions and recoveries is strongly rejected in all specifications.

       Panel A also shows that as the lag length of UR + and UR − increases, their differential

impact on property crime gets larger.         For example, in the models with 6 lags of the

unemployment rates, a one-percentage point increase in the unemployment rate generates 39,227

more property crimes per month, but a one-percentage point decline in the unemployment rates

reduces property crimes only by 23,836 per month.

       Panels B and C of Table 2 display the results for U.S. murder rate and rape rate,

respectively. Because these crimes are non-stationary, we employ them in first-difference form.

In both cases the impact of the unemployment rate is not statistically significant and the impact

of unemployment during a recession is not different from its impact during a recovery.

       Table 3 presents the results where the growth rate in per capita real income is used as the

indicator of business cycle. The average annual per capita income growth is 2% in the sample,

which implies an average of 0.17% growth per month. Such an increase in real per capita

income generates a decrease in the property crime rate by 5.5 (-3272.7 × 0.0017), (a 1.4%

decrease in the property crime rate) which translates into 13,648 fewer property crimes per

month. On the other hand, a decrease in income by the same absolute magnitude generates an

increase in property crime rate by 14 (a 3.7% increase), which implies 36,070 more property

crimes per month. Thus, the impact on property crime of a decrease in per capita GDP growth is

much more pronounced than the impact of an increase in per capita GDP growth of the same

magnitude.




                                                  15
        Panels B and C of Table 3 display the results for U.S. murder rate and rape rate,

respectively. Similar to the results obtained from the unemployment rate in Panels B and C of

Table 2, these crimes are not influenced by increases or decreases in per capita GDP growth.

        The asymmetry in the response of property crime to increases/decreases in the

unemployment rate and per capita GDP confirms the prediction of the theory. Note that reverse

causality from crime to the unemployment rate or from crime to per capita GDP is not likely in

aggregate U.S. data. Local criminal activity may drive away business or may generate re-

location of families and therefore may influence unemployment in that locality. However, such

reverse causality cannot exist in the U.S. aggregate data. On the other hand, a natural question to

ask is whether an unobserved variable influences UR + differently from UR − to generate biased

estimates. A candidate is deterrence, such as the police force. Monthly U.S. police data are not

available, but we will investigate this issue with New York data below.



C. Evidence from New York City Monthly Time-Series Data

        We performed the same analyses using data from New York City using time-series data

from January 1970 to April 2000. New York City property crimes, displayed in Figure 6,

include grand larceny, motor-vehicle theft and burglary. The economic indicator for New York

City, which is available on a monthly basis is the unemployment rate of the City (displayed in

Figure 9). Population data for New York City are not available on a monthly basis.5


5
  The census estimate for NYC population is 7.9 million in 1970, 7.1 million in 1980, 7.3 million in 1990,
and 8 million in 2000. Thus, based on census data, NYC population was fairly stable between 1970 and
2000. Because neither monthly nor annual population data are available, interpolation of monthly values
from census years would not be sensible. For this reason, and because the size of the population was
stable, we followed Corman and Mocan (2000) and Corman and Mocan (2005), and did not deflate
crimes by population.
                                                   16
        Table 4 displays the results of the non-parametric model for New York City.6 In the top

panel which shows the results for property crime,       00   is estimated to be 0.297, while   11   is 0.275,

but the difference is too small to reject the hypothesis of symmetry. The same is observed for

murder and rape crimes in New York City data as well. This may either suggest that crime is

symmetric over time in New York City, or that data for New York City may contain a high

noise-to-signal ratio to allow for a crisp identification of the transition probabilities.

        Table 5 displays the parametric results for New York City. As shown in Panel A of

Table 5, a one percentage point increase in NYC unemployment rate generates about 512

additional property crimes per month. On the other hand, a decrease in the unemployment rate

has no statistically significant impact on property crime (point estimate is 158.87 with a standard

error of 311.6).    Column III of Panel A in Table 5 demonstrates that the hypothesis of the

equality of     β i and     γ i is strongly rejected. This indicates that while an increase in the

unemployment rate brings about an increase in property crime, a decrease in unemployment is

not associated with a significant reduction in property crime in NYC.

        Panels B and C of Table 5 display the results for murder and rape for NYC. In case of

murder neither an increase (     β i ), nor a decrease (      γ i ) in unemployment generates variations

in murder. The first row of Panel C, which displays the results for the contemporaneous value

and two lags of the unemployment rates for rape, demonstrates that a one-percentage point

increase in the seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate brings about 8 additional rapes per

month, and a one percentage-point decline in the unemployment rate decreases rapes by about 6.7


6
  As described earlier, quarterly data are used in nonparametric analysis.
7
 Although Corman and Mocan (2005) could not find a significant impact of unemployment on rape,
Raphael and Winter-Ebmer (2001) identify a positive relationship between unemployment and rape.
                                                   17
Yet, as can be seen in column III of Panel C, the equality of the impacts during increases and

decreases in unemployment cannot be rejected. Put differently, we cannot reject the hypothesis

that the impact of unemployment on rape is symmetric.

         In Table 6 we report the results pertaining to the impact of police in New York City. The

    coefficients are related to POL+ , i.e., they represent the impact of an increase in police on

crime. The      coefficients pertain to POL− variables, and stand for the impact on crime of a

decrease in police force. For example, in the first row we observe that a decrease in the size of

the police force by one officer increases monthly number of property crimes by 1.975. On the

other hand, adding one more police officer generates a decrease by the amount of 1.878, and the

difference between these two effects is statistically different from zero. This means that the

absolute value of the effect of a decrease in police is larger than the corresponding effect of an

increase in police, which is consistent with the theory outlined earlier. The results in Panel A of

Table 6 imply that deployment of 10 additional police officers would reduce property crimes by

about 19 per month, while laying off 10 police officers increases property crimes by about 20-21

in a month.8

         Panel B of Table 6 displays the results where the dependent variable is monthly

homicides in New York City. According to the results, 100 additional police officers reduce

murders by about 0.6 per month (or about seven murders per year), and a decrease in the police

force by 100 officers increases murders by about 0.7 (or about eight murders per year).

However, these impacts are not statistically different from each other, indicating that the impact

of police on murder is symmetric.

8
  These impacts are greater than what would be normally expected because of the omission of the arrests
and because police and arrests are positively correlated. However, the main point here is the asymmetric
response of crime to police.
                                                  18
       In case of rape, reported in Panel C of Table 6, police has a statistically significant

impact. This result is consistent with the one reported in Corman and Mocan (2005). An

increase in police force by 100 officers reduces monthly number of rapes by 1.2, but a decrease

by 100 officers increases rapes by 1.4. The difference is statistically significant in two of the

three specifications, indicating asymmetric response of this particular crime to variations in

deterrence.



D. Robustness and Model Specification

       We investigated if the results are sensitive to the model specification.            For the

nonparametric analysis, we investigated if the results were sensitive to the method of detrending.

Instead of eliminating nonstationarity using the first-differences, we obtained trend deviations of

the variables with unit roots from a Hodrik-Prescott Filter (Mocan 1999, Blackburn and Morton

1992). Alternatively, we eliminated trends by regressing non-stationary variables on linear and

quadratic trend terms. The results were insensitive to the method of de-trending.

       We estimated the regressions with time-series data using longer lag-lengths, which did

not alter the conclusions. We also entertained the possibility that the impact of unemployment

on crime might depend on the level of unemployment. We did not reach clear-cut conclusions in

this exercise, possibly because the range of the unemployment rate is not wide enough to identify

such an impact.

       It is also important to investigate if the results may be an artifact of reverse causality or

omitted variables. Reverse causality from crime to unemployment is theoretically possible

where the unit of observation is a city, but in our particular case, reverse causality is not likely

because of high frequency of the data. Specifically, variations in crime in a particular month are

                                                19
not likely to impact the unemployment rate in the same month. Furthermore, our time-series

models include lagged values of the unemployment rate, which cannot be influenced by

contemporaneous variations in crime. Can the differential impact of recessions and recoveries

on crime be an artifact of omitted variables? For example, if deterrence is negatively correlated

with increases in unemployment, the impact of recession on crime would be overstated given

that deterrence has a negative impact on crime. New York City data allow us to investigate the

correlations between police and UR + and police and UR − . The correlations are very small, –0.02

in the former and –0.09 in the latter, indicating that omitted deterrence is not an issue. If there is

some other omitted variable which is negatively correlated with recessions but which has a

positive impact on crime (such as alcohol consumption), then our results are actually

understatements of asymmetric behavior.



E. Evidence from State-level Panel Data

       Our final piece of evidence regarding asymmetric behavior of crime is obtained from a

different source of variation. We use annual state-level panel data covering the period from 1977

to 2002. Models are estimated as depicted by Equation (6), where state property crime rate (the

sum of burglary, motor-vehicle theft, and larceny theft per 100,000 population) as well as violent

crime rate (the sum of murder, robbery and rape per 100,000 population) are modeled as a

function of UR + and UR − . As before, these variables are created based on changes in state

unemployment rates between years.

       The results are displayed in Table 7. All specifications include state fixed-effects, year

fixed-effects and state-specific time trends. The regressions are estimated with weighted least

squares where state populations are used as weights. In column I we report the results where

                                                 20
property crime rate is explained by UR + and UR − only (in addition to year and state fixed-effects

and state-specific time trends). A one percentage-point increase in state unemployment rate

increases the property crime rate by about 103 (the mean of the sample is 4454). This suggests

that a one-percentage point increase in the unemployment rate is associated with a 2.3% increase

in property crime rate. On the other hand, a one percentage point decrease in the unemployment

rate lowers the property crime rate by only 92 (2.06%). The difference is statistically significant

at the 5 percent level, indicating that the extent of the increase in property crime during a

particular rise in unemployment is greater than the decrease in property crime when

unemployment declines by the same amount. Column II reports the results where the same

specification is run with additional controls that may have an influence on state-level criminal

activity.   A one-percentage point increase in the unemployment rate is associated with an

increase in property crime rate by 101, while a one-percentage point decrease in the

unemployment rate decreases property crime by only 91 and difference is again statistically

significant (p-value=0.04). These results, once again, indicate that property crime is asymmetric.

        Columns III and IV repeat the same exercise for violent crime. As can be seen, the

unemployment coefficients are not statistically different from zero, suggesting that no reaction of

violent crime to changes in the unemployment rate.              When we estimated the models with

individual crimes that comprise violent crime, the coefficients of both unemployment variables

were insignificant.9


9
  We also ran the models using the logarithms of violent and property crimes. For violent crimes we
obtained small and statistically insignificant impacts of unemployment. For property crimes, the
coefficient of UR + was 0.0183, and the one for UR − was 0.0155 in the model with no additional controls
(the equivalent of column I), and they were 0.0186 and 0.0163, respectively, in the model with controls
(the equivalent of column II). In both cases the difference was statistically significant. It should also be
noted that the magnitudes of these effects are very similar to those obtained in previous research, which
                                                    21
!

       In this paper we present evidence of a previously-unnoticed regularity of aggregate

criminal behavior.   Property crime rises quickly but declines gradually over time; and the

increase in property crime during economic downturns is greater in magnitude than its decrease

in economic recoveries.     We use three different data sets and three different estimation

methodologies. Using U.S. data, we perform a nonparametric analysis to examine the nature of

expansions and contractions over time. Calculation of the transition probabilities shows that for

property crime, increases are sharper but decreases are more gradual. This result indicates that

property crime expands quickly, but contracts slowly. Murder and rape do not exhibit such

asymmetry.

       For parametric time-series analyses using aggregate U.S. data, we employ two indicators

of aggregate economic activity: the unemployment rate, and per capita growth in real GDP. We

find that during an economic downturn, which is associated with an increase in unemployment or

a decrease in per capita income growth, property crime rate rises more significantly than the

decline it exhibits during a recovery. For murder and rape, no asymmetry is expected due to

business cycles, which is confirmed by the data.

       We also perform the parametric and nonparametric analyses using data from New York

City. Consistent with the U.S. data, we find evidence of asymmetric behavior of property crime,

but the hypothesis of symmetry cannot be rejected for murder and rape in New York City, where

local unemployment rate is used as a business cycle indicator.



assumed symmetry (e.g. Corman and Mocan (2005), Gould, Mustard and Weinberg (2002), Levitt (2001),
Raphael and Winter-Ebmer (2000), and Levitt (1996)).
                                               22
           The availability of monthly police force information for New York City allows us to

investigate the impact of increases and decreases in police on crime. We find that a decrease in

the size of the police force has a greater impact on property crimes than an increase in police by

an equivalent amount. No such asymmetry is detected for murder, but there is some evidence of

persistence of rapes following a decrease in police.

           As a final analysis, we use annual state-level panel data from 1997 to 2002 and detect the

same regularity. Consistent with the other analyses performed in the paper, we find that a one

percentage-point increase in state unemployment rate is associated with a larger absolute

increase in crime in comparison to the decline in crime due to a one percentage-point decline in

the unemployment rate. Violent crime does not react to variations in state unemployment.

           A number of factors may cause an increase in crime such as reduced certainty and

severity of punishment, increased joblessness, demographic shifts, changes in risk aversion and

time preferences. The results of this paper indicate that persistence in the level of crime will

follow after an increase in criminal activity, and crime will not revert back to its original level as

quickly as it has risen. Given that the social cost of crime is substantial10, the finding of

hysteresis in property crime suggests that it may be cost effective to implement measures and

mechanisms that will prevent crime commission rates from rising in the first place.

The crime rates and the unemployment rate are seasonally adjusted. Murder and rape rates are in
first-differences. Robust standard errors are in (parentheses) under the coefficients. *, **, or ***
signify statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively. The last column reports
the Wald-statistic for the hypothesis of the equality of the sums of the UR + and UR − coefficients.
The values in [brackets] contain the p-values for Chi-square (1).

The crime rates and per capita GDP are seasonally adjusted. Murder and rape rates are in first-
differences. Robust standard errors are in (parentheses) under the coefficients. *, **, or *** signify
statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively. The last column reports the
Wald-statistic for the hypothesis of the equality of the sums of the UR + and UR − coefficients. The
values in [brackets] contain the p-values for Chi-square (1).
