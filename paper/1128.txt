                       THE ECONOMICS OF RETIRE'IENT BEHAVIOR



                                     ABSTRACT


     This   paper examines the role of economic factors in determining retire-

ment behavior using a unique new data archive on more than 8,700 workers

covered by ten different pension plans. We build on our earlier work by esti-

mating several different retirement models including linear as well as dis-

crete choice formulations. This framework provides new insights into how and

why retirement ages differ across firms. We conclude that older

workers' income opportunities differ depending on their pension rules, which

in turn have a powerful influence on their retirement patterns. In addition

the models indicate that older workers' tastes for income are not uniform,

either across Individuals or across firms.      Finally, we show that retirement

age differences are in part due to differences in worker preferences and in

part due to differences in income opportunities. There appears to be some

evidence of worker sorting across pension plans.

INTRODUCTION


     Why do older   workers retire when they do? Although some   workers   withdraw

from their firms when confronted with health problems1 or mandatory retirement,2

an economic explanation, in contrast, puts more weight on the role of income and

leisure opportunities as determinants of older workerst retirement patterns.

     The present paper contains several findings about the role of economic

factors in retirement behavior, using a unique new data archive on more than

8,700 workers covered by ten different pension plans. It extends our earlier

work based on 390 workers in a single pension plan (Mitchell and Fields, 1983;

Fields and   Mitchell,   1983a). The point of departure in Section I is an inter—

temporal model in which older individuals select a retirement age from among

several possible dates by comparing the utility from each alternative.       Empirical
implementation of this framework requires modelling expectations about future

pension and earnings streams. We do this in Section II. In Section III, various

retirement models are estimated including linear as well as discrete choice

formulations. We test for unobservable but systematic patterns in workers'

preferences for income relative to leisure, and evaluate the sensitivity

of estimated responses to changes in income parameters. We take a different

tack in Section IV, by exploring how and why average retirement ages differ

across firms. This last issue has received only scanty attention in existing

literature, though it is critical in determining whether or not workers "sort"

themselves into firms providing pension plans rewarding early or late retirement




       'Cordon and Blinder (1980) provide a careful analysis of the role of ill
health on retirement; a recent review of how health affects older workers is
contained in Bazzoli (in progress).

      2Làear (1979) has an interesting analysis of mandatory retirement policy.

           Results   and policy Implications are gathered in Scction V. We concludc:

           1. Older workers' income
                                     opportunjtj5 differ depending on when
               they retire, who they are, and what their pension rules are.

           2. Differences in income opportunities at older ages influence
               retirement patterns significantly.

          3. Older workers' tastes for income and leisure are not uniform
              either across older workers within a firm or across firms.

          4. Average retirement ages vary widely across firms; some of this
              variation IS attributable to differences in worker preferences,
              and some to differences in income opportunities. In addition,
              we find some evidence of worker
                                                sorting.


  I. MODELING CONSTRAINTS AND CHOICES

          A. The Theoretical Framework

          The basic model of how earnings,
                                             private pensions, and Social Security
  benefit streams affect workers'
                                 retirement ages is facilitated by cxamining
  Figures 1 and 2. Figure 1 depicts the
                                        intertemporal budget set for a worker

 contemplating retirement, taking age 60 (or some similar age) as the starting

 point for retirement planning and the planning horizon as T years. Each
                                                                         year
 the individual continues to work, he
                                          receives $E in after—tax earnings. If
 he retires in year R, he receives $ii(R) in retirement income from private

 pension and Social Security in that year, and $P.(R,t) in retirement income
                                                    I
 thereafter.      The upward slope of the tr function reflects the widespread

 practice of providing higher initial benefits to a worker who defers retirement.

 Corresponding to each retirement date (for example,
                                                           R1 and R2) are streams of
future pension benefits, denoted by P(R,t). The P(R,t) functions are flat if

pension streams are constant over time; they rise if post—retirement pension

increases are awarded.

        The monetary gain to Continued work is best treated in terms of
                                                                        present
discounted values. Let         be a discount factor reflecting time preference

and mortality. The present discounted value of earnings is:

This increases with length of worklife R so long as E >        0.   The pension

structure rewards or discourages continued work in accordance with

When retirement is postponed, pension benefits typically are higher per year,

but they are received for fewer years. If PDVP(R) is constant regardless of

the date of retirement, the pension structure is said to be actuarially neutral.

Generally, however, neither private pensions nor Social Security are neutral

in this sense. The total payoff from working until a particular age and then

retiring is the sum of PDVE and PDVP:

     FDVY     1R E 6 dt    + JT( + SS )6 dt.                                       (3)

The earnings and pension streams depicted in Figure 1 produce a PDVY locus

which increases inonotonically in R.

     The choice of retirement age is determined by combining this intertemporal

budget set with an intertemporal utility function, here postulated to have as

its arguments present discounted value of expected lifetime income (PDVY, as

given by (3)) and     number of leisure years (RET    T—R). The control variable

R is selected to maximize

     U     U(PDVY, RET) where U1, U2 >   0,   U11, U22 <
                                                           0                       (4)


subject to (3). As shown in Figure 2, the goal is to achieve the highest

possible utility level U* consistent with the intertemporal budget set. The

optimal retirement date R* equates the marginal utility of income from an addi-

tional year of work with the marginal utility of one more year of leisure.


     B. Econometric Formulations

     Two   different   econometric models are used in the present paper to determine
                                                                                            5


empirically     how responsive retirement ages are to changes in the budget constraint.

       The first approach takes the age of retirement as the dependent variable,

and estimates its sensitivity to a paraineterization of the intertemporal

budget set. In particular, we postulate that the PDVY       function   in   Figure   .2




may   be summarized by two variables:      (1) Base wealth (YBASE), or the present
value of income available at the earliest possible retirement age; and (2) The
gain   in the present value of income that would be obtained by working longer

and postponing retirement (YSLOPE). In earlier work (Fields and Mitchell,

1983a), we showed theoretically that the age of retirement should be negatively

related    to YBASE, ceteris paribus, because of the ordinary negative income
effect. YSLOPE on the        other hand has a theoretically ambiguous effect on       the

age    of retirement; a higher income gain from postponing retirement makes the

workerts leisure time more costly (inducing more work), but also provides

higher income each year he does work (inducing earlier retirement).           If the

substitution effect doninates, the partial effect of YSLOPE on the age of

retirement should be positive. These hypotheses are tested in Section III.

       While the OLS model is invaluable as a first—round approach to the age

of retirement problem, it is also useful to determine what further insights

are obtained from a more structured econometric procedure.        An approach that

proved fruitful in our earlier study of workers in a single firm (Mitchell

and Fields, 1983) is to model retirement in a discrete choice framework.

Drawing on the pathbreaking work of McFadden (1974), we postulate that the

i'th    worker would receive utility        if he retired at age j, where utility is
comprised of a "strict utility" component for the average person as well as
a disturbance term which varies across people:
            —   (ci   logPDVY + B logRET1) +
Here ci and 8 are average taste parameters to be estimated across a sample of
                                                                                         6


individuals.

       To close the model, we must add a distributional assumption about the

A common tactic in qualitative choice analysis is to assume that £jj'S         are
distributed    independently of one another and that each       has the Weibull

distribution. This produces a inultinoniial logit estimating model (IINL):
                                                                  -

                                                                                         (6)
                    I.e




       As is well known, however, this distributional assumption requires Independence

from Irrelevant Alternatives (hA), i.e., the relative probabilities of any

two choices are unaffected by the attributes or availability of other choice

options. In particular, hA means that there is no correlation between C.k and

      (k & j). However, in the retirement context there is strong reason to

believe that such correlation may be important——particularly if individuals

are likely to be "workaholics" or "leisure lovers."

       In order to allow for this kind of correlation, we propose an       ordered   logit

(OL) setup, in which the probability of choosing a given retirement age is

allowed to depend on the attractiveness of the next closest retirement ages.1

The probability of selecting from among several ordered choices maj be approximated

as:


           e
           K                                                                             (7)
            Z (eVk + oNk)
           k=l

where N =           (log (-i) +   log(l + P1/P) + log(l + P1/P)) and P is the
probability    of    selecting retirement age k under the hA assumption.       plays
the   role of a proxy for alternative—specific variation in tastes, which other-

wise would be omitted from the Logit model; its coefficient (a) indicates the
                                                                                                                          7


importance of such variation. Iterated maximum likelihood estimation produces

estimates of, the coefficients of interest, reported in Section III.


     C. Data

     As is evident from the previous discussion, estimating retirement models

requires that the analyst have complete information for each sample individual

about: (1) the actual retirement age he selected, and (2) the intertemporal

budget set he faced.

     Concerning the actual retirement age, many data sets deal with individuals

who have not yet retired. Our data set, a subsample of the Benefits Amounts

Survey developed by the US Department of Labor, avoids this difficulty since

we include only those individuals who reached the age of mandatory retirement

by the time of the survey in 1978.1 As a result these data are free from

"censored spells" problems which plague other labor force modelers. At the

same time, we wish to avoid mortality bias, and thus select the youngest

possible group of workers in the sample——those born in 1909 and 1910. The data

set then consists of 8733 males in ten firms who retired between the ages of

of retirement patterns, and in addition extends the 390—retiree sample used

in our own previous empirical studies.

     The Benefit Amounts Survey is also exceptionally useful for building

the components of each worker's intertemporal budget set. This is because the

data were collected on each worker's years of service, birth year, andretirement

year, and then the individual files matched with Social Security administrative

records and firms' pension rules. The Social Security records provided a

detailed earnings history for each worker from 1951 on2 which was used to im—



     'Mandatory retirement ages varied across firms in the 1970's; six firms
in our sample used age 65, one used age 66, and the rest were later or had no

pute what each individual would have made (after taxes) had he continued to

work between the ages 60 and 68.1 In addition, published Social Security

regulations were used to compute each worker's benefit streams for all possible

retirement ages. For private pensions, descriptions of benefits rules were

taken from union contracts and/or summary plan descriptions on file with the

Labor Department, rendered computer useable by constructing complex benefit

algorithms for each of the ten plans used in the analysis.2'3


II. EARNINGS, PRIVATE PENSIONS, AND SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFIT STREAMS


     The income opportunities available to each worker at all feasible retire-

ment are presented in Table 1. The perspective taken is a forward—looking

one: we ask, from the viewpoint of age 60, what is the discounted present

value of pension benefits, Social Security income, and earnings available to

the worker if he were to retire at age 60, or age 61, or later?4 We follow

standard practice by discounting each year's benefits by the probability of

mortality at each age, based on survival rate information for the cohort.

In addition future benefits are deflated by inflation and a real discount

rate, assumed tote 2%.




     ore information about the construction of the intertemporal budget set
is available from the authors upon request.

     2Pension descriptions in effect during the 1970's when sample members
were retiring were complemented with earlier descriptions, used to determine
how benefits had changed during the previous decade. The empirical analysis
below builds in pre—retirement pension increases consistent with what each
plan did during this period; since most plans did not grant post—retirement
increases, nominal benefits upon retirement are taken to be constant.

     3The ten plans in our sample cannot be identified individually for conf i—
dentiality reasons; however the sample includes four blue collar plans negotiated
by the United Auto Workers, and several non—union manufacturing and service sector
plans.
     4The computations assume that an individual files for Social Security
when he retires or at age 62, whichever is later.

     Several regularities stand Out in these data. First, discounted lifetime

income always increases as retirement is deferred. This is a result of higher

cumulative earnings which outweigh any actuarial penalty imposed by private

pension plans, and the Social Security penalty when retirement is deferred

past age 65.1 Second, the intertemporal budget set is highly nonlinear. On

average, a worker postponing retirement from age 61 to 62 would gain about

$8700, but for delaying retirement between ages 64 and 65 receives a marginal

gain 16% smaller. This arises because of the underlying nonlinearities in

the pension and Social Security systems and the interactions between them.

Some of our sample plans integrate benefits with Social Security payments,

paying 'tearly retirement supplemental income" until the retiree is eligible

for Social Security. The payoff to deferring retirementis greater for some

ages than for others in all sample plans.

     Another important feature of the data is that the intertemporal budget

sets vary substantially across workers. The major source of this variability

is clear from Table 2, which reports means and standard deviation of private

pension income streams in each of the ten plans.2 Differences in years of

service account for much of the variation in expected benefits across workers

in the pattern plans, where benefits are determined primarily as a function

of tenure at the firm.      The conventional plans exhibit somewhat more cross—

worker variation since they include both service and salary history in computing

benefits. The fact that there are differences across workers' intertemporal

budget sets is critical in estimating retirement responses, just as it is

necessary to have wage differences in order to trace out labor supply patterns

in the   cross   sectional context.3

     In addition to within—plan income   differences,   there are

differences in income opportunities. Because the pension structures are quite

complex, it is useful to derive expected benefits for the identical "illustrative

worker" in all ten plans; the results appear in Table 3•1 One striking fcature

is that the pattern plans in our sample tend to structure their benefits so

that they actively discourage work beyond age 60. A pattern plan employee

who defers retiring until age 65 will in fact receive lifetime pension benefits

which are about 18% lower than at age 60. On the other hand, conventional plans'

present value streams are set up so that the worker who defers retirement until

age 65 will receive about 17% higher pension benefits than if he left at age 60.

Thus, between ages 60 and 65, conventional plan improve benefits by about the

same proportion that pattern plans reduce them. In general, patterns plans tend

to encourage early retirement, while conventional plans encourage remaining on

the job until age 62 and offer a flat payout schedule thereafter (See Figure 3).

We can conclude that in some plans, the present value of retirement income is quite

low for an early retiree, but rises if retirement is postponed; for other plans,

the structure is reversed so that early retirement is rewarded most highly, and

continued work is penalized by the pension plan.

     In the next section we explore how these differences in income opportunities

across workers and plans influence retirement age decisions.

III. RETIREMENT RESPONSES TO INCOME OPPORTUNITIES


     A.   Results from the Linear Model

     Table 4 contains a first set of findings on the question of how earnings,

pensions and Social Security benefits affect retirement patterns. We find

that the predictions suggested by our previous research are confirmed

in Column 1. The coefficient on YBASE is significantly negative, indicating

that persons with more base income retire earlier. In addition, the effect of

YSLOPE is positive, indicating that individuals who have more to gain by

poning retirement, do in fact retire later. Sixteen percent of the variance

in retirement ages is accounted for by just these two variables——a high R2

for micro data. Thus we conclude that our earlier regression findings for

the employees covered by one particular pension plan are supported in this

extended sample.

     Having established the overall qualitative robustness of the regression

results, we turn our attention to the specific quantitative magnitudes of

the regression coefficients to determine whether the workers in the ten plans

exhibit basically the same quantitative responses to lifetime income oppor-

tunities. One set of tests is based onthe pooled sample. Using all 8733

workers, we introduce dummy   variables   allowing first for plan—specific intercept

shifters (Column 2) and then also for plan—specific slope shifters (Column 3).

In both models we see that the plan dummies are significantly different from

zero by conventional standards. From this we conclude that the workers in

different pension plans are differentially responsive to economic incentives

associated with deferred retirement.

     It might be thought that in addition to the parameters of the budget

constraint (as measured by YBASE and YSLOPE), variations across firms in

retirement ages might be associated with differences indemographic characteristics

of the workers or with characteristics of the firms themselves. Variables to

test these conjectures are not abundant in our data set; for some plans we

did have a few additional descriptors of the workers (race, marital status)

but these had no significant impact on the findings noted above. As for firm—

side variables, we were able to develop dummy variables measuring the existence

of a union, whether all employees were blue collar, whether the firm was in the

manufacturing sector, and whether mandatory retirement parlor toage68 was in

effect. When these variables are regressed on plan—level coefficients estimated

obtained from Column 2 of Table 4, we find that unionized firms have somewhat

later retirement ages and blue collar workers retire significantly earlier,

holding constant the budget constraint as measured here. These findings are

consistent with non—pecuniary attributes of the job playing a role in determining

retirement ages: in particular, unions may increase the attractiveness of

the workplace, while blue—collar jobs are less appealing to the older worker.

Since we cannot yet identify very many of the factors differentiating workers'

retirement patterns across plans, the only available option is to treat these

worker and firm traits as unobservables and to develop models incorporating

unmeasured systematic differences across employees. This is accomplished to

a great degree by means of the discrete choicemodels explored next.


     B. Results from the Discrete Choice Models

     The jumping—off point for discrete choice modeling is the basic multi—

nomial logit (MNL) model. Because of the potential for differences in unobservables

across firms signalled in the previous section, and because early mandatory

retirement provisions were in effect in some firms, but not in others, we examine

the ten pension plans one by one rather than in a pooled model. Plan—by—plan

results for the MNL model appear in the left hand columns of Table 5.

     For all ten plans, the MNL results indicate that the income opportunities

for different retirement ages (PDVY) are significant determinants of retirement

patterns. In eight of the ten plans, workers also appear to value leisure

years (RET) significantly. However, before accepting these findings based

on the MNL model, it is necessary to test the validityof its underlying assump-.

tion——the Independence from Irrelevant Alternatives (hA).

     One test of hA was suggested by Hausman and McFadden (1981). It is a

Chi—square test statistic comparing the estimated MNL coefficients from the full

sample with new coefficients obtained from estimating a MNL model on a subsample

of individuals who chose a specific subset of alternatives.1 Such calculations

for the subsets age 60 through 65 and 60 through 62, appear in Panel A of Table

6. The calculated value of the test statistic surpasses the critical value in

all but one firm for which the test could be performed.2 This is strong evidence

against hIA: tastes for leisure are not uniform in the older population.

     The second hA test compares the predicted frequency distribution of

retirement ages under MNL, where hA is required, with the predicted distribution

obtained from the ordered logit model, where hA is relaxed. By this test,

reported in Panel B of Table 6, the calculated test statistic surpasses the

critical Chi-square value in six of the ten p1s. Thus hA should also be

rejected in the majority of the cases by this second test.




1The Hausman—McFadden statistic is defined as
     T —     — 0) '[cov(OR) — coy   (0) ]   —
                                            °R   0)
where   0Is the coefficient vector estimated for the full model; 0R
is the coefficient vector estimates among individuals chosing a sub—
set of tne total choice set; cov(0) refers to the relevant parameter covariance
matrix; and t denotes a generalized inverse. The test statistic is interpreted
such that avalueof T larger than a Chi—square critical value rejects hA;
degrees of freedom are computed as
    d       tr[(cov(O) — cov(0   )]tlcov(0R) — cov(O)].
2The test cannot be performed where retirement was mandatory at age 65, or
 when no worker in a particular plan chose to retire before age 62.

      Taken together these tests suggest that the ordered logit (OL) model,
in which hA is not maintained, better suits the retirement problem.      An

examination of the OL coefficient estimates (right—hand columns for each plan

in Table 5) indicates the importance of both income and leisure as determinants

of retirement ages. PDVY is statistically nonzero in all ten plans, and RET

enters significantly In eight of ten plans. The results are similar to MNL

findings in some cases, e.g., the ratio a/B      and the log likelihood ratio for

plan 1/8 are virtually identical.1 However, in other cases the results are quite

different: for plan 1/5, the ratio a/B changes by about 18% and the log like-

lihood ratio rises by 16% when going to ordered logit. In addition, the fact

that the coefficient (a) is statistically nonzero in eight out of ten cases

suggests that relaxing the hA assumption makes a difference.

       Focusing just on the OL results, we note that the relative importance of

 income versus leisure as measured by a/B varies across firms by a factor of

 about 2 1/2: from .64 in plan 1/3 to 1.46 in plan 1/9. These findings buttress

 our conclusions from the linear models: workers in all firms react to income

 and leisure opportunities in selecting retirement dates, but they differ across

 firms in the way they react to the income and leIsure opportunIties associated

 with deferred retirement.

       Because OL coefficients are rather difficult to interpret directly, it is

                                                                    are to changes
 of interest to compute explicitly how sensitive retirement ages

       Change A: Each worker's earnings stream is increased by 10% of his
                  base (age 60) earnings amount.

       Change   B: Each worker's earnings stream is tilted suchthat earnings
                   at every age are increased by 10%

    Change C: The pension benefit at each age is increased by 10% of the
               age 60 amount.

    Change D:   The slope of the pension function is raised by 10%.

    Change E: The Social Security benefit stream is raised by 10% of
               the initial amount.

     Change F: The slope of the Social Security function is increased
                by adding 10% to every year's benefits.

Estimated coefficients from Table S are combined with these alternative

budget sets in order to determine how each individual would be likely to

alter his retirement date. Changes for the group as a whole are cbtained by

summing individual changes in predicted probabilities for each age.

     Table 7 reports the findings for the preferred OL specification in Colurn

1; parallel estimates for the ML model appear in the second co1uin. A 10%

increase in earned income is predicted to increase the average retirement age

by about 0.1 years, or a little over a month. A rise in earnings has both

income and substitution effects, and in this case the substitution response

appears to dominate. In constrast, raising retirement benefits by increasing

either private pensions or Social Security would lower the retirement age by a

little less than a month, on average.1 Changing the value of early retirerrnt

benefits has a larger effect than altering the gain to deferring retirement,

for both pensions and Social Security. This is because raising only early

retirement benefits produces an incorr effect favoring more leisure consurption;

raising the slope of the benefit stream elicits an additional substitution

response in the opposing direction.

     Several conclusions emerge from this analysis. First, we find that for

 than to pensions and Social Security, though the data set they use did not
 contain as much information on benefit structures as is available here.

 every plan, higher earnings would result in later retirement, whereas higher

 pensions or Social Security Benefits would induce earlier retirement. Second,

 the ordered logit model provides larger estimates of behavioral responses to

 changes in income parameters, as compared to the MNL approach. This arises from

 the fact that the CL setup allows nearby retirement ages to be "closer" to the

 date initially chosen, than does the MNL model. Consequently, when the budget

 constraint changes, the OL responses are on average 30% larger as compared to

 the responses estimated assuming hA. Third, the difference that OL makes

varies across plans; looking across the ten plans we find less of a quantitative

difference between OL and MNL than had been detected in our earlier work on a

single plan. This is the only quantitative difference between our findings in

the larger sample and earlier results. Fourth, we conclude that retirement ages

are responsive to budget set parameters, but the degree of responsiveness is

relatively small. In general, rather large changes in policy variables such

as taxes or benefits would be required in order to elicit substantialchanges

in retirement ages.1


IV.   WHY DO RETIR'1ENT AGES DIFFER ACROSS PENSION PLANS?

      A. Retirement Ages in Ten Plans

      In contrast toprevious sections, the focus here is on retirement age

differences across pension plans, rather than across individuals. That

retirement ages do differ across plans is demonstrated in Table 8: the overall

retirement age across all ten pension plans is 63.7, but plan averages range

from 61.8 to 65.7 years of age. Several explanations are possible: either the

economic incentives for retirement differ systematically across plans, or workers'



     This conclusion is supported in our research with other data sets and other
policy reform proposals; see Fields and Mitchell (1983b).

preferences f or income and leisure vary systematically across plans, or both

factors may be important. While a larger sample would be necessary for a

thorough investigation of these explanations, it is of interest to explore

the suggestive evidence provided by the ten plans for which information is

presently available.


     B.    Retirement Ages and Worker Preferences

     Our earlier analysis used OL models to develop plan—specific estimates of

the weights workers attach to income relative to leisure (a/s).         In   order to

see whether retirement ages and workers' tastes are associated across plans,

we correlate each plan's ratio of a/ with its average retirement age CR).1

We find that in fact this ratio covaries withretirement age almost exactly,

producing a correlation coefficient between R and cx/ of .94. This finding

suggests that plans that have later average retirement ages are also those

where workers on the average have stronger relative preferences for income versus

leisure.


     C. Retirement Ages and Income Opportunities

     We now investigate whether differences in budget constraint parameters

across plans help explain plan-level differences in retirement ages. This

issue can be analyzed in two ways: (1) Do plans offering more inome for

early retirement have earlier average retirement ages (holding constant the

rewards from deferring retirement)?, and (2) Do plans offering a greater reward

for postponing retirement have higher average retirement ages (for a given early

retirement benefit)?

    One way to operationalize both questions is to determine the degree of

association between average retirement ages (i),    the   present   value of income


     1The ratio ct/; was computed only where the underlying OL coefficients were
statistically significant. We interpret this ratio as a measure of relative
preference for income versus leisure, although it may reflect worker tastes for
job characteristics as well.
                                                                                  26


available to an early retiree (YBASE), and the change in the present value of

income if retirement is deferred until age 65 (YSLOPE). For our sample of plans

the   coefficient   of partial correlation between retirement age and YBASE proves

to be —.58, and between retirement age and YSLOPE +.30. Therefore we can con—

dude that some of the variation in retirement ages across plans is attributable

to differences in income opportunities available to workers covered by the plans,

thoughnot as much as was attributed to differences in worker preferences.


       D.   Is There Sorting?

       Firms   and workers   may sort themselves according to their respective preferences

for   continued work. Firms may differ according to the productivity value of
additional     seniority: presumably older workers are less productive per dollar

expended in some industries than they are in others. Such firms would be expected

to creatè.incentives for older employees to leave at relatively young ages. One

way to do this is to create pension benefits that are larger for workers who

retire early. If workers are aware of the differential incentives offered by

different employers, those individuals who have relatively high tastes for

leisure would seek employment in firms offering higher early retirement benefits.

Empirically, this leads us to expect that our measure of the relative strength of

worker preferences for income versus leisure (a/s) should be negatively related

with the pension plan's early retirement income level (YBASE). In fact the

correlation of a/8 and YBASE is —.45, suggesting that sorting of this type does

indeed take place.


V.    CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS

      The   analysis   reported here is based on a larger and richer data set than

has been previously available to researchers studying retirement issues.

Of course, the sample should be expanded even further before attempting to
                                                                                  27


 generalize    beyond this group of employees and pension plans, and we cxpec

 future research to go in this direction. The evidence developed thus far

 suggests four major findings:

        1. Older workers' income opportunities differ depending on when they

 retire, who they are, and what their pension rules are. For a given individual,

payoffs to continued work are greater at some ages than at others; in general

private pensions and Social Security appear not to be actuarially neutral.

Even within a pension plan, income opportunities vary across workers as a

function of seniority and salary histories used to compute retirement benefits.

Acorss pension plans there are also large differences: in some firms, the

present value of retiring early is low, but rises if the worker defers retire-

ment; in other firms, the structure is reversed so early retirement is rewarded

but continued work penalized.

       2. Differences in income opportunities at older ages influence retirement

patterns significantly. Individuals with more income at age 60 retire earlier;

however, retirement is delayed if the worker stands to gain more by working

longer. In addition, the degree of responsiveness to income opportunItIes

depends on the attractiveness of other, nearby retirement ages. Changes in

earnings have a stronger impact on retirement patterns than would the same

percentage change in private pension or Social Security benefits.

       3.   Tastes for leisure and income are not uniform either across older

workers with a firm or across firms.       The data reject a model that imposes hA

in favor of models which allow for within—individual taste correlation

("workaholism")

      4.    Average   retirement ages vary widely across firms; some of this variation
is   attributable to differences in worker preferences, and some to differences

in income opportunities. In addition, there is some evidence of worker sorting:
                                                                                   28

  those   individuals who place a high value on work and the income derived from

 working are found in firms which provide greater financial rewards for
                                                                          remaining
 on the job at older ages.

      Overall, though many factors influence retirement behavior, our work

 shows that retirement patterns are closely linked to the economic incentives

 for deferring retirement. The policy imp],ications of this finding are evident:

 government practices which alter the rewards for retirement will influence older

 workets' labor market behavior in predictable ways. For instance, reducing

 early Social Security benefits or raising the payroll tax (leaving all else

 the same) would encourage individuals to remain in the labor force, though

 our, results indicate a relatively small response.1

      Future research should inquire whether differences in response patterns

'identified here are correlated with other worker and/or firm characteristics,

'such as health or job requirerrnts. Our findings on worker sorting also

'deserve further attention in future research. Evidence presented here

suggested that firms and workers attempt to structure their pension structures

in a mutually agreeable manner. Thus planners charged with making pension

policy would do well to consIder how specIfic reforms would alter
                                                                    existing
structures, and to ascertain whether such reforms are in fact beneficial to

firms and/or their employees.
