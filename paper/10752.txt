To American and European economists in 1945, the countries of Asia were unpromising candidates

for high economic growth. In 1950 even the most prosperous of these countries had a per capita

income less than 25 percent of that of the United States. Between the mid-1960s and the end of the

twentieth century, however, many of the countries of South and Southeast Asia experienced vigorous

economic growth, some with growth rates far exceeding the previous growth rates of the

industrialized countries. Forecasts that the region’s population growth would outstrip its capacity to

feed itself, and that its economic growth would falter, proved to be incorrect. Growth rates will

probably continue at high levels in Southeast Asia for at least another generation. This forecast is

based on 4 factors: the trend toward rising labor force participation rates, the shift from low to high

productivity sectors, continued increases in the educational level of the labor force, and other

improvements in the quality of output that are at present not accurately measured in national income

accounts.

                       High Performing Asian Economies: Retrospect and Prospect

            In 1945, the idea of high performing Asian economies was not in the mind of

American or European economists. In the United States economists worried about the

problems created by the demobilization of 20 million people (half from military ranks

and half from war industries) and their integration into the civilian labor force. There

were widespread fears that America might slide into a severe new depression. In Europe

the central issues turned around the Allied occupation of German and Italy and the

restoration of the war-devastated economies.                      In Asia the central issues were the

demilitarization of Japan and the restoration of the nations that had been occupied by

Japan. On the horizon were problems related to the dismantling of the colonial empires

of Britain, France, and other European powers.

            Several events between 1945 and 1950 set the stage for the political economy of

the remainder of the twentieth century. One was the outbreak of the cold war and the

strategy of containing the expansionist ambitions of the Soviet Union. Another was the

rapid recovery of Western Europe and the transformation of West Germany into an ally

in the anti-communist coalition. A third was the communist victory in the Chinese civil

war that followed the defeat of Japan. Still another important event was the partition of

India into independent Hindu and Muslim nations. There was also the emergence of

newly independent governments throughout South and Southeast Asia∗ that were each

struggling to find its road to rapid economic growth.

            As Table 1 shows, the countries of South and Southeast Asia were at different

economic levels in 1950, at the beginning of this quest. Japan, an occupied nation, had

                                                                                                               1
suffered severe reversals in fortune and had slipped to a level of per capita income

characteristic of a low-middle-income economy.          Even the more prosperous Asian

nations shown in Table 1 had a per capita income that was less than a quarter of that in

the United States. In contrast, the war-ravaged economies of Europe were by 1950

already on their way to a quarter century of unprecedented economic growth that would

raise standards of living, health, and life expectancy for ordinary people to levels that few

would have predicted (Crafts and Toniolo 1996). Thus, the stage was set for intense

debates among economists and policymakers about the way to deal with global

disparities. Among the points at issue were the virtues of centralized and decentralized

planning and whether international trade was a handmaiden of domestic economic

growth or an obstacle to it.

       It is also worth noting that by current standards the United States of 1950 was not

a rich country, although it would have been classified at the top of the World Bank’s

category of “upper-middle-income” nations. France and the United Kingdom would also

have fallen into the upper-middle-income category, but Germany and Italy would have

been in the lower-middle income category, much closer to the more prosperous Asian

nations than to the United States.

       During the 1950s and 1960s economists were particularly interested in the relative

progress of India and China. The political leadership of both countries was heavily

influenced by the Soviet model of centralized planning.          Both countries developed

successive 5-year plans for economic growth of their countries. These plans sought rapid

economic growth by placing special emphasis on the rapid development of heavy

industry. Both taxed rural areas to subsidize cities and urban industries.




                                                                                           2
       However, India sought to achieve its objectives under a political democracy, in

which some industries would have government backing but the bulk of economic

production and distribution would be left to the private sector. It also embarked on a

protectionist policy aimed at promoting infant industries. New financial institutions were

set up that placed the supply of capital largely under the control of the government, which

directed investment into sectors given prominence by the plan. The first 5-year plan,

which ran from 1951–1956, was successful in meeting its goals and private enterprise

expanded. As indicated by Table 2, the annual rate of growth in per capita income during

the plan was in the neighborhood of 2 percent. However, annual net investment was in

the neighborhood of just 6 or 7 percent (Pepelases, Mears, and Adelman 1961;

Malenbaum 1959, 1982).

       By the early 1960s, the Indian economy began to stumble. Not all of the problems

were due to errors by policymakers. Some problems arose from border clashes with

Pakistan and China. Some of the food shortages were due to droughts. But the main

pressure on the food supply was due to explosive growth of population as mortality rates

fell sharply. As a result of the successful public health measures undertaken during the

1950s and 1960s, such killer diseases as cholera, malaria, and smallpox were brought

under control, helping life expectancy at birth to rise from 32 to 51 years between 1950

and 1968 (Chandrasekhar 1968). Moreover, growth of per capita income also raised the

demand for food, putting upward pressure on food prices that pinched both the urban and

rural poor.   Government efforts at land reform may actually have increased rural

inequality (Mellor et al. 1968; Blyn 1971).         Attempts at government controlled

industrialization thwarted private investment and promoted uncompetitive enterprises




                                                                                         3
(Shenoy 1968, Sklaeiwitz 1966, 5 April 1971; Healy 1972; cf. Bhagwati and Chakravarty

1969). As a result, Indian growth slipped badly during the first half of the 1960s (see

Table 2).

       Although India and China were the cases most frequently discussed by

economists, attention was also paid to other nations in Southeast Asia. During the 1960s,

there was considerable pessimism about Indonesia’s future. Although there was a spurt

of economic growth immediately after independence, during which the nation recovered

from the setbacks associated with the Japanese occupation, the economy stagnated

between 1955 and 1965, a period long enough to make economists wonder if Indonesia

could overcome its problems (Mears 1961). Beginning with the mid-1960s, however, the

country began vigorous growth that lasted for three decades (see Table 2). Malaysia and

Singapore also stagnated during the decade of the 1950s, contributing to the sense among

some Western economists that adverse institutional factors might thwart their

development. But in these countries fortunes changed decisively in the 1960s.

       Table 2 shows that eight Southeast Asian nations all grew vigorously from 1965

on, and that several of them (China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Thailand) had vigorous

economic growth throughout the second half of the twentieth century. Indeed, their

growth rates far exceeded the previous growth rates of the industrialized countries. Few

American or European economists anticipated growth rates that would double, triple or

quadruple the long-term rates of the industrial leaders between 1820 and 1950.

       The most startling change of fortunes was in Japan. With outbreak of the Korean

War, United Nations forces placed large orders with Japan, greatly stimulating its

industrial growth. Even after the end of fighting, Japan’s economy benefited from large




                                                                                       4
orders for the build-up of the U.S. military establishment in the Pacific region. The

Japanese export boom powered the dramatic rise in the Japanese economy. In one

industry after another, including scientific instruments, cameras, sewing machines, and

shipbuilding, Japanese firms displayed their command of the latest technology. During

the 1960s, Japan moved from the production of under a half million cars to the world’s

second largest supplier, displacing Germany and France, among others. The rise of auto

production helped promote the expansion of steel and moved the country toward world

preeminence in that basic product (Allen 1972). As Table 2 shows, from 1950 through

1970, the growth of Japanese per capita income exceeded that of all the other high

performing economies. In the space of two decades Japanese per capita income increased

by more than fivefold, a feat that had required more than a century for the nations that led

the industrial revolution (Kuznets 1971; Maddison 1995).         Although the growth of

Japanese per capita income slowed after 1970, it still increased by about 40 percent

between 1970 and 1980, making it the second largest economy in the world, bigger than

France and the UK combined (Maddison 1995).

       During the late 1960s and early 1970s, many analysts became alarmed at what

appeared to be the unchecked growth of population in Asia. It was widely predicted that

such growth would not only swamp the capacity of South and Southeast Asia to feed

itself, but would also smother the tenuous economic growth of the region. In the 1950s,

many demographers had predicted that population growth would moderate, because a

decline in fertility would soon follow the decline in the death rate, which had caused the

Asian population explosion.     That view was called the theory of the demographic

transition. But fertility rates remained high through the end of the 1960s, causing some




                                                                                          5
demographers to declare that the theory of the demographic transition was dead (Coale

1975).

         At it turned out, that gloomy forecast was incorrect. As Table 3 shows, between

1970 and 1980, total fertility rates fell sharply in all Southeast Asian nations. Today all

of these nations, except for Malaysia and Indonesia have total fertility rates below

reproduction. Indeed, fertility rates in most of these nations are below the fertility rates

of three of the five rich nations shown in Table 3.

         The forecast that Southeast Asia would be unable to feed itself because of the

unbridled growth of population also turned out be erroneous. Table 4 shows the food

situation throughout South and Southeast Asia in 1961. Per capita consumption of

calories in China, even after the famine, was at or below the level of consumption in

England and France toward the end of the eighteenth century. The same desperate

situation prevailed in India, Thailand, and Korea.       By 2000 the food situation had

changed dramatically. Despite the erroneous agricultural policies that precipitated the

famine of 1960-1961, and again slowed agriculture during the “Cultural Revolution” of

1966–1967, China’s progress in agriculture between 1962 and 2000 has been remarkable

(Clark 1976). China not only found a way to feed itself, but did so well enough to

increase its average daily consumption of calories by 73 percent, despite the near

doubling of its population (cf. Lin 1998).

         Although not as dramatic, there were also substantial gains in caloric consumption

in the rest of South and Southeast Asia, ranging from 12 to 68 percent. Another point

worth noting is the improvement in the quality of the diet, as indicated by the increase in

the proportion of nutrients coming from animals. In China the rise was from under 4 to




                                                                                          6
over 19 percent of total caloric consumption. Only Indonesia and India still have levels

of the consumption of animal products that hark back to eighteenth-century conditions in

England and France. Still another problem is the unequal distribution of food in many of

the nations of South and Southeast Asia. In these countries, the proportion of low birth

weights is still high, which implies the early onset of chronic disabilities at middle and

late ages, a problem that will contribute to the high cost of medical care for the elderly in

future years (Barker 1998; Doblhammer and Vaupel 2001; Fogel 2003, 2004).

        So far, I have focused on what has been accomplished in Southeast Asia to date,

an accomplishment that has been hailed widely as an economic miracle. What about the

future? Has the economic miracle run out of steam, as some analysts believe, or is there

room for vigorous growth until 2030 and beyond? I believe that growth rates will

continue at high levels in Southeast Asia for at least another generation. My forecast

rests on three factors.

        First, labor force participation rates will probably increase beyond current levels

in most HPAEs. Both economic and demographic factors suggest that LFPR could rise

to 60 percent or more. China is already near that level, so change in its LFPR will

probably contribute little to its growth. However, given the large differences in labor

productivity within sectors (see Table 5), shifts of labor from agriculture to services and

industry and a small increase in the LFPR could account for 30 percent of the Chinese

growth rate. In other words, labor productivity in China has to grow within sectors by

about 5 percent per annum to produce a total growth rate in per capita income of 7

percent. Intersectoral shifts and increases in LFPR are also likely to account for between




                                                                                           7
a fifth and a third of the total growth of per capita income in other Southeast Asian

economies.

       Second, further increases in the education level of the labor force should add to

labor productivity and economic growth. Table 6 shows gross enrollment ratios in 1980

and 1997 in primary, secondary, and tertiary schools. At the primary level most of the

HPAEs have reached the educational levels of the rich countries. With the exception of

South Korea, however, the HPAEs are still a quarter to a half below the enrollment levels

in secondary schools attained by rich nations. The biggest gap is at the tertiary level

where, except for South Korea, enrollment rates are generally less than a fifth of the U.S.

level. Closing the educational gap will improve the quality of the labor force in the

HPAEs, and will also permit them to move to the frontier of technological innovation.

The growth in the number of highly trained professionals will not only speed up

technological catch-up in the HPAEs, but will also increase the global pace of

technological change. The greater the number of scientists trying to advance the frontier

of knowledge in stem cell research, nanotechnology, genetic engineering, and

information technology, the more rapid the advance in science and technology is likely to

be.

       Third, as HPAEs become rich, and as labor becomes concentrated in the service

sector, errors in the measurement of national income become increasingly severe.

Economists in the United States have identified this problem. It is now clear that many

of the numbers I have presented for the United States badly underestimate U.S. economic

growth because they do not take into account improvements in the quality of output,

especially in such services as education and health-care. Children in secondary schools




                                                                                         8
are taught more today than post-graduate college students used to be taught a generation

ago, let alone two generations ago.

         Even more dramatic are the improvements in health care. A century and a half

ago, people in their late thirties and early forties were more afflicted by chronic

disabilities than people in their late sixties and early seventies are today. Not only has the

average age of onset of disabilities been delayed by a decade or so, but once they appear,

there are now numerous effective interventions. Hernias that used to be permanent and

exceedingly painful conditions, afflicting one out of every four males, can now be

repaired by a surgical procedure that in the U.S. requires hospitalization for only 23

hours.    Other areas where medical interventions have been highly effective include

genito-urinary conditions, control of hypertension and reduction in the incidence of

stroke, replacement of knee and hip joints, curing of cataracts, and chemotherapies that

reduce the incidence of osteoporosis and heart disease (Fogel 2004).

         Yet most of these great advances in health care and education are overlooked in

accounts of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), because the values of these sectors are

measured by inputs instead of by output. An hour of a doctor'
                                                            s time is considered no

more effective today than an hour of a doctor'
                                             s time was half a century ago, before the

age of antibiotics and modern surgery. It has recently been estimated that improvements

in health care, if properly measured, are at least twice the cost of health care, but such

calculations have not yet made their way into the GDP accounts (Cutler and McClellan

2001; Murphy and Topel 2003; Nordhaus 2003). In the case of the United States, my

own rough estimates indicate that allowance for such factors as the increase in leisure

time, the improvement in the quality of health care, and the improvements in the quality




                                                                                            9
of education would come close to doubling the U.S. annual growth rate of per capita

income over the past century (from 2.0 to 3.6 percent per annum).

        What is the implication of these statistics for the understanding of change in

standards of living for the typical American? If we use the conventional measure of

growth, the real income of the typical American in 2000 was seven times greater than it

was in 1900. However, if the adjusted measure is used, Americans in 2000 had real

incomes that are 34 times greater than in 1900. In other words, 80 percent of the goods

and services that Americans enjoy today are outside of the measured economy.

        I close with a final question. Suppose HPAEs are able to grow at 6 or 7 percent per

capita per annum for another generation. Does that mean that technological leadership will

pass from the West to Southeast Asia?         My answer is, not necessarily.       Since new

technologies in the information, biomedical, genetic engineering, and energy production

industries are driven by the level of basic scientific knowledge, the key issue is not only the

speed with which the HPAEs will be able to develop a large cadre of advanced scientists. It

also turns on how rapidly these scientists can discover the most promising uncharted

frontiers of scientific research.

        The American experience shows that scaling such heights is not an easy task. The

United States began the process of rivaling Western Europe in natural science when it began

establishing post-graduate research programs in the U.S., beginning about 1875. During the

next quarter century it sent some of its most promising young scientists to Europe to study

with the great masters in Germany, France, and Great Britain. That policy yielded some

successes, as indicated by the occasional Nobel prizes awarded to Americans. Yet in such

fields as physics and chemistry, the Europeans remained dominant down to the outbreak of




                                                                                            10
World War II. It was not until some of the European master-scientists emigrated to the

United States, chased out of Europe by the Nazis, that the U.S. was able to gain the scientific

dominance that it achieved during the second half of the twentieth century.

       The conclusion I draw from that experience is that scientific training is still an

artisanal craft that requires not just a few years of contact between the masters and students,

but decades of patient interaction. It is not, of course, precluded that the HPAEs will do

better than the U.S. did. Perhaps the old masters in the West will become too narrow in the

range of issues they are willing to entertain and create new openings for younger minds. In

any case, it will be interesting to see how the race for scientific excellence unfolds in the

new millennium.

Note: Gross enrollment ratios are equal to the total enrollment of all ages in the school
      level divided by the population of the specific ages that correspond to the specific
