              Anticipated Inflation, the Frequency of Transactions
                      and the Slope of the Phillips Curve


                                    ABSTRACT



      This   paper examines the effects of expected inflation on the responsiveness

of output to nominal disturbances in the framework of a localized markets model.

The mechanism described in the theoretical part of the paper is that expected

inflation has a positive effect on the transaction frequency, which in turn

increases the flow of price information across markets. More information implies

less misperception of monetary shocks as relative shifts in excess demand,

resulting in lower sensitivity of real output to these socks.

      The empirical implication of this proposition — namely, that expected

inflation reduces the coefficient of nominal shocks in an output equation —

is   tested first using data across countries, and then with time series data

from the United States. The first test uses Lucas's and Alberro's estimates

of Phillips Curve coefficients from different countries and the corresponding

average inflation rates. The second test involves data from the post — World

War II period. It uses nominal rates of return on Treasury Bills and corporate

bonds as measures of anticipated inflation and Barro's estimates of unanticipated

money. In general, results in both tests provide support (stronger than expected)

for the implication of the theory.

      This paper was motivated by two independent hypotheses in the macro-

 economic literature. The first is Lucas's hypothesis on the slope of the

 Phillips Curve. Lucas's (1973) study indicated a negative correlation

 between the variance of the nominal disturbances and the responsiveness of

 real output to these disturbances. The idea advanced by Lucas is that the

 higher this variance, the more likely are agents to attribute locally observed

 price movements to general inflation rather than relative shifts in excess

 demand. Therefore, as the variance of nominal shocks increases, supply becomes

 less responsive to the general price movements generated by these disturbances.

      The second hypothesis is from the literature on the inventory approach

 to the demand for money (e.g. Baumol (1952), Tobin (1956), Barro (1970),

 Feige and Parkin (1971) and Grossman and Policano (1975)).    It can be summarized

 as the existence of a positive effect of expected inflation, or the nominal

 interest rate, on the frequency at which cash receipts are exchanged for com-

 modities or earning assets.

      In Lucas's model, the nonnueutral effect of nominal shocks occurs because

 of the lack of complete current information. Agents estimate the unobserved

 price level using an information set that contains lagged values of the nominal

aggregates. Now, if expected inflation affects the frequency of transactions,

it must also affect the frequency
                                    at which other prices are observed. Thus,
the structure of the information set--and hence the responsiveness of
                                                                      output to
nominal shocks--will depend also on the expected or systematic rate of

inflation.

     This paper was also motivated by the empirical observation that highly

volatile aggregate demand countries are also those with high average inflation

rates. Therefore, Lucas's finding that the Phillips Curve is more vertical

in those countries is also consistent
                                        with the informational effects of the
velocity of transactions.

     The theoretical part of this paper discusses the proposition that expected

inflation affects the slope of the Phillips Curve in two separate sections. The

first deals with the relationship between the rate of inflation and the frequency

of transactions in a deterministic framework. The model presented in Section I

summarizes previous results related to the frequency of transactions, especially

from Barro (1970) and Grossman and Policano (1975). The purpose of this Section

is to discuss these results in a general equilibrium framewDrk in which individuals

maximize utility from consumption and leisure, given a production function, trans-

action costs and government spending financed by money issue. Agents decide how

much to produce and sell, and for how long to accumulate the resulting inflow of

cash until a shopping trip is made. In this framework, the inflation

rate determines the relative price relevant for production, which is the

current price relative to the price level at the time of the next shopping

trip. The inflation rate also affects the decision about the frequency

of the visits to the other markets. This section also derives aggregate

demand and supply and characterizes the general equilibrium.

     The second section is a version of Lucas's and 3arro's (1976) localized

market models with partial information. The agents are assumed here to behave

similarily as in the deterministic model; they face a current price which is

deflated by a future (expected) price of the consumption bundle, and accumulate

cash until these goods are purchased0 In this section however, the frequency of

transactions is treated as exogenais. It is viewed as determined in a similar way

as discussed in the previous section. The focus here is on the informational

implications of the frequency of transactions and its relationship with the

responsiveness of real output to nominal shocks.

     Section III reports empirical tests of the hypothesis that expected

inflation diminishes the effect of nominal shocks on output. A first test

uses Lucas's and Alberro's (1980) estimates of Phillips Curve coefficients

for different countries and the corresponding average inflation rates. A

second test involves times series data from the United States after World War II,

using nominal rates of return on Treasury Bills and corporate bonds as measures

of anticipated inflation and Barro's (1980) estimates of unanticipated money.

     In general, the results in both tests indicate a fairly substantial

negative correlation between anticipated inflation and the coefficients

relating output to nominal shocks.

Section I.       Inflation and the Frequency of Transactions

      Consider an agent producing and selling a good,or a service, whose rate of

production is a function of the input of labor. With the continuous stream

of supply, the agent accumulates cash that depreciates until it is exchanged

for consumption goods. A key assumption is that this exchange, or shopping,"

involves a cost. These transaction costs--assumed to be independent

of the amount purchased--can be viewed as the time or direct expenses involved

in traveling to other markets.                Given these costs and the rate of depreciation

of the currency, there is a tradeoff between economizing on shopping trips and

minimizing the effects of the depreciation of the currency received.

       The individuals, who have infinite lives and zero rate of time preference,

maximize utility from consumption and leisure:


       U =   U(C,L)                              U, U1 > 0,               U, U11 <   0



C and L are the uniform, instantaneous flows of consumption and leisure respec-

tively. C can be viewed as a composite good whose components have constant

relative prices resulting from a steady state equilibrium.

       The production function that expresses the relationship between the input of

labor and the rate of production and sale——which occur simultaneously--of good S is


       S     (1/a) (H - L)


where a is a positive constant and H is the ceiling to the flow of labor. At

time t the individual sells S at the price P(t), which grows at the instantaneous

rate ii.     The purchasing power of the cash accumulated between two shopping

trips is



                           T+ i

                                  SP(t)dt

                                              -.4 -




where    P(T+T) is the general price level at the end of the period of length T
that begins at date T. In the steady state equilibrium all prices grow at
the   same rate, namely

                                                                        (t-T)
        (1)   P(T   +   T) = P(T)eT          and P(t)           P(T)e



        Given the shopping cost b, the consumption flow per unit of time is


                                  T+i
                                                      -

                                      f SP(t)dt



Substituting      (1)   into    (2) yields
                         T+i

    Utility is niaximized with respect to the shopping period                                and the

supply level S. The constraint that supply has a uniform level over time

is a somewhat restrictive assumption made for simplicity. In a more general

setup, the higher real return on supplying closer to the purchasing time would

induce an increasing pattern of supply between two shopping points. A corner

solution of selling only just before buying can be ruled out if it is assumed

that the marginal utility of leisure becomes extremely large as leisure approachesr

zero, and that it becomes extremely small as leisure approaches H. These

assumptions would insure a positive supply at all times, producing the same

type of tradeoff between the costs of transacting and that of holding cash.

Therefore, given the focus of the analysis here, nothing essential is lost

by adopting a uniformity constraint on S.

     An additional restrictive assumption is that production and sale take

place simultaneously. With respect to services, this is no constraint. Re-

garding commodities one could argue that under inflationary conditions, agents

can do better by producing during the period and selling only at its end.

However, this plan would not be optimal if the act of selling also

requires the input of labor. Then, if the marginal utility from leisure

behaves as mentioned above, sales will have some dispersion over the period.

Sales close to production could be rationalized also on the basis of un-

included factors like storage costs or risk of damage, spoiling etc.'

      Equation (5) means that, given S, the stream of consumption is maximized

by equalizing the marginal benefit from enlarging the shopping period,--which

reduces the transaction costs--with the marginal depreciation costs. Equation (6)

expresses the standard optimal labor supply condition that the utility from

the additional consumption obtainable by a marginal increase in labor supply

equals the marginal disutilityfrOm reducing leisure.

Comparative Statics


       The next step is to see how changes in the main exogenous parameter, ,
                                                                                  on T

 yields

This expression is negative from (A.6) and (A.lO) in appendix A. This is a

standard result which says that the higher the rate at which cash receipts

depreciate, the sooner they will be exchanged for commodities (or real valued

assests).

         Differentiating now equation (6) with respect to S and      Ti
                                                                              yields

        Since U

                                                                                  SiT

negative or positive according to whether the substitutjon or income

Since the denominators are positive from (1.9),       the signs of dT/d and dS/du
depend on the expressions in the numerators. Except for U          all the cross

derivatives are unambiguously negative. Consider first dt/dii.        If the income

effect on labor supply is stronger than the substitution effect--U5 < O-dT/di

is unambiguously negative. In this case, an increase in inflation induces

more supply, which means more cash accumulation. The depreciation costs in-

crease and therefore agents transact sooner. This effect reinforces the

standard one expressed by Ut. Also when U         =   , dT/d   is unambiguously

negative. However, if the substitution effect is stronger than the income

effect--U   < 0--, the sign   of   dt/dT becomes ambiguous. It will be assumed

that in the "normal" case dT/dT is negative.

     Consider now dS/dn. If U        < 0, the partial effect of iT on S is negative,

as seen before. However, dS/sii includes the offsetting term U U which
                                                                   ST TIT

comes from the negative partial effect of inflation on t; when T      declines,
the relative price increases inducing more supply.2

     If U   and U   are sufficiently negative, both d/d7r and d-r/dn can also

be negative. In this case, the depreciation costs have a stronger effect on

the frequency of transactions than the reduced flow of supply, and the substi-

tution effect on supply is stronger than both the income effect and the off-

setting shortening of the shopping period.



Aggregate Demand, Supply and Equilibrium.

     This part of the section deals with the equilibrium of an economy composed

by individuals who behave as seen above. Given the setup used here, general

and market equilibrium conditions are the same. This discussion provides some
                                         —9-




foundations for the specification of commodity demand adopted

in the next section.

        The demand side of the commodity market is composed by those agents who

are currently in their shopping trips, and the government--which finances its

purchases by issuingnewmoney. Government services are assumed not to

affect the utility of the public. These can be seen as police or defense

services that are designed to neutralize negative effects on utility from

crime, foreign threats, etc.

        The private nominal demand at time t, denoted by M(t, T), is determined

by the cash accumulated for a period of length T times the number of individuals

currently purchasing


        fl(t,T)           SP(x) dx = NSP(t)    (l_eT)
                   t-T



where N is the total number of agents in the economy. Government spending is

assumed to require a constant growth rate, p,         of   the money stock, M(t).   Thus,
aggregate nominal demand is given by

        Aggregate supply in nominal terms is NSP(t), and in equilibrium it

       Since conunoditiesandmoney are the only two goods in the model, commodity

market clearing implies equality of demand and supply of money, and vice versa.

The demand for money, Md(t) equals the summation of the cash receipts will-

ingly held by all agents


               =
                       f(t,T')       dT'   =     NSP(t)

The equtlity M(t) =                M(t)    implies that M(t) and P(t) must grow at the same

rate: r = p.

       Also, from jd(t) =             M(t)       follows

                   2
                       T          = NSP(t)

This equality is identical to the commodity market clearing condition and

       Finally         one can compute the effect of a chaige in p on velocity.

Differentiating V(p) with respect to p yields

       The exact form of V/p and V/?t are reported in (A.12) and (A.13) in

appendix A. V/Bp represents the direct effect of inflation on real balances;

the higher the inflation rate, the lower is the current real value of the cash

accumulated for some period. The second term is the standard relationship

between the frequency of transactions and the velocity of money circulation.



Section II. The frequency of transactions and the Phillips Curve

     On the basis of the analysis in Section I, which dealt with expected

inflation and the frequency of transactions, this section focuses on the

informational implications of the transaction frecuency and its relation-

ship with the effects of money movements on real output in a stochastic

environment. The framework of this discussion is a multimarket model with

partial current information of the type used by Lucas (1973) and Barro (1976)

arid incoorates the basic features of the economy discussed in section I.

The agents, located in different markets, sell goods or services and     accumulate

cash for a period of time of length r .     Then they make a trip to the other

markets to purchase consumption goods.

     The freq'ncy of transactions is exogenous in this discussion, but it

is viewed as determined optimally in a similar fashion as discussed in
             3
Section I.       The comparative statics exercise carried out below by changing

T   is   rationalized by an underlying change in expected inflation in the

opposite direction.

         In this framework, the future price level is not known with certainty

and agents form their optimal forecasts using all available information,

which includes neither current prices--other than the local one--nor the current

money stock. The (log of the) relative price on which supply decisions are

                                 P(z) is the local price at time t and       is

shopping time (1 i <          t).   The information set that conditions the expecta-

tion contains Pt t+i.' which is the price level that was observed by agents

the last time they visited the other markets.

      The importance of the trade period in this context relies primarily on

its informational implications. The more often agents visit other markets,

the more recent and relevant is the information on which they base their

expectations.


      Turn now to the specification of the model. The supply behavior in

market for commodity z at time t is given in log-linear terms by


      (10) y(z) = h   +               —            +            a>0
                          cz[P(z)         EPt+]

h is a constant term which can be seen as related to

H and b of section I. a is the relative price

elasticity of supply. The assumption that a is positive can be interpreted

as a net pitive partial effect of the relative price on supply, that is,

holding constant the trade cycle, the relative price and supply move in the

same direction.               is a random productivity shock specific to z.   I will

return below to the process associated with this term and to the details of

the expectation EP
                   t +1

      The log-linear demand for commodity z at time t follows the general

form of equation (9) in section I.


                          -
      (11) y(z) = M            P(z)   +   log(V)   +




     is the log of the money stock (divided by the number of markets) and V is
Mt
the fraction of the current money stock being exchanged for commodities, both

 by shopping agents and by the government. This functional form also corresponds,
                                  —13—




approximately, to a Cobb-Douglas utility function with equal shares for all

commodities. c(t) is a random term associated with shifts in preferences

or in the pattern of government spending.

     Turn now to the stochastic properties of the xiodel. Money growth follows

the process


     Mt _Mi p+m                   p   >0

mat is, the money stock grows at a combination af a constant rate p and a

random term in of zero mean and variance 2. lbr convenience ji the calcu-

rations, it is assumed that m is serially uncorrelated.4 The fraction V

which is treated as a function of p would in fact depend positively also on

mr__if the new money is spent by the government. However, since demand depends

on m through M, the model approximately captures that effect.
                                        d             s
     The other stochastic term involves E(z) and            The excess demand

relative shock, s(z) (z) -               is assumed to follow amoving-average
                                 e(z)
process of order n



     (z) = Etn(Z)     + ... +




where the series Et(z) is serially wicorrelated and has zero mean and

common variance       The serial correlation in c*(z) expresses the
                  E                               t

assumption that it takes n periods to arbitrage away shifts in relative

excess demand. It will be assumed that n > r.

     Turn now to the structure of the information set available to agents.

Suppliers and demanders have access to different information. ents who
                                         -14-




are currently in their shopping trips observe all prices. ki the other hand,

suppliers observe only the local price; their information set is the following




    {Mtk. t-T+1' t-T+1-l'                  P(z), Pti(z),
                                                                        }


             denotes the expectation of                   conditional on this information set.

Monetary statistics are published continuosly with a lag of length k, where

k >> r.    The most recent observation on the price level is P                      .,
                                                                               t— T+1
                                                                                         which   cor-
responds to the last shopping trip. Additionally, information on all previous

prices are also obtained at that time.5 Finally, the current and past local

prices are known.

     It is assumed that the trade periods of agents located in one market are

synchronized.     This assumption simplifies a great deal the computation of the

conditional expectations and the solution of the model, but it presents some

problems that are discussed later. The trade periods of producers of dif-

ferent commodities will in general not coincide. At each point in time

during a period of length T a different population of agents will be visiting

other markets. Thus, according to the timing of their shopping trips agents

can be classified into T groups. These groups may be seen as having the same

size because arbitrage of different real prices of the consumption bundle will

generate a uniform flow of demand.

     The solution of the model follows the same procedure used by Lucas (1973)

and Barro (1976). First, fromp.ations (10) and                   (11)   clearing of market z

       Given the log-linearity of the model, the solution for the average price

level Pt will have the form

assigned      a priori different coefficients according to their date of nccurrec.

The date of the shock is relevant for its effect on                                    because past price

levels      are known--and money shocks inferred--by a larger fraction of agen:s
than   more recent ones.

       Updating now              from (13) i periods        and taking the              expectation operator

         The neutrality of fully perceived money appears in the unity value for

                      ir_1 and the ki term in              This means that the part of the

current money stock whicbisknown by all agents in the economy--either from

public announcement, from observations on past price levels, or by the knowledge

that money grows at an average rate of p--has a one-to-one effect on the price

level. The terma(T+l)/4p+log(V) in                        represents the effect of expected

money growth and          inflation   on velocity and       the      current price level.

neutral effect because it is unperceived by those agents--the less informed

at time t--who visited other markets before T-l periods. The next coefficient

is Tr         ,   which corresnonds to in           .   Since   it         0 < 1, ii         < IT         .   The

smaller coefficient for m                   is due to the larger fraction of the economy

that cannot infer inT+3. The fraction consists of the agents who shopped

at t-T+l and t-T+2. In general, the more recent the shock the fewer the

agents who can infer it and thus the smaller its effects on the price level.

The contemporaneous m is known only by those agents who are currently in

their shopping trips and thus it has the smallest coefficient.6

        A full solution of ii. in terms of the exogenous parameters is not computed.

However, this solution is computable since one can substitute for '11712 in

and then both expressions in 11714 and so on.



A More Detailed Interpretation of the Money Shocks' Coefficients.

        The general form of n. in (21) represents the average effect of                                           in

the economy. Since agents--and in this specification, also markets--can be

classified into groups according to the date of their last shopping trip, '71.
                                     —20-




averages the different effects of in        across   these categories. Consider first

the agents whose last trip was before t-j-l periods. They cannot infer

but they know that at the time of their next shopping trip--t+T-j-l--all other

agents will know          This is so because at any date, all money growth from

i-i periods in the past and backwards can be inferred by all. Therefore,

their average estimate of EP        in this group includes 3m .. This is
                            t+T—J+l                          t-J

their (average) current best estimate of       and is expected to be neutral

                                                                        itself in the
at the time of their next shopping trip. The 3 appearing by

n. expression comes from the effect of m            on these markets.
                                              t—J
      Turn now to the agents in the t-j-2, t-j-3, ...,        t-T+l   groups, which

cannot infer         either. Since they are closer to their next visit

to the other markets, their corresponding price expectations, EPt÷Tj_2

                          will take into account that at those future times
EPt+T_j_3, ...,    EPt,
will still be unperceived by some other agents. In other words, the effect

of        on these markets is determined by, first, the shock being locally

unperceived, and second, the knowledge of the local agents that at the time

they will be purchasing other goods,              will be partially unperceived.

 Take for example the t-j-2 group. Their next trip is at t+T_j_2. At that

 time nit. will still be unperceived by one group. Thus, the effect of

 °"             is expected to be the same as that of 1T2 °              and given by

                          which appears in the term           in it..    The terms

 it130,
          ••'         reflect   similar considerations with respect to the

 traders in the t-j-3, ...,     t_T+l   groups.

       Finally, the agents who visited the other markets at t-j, t-j+l, ...,            t
  do infer m. They also know that by the time of their next trips--at

                                correspondingly—-all other agents will be able to infer
 t+T-j, t+it-j+l, ...,   t+T,

          For both reasons the effect of                              on these j+l groups is neutral

and   this    is reflected in the j+l term in the .                        expression.


Solution for Aggregate Output and the Phillips Curve.

        If P(z) is the price that clears the market for commodity z, an expres-

sion for output of z is obtained from the demand function in equation (11)

The pattern of the coefficients of the money shocks is declining with the

length of the lag. This declining effect of money on output mirrors the

opposite effect on the price level.

         Turn now to the main point in this section, which is to discuss the

effects of a change in i                     on the stochastic behavior of output. Consider an

exogenous increase in the frequency of transactions from one every r periods

to   one every T-l periods. In the new equilibrium, the resulting coefficients
of the money shocks are

Compare the coefficients in (23) tc those in (21). The less informed
traders in the shortened trade period case can infer int—T+2 , and                                therefore
it     has now a neutral effect--TI'2 =                          1, while previously TIt-2 < 1.    The

variable is now unperceived only by the less informed group, while previously

both the traders who shopped at t--r+l and t-t+2 could not infer it. A larger

 fraction of the economy has now knowledge of mT+3 and thus its effect is

 closer to neutrality: ¶3 >                         It3           This inequality can be easily verified

 using ¶20 < 1. For the same reason, all the new coefficients in (23) will
 be larger than those in (21), namely


 (24)             i   > i.              j = r—2,r—l,        ...,      0
                                           —23—




A formal argument to show that these inequalities hold is made in appendix B.

        A general interpretation of this result is that the shorter the trade

period, agents possess--onaverage-_more recent information about the price

level and thus, they can estimate the current value of the money stock

more accurately. Hence, misperception of nominal shocks for relative

shifts is reduced, producing a more neutral effect of monetary disturbances.7

This implies a weaker correlation between money shocks and real output in

equation (22), which can be seen as an inverse Phillips Curve type of relation-

ship.



Aggregation of Ouptut and Money Growth Over Time.

        One can define also a single coefficient as the slope of the inverse

Phillips Curve by aggregating (22) over a longer period. Since i is the

length of a production and purchase of consumption goods cycle, one can

imagine the magnitude of the time unit--indexed by t--as short relative

to the basic periods empirically used to investigate output fluctuations

(e.g. a quarter or a year). Thus, it seems meaningful to define a period

of length T (T > T) and to consider the deviations of the output flow during

this longer period relative to its normal level. In percentage units, this

deviation is approximately equal to


            + ... +      ;_T+lIT =                                        +

Consider now the relationship between the movement of output during the

T-period that ends at time t aid the deviation of money growth from its

trend during the same T_period__m +                    ... +              This monetary variable

is also the unexpected money growth for this T-period as to time t-T.

Also, one caii calculate the effect of the lagged T-period money shock on out-

put. The slope coefficient in the regression of                                          on (m+          Tht_T+l)

under   trade periods of length -r            can be interpreted as the slope of the inverted

Phillips         Curve.   This coefficient is calculated as

        Define      now ITT    as the similar regression coefficient under trade cycles

of length T-l. It has the same form of it                      in   (26) but with the     -s replaced

by the Tr!-s. Since ii!            > -ii. for   all the relevant j-s it holds rr' <           it.   In

other words, the correlation between output and monetary movements during

periods of length T decline with the frequency of transactions.

        Finally, Lucas's hypothesis on the slope of the Phillips Curve also

holds in this extension of his model. Each . depends positively on e, which

in turn is a positive function of ct. Therefore, it decreases                            in

Section III. Empirical Tests


a.     Data across countries.


        A first test of the proposition that higher inflation rates reduce the

sensitivity of output to aggregate shocks can be carried out using Lucas's

(1973, tables 1 and 2) and Alberro's (1980, table 1 and table 2--second column)

estimates of an inverted Phillips Curve coefficients and data on average infla-

tion rates and variances of nominal income across countries. First, their

results on the Lucas hypothesis can be summarized by regressing 1—-the estimate

of the Phillips Curve slope coefficients in country i--on o--the variance

of the change in nominal income in country i. Using Lucas's coefficients for

eighteen countries in the period 1952-1967 the resulting correlation is


         (26) .1 = .58          -   195o           +   unexplained    term
                        (.05)       (55)X1
 where the numbers in parenthesis are the standard errors of the coefficients.
 Alberro estimated the n. coefficients for 49 countries--including the 18 in

 Lucas's sample--using the period l953_l9698 The estimated correlation using

 these data is almost identical to that reported in (26)

         One can test now the correlation between the estimates of the Phillips

 Curve slopes and DP.--the average inflation rate in country i. Given the

 Lucas hypothesis, in order to isolate a partial correlation between inflation

 and the slope coefficients, the variances must be held constant. An exercise

 of this type can be carried out by regressing . on both DP and                  Using

     Lucas's estimates the resulting equation is



               = .64 - 2.5DP.        -.   6,60         +   unexplained   term.

The coefficients have the expected sign but the standard errors are large.

Since the F-statistic is well above the 99% critical value, the standard

errors indicate the presence of a strong correlation between DP. and a.

When Alberro's data is used, the estimated equation is


           =       .63
               3.4DP. + 8.8a

Here the coefficient of DP. is significantly different from zero, while the

coefficient of a                       is not.9 One can also test the existence of this correlation

among the relatively moderate inflation countries by excluding Argentina and

Paraguay from Lucas's sample, and Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Indonesia, Korea and

Uruguay from Alberro's sample. The results from the first sample show lack of

                                                                     both on         and

 However, using the stable price countries in Alberro's sample, the results

 are more in line with those reported previously

                                                      —27—




       In general these results provide support (stronger than expected) for

the hypothesis being tested. With respect tothe lack of correlation between

  and                  one can speculate that it may be related to the errors-in-variables

bias contained in                         Lucas's and Alberro's equations were estimated using

data on the change in nominal income rather than the unexpected change. If,

for example, velocity in each country is constant the variable used is m +                                    where

      is the expected deviation of money growth from the constant i.                          Then, ignoring .

the    lagged output variable included in their equations, one can represent the

relationship between                      and the "true" r. as

increases in 2, If this ratio is the sane across countries, the

if this ratio increases with a                        in some segments of the a     range, it is

possible that the overall correlation between                           and o may be negligible


b. Time series data from the United States


        A second test of the proposition presented in this paper uses annual ti;ic

series data from the United States after World Var II. The test consists

in the following: the output equation obtained by Barro (1980) is reestimated

allowing the coefficients of unanticipated money to depend on a measure of

anticipated inflation. The modified equation is

  is   the log of real GNP, the DMR-s are Barro's estimates of unanticipated
                                                                       of
money growth, Gt is real federal purchases, t is time, DP is a measure

the inflation rate anticipated at time t, and u. is a random term.

       The hypothesis to be tested is whether the b coefficient is positive

                                                 form of (27) is a linear
and whether a1 and a2 remain positive. The

approximation expressing the hypothesis that the higher the expected inflation

rate, the lower the effect of the DMR-s--because they are sooner perceived

as money. To preview the results of this test, the statistical significance

of the coefficient b turns out to be very sensitive to the starting year

of the sample.

       The estimation was carried out using the 3-month Treasury Bill and the

Aaa corporate bonds nominal rates of return as measures of expected inflation.

 If the movements in these interest rates are caused mainly by changes in

 inflationary expectations, the Treasury Bill rate represents the short term

 expected inflation (Fama (1975)) and the bonds rate reflects expectations

 over the more distant future. Which of these variables is more adequate

 in this context may be related to the existence and importance of costs of

 adjusting the transaction frequency.    If these costs are relatively low

 a short-term rate is more adequate.    If these costs are relatively high,

 the transaction frequency would be affected mainly by expectations of

 prolonged periods of inflation. Given no a-priori presumptiot about these
                                                              using each one of
 adjustment costs, the equation was estimated separately

 these interest rates. The variable used in the equations referred to in the

                                            which--from the point of view of the
 paper is the Treasury Bill rate, RTt,

  theory being tested--fits somewhat better.      Under the assumption that the

  DMR-s are exogenous, the endogeneity of the interest rate does not seem to

     Assuming normally-distributed errors, the equation is estimated using

a non-linear maximum likelihood criterion. First, when the sample used

the 1946-1978 period, b turns out to be insignificantly different from

zero (see table 1, line 1). Speculating that pegging of the Treasury Bill

rates until the Treasury-Federal Reserve Accord of 1951 may be affecting

the validity of the interest rates as measures of expected inflation, the

equation was reestimated over the sample 1953-1978. The resulting equation

is

where the numbers in parenthesis are asymptotic standard errors. The coefficient

b appears herewith the expected sign and with a relatively small standard

error (t-ratio of 2.9).10

     However, a closer examination indicates that the poor results obtained

in the entire 1946-1978 sample may be due mainly to the observations of 1951

and 1952, which correspond to the Korean War. If only these two observations

are deleted, the estimated b coefficient is 8.2 with a standard error of

4.1 (see table 1, line (2)). According to this result, it seems that the

pegging of the interest rate may not be the main problem that affects the

estimate of b in the 1946-1978 sample, but the Korean War years, which

correspond to a high level of government spending. Presently, I do not have

an explanation of this observation. It could be related to a misspecification

of the government spending effects, either on output or in the money growth

equation that generated the DMR-s. In any event, in the period beginning
in 1953, the negative correlation between RT and the effect of the DMR-s

on output is fairly substantial.

     I also found interesting to examine whether this correlation has anything

to do with the oil price shock, which is accompanied by the highest RT value

in the sample-- .079 in 1974. To do that, equation (28) was reestimated over

the sample interrupted in 1973, and then again deleting only the observations

of 1974 and 1975. Both equations--reported in table 1, lines (4) and (5)--

show an even stronger negative effect of RT on the coefficients of the money

shocks than that appearing in equation (28). This suggests that the effect

showing in equation (28) is not related to the oil price shock but, on the

contrary, is somewhat obscured by   it.

Concluding Remarks

     This paper examined the effects of expected inflation on the reponsivefleSS
                                                   described in sections I and II
of output to nominal disturbances. The mechanism

is that expected inflation has a positive effect on the transaction frequency,

which in turn increases the flow of price information across markets. More
                                                     shocks as relative shifts in
information implies less misperception of monetary

excess demand, resulting in lower sensitivity of real output to these shocks.
                                                              that expected infla-
     The empirical implication of this proposition__namely,

tion reduces the coefficient of nominal shocks in an output equation--was tested

first using data across countries, and then with time series data for the United

 States. Overall the results in both tests provide support for this hrnlica-

tion of the theory. The interpretation of these results as supporting the

 specific mechanism described in the first two sections is related to two

critical assumptions First, as in the equilibrium business cycles litcrature,

to which this analysis is an extension, the model involves the assumption that

agents cannot observe the current value of the money stock. If its value is

contemporaneously known, the frequency of price observations--and the money

shocks--does not have any effect on output. Secondly, the analysis excluded

earning assets. Anticipated inflation does not have to affect the transaction

frequency in the commodity markets if there are assets whose return is associated

with anticipated inflation. However, this effect may still exist if financial

 transactions costs preclude agents from using these assets between shopping trips,

 or if the nominal return on the available assets is, for some reason, sluggish to

 shifts in the inflation rates.

      Summarizing, the theoretical mechanism described in the paper seems

 consistent with the empirical results, which indicate a substantial negative

 correlation between anticipated or average inflation rates and the effect of

 nominal disturbances on output.

Since the right hand side of (B.2) is positive, this inequality implies (B.l).

      (B.2) is now established using induction. Consider first the difference between

 t- 2      and x_2.

                 —                    =        (T-l)ci.
                                                             (1—Ox'        )

 Thus, (B.2) holds for i= t-2. It has to be shown now that if

     1Storing costs would affect also the behavior of the individual as a

consumer. The higher these costs the lower the optimal stock of consumption

goods, implying a shorter transactions period.

     2Thjs effect involves only substitution because at the maximum

                         aC/aT = 0

     3The discussion abstracts from the effects of differential cash flows

accruing to different agents on their trade cycles.

     4This assumption may be seen as unrealistic in the present context, since

the length of the time unit is short. However, I do not believe that the

results would be affected by introducing serial correlation in m.

     5lmagine each current price posted above the crossed price of last

period.

          is assumed that production in these agents' markets continues at

that time. Imagine a shopper-spouse visiting other markets while the

producer-spouse continues producing in the local market.

     7At this point it is appropriate to return and discuss the assumption

made earlier, that all agents in one market follow symchronized transaction

cycles. This specification has the undesired implication that individual

prices do not follow a smooth pattern--as the average price level does. At

the time of the shopping trip, the local price jumps due to the change in

the relevant price deflator from Pt to t+T A more appropriate specification

would be to allow producers in one location to shop at scattered dates. I do

not believe, however, that the results for the aggregate economy in this case

would differ qualitatively from those obtained here. With scattered shopping

trips, agents can learn from the local price something about the price obser-

vations of others. However, given the unobserved relative shock c(z), they

still have the problem of estimating the relative and nominal shocks

affecting the local price. The confusion between nominal and real shocks

in this case will also diminish when the transaction frequency increases

because agents will be able to infer more about the money shocks0

       9As in Alberro's calculations, Indonesia was excluded from the sample.

 If Indonesia is included, the coefficient of DP. remains positive and

 significant--with a higher t-ratio--but the coefficient of .still positive,

 becomes statistically significant.

 different from zero.
