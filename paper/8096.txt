I. Introduction and Summary 1

       Variations in productivity growth have proven one of the most durable puzzles in

macroeconomics. After growing rapidly for a quarter century, productivity came to a virtual halt in

the early 1970s. There was no shortage of explanations for the productivity-growth slowdown. The

explanations included rising energy prices, high and unpredictable inflation, rising tax rates, growing

government, burdensome environmental and health regulation, declining research and development,

deteriorating labor skills, depleted inventive possibilities, and societal laziness.

       These explanations seemed increasingly inadequate as inflation fell, tax rates were cut,

regulatory burdens stabilized, government‚Äôs share output fell, research and development and patents

granted grew sharply, energy prices fell back to pre-1973 levels, and a burst of invention in the new

economy and other sectors fueled an investment boom in the 1990s. One of the major puzzles in the

mid-1990s revolved around the inability of increasingly sophisticated and powerful computers and

software to give an upward boost to productivity growth. This puzzle was expressed in the famous

Solow paradox, ‚ÄúComputers are everywhere except in the productivity statistics.‚Äù Notwithstanding

the ubiquitous computer, through thin and thick labor-productivity growth seemed to be on a stable

track of slightly over 1 percent per year.

       However, in the late 1990s, productivity growth rebounded sharply. Over the period from

1995 to mid-2000, productivity growth in the business sector grew at a rate close to that in the pre-

1973 period. The causes of the rebound were widely debated, but at least part was clearly due to

astonishing productivity growth in the ‚Äúnew economy‚Äù sectors of information and communications.

       The present study is the last of three papers devoted to developing new data and methods for

measuring productivity growth and examining the extent and sources of the current productivity

rebound. In addition to examining recent productivity behavior, the current study adds a few new

features to the analysis. First, it examines the welfare-theoretic basis of productivity measures and

proposes an ‚Äúideal‚Äù index of productivity growth. Second, it lays out a different way of decomposing

productivity growth which divides aggregate productivity trends into factors that increase average

productivity growth from the changing shares of the sizes of different sectors. Third, we develop

an alternative way of measuring aggregate and industrial productivity based on industrial data built

up from the income side rather than the product side of the accounts. By relying on the industrial

data, we can focus on different definitions of output and get sharper estimates of the sources of

productivity growth. Fourth, by working with the new industrial data, we can make more accurate

adjustments for the contribution of the ‚Äúnew economy‚Äù than has been the case in earlier studies.

Finally, this new data set allows us to create a new economic aggregate, which we call ‚Äúwell-

measured output,‚Äù that allows us to remove those sectors where output is poorly measured or

measured by inputs.

       Because the study is heavily methodological and data-intensive, we summarize the approach

and major results in this introductory section.

       1. The present study introduces a new approach to measuring industrial productivity. It

develops an income-side data base, currently available to 1997‚Äì98, on labor productivity relying on

data that are published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). The data are internally

consistent in that both inputs and outputs are income-side measures of value added, whereas the

usual productivity measures combine expenditure-side output measures with income-side input

measures. The advantage of the unified income-side measures is that they present a consistent set

of industrial accounts. The disadvantages are that they are only available for the period 1977‚Äì98 and

that they do not contain a set of capital accounts, so we can only examine labor productivity.


                                                  
          2. We have constructed a set of labor productivity measures for four different definitions of

output:

          ‚Ä¢ GDP from the income side

          ‚Ä¢ BLS‚Äôs business sector output from the income side

          ‚Ä¢ A new measure called ‚Äúwell-measured output,‚Äù which includes only those sectors for which

           output is relatively well measured

          ‚Ä¢ The ‚Äúnew economy‚Äù as defined below

          3. The constructed measures of labor productivity are reasonably consistent with the most

widely studied measure, the BLS‚Äôs measure of labor productivity in the business sector. Over the

period of investigation, the difference between the labor-productivity growth rate estimates of the

income-side and product-side constructs is 0.05 percentage points per year. However, in the last

three years, productivity from the income-side series grew more than 1 percentage point more

rapidly, primarily because of the movement in the statistical discrepancy between output and income

side measures.

          4. There has clearly been a rebound in productivity growth since 1995. The rebound is found

in all three sectoral definitions developed for this study. The labor productivity acceleration in the

last three years of the period (1996‚Äì98) relative to the 1978‚Äì95 period was 1.2 percentage points for

GDP, 1.8 percentage points for business sector, and 2.1 percentage points for well-measured output.

          5. We have developed a new technique for decomposing changes in labor-productivity

growth between different sources. This decomposition identifies a pure productivity effect (which

is a fixed weighted average of the productivity growth rates of different industries); the Denison

effect (which captures the effect of changing shares of employment on aggregate productivity); and

the Baumol effect (which captures the interaction between the differences in productivity growth and


                                                   
the changing hours shares of different industries over time). Total productivity growth is the sum

of these three effects.

        6. Our estimates show that the pure productivity effect in recent years has been substantially

above total productivity growth. For example, in the business sector for the period 1996‚Äì98, total

labor-productivity growth has been 3.19 percent per year while the pure productivity effect was 3.61

percent per year. The difference was primarily due to the Baumol effect, with a rising share of hours

in services accompanying slow labor-productivity growth in services. The Baumol and Denison

effects are relatively small for well-measured output.

        7. The first companion paper to this study provides a rigorous definition of the appropriate

measure of productivity growth from a welfare-theoretic point of view. The present paper applies

the ideal measure to the new data set. We find that the ideal measure is higher than other commonly

used measures of labor-productivity growth in every period. The differences are relatively small in

the most recent period, but they are substantial in earlier periods. On average, the ideal or welfare-

theoretic measure over the 1978‚Äì98 period is about 0.2 percentage points per year higher than the

other measures.

        8. One key question is the contribution of the new economy to the productivity rebound. For

the purpose of this study, we define the new economy as machinery, electric equipment, telephone

and telegraph, and software. These sectors grew from 3 percent of real GDP in 1977 to 9 percent

of real GDP in 1998.

        9. Productivity growth in the new economy sectors has made a significant contribution to

economy-wide productivity growth. In the business sector over the last three years, labor-

productivity growth excluding the new economy sectors was 2.24 percent per year as compared to

3.19 percent per year including the new economy. Of the 1.82 percentage point increase in labor-


                                                  
productivity growth in the last three years relative to the earlier period, 0.65 percentage point was

due to the new economy sectors. The contribution of the new economy was slightly larger for well-

measured output because that sector is smaller than the business economy.

       10. Which sectors within the new economy have contributed most to the productivity

rebound? The major contributors have been manufacturing electric and nonelectric machinery, the

major subsectors of which are computers and semiconductors. These two sectors, which constituted

under 4 percent of nominal GDP, contributed to 0.60 percentage points of the 2.39 percent per year

GDP productivity growth in the 1996‚Äì98 period.

       11. Finally, to what extent has there been an acceleration of productivity growth outside the

new economy? For all three output measures, there has been a substantial upturn in non-new-

economy productivity growth. After stripping out the new economy sectors, the productivity

acceleration was 0.54 percentage points for total GDP, 0.65 percentage points for business output,

and 1.18 percentage points for well-measured output. It is clear that the productivity rebound is not

narrowly focused in a few new-economy sectors.



II. Review of Concepts and Data

       This section reviews the methods and data used in productivity studies.



       Productivity Accounting

       The first issue reviewed is the appropriate approach to measuring labor productivity. This

section summarizes the results presented in the first companion paper to this one.2 Consider

aggregates of output (Xt), composite inputs (St), and total factor or labor productivity (At = Xt/St).

These aggregates are the sum (or chained indexes) of industry output, inputs, and productivity (Xit,

Sit , and Ait ). Aggregate productivity is calculated as:

(1)     $W ' j $LWZLW
                L

where wit = share of total inputs devoted to industry i, that is, ZLW ' 6LW 'M6MW . With some

manipulation, this becomes:

                    L               L                            L

where Rit are productivity relatives equal to Ait /At ;   1t   = Xit /Xt , which is the share of industry i in

nominal output; and sit = (Sit/St)(Xit‚Ä¢1/Xt‚Ä¢1)/(Sit‚Ä¢1/St‚Ä¢1), which is approximately equal to      1t   for small

times steps and smooth series. For small time steps, equation (2) becomes:

(2N)    J $ W ' j FLNJ $LW % j FLW & FLN J $LW ' j 5LW&)ZLW
                    L                L                               L

        Equations (2) and (2N) show that aggregate productivity growth can be broken into three

components: a pure, fixed-weight productivity term which uses fixed base-year expenditure or output

weights (‚Äúpure productivity effect‚Äù), a term that reflects the difference between current weights and

base-year weights (the ‚ÄúBaumol effect‚Äù), and a third term which reflects the interaction between

changing weights and relative productivity levels in different sectors (the ‚ÄúDenison effect‚Äù).



        Welfare-theoretic measures of productivity growth

        Another important and neglected issue in productivity studies is the appropriate measure of

productivity growth. Measurements of prices and output have increasingly turned to welfare or

utility theory as a basis for the concepts. Using this approach, we have examined the question of the

ideal welfare-theoretic measure of productivity in an economy with many sectors experiencing



                                                    
varying rates of productivity growth. The major result is that the ideal measure of productivity

growth is a weighted average of the productivity growth rates of different sectors, as shown by the

following equation:

(3)     J 5 W ' FWJ $W % FWJ $W % √£ % FQWJ $QW 

The important point is that the indexes used in the appropriate measure are chain indexes of

productivity growth rather than differences in the growth rates or indexes of output and inputs.

       We can relate this result to the equations in the last section. It turns out that a welfare-

theoretic based measure of productivity growth should include only the first two terms of equations

(2) or (2‚Äô). That is, the pure productivity and Baumol effects should be included in appropriate

measures of productivity growth, but the Denison effect should normally be excluded. Additionally,

the ideal equation has slightly different weights from the first two terms in (2). Surprisingly, none

of the current measures of productivity growth follow the appropriate procedure for measuring

productivity growth.



       The productivity data

       The present study relies upon a data set for measuring labor productivity that differs from

standard measures. The second companion paper to this one develops an income-side data base on

productivity which relies on industrial data that are published by the BEA.3 These data are internally

consistent in that both inputs and outputs are income-side measures of value added, whereas the

usual productivity measures combine product-side output measures with income-side input

measures. The advantage of the income-side measures is that they present a consistent set of

industrial accounts. The disadvantages are that they are only available for the period 1977‚Äì98 and

that they do not contain a set of capital accounts, so we can only examine labor productivity.

        Because of interest in the ‚Äúnew economy,‚Äù we have also constructed a set of new-economy

accounts. For the purpose of this study, we define the new economy as machinery, electric

equipment, telephone and telegraph, and software. These sectors grew from 3 percent of real GDP

in 1977 to 9 percent of real GDP in 1998. These sectors are somewhat more inclusive than a narrow

definition of the new economy but are the narrowest definition for which a complete set of accounts

is available.

        The second companion paper develops a data base for three different output concepts which

can be used in productivity studies. One set is standard GDP (measured from the income side of the

accounts). A second output concept is what the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) defines as

‚Äúbusiness sector output.‚Äù A third concept responds to concerns in productivity studies about the poor

quality of the price deflation in several sectors. For this purpose, we have constructed a set of

accounts called ‚Äúwell-measured output,‚Äù which includes only those sectors for which output is

relatively well measured.



III. Review of Alternative Productivity Measures

        In this section, we begin with a review of standard labor productivity measures and then turn

to a comparison of standard measures with the measures constructed for this study.



        The BLS productivity data

        The most widely followed measure of labor productivity examines productivity in the

business sector and is constructed and published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Figure 1


                                                 
shows the behavior of that series for the business sector; for this purpose, we have used a three-year

moving average of labor-productivity growth. Table 1 shows a simple regression with two breaks

in trend, one in 1973 and the second in 1995.

       Four points are worth noting. First, the labor-productivity growth data do not show dramatic

and obvious breaks in trend. Labor productivity began deteriorating in the late 1960s, and the really

terrible period was in the early 1980s. An untutored analyst would probably not recognize any sharp

break in trend labor productivity after 1973. Second, the productivity upsurge in the late 1990s was

not a particularly rare event. Productivity accelerations of greater magnitude were seen in the early

1960s, the early 1970s, and the early 1980s ‚Äî indeed, there were breaks in trend in virtually every

decade. The volatile nature of productivity growth is a warning that we should not read too much

into a period even as long as four years. Third, even with the rapid productivity growth of the last

four years, labor-productivity growth is still below three other postwar highs. The early 1950s, the

mid-1960s and, briefly, the mid-1980s were periods with more rapid labor-productivity growth than

have been attained in the last three years. Finally, data revisions have led to substantial changes in

the patterns of productivity growth. Figure 2 shows the ratio of productivity in the latest data to

productivity estimated with data as of 1995. The data revisions tended to reduce the estimated

growth rate of labor productivity by about 0.2 percent per year from 1947 to 1977 (6 percent/30

years). Then in the decade after 1982, labor-productivity growth was revised upwards by about 0.8

percent per year (8 percent/10 years). These data revisions actually removed a substantial part of the

labor productivity slowdown about which so much was written in the last quarter century.

       Notwithstanding these cautions, it is important to examine the current upturn in productivity

with an eye to understanding its sources. In particular, we will want to determine the role of the

‚Äúnew economy‚Äù in the recent productivity rebound.


                                                 
       Comparison of labor-productivity growth rates between BLS (output-side) and BEA

       (income-side)

       We have prepared a data set on business sector output using an alternative source from the

standard measure. Figures 3 through 5 and Table 2 show a comparison of estimates of labor-

productivity growth using the BEA (income-side) and BLS (product-side) data sources. There are

substantial discrepancies between the estimates of productivity growth for the two sources. The BLS

product-side series yields higher productivity growth rate numbers in the early period, but in the most

recent period the BEA income-side estimates are 0.65 percentage points per year more rapid.

       The difference between the two estimates comes both from the output and the hours data.

Table 3 compares the trends in workers, hours per worker, and total hours for the BLS and BEA

concepts based on the data described above along with unpublished data on hours from both sources.

BEA (income-side) output is estimated to have grown 1.09 percentage points per year faster in the

last 3 years, while BEA hours are estimated to have grown about 0.24 percent more slowly in the last

three years. Labor productivity using the BEA income-side concepts has grown 0.65 percentage

points per year faster. However, the differences are not entirely consistent, and we have not

succeeded in identifying the reason for the differences between the two sources.

       Well-measured output

       We have developed an alternative measure of output that develops input and output data for

a concept that we designate as ‚Äúwell-measured output.‚Äù The sectors included in well-measured

output are:

A full discussion of the reasons for the separation is contained in the companion paper on the data.4

       Figure 6 shows a comparison of productivity growth for the three different concepts of total

GDP from the income side, business sector, and well-measured output. Three conclusions are

readily apparent. First, productivity growth for the well-measured sectors is about twice that in the

poorly-measured sectors. Second, for the last three years of the period, productivity growth in the

well-measured sectors has been impressive, averaging almost 4¬Ω percent per year in 1996‚Äì98.

Third, there was a sharp productivity acceleration in the late 1990s, with productivity growth in the

well-measured sectors rising more than 2 percentage points above the earlier period.



III. Productivity Resurgence and the New Economy

       We now turn to the central questions about productivity performance in the late 1990s: What

was the magnitude of the productivity upturn? How much of the growth was due to each of the three

factors derived above ‚Äî pure productivity acceleration, the Denison effect, and the Baumol effect?

Do measures of productivity growth using ideal measures differ from conventional measures? What

was the contribution of the new economy to the productivity acceleration? And is there a different

view in the well-measured as opposed to the entire economy?



       What was the Size of the Productivity Acceleration?

       Figure 6 and Table 4 show the basic numbers on labor-productivity growth using different

output concepts and time periods. GDP is the standard concept in the national accounts measured

from the income side. Business output is the measure as defined by the BLS and constructed here.

Well-measured output and the new economy are sectoral concepts that were defined in the last

section.

       The basic story is straightforward: Labor-productivity growth in the three major sectors

showed little change over the 1978‚Äì1995 period. It averaged around 1.1 percent per year for private

GDP and around 1.3 percent per year for business output. Well-measured output showed more

robust productivity growth, averaging around 2.3 percent per year, but was relatively stable over this

period. The new economy showed substantial productivity growth, but there was little acceleration

over the period.


                                                 
       The last three years of the sample period showed a dramatic upturn in labor-productivity

growth in all of the measures. Private GDP grew 1.18 percentage points per year more rapidly, while

business sector output grew about 1.82 percentage points more rapidly. Well-measured output

showed a dramatic upturn in productivity growth, almost doubling with a 2.08 percentage point

increase. The new economy logged a breathtaking increase in productivity of 13.3 percent per year

in the last three years, which was approximately double that of the earlier period.

       In short, while the period is relatively short, the last three years witnessed a major upturn in

productivity growth for all the major aggregates we examined, particularly for the well-measured

sectors.



       Decomposition of the Productivity Acceleration

       How much of the growth was due to each of the three factors derived above. Recall from

equation (2) that we can decompose productivity growth into pure productivity growth, the Denison

effect, and the Baumol effect. What were the sources of the acceleration in the last three years?

       Table 5 shows the basic results for the overall economy. The results are quite surprising.

The major finding is that the pure productivity effect is markedly higher than conventionally

measured average productivity growth. For overall (GDP) productivity over the last three years,

productivity as measured from the output side averaged 1.66 percent per year, while that from the

income side grew more rapidly at an average rate of 2.32 percent per year. However, the pure

productivity effect in the last three years was 0.14 percent per year higher than the total. The

difference was due primarily to the Baumol effect ‚Äî that is, to the fact that productivity growth was

higher in industries whose output shares were declining.

       The other interesting point is seen in the last column of Table 5. This shows the acceleration


                                                 
of productivity in the last three years relative to the first period (1978-89). Whereas overall GDP

productivity showed a meager acceleration of 0.41 percentage points, the acceleration as measured

by the pure productivity effect was 1.37 percentage points.

        Table 6 and Figure 7 shows the results for the business sector. For this sector, we cannot

compare output and income side measures directly because the statistical discrepancy is not allocated

by sector. Two important results can be seen. First, there was a major acceleration in productivity

in the business sector in the last three years, with total productivity averaging 3.16 percent per year.

Second, the pure productivity effect was even more substantial, and accelerated even more, but was

dragged down by large negative Baumol and Denison effects. Unlike the overall economy, in the

business sector the Baumol and Denison effects were both quite large and in the last three years

reduced productivity growth by 0.46 percentage points.

        Table 7 and Figure 8 shows the results for the well-measured sector. The results here parallel

those in the other sectors. Productivity growth in the last three years was very rapid: 4.65 percent per

year as compared to 2.39 percent per year in the first part of the period studied. For the well-

measured sectors, the Denison and Baumol effects were small relative to the overall impact, pulling

down the pure productivity effect by only 0.13 percentage points in the last three years.

        The basic conclusions regarding the decomposition of productivity growth is that pure

productivity growth in the most recent period has been even more rapid than the total. This is most

clearly seen for overall output, where the conventional product-side estimates of productivity growth

are well below the pure productivity growth because of the statistical discrepancy as well as modest

Denison and Baumol effects. The understatement is even larger for the business sector.



        Comparison of Alternative Measures from Welfare-Theoretic Point of View


                                                  
        The next question is how the different measures compare with the ideal welfare-theoretic

measure of productivity growth. Recall from section II above that the ideal measure of productivity

growth is a chain index of productivity growth where the weights are current nominal output. In

practice, we measure the weights as Tornqvist weights, which are averages of the weights of the two

periods.

        Figures 9 and 10 and Table 8 show a comparison of four measures for the overall economy.

The series called ‚Äúwelfare measure‚Äù is the ideal measure shown in equation (3) of section II. This

captures the estimate of productivity growth that best measures the growth in average living

standards. The measure labeled ‚Äúvariable‚Äù is very similar to the ideal except that it uses a more

complex set of weights rather than nominal output weights; this series includes the fixed productivity

effect plus the Baumol effect. The third series, labeled ‚Äútotal GDI,‚Äù is total income-side productivity

growth measured simply as output per unit input; this is therefore the variable productivity effect

plus the Denison effect. The final series, called ‚Äútotal GDP,‚Äù is identical to total GDI except that the

numerator is product-side output rather than income-side output.

        The results show two important differences between the different concepts. First, the ideal

or welfare-theoretic measure is higher than any of the other measures in every period. The

differences are relatively small in the most recent period, but they are substantial in earlier periods.

On average, the ideal or welfare-theoretic measure over the entire period was 0.21 percentage points

per year higher than total income-side productivity. The second point, which was clear in the earlier

results, is substantial difference between the GDI and GDP concepts in the most recent period.



        Contribution of the New Economy to the Productivity Rebound

        The next issue involves using the new data set to answer an important question: What is the


                                                  
contribution of the new economy to the remarkable resurgence in productivity over the last few

years. In this exercise, we limit our answer to the direct contribution of more rapid productivity

growth in new-economy industries; this analysis omits the question of the contribution of capital

deepening and of spillover effects of the information economy to productivity.

       The technique for calculating the impact of the new economy is as follows. We calculate

old-economy output and hours of the relevant sector (e.g., durable manufacturing) by removing the

new-economy output and hours from the sectoral total. For example, in the durable manufacturing

sector, we subtract output and hours of Machinery, except electrical and Electric and electronic

equipment. We then calculate total labor productivity with these sectors omitted.

       The results are shown in Tables 9 through 11. We focus first on the business sector, which

is the most widely followed of the productivity constructs. In the last three years, as shown in Table

10, the new economy contributed almost a percentage point (0.97 percentage points) to labor-

productivity growth (see the third number on the last line of Table 10). Another important finding

is the contribution of the new economy to the labor productivity rebound in the last three years. Of

the 1.89 percentage point acceleration in labor productivity (see the last column of line 1 in Table

10), one third was due to the acceleration in the contribution of the new economy (see the last

column of line 4 in Table 10).

       Similar results are found for the overall economy. For that sector as well, slightly less than

one-half of the acceleration of income-side productivity growth was due to the new economy (see

the last columns of lines 1 and 4 in Table 9). The role of the new economy in well-measured sectors

is marginally more important that in the two larger sectors. In this sector, as shown in Table 11, the

new economy was responsible for 1.09 percentage points of the 2.26 percentage point increase in

productivity growth.


                                                 
        Figure 11 shows the contribution of the different new economy sectors to overall GDP

productivity. These weight the productivity growth rates of each of the four sectors by its weight in

nominal GDP (following the approach of the ideal welfare-theoretic formula). The total impact,

shown in the last set of bars, was slightly below 0.5 percentage points of productivity in the first two

subperiods, and then grew to 0.86 percentage points for the 1996-98 period. The largest single

contributor was Electric and electronic equipment (primarily semiconductors), followed by

Machinery, except electrical.5



        Evaluation of the Gordon Hypothesis

        Based on Tables 9 through 11, we can evaluate the Gordon hypothesis. This view holds that

most if not all of the productivity acceleration in the late 1990s was due to productivity in the

computer industry. As summarized in The Economist:

        Robert Gordon of Northwestern University, one of the country‚Äôs top authorities on

        the subject, has found that more than 100% of the acceleration in productivity since

        1995 happened not across the economy as a whole, nor even across IT at large, but

        in computer manufacturing, barely 1% of the economy. Elsewhere, growth in

        productivity has stalled or fallen.6

        The most recent presentation of the Gordon hypothesis (see the reference in footnote 7

below) argues that nonfarm private business experienced a slowdown in labor-productivity growth

of 0.28 percentage points for the period 1995:4 to 1999:4 relative to the period 1972:2 to 1995:4.

        The results developed here definitely reject the Gordon hypothesis. For all three output

        5
             The estimates here varies from those in other tables because the weighting procedure is slightly
different.

concepts (total GDP, the business sector, and well-measured output), labor-productivity growth

without the new economy has shown a marked upturn in the last three years relative to the

1977‚Äì1995 period. The acceleration in non-new-economy productivity growth was 0.64 percentage

point for overall GDP, 0.91 percentage point for business output, and 1.16 percentage point for well-

measured output. A rough approximation is that new economy contributed directly to about one-half

of the total acceleration in labor-productivity growth.

       It should be emphasized that the results presented here are likely to underestimate the impact

of the new economy because they omit the impact of capital deepening on labor-productivity growth.

Recent estimates of the impact of capital deepening on labor productivity are approximately 0.3

percentage point for the period under consideration.7 Although we do not develop independent

estimates of the contribution of capital deepening, we can incorporate the results from other analysts

in Figure 12. This figure shows the breakdown of the acceleration in productivity in the three sectors

between capital deepening (assumed to be 0.33 percentage points), new-economy output

productivity, and other. It is clear that the new economy is a major contributor to the productivity

acceleration, but even after correcting for capital deepening productivity has accelerated in all three

sectors considered here.

       A final decomposition of productivity growth examines how much each industry contributes

to the total. Figure 13 shows how productivity growth for the overall economy (measured as

income-side GDP) derives from the different industries. For this calculation, we have used the

‚Äúvariable‚Äù productivity growth rate, which incorporates the pure productivity effect plus the Baumol

effect (see the discussion above). This measure is the closest to the welfare-theoretical ideal of the

different indexes. The individual-sector figures sum to the total, so the length of each bar in Figure

13 shows the relative importance of each sector.

       There is no surprise that durable manufacturing is the most important contributor to overall

productivity. Some of the other sectors are more surprising. For example, retail and wholesale trade

have each made major contributions to overall productivity growth in the latest period. Indeed, the

acceleration of productivity for 1996‚Äì98 in each of these two sectors has been larger than in durable

manufacturing. The data in these sectors are somewhat of a mystery, however, which emphasizes

the importance of closer attention to measuring output of the trade sectors. The other anomalies are

the poor performance in services and construction. These sectors, which have the most questionable

price indexes and are excluded from our index of well-measured output, showed negative

productivity growth in each of the three subperiods.8

       Another important question is the behavior of the industries within manufacturing, shown

in Figure 14 and summarized in Figure 15. The importance of industrial machinery (notably

computers) and electronic machinery (notably semiconductors) is striking.9 As Figure 15 shows, the

totality of other industries showed a marked productivity deceleration in the latest period. Of the

1.15 percentage point slowdown in non-new-economy manufacturing showed in the first set of bars

in Figure 15, food is responsible for 0.78 percentage points, which raises questions about either the

data or the performance of that industry. If the two major new-economy sectors and food are

removed from Figure 14, the latest data look pretty routine. It seems reasonable to conclude,

therefore, that up through 1998, the acceleration in manufacturing productivity was limited to the

       To conclude, the present study is the last in a series of three papers devoted to issues in the

measurement of productivity and productivity growth. We can summarize the major points here,

although a more detailed summary is contained in the first section. First, the present study explores

a new income-side data set for analysis of productivity, and constructs data for total output, the

business sector, ‚Äúwell-measured‚Äù output, and the new economy. Second, there has clearly been a

rebound in labor-productivity growth in recent years. All three sectoral definitions show a major

acceleration in labor productivity in the last three years of the period (1996‚Äì98) relative to the

1978‚Äì95 period. The rebound was 1.2 percentage points for GDP, 1.8 percentage points for business

sector, and 2.1 percentage points for well-measured output. Third, labor-productivity growth in the

new economy sectors has made a significant contribution to economy-wide productivity growth. For

the business sector, of the 1.82 percentage point increase in productivity growth in the last three

years, 0.65 percentage point was due to the new-economy sectors. Finally, for all three output

measures, there has been a substantial upturn in productivity growth outside the new economy. After

removing the direct effect of new economy sectors, the labor productivity acceleration was 0.54

percentage points for total GDP, 0.65 percentage points for business output, and 1.18 percentage

points for well-measured output. It is clear that the productivity rebound is not narrowly focused in

a few new-economy sectors.

Note: The exact definitions of the terms are given in the text in equation (3). An approximate
definition is as follows:
        Pure productivity effect is the weighted average of sectoral productivity growth using fixed
employment weights for 1987.
        The Baumol effect is the difference between the variable productivity effect and the pure
productivity effect, where the variable productivity effect uses actual year weights.
        The Denison effect is the impact of reallocation among industries which have different levels
of productivity per worker.
