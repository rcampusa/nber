                                         ABSTRACT

After the economic reforms that followed the National Revolution of the 1950s, Bolivia seemed
positioned for sustained growth. Indeed, it achieved unprecedented growth from 1960 to 1977.
The rapid accumulation of debt due to persistent deficits and a fixed exchange rate policy during
the 1970s led to a debt crisis that began in 1977. From 1977 to 1986, Bolivia lost almost all the
gains in GDP per capita that it had achieved since 1960. In 1986, Bolivia started to grow again,
interrupted only by the financial crisis of 1998–2002, which was the result of a drop in the
availability of external financing. Bolivia has grown since 2002, but government policies since
2006 are reminiscent of the policies of the 1970s that led to the debt crisis, in particular, the
accumulation of external debt and the drop in international reserves due to a de facto fixed
exchange rate since 2012.

1. Introduction

In the early seventeenth century, Bolivia was so famous for its mineral wealth that Miguel
Cervantes in his Don Quixote used the phrase “valer un Potosi” (to be worth a Potosi) to indicate
something of great worth, referring to the Bolivian silver mining city of Potosi. The phrase had
become popular in Spain in the late sixteenth century, and its use by Cervantes cemented it into
the Spanish language, where it is still used today, often with a small p. Unfortunately, Bolivia’s
exports of its proverbial wealth in natural resources—first silver, then tin, and now natural gas—
have not prevented it from becoming the poorest country in South America in 2017, according to
the World Bank’s World Development Indicators.1
         We study Bolivia’s poor economic performance, focusing on its modern economic history,
from 1960 to the present. Figure 1 presents a graph of the evolution of real GDP per working-age
(15–64 years) person (WAP) in Bolivia, in which we divide its modern economic history into five
distinct periods. The first period runs from 1960 to 1977 and is characterized by the most rapid
economic growth that Bolivia has experienced. It is followed by the second period of debt crisis
and hyperinflation, which runs from 1977 to 1986. The third period is a slow recovery that extends
from 1986 to 1998. The fourth period is the 1998–2002 financial crisis. The fifth and final period
starts in 2002 and runs to 2017. This period is characterized by growth—although not as rapid as
that from 1960 to 1977—and, starting in 2006, by an increase in the participation of the state in
the economy through the nationalization of enterprises in key economic sectors.
         We develop a narrative for the uneven economic development depicted in figure 1 that
focuses on monetary and fiscal policies, particularly on the external debt and the finances of state-
owned enterprises. Our narrative is compatible with other theories for Bolivia’s uneven
development. The most common narrative for Bolivia’s economic problems stresses that the
country’s continuing dependence on the export of a few natural resources makes its economy
sensitive to external shocks (see, for instance, Peñaloza Cordero 1985). Tin has accounted for at
least 50 percent of total exports from 1904 to 1985. After a short period of export diversification,
natural gas has accounted for at least 40 percent of total exports at the end of the twentieth century
and throughout the twenty-first century. Many economists have stressed the country’s dependence

  It is difficult to compare GDP per capita in Venezuela with that in Bolivia. The International Monetary Fund’s World
Economic Outlook Database estimates that GDP per capita in Venezuela was USD 12,388 in 2017, compared to USD
7,543 in Bolivia, but the Venezuelan number is subject to a lot of uncertainty. The World Bank has not been willing
to publish any estimates for Venezuelan GDP per capita since 2014.

                                                          1
on foreign aid, in terms of debt, grants, and foreign direct investment (Huber Abendroth et al.
2001; Peres-Cajías 2014). Other economists point to the low level of industrialization (Rodríguez
Ostria 1999; Seoane 2016). Production of manufactured goods has been stagnated at about 15
percent of GDP since the early 1940s.
       Although these narratives differ in their focus, they agree that government intervention in
the economy has been the driving force in either promoting or impeding economic development.
This government intervention took the form of intervening excessively in production activities in
the 1960s, 1970s, and recently, and took the form of intervening in the allocation of resources
through regulations in the 1990s and early 2000s. Given this common agreement about the
centrality of government policies, we stress the need for a comprehensive analysis of these policies
that focuses on the government’s intertemporal budget constraint.
       A special feature of Bolivia´s modern economic history is that it has received subsidized
loans. It has also defaulted frequently. Although it has been in default on some loans during every
year in the period 1960–2009, Bolivia nevertheless has continued receiving loans. In fact, it is the
only country in South America that has benefited from the joint International Monetary Fund–
World Bank programs to reduce the debt of very poor countries: the Heavily Indebted Poor
Countries (HIPC) Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI).
       Our general argument runs as follows: After the economic reforms that followed the
National Revolution of the 1950s, Bolivia was well positioned for sustained growth. Indeed,
Bolivia achieved unprecedented growth during the period 1960–1977. The rapid accumulation of
debt seen in figure 2, which was due to persistent deficits, coupled with a fixed exchange rate
policy during the 1970s, led to a debt crisis that began in 1977. From 1977 to 1986, Bolivia lost
almost all the gains in GDP per working-age person that it had achieved from 1960 to 1977. In
1986, Bolivia started to grow again, albeit slowly, interrupted only by the financial crisis of 1998–
2002, which was the result of a drop in the availability of external financing. Bolivia has grown
since 2002, but government policies since 2006 are reminiscent of the policies of the 1970s that
led to the debt crisis, particularly the accumulation of external debt and the drop in international
reserves due to a de facto fixed exchange rate since 2012.
       As figure 3 shows, Bolivia has experienced only one period of hyperinflation, whereas
other countries such as Argentina and Brazil have experienced multiple episodes of



                                                 2
hyperinflation.2 In contrast to Argentina and Brazil, Bolivia adopted a fixed exchange rate policy
over long periods, which has allowed it to maintain inflation at low levels.
         We carry out a systematic data analysis of Bolivian monetary and fiscal policies and their
effects on the economy. We use Kehoe and Prescott’s (2007) growth accounting analysis to
identify the real impact of government policies, and we use Kehoe, Nicolini, and Sargent’s (2010)
government budget accounting analysis to identify changes in government policies.
         In section 2, we perform the growth accounting analysis. Section 3 describes the different
periods or cycles of Bolivia’s modern economic history between 1960 and 2017. In section 4, we
perform the budget accounting analysis. In section 5, we present our conclusions. We also provide
an appendix in which we present a brief historical overview of Bolivia’s economic history before
1960, focusing on the National Revolution of the 1950s and its aftermath.

2.   Growth accounting

Figure 4 summarizes the macroeconomic history of Bolivia from 1960 to 2017 with the results of
a growth accounting exercise based on those in Kehoe and Prescott (2007). We use a Cobb-
Douglas production function for real GDP:

                                                  Yt = At Kta L1t-a ,                                              (1)

where we cumulate investment deflated by the GDP deflator to measure capital and number of
workers to measure labor. We employ a value of 0.42 for the capital share in the production
function, following the estimate of Machicado (2012).3
         The capital stock series is calculated using the perpetual inventory method, based on the
law of motion for capital,

                                              Kt +1 = (1- d ) Kt + It ,                                            (2)

where  is the depreciation rate that we assume is equal to 0.05, a standard value for yearly data.
         Our growth accounting rewrites the production function (1) as


2
  Notice that the data in figure 3 are in terms of percentage growth factors—where the percentage growth factor is 100
+ percentage growth rate—rather than growth rates. This allows us to plot data with both positive and negative growth
rates with a logarithmic scale. With this scale, 100 indicates a zero inflation rate or a zero growth rate of the money
supply depending on the series.

  Other estimations for Bolivia include that of Humérez and Dorado (2006) with a value of 0.35 and that of Jemio
(2008) with a value of 0.69.

                                             Nt         è Yt ø÷ è N t ø÷

where Nt is the number of working-age persons. The advantage of this growth accounting is that,
                                       /(1 )
in a balanced growth path, (Kt / Yt )           and Lt / N t are constant, and growth in Yt / Nt is driven
                  1 /(1 )
by growth in At               . Kehoe and Prescott (2007) apply this composition to data for the United

States and use it to show that the US growth path is close to balanced: in particular, the growth in
Yt / Nt is close to that in At1 /(1 ) , and (Kt / Yt ) /(1 ) and Lt / N t are close to constant.
        In figure 4, there are four features worth noting. First, fluctuations in GDP per working-
age person in Bolivia are driven mostly by fluctuations in total factor productivity (TFP). Second,
during the 1960s and early 1970s, we observe a remarkable expansion in TFP that is almost
completely lost during the debt crisis period. Third, although there was devaluation in 1972 and
1973, TFP continued growing; it is in 1978 that it starts to fall. Fourth, TFP falls in 1999 to 2001
because of the financial crisis.
        The beauty of this growth accounting is that we can identify the deviations from balanced
growth. In fact, in this paper, we attempt to relate the major deviation from balanced growth in
Bolivia to shocks, both internal and external, and to monetary and fiscal policy. Our hypothesis is
that Bolivia followed economic policies up through 1985 that left it very vulnerable to shocks.
Starting in 1985 with its new economic policy (NPE, Nueva Política Económica), the Bolivian
government implemented a series of reforms that successfully isolated the economy from shocks,
at least until 1998.

3. Periods of economic development in modern Bolivia

3.1. Stabilization and growth (1960–1977)

In 1956, the Bolivian government enacted the Eder Plan.4 The plan intended to reduce the liquidity
available in the economy by cutting public expenditures and loans, and by liberalizing prices,
beginning with the exchange rate and then prices for goods. The plan also modified budget



4
 The plan was named after George Jackson Eder, an economist sent by the United States as part of the technical
assistance provided to Bolivia.

                                                         4
procedures by including the deficit of public enterprises, established a mining royalty and new
tariffs, and restructured the tax system.
        The Eder Plan planted the seeds for the rapid growth that the Bolivian economy
experienced subsequently because it managed to control inflation, reducing it from 178 percent in
1956 to 11.5 percent in 1960. In fact, between 1960 and 1969, the Bolivian economy grew by 3.0
percent in terms of GDP per capita, a rate higher than those of Brazil and Chile (2.6 percent).
        An important feature of this period is that external debt increased, mainly to finance
macroeconomic stability and the fiscal deficit, in particular, to finance the expenditures of public
enterprises. Overall, external debt increased from USD 181.5 million in 1960 to USD 1,476.9
million in 1977. Figure 2 depicts the evolution of the ratio of external debt over GDP. This ratio
increased from 48.2 percent in 1960 to 60.3 percent in 1972 and then decreased to 46.7 percent in
1977.
        As we can see in figure 5, between 1960 and 1970, private lending represented the largest
source of external credit, although it fell during this period. In 1960, bilateral lending represented
30 percent of total debt, but in 1970 it represented only 22 percent. Multilateral lending increased
during the 1960s but then decreased in 1970. In fact, during the 1970s and mid-1980s, multilateral
lending was not very important and was below bilateral lending and far below private lending.
        During the period 1960–1977, external financing was employed primarily in maintaining
macroeconomic stability. In addition, the sustained net disbursements of debt generated a sustained
positive balance in the capital account of the balance of payments, which was larger than the deficit
of the current account. Therefore, there were net international reserve gains, as seen in figure 6.
From 1964 to 1978, net international reserves as a share of GDP were positive, with its highest
value of 8.1 percent in 1974.
        In figure 7, we see that net transfers from international creditors were always positive and
large, although very volatile, during the 1960s and 1970s. They increased from 3.9 percent in 1969
to 9.9 percent in 1970 and then fell to 0.2 percent in 1973, increasing again to 8.8 percent of GDP
in 1977. According to figure 8, this was a period in which sovereign debt in default was low. There
were some bonds in foreign currency that were in default during the 1960s, but then, between 1970
and 1977, the amount of foreign currency bonds in default was on average only USD 5 million, an
amount so small that it is difficult to see in figure 8.



                                                    5
       The Bolivian government maintained a fixed exchange rate regime during the Bretton
Woods period, up until 1971. It devalued in 1972, but then maintained a fixed exchange rate again
from 1973 to 1978. In figure 9, we see that during the fixed exchange rate regime, there was a
steady real appreciation, with the exception of the 1972–1973 devaluation. We do not catalog the
1972 devaluation as a balance of payments crisis because it was not accompanied by a fall in
international reserves, as seen in figure 6.
       In the 1970s, Bolivia enjoyed favorable economic conditions that provided a basis for
sustained growth. The country had access to vast foreign credit, and the export prices of mining
and oil—the most important economic sectors—were high. According to figure 10, the trade
balance had a surplus of 8.5 percent of GDP in 1974. Unfortunately, Bolivia did not take advantage
of these favorable conditions because it failed to reverse the historical trend of being a producer
and an exporter of raw materials. In fact, during this period, there was active criticism of fiscal
policy, in part because most of the external resources were used to finance public enterprises and
not to reduce social inequality.
       Between 1960 and 1970, current revenues of the general government increased from 5.9
percent of GDP to 9.4 percent, while expenditures increased from 8.1 percent of GDP to 10.3
percent, as seen in figure 11. This allowed the fiscal deficit to decrease as a share of GDP. It
decreased from 2.1 percent of GDP in 1960 to 0.9 percent of GDP in 1970.
       In the 1970s, the trend of reduction of the deficit of the general government reversed. We
see in figure 12 that the fiscal deficit increased from 2.4 percent in 1971 to 4.4 percent in 1977 as
a share of GDP. The data in figure 13 show that, in the 1970s, the Bolivian government started
running primary deficits when external conditions were favorable. In figure 13, the terms of trade
are measured as the ratio of the export price index to the import price index, that is, the relative
price of exports to imports. During the period 1974–1996, the correlation of the primary surplus
with the terms of trade was −0.66, while during the other years that we study, 1960–1973 and
1997–2017, this correlation was 0.60. During 1986 through 1996, the government struggled to run
primary surpluses as it recovered from the debt crisis even as the terms of trade deteriorated, as we
discuss subsequently. During 1974 through 1985, however, the government ran primary deficits
even as the terms of trade improved. The large fiscal deficits and primary deficits in the 1970s are
explained mostly by a boom in public investments financed by a large inflow of external resources.



                                                 6
According to Otalora (2002), during the years 1975–1979, there were currency surpluses that
financed only a minor part of the public investments.
       In figure 14 we can see that, while the general government reduced its debt during the
1960s and mid-1970s, public enterprises increased their debt from 8.4 percent of GDP in 1969 to
24.7 percent in 1973, remaining at around 19 percent of GDP in the 1970s. We interpret this as
indicating that the fiscal problems came mostly from public enterprises.

3.2. Debt crisis (1977–1986)

Between 1977 and 1986, Bolivia suffered an economic crisis of extraordinary proportions. During
the 1970s, Bolivia, like other Latin American countries, enjoyed large inflows of credit, mostly
from foreign currency loans from international banks. In the 1980s, the situation reversed and
external credit was severely constrained or cut off. This period was also characterized by internal
political chaos between 1978 and 1982, overlapping with the onset of high interest rates and a
global recession. Between 1982 and 1985, Bolivia experienced a democratic opportunity, but with
a political crisis in which the new administration, led by Hernan Siles Suazo from the Democratic
and Popular Union (UDP), had little internal support; therefore, it had to rely on external support.
The main internal opposition that confronted the government came from the Bolivian Labor Union
(Central Obrera Boliviana), which was not just a confederation of guilds, with wage demands and
stability of employment, but also viewed itself as a political party whose aspiration was to control
the government (Toranzo 2009). Its main demand was a minimum wage that was 100 percent
indexed to past inflation. By the end of the period, the average annual CPI inflation rate was above
11,000 percent, and the fiscal deficit was around 18 percent of GDP. Morales (1988) and other
authors attribute the hyperinflation to the financing of the fiscal deficit by increased money
printing. The data in figure 3 support their assertion.
       External debt doubled from USD 1,476.9 million in 1977 to USD 3,642.5 million in 1986.
As a share of GDP, debt jumped from 45.1 to 100.4 percent in one year (1981–1982), as seen in
figure 2. Most of the increases in the external-debt-to-GDP ratio between 1977 and 1983 were due
to real exchange rate depreciation, as seen in figure 2. The figure shows what the debt-to-GDP
ratio would have been if the real exchange rate had been constant over 1960–2017 at its 1980
value. For example, we interpret the fact that, in 1983, the RER-adjusted debt-to-GDP ratio was
only 36 percent of the debt-to-GDP ratio as indicating that 64 percent of the debt-to-GDP ratio in


                                                  7
1983 was due to the real exchange rate devaluation between 1980 and 1983, with the remaining
36 percent due to accumulated fiscal deficits.
        The crisis that started in July 1978 with the resignation of President Hugo Banzer Suarez
was a balance of payments crisis of the sort analyzed by Krugman (1979): the government had no
other option than to devalue in 1979, as net international reserves were falling. Figure 6 shows that
net international reserves as a share of GDP started falling in 1978, and by 1979 they were
negative. The government fixed the nominal exchange rate again in 1980–1981, but reserves
continued to fall, so there was no other option than to devalue. Inflation and dollarization followed.
        In 1982, Bolivia ended a period of several military dictatorships. Democratic openness was
accompanied by a severe economic, political, and social crisis. The disinvestment of large public
enterprises and the sharp increase in financial obligations, related to servicing the external debt,
were the main sources of the most severe crisis that Bolivia experienced in 1985. The crisis was
characterized by hyperinflation, unemployment, and a worsening of living conditions.
        The prevailing conditions in the international financial markets allowed Bolivia to increase
its external debt by a factor of 1.8 between 1978 and 1985. The stock of external debt was USD
1,799.7 million in 1978 and USD 3,294.4 million in 1985. The data in figure 8 indicate that
sovereign debt in default also increased sharply during this period, from USD 6.6 million in 1978
to USD 2,236.69 million in 1986. In 1986, Bolivia defaulted on all debt with all types of creditors,
but most of this debt was in foreign currency bank loans and bilateral debt.
        The political uncertainty involved in the return to democracy that characterized the early
1980s was reflected in the government’s debt policy. Even though there was an international
movement in favor of a suspension of the service of debt, the Bolivian government renounced this
possibility. International creditors, in particular the international banks, implemented a policy to
solve the payment limitations of the large debtors, Mexico, Brazil, and Argentina, but they did
nothing to solve the problems of the small debtors like Bolivia. In this setting, the Bolivian
government decided to impose discipline on its external financial obligations to avoid punishment
by the international creditors and to maintain its internal legitimacy. Notice in figure 7 that net
transfers were negative between 1982 and 1985. This means that while Bolivia defaulted with
some creditors, it paid others. In fact, this is a particular feature of Bolivia’s debt policy. It seems




                                                   8
that it managed its debt portfolio by paying some creditors while acquiring new debts, possibly
using some of the new debt to pay old debts.5
         Figure 5 shows that there is also a change in creditors between 1982 and 1985. The relative
weight of private creditors dropped to 22.8 percent because the government initially paid this debt.
Simultaneously, the relative weight of bilateral creditors rose to 50.7 percent, which is explained
by the support that the Bolivian government and other official organizations gave toward the
democratic process initiated in Bolivia. Of course, the decision to pay as much debt service as
possible had drastic implications for the economy. The ratio of debt service to exports of goods
and services plus factor income from abroad reached 63 percent in 1984, which was an
unsustainable level. We also observe in figure 10 that between 1978 and 1983, the trade balance
increased from −7.5 percent of GDP to 4.3 percent of GDP and then fell abruptly. Rather than an
abrupt sudden stop, the Bolivian economy went through a painful five-year cutoff of most foreign
lending.
         In 1985, the most severe economic crisis in Bolivia’s history occurred, characterized by a
hyperinflation of unprecedented magnitude that occurred as a direct consequence of money
printing to finance the fiscal deficit. Notice in figure 3 that inflation rate reached 11,750 percent
(the corresponding inflation factor is 11,850 percent). As Milton Friedman stated, “Inflation is
always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon in the sense that it is and can be produced only
by a more rapid increase in the quantity of money than in output” (Friedman 1963). Figure 3 shows
that hyperinflation coincided with a large increase in the rate of growth of the monetary aggregate
M1. Thus, hyperinflation was a monetary phenomenon in Friedman’s sense, but the need to print
this money came from fiscal problems and problems with external debt, as we have discussed.
Notice, however, that M1 did not increase as much as did the price level, nor, except for 1985, the
year of the hyperinflation, did the increases in M1 exactly coincide with the increases in the price
level.
         The decline in tax revenues, that is, of current revenues, and the increase in current
expenditures during the years 1978–1979 pushed up the fiscal deficit. The increase in the fiscal
deficit coincided with a decline in exports as a percentage of GDP driven by a decline in quantities

 At the conference “La Historia Monetaria y Fiscal de Bolivia: 1960–2014,” one of the presidents of the Banco Central
de Bolivia during this period, when asked whether Bolivia intended to pay its debt, answered, “We wanted to pay, but
we were not able to.”

                                                         9
exported rather than a decline in export prices, since we can see in figure 13 that this was a period
in which the terms of trade were improving. Because most Bolivian exports were produced by
public enterprises, the decline in the quantities exported is a clear sign of their inefficiency.6 At
the same time, there was also an increase in external debt service and a decrease in disbursements
of external debt. All of these factors contributed to the deterioration of the financial position of the
National Treasury (TGN), which drove the increases in primary deficits, not only in the later years
of the 1970s but also during the following years. Notice how the fiscal and primary deficit rose in
the early 1980s, reaching levels of 17 percent and 15 percent of GDP, respectively, in figure 12.
         In figure 15, we observe that the deficit of the nonfinancial public sector (NFPS) increased
after 1982. In 1983, it was 17.0 percent as a share of GDP, and after a year it rose to 21.2 percent
of GDP. The growth in the deficit is explained in part by the Olivera-Tanzi effect (see Tanzi 1977)
and also by an increase in government spending due to the wage policy that was implemented. In
the figure we can also see that seigniorage allowed the government to cover most of its deficit.7
         There are two aspects worth noting about the economic instability in the late 1970s and
early 1980s. First, as the crisis deepened and external financing options were limited as foregin
lending was cut off, the government developed a greater confidence in the inflation tax as a
mechanism of financing. This reliance on seigniorage encouraged outflows of capital and the
public’s use of foreign currency, especially dollars. Second, because the banks had guaranteed
access to dollars, they rejected payments in national currency for foreign currency–denominated
debt, thus creating a parallel exchange market where borrowers kept buying dollars, which they
kept as a store of value to protect against devaluation and inflation (see Antelo 1996).
         The lack of fiscal discipline led the government to eliminate deposits in foreign currency
in the domestic financial system and to impose capital controls. By the end of 1982, several
attempts were made to stabilize the exchange rate. An official exchange rate was established with
state control of foreign exchange, based on controls on foreign trade and compulsory delivery of
foreign currency to the state. In addition, the Foreign Exchange Policy Commission was created




6
  According to Requena et al. (1989), the fiscal deficit of the Bolivian public sector from 1980 to 1985 was mostly
driven by the nonfinancial deficit and this deficit was mostly driven by the fall in the quantities exported by public
enterprises.
7
  The Olivera-Tanzi effect is a situation in which an increase in inflation reduces fiscal revenues in real terms
because of the lag in the payment of taxes.

                                                         10
to allocate the scarce foreign exchange according to criteria and rules determined by the
government.
           One of the measures to restrict the use of dollars was the “de-dollarization” program, which
consisted of converting all obligations contracted in dollars or with value maintenance into national
currency, including deposits in the banking system, at the exchange rate determined by the
government on a given day. This measure created a mismatch in the banking system, hurting
creditors and those with deposits in foreign currency in the banking system, but favoring debtors.
The policy of de-dollarization failed because dollar transactions actually increased, and the
government had to refinance debts and deposits in dollars with currency creation, thus increasing
inflation (see Cariaga 1996). This program also generated a bank run and a subsequent government
bailout of the banks, as seen in figure 16. Deposits in banks as a share of GDP fell from 14.8
percent in 1982 to 4.0 percent in 1985.
           Morales (2012) argues that the de-dollarization program produced a liquefaction of the
government’s short-term debt, insofar as the foreign currency (or value maintenance) reserves of
the banking system in the Banco Central de Bolivia had been used to partially finance the fiscal
deficit. According to Antelo (1996), the de-dollarization program had four goals: first, to reduce
the demand for dollars by giving back to the government control over the money supply and to
concentrate the stock of dollars in external debt repayments; second, to restore the government’s
ability to raise funds through inflation; third, to encourage sectors stifled by their dollar debts; and,
fourth, to lower investment costs in industry, whose debts denominated in dollars increased with
real exchange rate depreciation. The de-dollarization program failed to accomplish these
objectives, however, and financial disintermediation and informal dollarization followed.

3.3. Recovery and slow growth (1986–1998)

The year 1986 marked the beginning of a period of recovery and growth and the replacement of
the state by the market.8 In fact, in the second half of 1985, a restructuring process was initiated
that had two main objectives: first, to stabilize the economy and, second, to implement structural
reforms in which national or foreign enterprises would be the main economic actors. According to
Antelo (2000), the structural reforms implemented in Bolivia were framed in line with the
Washington Consensus. This period lasts until 1998 and includes different subperiods of structural

8
    Up until 2000, ninety-four public enterprises were privatized (see Garrón, Capra, and Machicado 2003).

                                                          11
reforms: economic stabilization and first-generation reforms (1986–1989), deepening of the first-
generation reforms (1990–1993), and second-generation reforms (1994–1997).9 The seed of these
reforms was the new economic policy, the NPE (Nueva Política Económica). The NPE was a
stabilization plan whose primary objective was to reduce inflation and generate foreign resources.
The structural reforms included the liberalization of goods and financial markets, capitalization
through privatization, a tax reform, commercial policies in favor of exports and foreign direct
investment (FDI), and fiscal decentralization among municipalities. It was a period characterized
by slow growth; GDP per WAP growth was on average 1.1 percent per year between 1986 and
1998.
           The NPE was implemented in August 1985, with Supreme Decree 21060. This stabilization
plan was enacted to confront the crisis, stop hyperinflation, and stabilize the economy. It was part
of a broader structural adjustment program aimed at changing the whole function of the economy
by reducing the influence of the state on production, increasing reliance on the price system in the
markets for goods, labor, and capital, and promoting private-sector initiatives. As Jemio (2001)
indicates, the framework of incentives adopted under the NPE included free convertibility of
foreign exchange, elimination of price controls, reduced government intervention in labor
contracts, financial liberalization, and commitment to price stability. All these actions were
designed to encourage greater private-sector participation in the economy. The core of this
stabilization program was based on exchange rate unification, drastic measures to control the fiscal
deficit, and a very tight monetary policy.
           Starting in 1981, the Bolivian government had maintained a system of dual exchange rates,
an official exchange rate and a parallel, that is, market, exchange rate. In 1986, the government
unified these exchange rates with the liberalization of the exchange market, accompanied by
restrictive monetary and fiscal policies, and an ingenious mechanism of intervention by the Banco
Central de Bolivia, known as “El Bolsin.” In the Bolsín, the demand for foreign exchange that
could not be satisfied by private operators was covered by the Banco Central de Bolivia through
an American auction with a base or reserve price. The price resulting from this operation served
to define the official exchange rate. Once the exchange market was controlled, the devaluation rate
of the parallel exchange rate with the US dollar was reduced from almost 7,300 percent in 1985 to



9
    See Barja Daza (2000) for a detailed explanation of the specific reforms that occurred in each period.

                                                            12
13 percent in 1987. After that, a crawling-peg regime was adopted with mini-devaluations, as seen
in figure 9. This regime lasted until 2005, when a real appreciation recurred.
        The NPE allowed the possibility of transacting in US dollars within the financial system,
and with the reestablishment of foreign currency deposits, a formal financial system based on the
US dollar was established. A bimonetary system was established where transactions could be made
in dollars or in local currency. This, in combination with the crawling-peg regime, generated the
incentives for an increase in dollarization from 48.3 percent in 1986 to 90.1 percent in 1997, as
seen in figure 17.
        Macroeconomic stabilization was achieved in two years. Antezana (1988) explains that
stabilization was achieved by a combination of fiscal and monetary policy. Fiscal policy reduced
public expenditure and increased revenues by raising prices and taxes on goods and services sold
by the public sector, mainly fuels. Monetary policy aimed to control the money supply by tightly
restricting net lending to the public sector and to development banks. The inflation rate was
reduced from more than 11,000 percent in 1985 to 276.3 percent in 1986 and to 14.6 percent in
1987, as seen in figure 3.10
        Monetary policy was fundamental in stabilizing prices. Supreme Decree 21060 required
the Banco Central de Bolivia to submit a monetary program to the Ministry of Finance with reports
every ten days to allow the Ministry of Finance to closely monitor the money supply. This
mechanism made it possible to coordinate efforts to reduce the fiscal deficit with control of fiscal
credit, both to the National Treasury and to decentralized entities, public companies, and
departmental and local administrations. Although the Ministry of Finance monitored the monetary
management, the Banco Central de Bolivia defined its operational objectives independently. In
this way, monetary policy ceased to be subordinated to fiscal financing needs.
        Hyperinflation left the country with no way to pay its external debt. Therefore, the NPE
aimed to promote exports so as to generate foreign resources. The orientation of the NPE in terms
of its relationship to the multilateral organizations was linked to a solution of this incapacity to
pay the debt. As the general government was the main debtor, as seen in figure 14, one of the first
objectives of the NPE through the Structural Adjustment Program (PAE for its initials in Spanish)




10
 Once stabilized, the currency, the Bolivian peso (BOP), was replaced by the boliviano (BOB), where 1 boliviano
was worth 1 million Bolivian pesos. This modification took effect on January 1, 1987 (Law 901, November 1986).

                                                      13
was to reduce and control the fiscal deficit. Therefore, in May 1986, a new tax structure was
imposed.11
         A priority of the NPE was the reduction and payment of the accumulated foreign debt. In
February 1987, the 131 creditor banks of Bolivia approved a refinancing agreement (Enmienda al
Convenio de Refinanciamiento) from 1981 in which these banks had the opportunity to purchase
bonds in the secondary market and also exchange the debt for investment bonds. The solution
consisted of the buildup of a fiduciary fund administered by the International Monetary Fund so
that it could collect resources donated by the developed countries and move them to the secondary
market to acquire debt at a lower price. In this way, Bolivia reduced its commercial debt by
purchasing it in the secondary market at 11 cents per dollar. This form of reduction was also
supported by the approval of the Brady Plan. Between 1987 and 1989, Bolivia reduced its external
debt by USD 797.4 million.12
         The success of this repurchase of debt led to a second round. Between 1992 and 1993,
external debt was bought in the secondary market at a value of 16 cents per dollar. This operation
also allowed exchanging debt for short- and long-term bonds. In sum, these operations contributed
to reduce the external debt by USD 170 million. Furthermore, in 1989 the Banco Central de Bolivia
issued investment bonds with the aim of exchanging them with international private debt. The
bonds had a present value of 11 cents per dollar, and they were redeemed in 25 years.13
         In terms of bilateral debt, the Bolivian government appealed several times to the Paris Club
to reschedule its debt with governments and official organizations. Due to the fiscal crisis, in July
1988, the government entered into an agreement with the International Monetary Fund called the
Servicio Reforzado de Ajuste Estructural (SRAE). This program allowed the Bolivian government
to continue to reschedule its debt with the Paris Club. As a result of all these negotiations that
started in 1986 and ended in 1996, Bolivia managed to reduce its external debt significantly. Table
1 presents a summary of the debt negotiations according to the type of creditors, and figure 18
shows the debt reductions achieved by these two types of renegotiations.

11
   This tax reform (Law 843) reduced the tax structure to seven taxes from which the value-added tax was the most
important. This law, in its 1986 version, did not include a tax to labor or to capital income, and even today, the labor
income tax is absent from the Bolivian tax structure.
12
   A critique of this form of debt reduction can be found in Bulow and Rogoff (1988).
13
   They were equivalent to Triple A bonds. The sale of these bonds was intermediated by Merrill Lynch. This company
bought fiduciary documents from international organizations—the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund—and from the Federal Reserve.

        As a result of the structural reforms, in particular the privatization of public enterprises, in
the 1990s, there was a large inflow of foreign resources in the form of FDI. The entry of foreign
enterprises in strategic sectors such as oil, energy, and telecommunications allowed the economy
to resume its growth. On average, the economy grew by 2 percent between 1990 and 1997 in terms
of GDP per capita. In 1994 the rate of growth was 2.3 percent as a result of capitalization, but the
ratio of external debt to GDP reached a maximum value of 75.1 percent. This ratio then declined
to 57.3 percent in 1997, a value that was still high for a country that needed to reverse its poverty
levels. Nevertheless, the state-owned enterprises reduced their debt as a percentage of GDP, due
to the capitalization program, from 11.6 percent in 1995 to 1.2 percent in 2005.
        The composition of debtors also has changed dramatically since the implementation of the
PAE, as seen in figure 14. Since 1985 the general government, and in particular the central
government, appears as the principal debtor, absorbing 74 percent of total debt in 1997. The central
government allocated these resources primarily to public investment because the tax policy thus
far did not generate sufficient internal resources to cover capital and current expenditures. The
financial public sector (Banco Central de Bolivia and specialized banks) appear as the second
debtor. Its relative weight doubled in ten years, and it represented 18.7 percent of total debt in
1997.
        During this period, sovereign debt in default was also large. In particular, we see in figure
8 that in 1995 Bolivia defaulted in USD 1,363 million of its bilateral debt, and in 1996 and 1997
it defaulted in USD 669.1 million and USD 417 million, respectively, of its multilateral debt. By
that time, multilateral debt represented 40 percent of GDP, and it was already the largest
component of total debt.
        The NPE allowed a reduction of the fiscal deficit of the NFPS from 8.1 percent in 1985 to
2.3 percent in 1986, with the reversion of the Olivera-Tanzi effect, because inflation was

                                                   15
drastically reduced. In 1987, however, the fiscal deficit of the NFPS increased again to 6.8 percent
of GDP, as seen in figure 15. Therefore, a tax reform was implemented with the goal of achieving
fiscal balance. Between 1989 and 1997, the fiscal deficit was on average 3.8 percent of GDP.
During the 1990s, the privatization programs that the Bolivian government implemented helped to
reduce the deficit to 1.8 percent and 1.9 percent of GDP in 1995 and 1996, respectively.14

3.4. Financial crisis (1998–2002)

From 1998 to 2002, the economy entered a slowdown phase, induced by external shocks: a
deterioration in the terms of trade and the reversal in capital flows. During this period, financial
flows, with the exception of FDI, reversed significantly. FDI remained at relatively high levels
(USD 770 million on average per year) because the capitalized companies were still accomplishing
their investment commitments.
           Public external debt increased to finance the growing fiscal deficit resulting from the
economic slowdown and the implementation of structural reforms. Among them, pension reform
implemented in 1996 had a significant fiscal impact. Bolivia passed from a system of mutual funds
to a system of individual capitalization. In 1999 the fiscal deficit of the NFPS was 3.0 percent of
GDP, but the fiscal deficit without pensions was indeed a surplus of 0.7 percent of GDP. In 2002
the fiscal deficit was 8.5 percent, from which half represented pensions.
            In September 1996, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank created the
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative to give financial support to a limited number
of countries characterized by poverty and with medium-term external financial obligations in terms
of debt service that were higher than what these countries were able to afford. The argument was
that reducing the external debt for these countries would free up greater resources that could be
used to attack poverty. This was the first time that a debt forgiveness program included multilateral
debt, which, as we have seen in figure 5, accounted for most of Bolivia’s debt by the end of the
1990s.
           The International Monetary Fund and World Bank imposed conditions in terms of
macroeconomic policies and structural reforms as part of the concession of the HIPC debt
reduction. Bolivia met all of these conditions and, being a poor country, was selected to participate
in this initiative. Through the HIPC I program, implemented in 1998, the accorded reduction of

14
     See Garrón, Capra, and Machicado (2003) for a review of the three waves of privatization in Bolivia.

                                                           16
multilateral debt was equivalent to 24 percent of the stock debt by the end of 1998 in the next forty
years, although the largest part of this reduction would be effective in the first years. The
application of this program managed to reduce the debt service over exports to 25.5 percent in
1999. Nevertheless, the negative external shocks that began in 1999 offset the beneficial results of
the HIPC I. The service of the external debt and the worsening of the terms of trade drastically
reduced the level of national savings. There was a huge drop in output and exports, and the negative
balance of the current account could be compensated only with the inflow of FDI. As can be seen
in figure 2, the debt as a share of GDP remained constant during these years at an average of 55
percent.
       The HIPC II initiative made it possible for Bolivia to obtain additional resources through
the forgiveness of the debt with the approval of the so-called Bolivian Strategy for Poverty
Reduction. The HIPC II strategy consisted of the reduction of multilateral debt in fifteen years,
starting in 2001. The application of the HIPC I and HIPC II initiatives allowed an increase in
forgiveness of the average debt of 1999–2000 by 44 percent. This initiative allowed a reduction of
external debt of USD 50 million between 1999 and 2000, which represented 2 percent of GDP,
but this reduction was not sufficient. Indeed, in 2001 the external debt represented the same
proportion of GDP as it did in 1999, as seen in figure 2.
       The data in figure 12 show that fiscal problems worsened at the beginning of the 2000s.
The fiscal deficit shot up between 2000 and 2001. The fiscal deficit increased from 3.9 percent to
7.2 percent, and the primary deficit increased from 2.2 percent to 5.2 percent. These fiscal
problems made it impossible for the government to continue paying its debt obligations; therefore,
in 2001 we also observe large amounts of sovereign debt in default. Bolivia defaulted by USD 685
million in its bilateral debt and by USD 488.4 million in its multilateral debt, as seen in figure 8.
       The period 1998–2002 is characterized as a financial crisis. Jemio (2006) explains that,
starting in 1998, the Bolivian economy experienced a drop in the growth rate, high unemployment,
and financial disintermediation. The financial sector suffered the most, experiencing a credit
crunch due to the contagion effects of the international financial crisis through lower capital and
commercial flows and policies followed by other countries.
       The contraction of international demand reduced prices of the main export commodities,
affecting the income of the exporting companies, and deteriorating their cash flows and their
capacity to service the debts contracted. The trade balance as a share of GDP fell to −12.9 percent


                                                 17
in 1998, as seen in figure 10. Additionally, the economy was affected by a lower availability of
external financing, since in the years before the crisis there had been an outflow of capital,
especially capital intermediated by the financial system.
           This situation resulted in a fall in international reserves and a contraction in the money
supply. Figure 6 shows that net international reserves fell from 13.2 percent to 10.8 percent of
GDP between 2001 and 2002. The lack of liquidity accentuated the fall in the pace of economic
activity. Finally, the devaluation of the Brazilian real represented a loss of competitiveness of the
traded goods sector and exerted pressure on the exchange rate. The rate of depreciation of the real
exchange rate was 5.0 percent in 2000, but it increased to 8.1 percent and 9.2 percent in 2001 and
2002, respectively, as seen in figure 9.
           Monetary and fiscal policies were procyclical. Monetary policy tried to maintain stable
growth through payments by using open market operations, domestic credit, and to a lesser extent,
the level of bank reserves. Fiscal policy restricted public investment as a way to reduce the deficit,
amplifying the effect of real shocks. The financial system responded to this situation by rationing
credit, and this was encouraged by the enactment of a stricter prudential regulation by the
Superintendency of Banks and Financial Institutions (SBEF) in November 1998. This resulted in
portfolio declines; increases in the reserves of banks; lower interest rates, deposits, and loans; and
an increase in bank spreads.
           The regulations in force until 1998 allowed an overexpansion of bank credit during the
1990s, but this increased the risk of the financial system and was one of the main causes for the
subsequent contraction of credit since 1998. Although the change in regulations introduced by the
SBEF in November 1998 was aimed at correcting this contraction by obliging banks to increase
their loans, it had the opposite effect because it was too late. According to Morales (2012), between
1999 and 2003, the banking system had reduced its deposits by 24.6 percent and its loans by 43.4
percent.

3.5. Nationalization and growth (2002–2017)

The slowdown that began in 1999 created a climate of social and political conflict, which became
critical after 2002 when a new president was elected.15 The economic and social crisis that the new
president inherited created uncertainty for investment and deposits. Morales (2012) explains that

     Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada became president for the second time, after going to a runoff with Evo Morales.

the unexpected results of the elections increased the nervousness of the depositors in the financial
system. As a result, there was a huge outflow of deposits between June and July 2002. In six weeks,
the financial system lost 23 percent of total deposits. In fact, deposits as a share of GDP fell from
49.0 percent in 1998 to 35.4 percent in 2006, as seen in figure 16.
       In 2002, indicators pointed to a worsening of the crisis as neighboring countries were
having serious financial problems. According to Morales (2012), the abandonment of the
convertibility and the moratorium on the Argentinean debt, the Uruguayan banking crisis, and the
rapid depreciation of the Brazilian real, together with the instability within Bolivia, posed serious
threats to the financial system. The structural reforms that had been made in the 1990s, however,
endowed Bolivia with an unexpected robustness, and, consequently, economic collapse was
avoided.
       What could not be avoided was political collapse. In 2003, when the fiscal deficit had
reached unsustainable levels—8.9 percent in 2002 according to figure 12—the government
decided to implement an income tax, which had never previously existed nor does it today, in the
Bolivian economy. This policy generated a resounding rejection by the entire population. Political
turmoil ensued. In October 2003, after having lost its legitimacy and having serious conflicts in
the city of El Alto, the government elected in 2002 was forced to resign.
       International economic conditions began to recover in 2003, but most importantly, Bolivia
increased its natural gas exports to Brazil. The value of natural gas exports increased from USD
265.5 million in 2002 to USD 389.5 million in 2003. In addition, an increase in the prices of
Bolivian exports produced an export boom. The trade balance had a large surplus between 2004
and 2014, as seen in figure 10. GDP growth also increased, although not to the levels of 1960–
1977. Between 2002 and 2017, growth in GDP per WAP averaged 2.6 percent per year.
       Even though the economy was showing signs of recovery, the social and political
instability continued because the presidents who followed Sanchez de Lozada did not have
sufficient support in the Congress. In addition, the export boom, mainly from the hydrocarbon
industry, led to political debate about how incomes were distributed. Recall that the hydrocarbon
sector was controlled by international companies, and the government received only taxes from
exports.
       In 2005 there were new elections, won by Evo Morales, who became president in January
2006. With his administration, a new economic vision was implemented. The year 2006 began a


                                                 19
period characterized by a return to an economy in which the state played the leading role through
the nationalization of the main companies in strategic sectors such as oil, electricity, and
telecommunications. These companies were previously under private ownership.
       The extremely favorable international conditions of high commodity prices, along with the
nationalization of the hydrocarbon sector, allowed Bolivia to experience, for the first time in its
modern economic history, a continuous nonfinancial public-sector surplus between 2006 and 2013.
Figure 12 shows that the fiscal surplus was 4.5 percent of GDP in 2006 and that it remained at an
average of 1.8 percent until 2013.
       The stock of foreign debt as a share of GDP declined from 55.4 percent in 1999 to 51.9
percent in 2005, as seen in figure 2. The largest decrease in debt occurred after 2006, however,
when the stock of debt was reduced to 28.4 percent of GDP in 2006 and to 16.8 percent of GDP
in 2007. This decline represented USD 2,732.9 million. Starting in 2008, the stock of foreign debt
remained around 15 percent of GDP, but, starting in 2015, it has increased, reaching 25.3 percent
of GDP in 2017.
       In 2005, during a meeting of the G8 countries, a complete forgiveness of debt was
announced for the HIPC countries (Bolivia included). This program, called the Multilateral Debt
Relief Initiative (MDRI), explains the large reduction of Bolivia’s multilateral debt. To this we
have to add the change in the external economic conditions since 2005 that coincided with the end
of the social crisis that Bolivia experienced between 2000 and 2003 and the end of the so-called
neoliberal period, when the economy was based in the free market.
       The windfall of funding received by the NFPS and the external surplus allowed the Banco
Central de Bolivia to accumulate reserves to amounts never seen before. Net international reserves
increased from 12.0 percent of GDP in 2003 to 51.8 percent of GDP in 2012. Since then, reserves
have started to decrease, coinciding with a reversal of these favorable conditions, as seen in figure
6.
       The large current account surpluses that the Bolivian economy started to experience in
2004 generated an excess of dollars in the economy that caused the nominal exchange rate to
appreciate. In 2005, the nominal exchange rate reached a value of 8.08 BOB/USD, and it
appreciated further to 8.05 BOB/USD in 2006. Figure 9 shows that the real exchange rate has
experienced a real appreciation since 2005 that continues today. In fact, in November 2011, the
Banco Central de Bolivia adopted a de facto fixed exchange rate policy. Since then the nominal


                                                 20
exchange rate has been fixed at 6.96 BOB/USD. This policy explains the fall in international
reserves observed in recent years in figure 6.
        By 2017, international reserves were 27.5 percent of GDP, there was a fiscal deficit of 7.8
percent of GDP, and the current account deficit was 7.0 percent of GDP. External debt has
increased to USD 9,427.9 million, and, although it is an amount larger than what Bolivia’s debt
was in 2005—USD 4,941.6 million—it represents only 25.3 percent of GDP.
        The policies that are being implemented today have the following features in common with
policies that were implemented in the 1970s:

   Nationalization of the enterprises in strategic sectors (oil and energy).

   Economy based on the role of the state as producer (state capitalism in the 1970s), where the
    surplus generated by strategic enterprises was used (or was intended to be used) to finance
    other enterprises.

   Adoption of a fixed exchange rate policy that led to an overvaluation of the local currency.

   Ambitious investment plans that did not clearly identify the sources of financing or the
    profitability of projects.

   Increasing fiscal deficits, mainly due to the increase in the deficit of public enterprises.

   Fall in reserves due to an expansion of domestic credit.

These similarities in policies lead us to ask, Is the Bolivian economy heading toward a balance of
payments crisis?

4. Budget accounting analysis for Bolivia

Our analysis of budget accounting for Bolivia uses debt data from the Banco Central de Bolivia
because they cover a longer period than alternative sources such as the World Bank’s International
Debt Statistics.
        Recall that during the 1970s, Bolivia borrowed large amounts from private lenders. The
capacity for negotiation with these creditors fell as the country increased its debt. Therefore,
Bolivia had no other option but to contract loans with more severe conditions, which means that
interest rates were higher and maturities were lower. This is exactly what happened in the early
1980s: there was a rise in world interest rates, and most of the loans that Bolivia contracted in the

                                                  21
1970s reached their maturity. This fact, associated with the incapacity of the country to generate
foreign resources and large fiscal deficits, set the stage for the subsequent crisis.
           In the 1990s, with the consolidation of structural reforms and the change in international
creditors, maturities started to rise and interest rates decreased. By the end of the decade, interest
rates were on average 3 percent and maturity was fifteen years on average. It is important to
mention also that these credit conditions changed to conditions even more favorable for the
Bolivian government with the debt forgiveness and reductions that benefited Bolivia during the
1990s.16
           Between 1988 and 2000, there was an increase in debt contracted under multiple
currencies, but most of this debt was contracted in US dollars. In 2005, 75 percent of total debt
was in dollars. Debt contracted in deutsche marks never reached more than 10 percent of total debt,
and debt contracted in yen reached its highest share of 13.7 percent in 1994.
           We have modified the budget equation in Kehoe, Nicolini, and Sargent (2010) to
incorporate not only nominal and indexed internal debt but also dollar internal debt, as Bolivia has
a bimonetary system, and the Banco Central de Bolivia as well as the National Treasury can issue
debt in dollars or in bolivianos.
           The government began to issue internal debt in 1988, which became important in 1996
after the pension reform. With the new pension system, the newly created pension funds used
Treasury bonds as the major way to invest their funds. In fact, the pension system was thought of
as a system that could serve as a source of financing for the government as well as a system that
could generate the incentives for the creation of a stock market in Bolivia. Currently, the pension
funds not only serve as a major source of financing for the government, as they have bought around
25 percent of the government sovereign bonds issued in 2017, but also now represent the main
source of liquidity for the financial system.17
           Between 1988 and 2000, most of the internal debt was also debt from the Banco Central
de Bolivia, issued to sterilize the monetary effects of the high accumulation of international
reserves through open market operations. In Bolivia, a significant share of internal debt in local
currency is not issued for financing needs but to control excessive liquidity.

     Bolivia issued sovereign bonds in 2012, 2013, and 2017 for USD 1,000 million each.

                                                          22
        Figure 19 depicts the evolution of internal and external debt as a share of GDP since 1993.
Notice that, since 2003, the stock of external debt as a share of GDP decreased, while the stock of
internal debt as a share of GDP increased until 2004. Internal debt was even larger than external
debt between 2007 and 2012.
        Our budget accounting starts with the year-by-year budget constraint of the government in
nominal domestic currency:

                  Bt + bt Pt + Btd Et + Bt* Et + M t =
                                                                                                                       (4)
                     ( Dt + X t ) Pt + Bt-1 Rt-1 + bt-1rt-1 Pt + Btd-1 Rtd-1 Et + Bt*-1 Rt*-1 Et + M t-1

where Bt is nominal internal debt, Mt is the stock of money, bt is indexed internal debt, Btd is

dollar-indexed internal debt and Bt* is the dollar external debt, Pt is the price level, Et is the

nominal exchange rate, Rt, rt, and Rtd are the gross returns on nominal, indexed, and dollar-

denominated internal debt and Rt* is the gross return on external debt, Dt is the deficit of the

general government, and Xt is the residual. We are not sure what the residual exactly includes, but
it certainly includes the deficit of the public enterprises.
        If we assume that Xt represents only the deficit of public enterprises, we can consider Dt+Xt
as the deficit of the nonfinancial public sector, for which we only have information since 1980.
Since we have information on the central and general government since 1960, however, we
calculate Xt as a residual. Unfortunately, this residual—which represents a measure of our
ignorance—is large in some periods.
        We can write the budget constraint in terms of real GDP as

                                                                                                       æ     1 ö÷

is the ratio of external debt to GDP and xt qtd is defined similarly. In both of these terms we factor
out the real exchange rate, ξt. The last two terms on the left-hand side of equation (5) represent
increases in high-powered money and seigniorage. The first two terms on the right-hand side
represent the deficit of the general government and the residual as a fraction of output, respectively,
and the final four terms measure the real net service costs on all types of debt adjusted by GDP
growth.18
         To understand better the debt issuance terms for dollar-indexed internal debt and external
debt in budget accounting equation (5), we decompose the issuance term for external debt as

                                xt (qt* - qt*-1 ) = (xt qt* - xt-1qt*-1 ) - qt*-1 (xt - xt-1 ) .                   (8)

Of course, an analogous decomposition applies to dollar-indexed internal debt. The first term in
this decomposition tells us how much the value of external debt as a fraction of GDP changed from
year t−1 to year t. The second term tells us how much of this change in value was due to the
change in the real exchange rate. As we have seen in figure 2, much of the year-to-year changes
in the ratio of external debt to GDP, (xt qt* - xt-1qt*-1 ) are due to real exchange rate fluctuations, and
our term for the issuance of external debt factors this out. As we have discussed, the value of
external debt increased from 45.1 percent of Bolivian GDP in 1981 to 100.4 percent in 1982. Of
this increase of 55.3 percentage points (pp), we account for 51.4 pp by the revaluation term
qt*-1 (xt - xt-1 ) , that is, by the real exchange rate depreciation. Our debt issuance term is the
difference, 3.9 pp. Bolivian external debt increased by 5.7 percent in dollar terms between 1981
and 1982. Our external debt issuance adjusts this term downwards because of US inflation of 6.2
percent and adjusts it upwards because of −4.4 percent Bolivian real GDP growth.19




18
   The term tW is the inflation in the dollar price level of traded goods consumed in Bolivia; as we do not have that
information, we have used the inflation of the United States.
19
   The adjustments work out additively to one decimal point, 3.9 = 5.7 – 6.2 – (–4.4), but this is a matter of luck and
of the adjustments being small. The adjustments for growth and foreign inflation are multiplicative, not additive.

                                                              24
                       For each year, we compute the terms in equation (5), and the accounting results are reported
           in table 2. The numbers in table 2 are in units of percentage of GDP per year. That is, we calculate
           the terms in equation (5) for every year in the period 1960–2017 and then average over periods
           and subperiods.

                       Table 2 highlights the role of seigniorage as a source of financing. In the period 1960–
           1977, it covered 60 percent of financing needs, and in the period 1977–1986, it covered 61 percent.
           During the debt crisis, increases in external debt compared to GDP accounted for 4.59 pp of
           financing needs on average, but, as we have discussed above, this number factors out the enormous
           increase in the value of debt compared to GDP caused by real depreciation.
                       Notice that, during most of the entire period, the contribution to obligations of the net
           service costs on external debt has been negative, except between 1977 and 1986, the period of the
           debt crisis, when Bolivia defaulted several times and with different creditors. These negative
           service costs on debt mean that, except during the period from 1977 to 1986, US inflation and
           Bolivian GDP growth were higher than the interest rate on external debt. In fact, interest rates were
           subsidized in the sense that there were concessional terms on much of the external debt, mainly
           multilateral. Thus, the real interest payments of Bolivia were negative, as we have already seen in
           the data in figure 7.
                       It is noteworthy that the deficits of public enterprises—if we assume that they make up
           most of the residual—were the largest component of financing needs for the government between
           1960 and 1977. By dividing this period in two, we can see that the deficit of the general government
           was not important between 1960 and 1971, but it became more important between 1971 and 1977.

                                                                                  25
This is a sign that changes in government policies during the rapid growth period of 1960–1977
explain much of the debt crisis of the mid-1980s.
       During the debt crisis, the deficit of the general government became the most important
component of obligations, representing 6.53 pp of financing needs. The deficits of the public
enterprises—that is, the residual—represented only 1.72 pp because the general government
absorbed the obligations of the public enterprises, as most of them were on the edge of bankruptcy.
       The fiscal reform implemented in 1986 managed to reduce the importance of the deficit of
the general government in financing needs between 1986 and 1996. In fact, the deficit of the
general government fell to only 0.50 pp between 1986 and 1998, but then it increased to 3.75 pp
during the financial crisis. As we mentioned in section 3, the increase in the fiscal deficit was a
major cause of the financial crisis. This increased contribution was offset by an increasing
contribution of the surpluses of public enterprises—the residual of 3.59 pp—between 1998 and
2002. In fact, these surpluses are mostly explained by the privatization policy that the different
governments implemented during the 1990s, which reduced current expenditures and revenues.
       Notice that in the period of recovery and growth of 1986–1998 and the period of the
financial crisis of 1998–2002, financing needs were negative: −0.09 pp and −0.31 pp, respectively.
This reinforces our conclusion that the structural reforms implemented between 1986 and 1998
helped to mitigate the impact of the financial crisis of the late 1990s: although the government
deficit was high, public enterprises had a surplus, and therefore the financing needs were negative.
       External debt as a source of financing turned negative in 1986 because Bolivia started to
pay its debt to different types of creditors, as already seen in table 1. External debt fell by
approximately 20 pp between the years 1989 and 2006, which is mainly explained by the MDRI.
       During the period of nationalization and growth of 2002–2017, the residual, which we
interpret as mostly the net income from public enterprises, shows a deficit of 1.88 pp in contrast
to the period 1998–2002 when it showed a surplus. Moreover, the deficit of public enterprises
increased to 3.02 pp in the period 2006–2017 (see Linares Calderón 2018). This large deficit is
compensated by a surplus of the general government of 0.22 pp and also by the other obligations
(internal and external debt service) that have negative signs. That is why we observe only a small
increase in total obligations from 0.85 pp in 2002–2017 to 0.92 pp in 2006–2017.
       In the period 2006–2017, we can also observe that there is an increase in money issuance
(1.38 pp) as a source of financing. This is explained not only by “bolivianization” (the opposite of


                                                26
dollarization), which allowed real money demand to increase (see Cerezo and Ticona 2017), but
also by an increase in income due to economic growth. Bolivianization also allowed the
government to increase internal debt in local currency as a source of financing. In the period 1986–
1998, it represented only 0.08 pp, whereas in the period 2002–2017, it represented 0.45 pp.
            The issuance of internal debt indexed to the cost of living was an important source of
financing during the financial crisis period, but in the next period, it was reduced and represented
a negative source of financing. The same occurred with the internal debt in dollars, which
represented −1.02 pp during the last period.
            Until now, we have described the results using the residual as the public enterprises deficit,
but being a residual, it can and does include other things. Figure 20 shows the comparison between
the residual and a constructed residual, which is the sum of variables that we think that the residual
includes: the reported deficits of public enterprises, changes in international reserves, capital
transfers, unidentified expenses, and the negative of donations received. Notice in figure 20 that
the fit between the residual and the constructed residual is very good at the beginning and end of
the period. In particular, the constructed residual explains most of the residual between 1960 and
1967 and between 2008 and 2017. Over the entire period 1960 to 2017, the correlation between
the residual and the constructed residual is 0.33. The average value of the residual over the entire
period 1960 to 2017 is 1.84 pp while the average value of the constructed residual is 1.03 pp.
Consequently, the part of the residual that we are unable to explain averages 0.81 pp per year. This
means that, on average, there were expenditures or transfers or losses of public enterprises that
were not recorded that amounted to 0.81 percent of GDP per year on average.
            This residual includes transfers or contingent liabilities. In the Bolivian case, we
hypothesize that four are of particular interest:

      The deficits of the public enterprises were not computed correctly. Much of the time,
       investment was not accounted for—only the flows of income and expenditures. Often the sales
       income of these enterprises was used to finance the general government expenditures, and
       these transfers were also not accounted for in the balance sheets of these enterprises. Another
       problem was that most of these enterprises suffered corruption problems, and their balances
       did not reflect the true situation of the enterprises.20


20
     Almost reliable, or at least consistent, data for public enterprises can be found starting in 1980.

                                                              27
    Since 2002, Bolivia has accumulated international reserves as never before: from 10.8 percent
     of GDP in 2002 to 40.5 percent in 2007. This accumulation of reserves reached its maximum
     point in 2012 at 51.4 percent of GDP.

    Bolivia has always received donations from foreign governments and from international
     organizations such as the United States Agency for International Development. Most of the
     time, these donations were aimed at attacking poverty through specific projects and programs.

    Some expenses appear as unidentified in the balance of the nonfinancial public sector. These
     are also potential contingent liabilities.

         In figure 20, we see that our attempts to account for the residual with our constructed
residual do particularly poorly during the periods from 1968 to 1973, from 1986 to 1987, from
1992 to 1996, and from 2006 to 2007. During the early 1970s, we cannot do much in accounting
for the residual because we do not have any data for public enterprises. In 1986 and 1987, the
problem could be that different exchange rates (the official rate and the parallel rate) were used in
different accounts. Between 1992 and 1996, the problem was probably in accounting for the
receipts of privatizations. In 2006 and 2007, the problem was probably in accounting for the costs
of nationalizations. Here are some of our hypotheses:

    The net income of public enterprises is not very well measured. The accounts of public
     enterprises are not transparent because of corruption or because the government wanted to hide
     the true state of the public companies. For instance, many public enterprises report their cash
     flows, but they do not report their investment or capital expenditures.21 It is noteworthy that
     the press release summarizing the IMF executive board’s 2018 article IV consultation with
     Bolivia concludes, “[The Directors] encouraged further reforms, including … reforming the
     legislative framework governing state-owned enterprises[,] and including the activities of all
     subsidiaries in the fiscal accounts of the non-financial public sector” (International Monetary
     Fund 2018).

    The receipts of privatizations during the 1990s should have been accounted for as a decrease
     in assets and therefore as an increase in net liabilities. In the accounts of the NFPS, however,


21
  See UDAPE (1986) for a discussion of these issues for public enterprises during the 1970s. See Linares Calderón
(2018) for an analysis of current intragovernmental transfers that are neither properly measured nor publicly presented.

                                                          28
     they cannot be identified, and it seems that they were not accounted for, at least not in that
     way. Conversely, the nationalization process in recent years did not involve a confiscation of
     the private companies; rather, they were bought by the state. For instance, in the hydrocarbon
     sector, the nationalization of strategic companies began on May 1, 2006, with the approval of
     Supreme Decree 28071, which allowed the Bolivian state, through YPFB (the public oil
     company), to recover “ownership, possession and total and absolute control” of the country’s
     hydrocarbon resources. For this purpose, the decree forced the purchase of the total or majority
     shareholding in the companies Chaco, Andina, Transredes, Petrobras Bolivia Refining (PBR),
     and Compañía Logística de Hidrocarburos de Bolivia (CLHB). The same mechanism was
     applied in the other sectors, and therefore until 2010, the state had already paid USD 476
     million. These costs are also not accounted for in the NFPS accounts.

    During the 1970s, the government’s operations of three state banks—Banco Minero, Banco
     Agrícola, and Banco del Estado—were not well accounted for. These banks were intended to
     give credit to producers but were captured by special interest groups that siphoned off the loans
     for their own use. These banks granted loans without sufficient guarantees, and, of course,
     most of them were not repaid. It has yet to be determined how many of these unpaid liabilities
     were effectively assumed by the Bolivian central government or by the Banco Central de
     Bolivia.22

    From 1981 to 1986, the Bolivian government, like many other Latin American governments
     during this period, utilized a system of dual exchange rates. Figure 21 depicts the behavior of
     the official exchange rate and the parallel exchange rate determined by the market. The parallel
     rate was 85 percent higher than the official rate on average from 1981 to 1986. During 1985,
     it was 383 percent higher on average and was 1,616 percent higher in August 1985. In our
     budget accounting, we have used the parallel exchange rate for the nominal exchange rate Et
     in the budget constraint (4) and used it to calculate the real exchange rate ξt in the budget
     accounting equation (5). If the government forced exporters or foreign investors to buy
     domestic currency at the official rate, this was an implicit tax on exports or foreign investment.

22
  In theory, the debt of these banks was assumed by the Banco Central de Bolivia, following Supreme Decree 21660.
In 1989, and according to Supreme Decree 22194, the debts of the Banco del Estado, Banco Minero, and Banco
Agrícola were around USD 46 million, USD 32 million, and USD 116 million, respectively. This was a debt of around
USD 194 million, without considering judiciary costs and charges for defaulted payments (Peres Arenas, Antezana,
and Peres-Cajías 2013).

                                                       29
     If the government allowed some importers to buy dollars at the official rate, this was an implicit
     subsidy on their imports. We do not have data on these taxes and subsidies, so they end up in
     the residual. If we redo the budget accounting using the official exchange rate rather than the
     parallel exchange rate, we find that the only differences in table 2 occur during the period
     1977–1986: both sources and obligations decline from 9.87 pp to 8.80 pp; in sources, this
     decrease is accounted for by the contribution of external debt decreasing from 4.59 pp to 3.52
     pp; in obligations, it is accounted for by the contribution of the external service costs decreasing
     from 1.63 pp to 0.69 pp and the residual decreasing from 1.71 pp to 1.58 pp. We prefer to use
     the budget accounting with the parallel exchange rate because it gives us a more accurate
     measure of how external debt increased compared to GDP. The difference in the residual
     between the budget accounting using the parallel rate and that using the official rate, 0.13 pp,
     gives us a rough idea of the net of the implicit subsidies minus implicit taxes imposed by the
     dual exchange rates. Notice that this is the average yearly net subsidy over the entire period
     1977–1986. It was much higher in 1983, when it was 3.79 pp.

    During the 1990s, there was something called gastos reservados (reserved expenditures),
     which were intended to be used in the battle against drug trafficking. Later, these reserved
     expenses were also used as a way to give special but unofficial payments to public servants.23
     Perhaps part of these expenditures are accounted for in the so-called unidentified expenses.
     We do not know what these unidentified expenses represent today.

    The deficit depicted in table 2 represents the primary deficit of the general government, but the
     data for the internal debt represent only the internal debt of the National Treasury. In addition,
     we have data for internal debt only since 1993. We lack data for internal debt after 1993 for
     local and regional governments.

5.   Conclusions

In this paper, we have analyzed the modern economic history of Bolivia, with an emphasis on the
monetary and fiscal policies that have been implemented between 1960 and 2017. We have
identified five distinct periods. The first period, one of stabilization and rapid growth, runs from
1960 to 1977. The second period, characterized by a debt crisis and hyperinflation, runs from 1977

23
  These expenditures were used to eradicate the coca plants under the Plan Dignidad. Some estimates indicate that
this plan caused an outflow of USD 500 million from the economy.

                                                       30
to 1986. The third period runs from 1986 to 1998 and is a period of recovery and slow growth.
The fourth period runs from 1998 to 2002 and is characterized by a financial crisis. The final period
runs from 2002 to 2017 and is one of growth but is also notable for the nationalizations that the
government implemented. In a brief description of the fiscal policies implemented in these periods,
it has been possible to identify the close relation between fiscal policy and external debt. In fact,
we have described the evolution of the external debt in Bolivia because it has determined the
interaction between fiscal and monetary policy in Bolivia.
         In addition, we have performed a growth accounting exercise for the whole period, which
has enabled us to identify TFP as the main element that explains the deviations from the balanced
growth path. A goal for future research is to analyze how fiscal and monetary policies could
explain these deviations, and what their effects have been on TFP in the different periods of
analysis. As a conclusion, we can say that if the evolution of debt has determined the way fiscal
and monetary policies were conducted in Bolivia, it might be important to explain the evolution
of the growth rate. For example, the constraints that the debt policy implied in the mid-1980s might
have dampened growth in the period after the crisis. We need a model and data analysis to show
this, as growth could also explain the evolution of debt as well as the evolution of fiscal and
monetary policy.
         The budget accounting exercise carried out in the previous section allows us to see that the
fiscal deficit and the accumulation of debt in the period of stabilization and growth (1960–1977)
explains much of the debt crisis of the 1980s. In particular, we see that, in the 1970s, the deficit of
public companies became important, and at the same time, external debt grew in importance as a
source of financing. We also see that governments frequently resorted to seigniorage as a source
of financing.
         We hope that this study will contribute to the analysis of economic history in Bolivia.
Currently, we lack a detailed and comprehensive analysis of the country’s modern economic
history based on a rigorous analysis of data and on quantitative models.24
         The current economic situation in Bolivia displays similarities with that of the 1970s. There
is a fixed exchange rate, international reserves are falling, and the fiscal deficit is growing. If the

  Most of the recent literature on Bolivian economic history focuses on a description of economic events, but not with
an appropriate analysis of data that could substantiate these descriptions. For example, Machicado (2010) describes
modern economic history, but from the point of view of policymakers.

government does not take corrective measures, this situation could end up in a balance of payments
crisis, as agents begin to perceive that international reserves are running out and that the Banco
Central de Bolivia will not be able to sustain the de facto fixed exchange rate.

Appendix: Economic history of Bolivia before 1960

Bolivia became an independent republic in 1825 and was one of the last countries in Latin America
to achieve its independence from Spain. As a Spanish colony, Bolivia—in particular, its city of
Potosi—was economically important. In 1650, Potosi had 160,000 inhabitants and was larger than
Paris or New York. Its main economic activity was mining, particularly silver extraction (Bakewell
1985; Menegus Bornemann 1999).
       Despite the economic importance of Potosi and the surrounding region (Assadourian
1982), Bolivia emerged as a country with many difficulties and a lack of integration, with the
majority of its population being indigenous and poor (Klein 2011a; Pentland 1975). During the
following decades, the country was characterized by political instability (Barragán 2002).
Although this instability was tamed by the end of the nineteenth century, the country lost
significant pieces of its original territory up until the early 1930s through wars with its neighbors
(Fifer 1972). Furthermore, despite having vast natural resources, particularly minerals, Bolivia did
not manage to consolidate a national market until 1952, when the National Revolution took place
(Peres-Cajías 2017; Rodríguez Ostria 1994; Sandoval et al. 2003). The most important economic
features of the National Revolution were the nationalization of mineral extraction and the
distribution of agricultural lands to peasants.
       The process of market integration in both geographic and social terms was accompanied
by other radical economic transformations that, in turn, were related to sweeping political changes
(Zondag 1966). These transformations had long-lasting, persistent effects (Grindle and Domingo
2003). Economic historians traditionally date Bolivia’s modern economic history as starting with
the economic transformation that followed the 1952 National Revolution. For the sake of
consistency with the other papers written as part of the Monetary and Fiscal History of Latin
America project, however, we start our history in 1960.
       Bolivia is a clear example of a “reversal of fortune” (Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson
2002): it was among the most important economic territories during colonial times and today is
among the poorest countries in the region. For example, the Bolivian GDP per capita as a share of
US GDP per capita has declined from 20 percent in 1950 to 12 percent currently; likewise, it has
declined from 51 percent of the Chilean GDP per capita to 24 percent during the same time span.
The rate of decline, however, has not been constant throughout time (Herranz-Loncán and Peres-
Cajías 2016). Indeed, the economic gap between Bolivia and the most dynamic economies in the

                                                  37
Americas increased during the nineteenth century and during two specific periods in the twentieth
century: the 1950s and the 1980s.
       This concentration of the Bolivian divergence in certain periods can clearly be seen in the
distinct periods of Bolivian economic history, as shown in figure 22. In the nineteenth century, the
existence of a constant low economic dynamism stands out. For instance, the available evidence
on Bolivian GDP per capita shows an annual average growth rate around 0.7 percent from 1846 to
1900. Alternative indicators, such as population growth and levels of urbanization, also point to a
(absolute and relative) low economic dynamism. Up to the 1870s, this process seems to be
explained by the difficulties in overcoming the economic and political instability brought about by
the direct and indirect costs of independence (Langer 2009; Mitre 1981; Prado 1995; Prados de la
Escosura 2009). From the 1870s onward, backwardness is related to the relatively small size of
the mining export sector, the most dynamic sector of the economy.
       Economic growth accelerated during the first third of the twentieth century, thanks to the
constant expansion of tin exports. The consolidation of tin as the main export product was in turn
related to infrastructure expansion and state support for export activities (Contreras 2003; Mitre
1993; Peres-Cajías 2017). This period also featured major political changes, such as the
centralization and expansion of education spending and the progressive centralization of money
issuance (Peres-Cajías 2014). In spite of this progress, economic imbalances were noticeable:
export concentration in a single product and few producers increased the negative effects of
commodities volatility and the dependence on very specific economic agents (Peres-Cajías and
Carreras-Marín 2017); the economic dynamism in the western part of the country sharply
contrasted with the stagnation in the east (Rodríguez Ostria 1994); the modernization of the export
sector was contemporaneous to a backward agrarian sector dominated by few landowners and
dispersed indigenous communities (Larsson 1988); and political voice as well as economic rights
were unfairly distributed (Klein 2011b). After the economic crisis generated by the Great
Depression and the Chaco War of 1932–1935, economic dynamism resumed, thanks again to tin
exports and industrial production, which for the first time in Bolivian history became relevant. The
war and postwar political instability, however, increased the political pressure toward state
involvement in the economy. Because of this and the inability to increase revenues in the short
term, macroeconomic instability increased in the late 1930s and early 1940s. Moreover, in spite of
the resumption of positive economic growth, economic imbalances persisted.


                                                38
       The National Revolution of 1952 sought to overcome these imbalances through radical
reforms: it nationalized the three biggest mining companies and created a new state-owned mining
company (COMIBOL); it pursued an agrarian reform that radically changed land ownership in the
western part of the country by distributing land to farmers and releasing farmers from debts to
landowners; it redistributed state resources to the eastern part of the country, in the form of
infrastructure investment (mainly roads), state-owned-companies, and soft loans; and it promoted
industrial production through the redistribution of cheap foreign exchange (Sandoval et al. 2003;
Zondag 1966). Initially, however, these structural reforms generated an economic downturn. On
the one hand, economic agents had to adjust to the new economic structure. For instance, small
farmers did not have the same skills as landowners regarding agricultural production (Dirección
Nacional de Informaciones 1962). On the other hand, the heterodox financing state expansion had
negative consequences: the Bolivian government applied an overvalued exchange rate on
COMIBOL revenues that were redistributed to other economic agents through an undervalued
exchange rate. This measure, as well as the determination to increase the wages of miners (key
political allies) and to contract those miners who lost their jobs in the previous years, widened the
company deficits. Thereafter, these deficits were financed through direct loans from the Banco
Central de Bolivia, which were backed by inorganic emission, that is, by printing domestic
currency not backed by accumulating foreign reserves. This, in turn, increased inflation to rates
that were higher than 100 percent in 1953 and 1956, higher than 50 percent in 1954 and 1955, and
close to hyperinflation rates in some months during these years (Peres-Cajías 2014).
       The initial macroeconomic shake-up of the 1952 revolution was tamed by an orthodox
stabilization plan pursued with the close cooperation of the US government and the International
Monetary Fund at the end of 1956. The stabilization plan comprised the elimination of price
controls, the unification of the exchange rate, a tax reform, and a plan of wage setting in public
companies. Thanks to these changes, the structural reforms of the revolution were not reversed,
and state intervention continued but with stable macroeconomic backing.
