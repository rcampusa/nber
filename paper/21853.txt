                                            ABSTRACT

The 2008 financial crisis did not precipitate global retaliatory trade intervention, in seeming contrast
to the Great Depression in 1930s. This paper discusses the influence of model structure in optimal
tariff (OT) calculations in explaining this puzzle. We emphasize how earlier literature reports high
optimal tariffs in numerical calculation (of a hundred of percent) but only uses simple trade models.
We use numerical general equilibrium calibration and simulation methodology to calculate optimal
tariffs both with and without retaliation in a series of observationally equivalent models, and explore
the influence of model structures on optimal tariff levels. We gradually add more realistic features
into basic general equilibrium model, and show sharply decline optimal tariffs, which suggests that
trade retaliation incentives effectively disappear with the deepening of globalization in 2008 compared
to 1930.

1. Introduction


    To trade economists it remains as a seeming puzzle that the global economy can

have passed through the 2008 financial crisis without an outbreak of retaliatory trade

intervention in the form of trade barriers being constructed to protect national markets

and employment. While it is the case that cooperative arrangements were in place to

present such occurrence, such as bound tariffs in the WTO and WTO codes in such

areas as government procurement and subsidies, the parallels drawn at the time to the

1930’s including the retaliatory beggar this neighbor trade policies suggested that the

pressures for intervention in the face of such a sharp trade shock would be

overwhelming.


    In this paper we offer a possible explanation for this seeming non-occurrence of

trade retaliation. First, we point out that retaliatory trade measures in the 1930’s have

over the years been somewhat overstated in terms of their severity. The most dramatic

step occurred with the US Smoot-Hawley tariff in the spring of 1929 which was well

before the large trade shock which followed. This was then followed by a single round

of localized and product specific tariff retaliation in a number of European countries,

which, over time, triggered no further tariff response. Rather, what followed at the

height of the trade compression was a series of competitive devaluations designed to

protect employment.


    Secondly, and as the heart of the paper, we suggest the prevalent view of the

imminence of an outbreak of trade retaliation in the 2008/2009 was in part based on a


                                           3
literature that only analyzed trade retaliation in a sharply restricted set of models

which if modified to add more realism produce progressively less and less retaliation.

In essence, trade models with progressive features of realism added produce shrinking

optimal tariffs and so today’s globalized world compared to the 1930s produce no

retaliation.


     We begin by reviewing literature both on the 1930’s and optimal tariffs, long

associated with the classic paper by Johnson (1953-1954). We then turn to the

literature from the 1970’s and later (up to today) which uses general equilibrium

models to compute optimal tariffs. These models, which all use the Armington

product heterogeneity by country assumption produce optimal tariffs in the global

economy which after retaliation are often in the range of a hundred percent.


     We then turn to numerical simulation and first generate a data set of country trade,

production and consumption for 2013 which incorporates the US, the EU, China,

Japan, India, Brazil and ROW (rest of the world). This data set is used to calibrate a

series of nested but progressively more complex models which are all observation

equivalent in that they calibrate to the same data. We produce supporting

parameterizations for each model in the nested structure. For each model in the nest

we are able to compute optimal tariffs and in the process calibrate to literature based

import demand elasticities. Throughout the nesting hierarchy all models are calibrated

to the same data and elasticities. Our calculations of optimal tariffs with those models

show optimal tariffs fall from the hundreds of percent to single digits by using more

complex models and hence to trade barriers of little consequence. This suggests the

                                           4
explanation for the non-occurrence of trade retaliation of the 2008 lies in the overly

simple models used in earlier optimal tariff literature.


    The hierarchy of models we use to show the shrinking optimal tariffs run from a

pure exchange Armington to a homogeneous goods model with production. Then we

add features of cross border ownership of capital, multi-country models, pairwise

trade costs, added trade imbalances, and the lastly homogeneous goods structures.

Each of the steps generates a reduction in computed optimal tariffs. These we suggest

supports our theme of the overstatement in literature of the threat of trade retaliation

at times of financial crisis as in 2008.


    The paper is structured as follows. In the second section we review literature on

the 1930s and on optimal tariffs. The next section describes our model experiments

and we discuss the concepts of observation equivalence and supporting

parameterizations in the hierarchy of nested models we use. We then calculate optimal

tariffs with different model structures. The last see our conclusions.

2. Literature Review


    The Great Depression of the 1930s is widely believed to be marked by an

outbreak of severe protection trade policies. The proliferation of higher tariffs, import

quotas, and foreign exchange controls are then all thought to have contributed to a

collapse of international trade. These import restrictions, combined with preferential

trade blocs are thought to have, destroyed the relative open, non-discriminatory world

trading system (Irwin, 2012). A numbers of papers explore role of various factors in

the trade collapse in the 1930s. Barry and Sachs (1985) analyze exchange rates and

their influence to economic recovery. Kindleberger (1986) explores the 1929-1939

world trade depression. Hamilton (1987) studies monetary factors in the Great

Depression. Bernanke (1995) analyzes the macroeconomics of the Great Depression.

Eichengreen and Irwin (1995) study world trade in 1930s involving trade blocs and

currency blocs. A rise in protectionism in 1930s is in most accounts of the period,

some countries raised tariffs sharply, they also imposed controls on foreign exchange

transactions, while others tightened trade restrictions only marginally (Eichengreen

and Irwin, 2010).


    Optimal tariffs are related to this literature. We show a shrinking optimal tariffs

follows by adding more realistic modelling assumptions into the model structure and

perhaps explains why the 2008 financial crisis avoided retaliatory trade intervention.

How different model structures influence optimal tariff is the main contribution of this

paper. First, we offer a review literatures of optimal tariff literature.


                                              6
    Optimal tariff literature is not as voluminous as work on other trade topics. Graaf

(1949-1950), Johnson (1953-1954), Gorman (1958) and Kuga (1973) are early papers

which analyze optimal tariffs in two-country pure exchange models and conclude that

optimal tariffs equal the inverse of the export supply elasticity. Eaton and Grossman

(1985) analyzes optimal tariffs when domestic markets are incomplete. Kennan and

Riezman (1988) show theoretically that big countries can win tariff wars and have

larger optimal tariffs. Lapan (1988) takes account of production and consumption

when analyzing optimal tariffs. Grossman and Helpman (1995) introduce political

economy considerations to explore the structure of protection in non-cooperative and

cooperative tariff policy equilibria. Syropoulos (2002) analyzes how and why

monopoly power and country size influence optimal tariffs.


    Later numerical studies of optimal tariffs can be divided into two parts. One uses

econometric methodology to calculate optimal tariffs. As the optimal tariff equals the

inverse of the export supply elasticity, papers compute optimal tariffs by estimating

inverse export supply elasticities. Broda et al. (2008), for instance, build an optimal

tariff theory for a new trade theory structure (imperfect competition and scale

economies) and calculates export supply elasticities and optimal tariffs. Soderbery

(2014) assumes that exporters have heterogeneous supply elasticities and estimates

these elasticity values with a structural estimator, and then computes optimal tariffs.


    The second part uses numerical model calibration and simulation methodology to

calculate optimal tariffs. Hamilton and Whalley (1983) were the first to numerically

calculate optimal tariffs with general equilibrium (GE) using calibration and

                                            7
simulation methods. Markusen and Wigle (1989) calculate bilateral optimal tariffs for

the US and Canada, and explore the roles of country size, scale economies and capital

mobility for Nash equilibrium tariffs. Perroni and Whalley (2000) calculate

post-retaliation Nash tariffs by region and use them to analyze country gains and

losses from regional agreements and trade liberalization. Ossa (2011) calculates

non-cooperative tariffs numerically in a “new trade” theory structure and analyzes

GATT/WTO negotiations. Whalley et al. (2011), Yu and Zhang (2011) use an inside

money trade imbalance model structure to numerically calculate optimal tariffs. More

recently Ossa (2014) uses a “new trade” model structure and incorporates political

economy factors to numerically calculate optimal tariff, trade war equilibrium tariff

and trade talk equilibrium tariff.


     Early theoretical papers conclude that optimal tariffs simply equal the inverse of

the export supply elasticity. Beyond this, none of them explores the influence of

model structure on optimal tariffs in a comprehensive way. This paper uses different

model structures to numerically calculate optimal tariffs and shows that more realistic

assumptions in the model can generate sharply lower optimal tariffs, which can

perhaps help explain why retaliatory trade intervention did not occur in the 2008

financial crisis.

3. GE Models, Data, Calibration and Calculation of Optimal Tariffs


     We describe our numerical general equilibrium (GE) models, benchmark data

used for calibration and counterfactual simulation, and optimal tariff calculation

methodology in this part.


     3.1 General Equilibrium Model Structures


    We use different model structures to calculate optimal tariffs, from Armington

goods general equilibrium models to homogeneous goods general equilibrium models.

For the Armington goods models, we begin with pure exchange structures and

gradually include production and foreign ownership of capital, then we extend to

multi-country model structures and include trade cost, exogenous trade imbalance and

monetary trade imbalance step by step. For the Homogeneous goods models, we have

pure exchange structure, with production GE structure, and exogenous fixed trade

imbalance structure with production.


    3.1.1 Simple Armington Goods GE Models


    The basic structure of our simple models have two countries, two goods

(manufacturing goods and non-manufacturing goods) and two input factors (labor and

capital), see Figure 1. Simple Armington goods GE models include pure exchange

structure and with production structure.


     In the pure exchange models group, two countries are sequentially and separately

identified as the US and ROW (Rest of the World), the EU (European Union) and


                                           9
ROW, and China and ROW. The two goods are manufacturing goods and non-traded

non-manufacturing goods. Each country has an endowment of goods. We assume

preference functions are CES (Constant Elasticity of Substitution) style. In the

Armington goods models, goods from different countries are heterogeneous and there

is an elasticity of substitution, in the preference function which is two-level CES. In

the equilibrium, goods markets will clear, and goods prices are determined by

demands and supply.

                     Figure 1: Nesting Structure of Simple Armington Goods GE Models

   Source: Compiled by authors.



     In simple GE models with production, both production and consumption are

included. The models are again two-country two-goods and two-factor structures. The

preference functions are two-level CES, the production functions are CES (see Figure

1). In the equilibrium, goods and factor markets in every country clear.


     In these simple models, trade are balanced, which means every country’s total

exports equals its total imports in value terms.


    3.1.2 Simple Armington Models with Foreign Ownership of Capital


     We add foreign ownership of capital assumption into simple Armington general



                                                   10
equilibrium model with production. Basic structures are two-country two-goods and

two-factor general equilibrium, where labor is mobile between industries but

immobile between countries. In order to introduce foreign ownership of capital

assumption, we assume that capital is mobile between both industries and countries,

which means capital used in the production may come from either domestic country

or foreign country. Under this assumption, the production and consumption function

structures are shown in Figure 2.

    There are some different methods to incorporate international ownership of

capital into a global applied general equilibrium model. Francois et al. (1996) and

Walmsley (1998) attempts at simple comparative static models. Willenbrockel (1999)

uses a two-country model to incorporate capital cross-ownership. Ianchovichina and

McDougall (2001), and Walmsley (2002) extend the structure in the dynamic GTAP

model. These assumptions regarding capital mobility differ significantly. The method

for incorporating foreign ownership of capital in our paper are simple and directly. We

assume that capital are homogeneous and mobile between countries, capital demand

in the production may come from different countries.


                                                      11
    3.1.3 Multi-country Armington GE Models


    In the multi-country GE model, all of production and consumption structures are

the same as the simple two-country case with production in our paper, only extension

is that the model here has more countries, specifically we have seven countries which

are China, the US, the EU, India, Japan, Brazil and ROW.


    3.1.4 Multi-country Armington Models with Trade Cost


    All production and consumption side structures are the same as in multi-country

models. Trade cost can be divided into tariff and non-tariff barrier, tariff generate

revenue but non-tariff barrier does not generate revenue. We assume importers need to

use real resources to cover the non-tariff costs involved, these resource costs are

denominated in terms of domestic non-manufacturing goods. We incorporate this

resource using feature through use of non-manufacturing goods equal in value terms

to the cost of barriers.


    3.1.5 Multi-country Armington Models with Trade Imbalance


     There are two trade imbalance modelling methods; exogenous fixed trade

imbalance, and endogenous monetary trade imbalance.

     (1) Exogenous Fixed Trade Imbalance GE Model


    Exogenous fixed trade imbalance general equilibrium structure is a traditional

assumption, which assumes that trade imbalances for all countries are fixed all the

time. We assume an exogenously determined fixed trade imbalance, denoted as Si ,

which will be positive when in trade surplus and negative when in trade deficit. Trade

                                          12
equilibrium will influence individual country’s budget constraint. In the equilibrium,

we have


    I=i Ei + Si                                                                  (1)


     which means that one country’s total income ( I i ) equals its total consumption

expenditure ( Ei ) plus its surplus (trade imbalance), if one country has trade surplus

then its income will more than consumption expenditure, but if one country has trade

deficit than its income will be less than consumption expenditure.


     (2) Monetary Endogenous Trade Imbalance GE Model


     Monetary endogenous trade imbalance general equilibrium models use a

monetized extension of this structure incorporating a fixed exchange rate and

non-accommodative monetary policy following Whalley and Wang (2010). If we only

consider the transactions demand for money in each country and for simplicity

assume unitary velocity, the money demand will equal all transaction values in one

country.


     In traditional models, money is neutral in the sense that once domestic money

supplies are specified, an equilibrium exchange rate is determined independently of

the real side, and a fixed exchange rate regime and trade imbalance does not occur.

And if the exchange rate is fixed, then the relative domestic money stocks need to

accommodate so as to support it as an equilibrium exchange rate. In the structure we

use, the monetary regime is non-accommodative to the fixed exchange rate; and in

this case the trade surplus or deficit will be endogenously determined by the equation


                                          13
    S=i I i − M i                                                                 (2)


     Where Si is trade surplus for country i , I i is the total income of country i ,

M i is the money supply in country     i . Once money supply in country i has been

fixed, then the trade imbalance for country i will be endogenously determined.

Global trade clearance determines that all of countries’ trade should be balanced,

which is

    ∑S   i   =0
     i                                                                            (3)


     We added these conditions in the global general equilibrium model yielding an

endogenous monetary trade imbalance general equilibrium model structure.


    3.1.6 Homogeneous Goods GE Models


    All homogeneous goods models in this paper have the structure of two-country

and two-goods, two countries have three different groups which are the US and ROW,

the EU and ROW, and China and ROW. The two goods are manufacturing goods and

non-traded non-manufacturing goods.


    In the pure exchange structure, each country has an endowment of goods. One

country trades one good with the other country, and the same good in the two

countries has the same price. In the equilibrium, all goods will be consumed, each

country’s total export value equals its import value. In the equilibrium, goods markets

will clear, and goods prices are determined by demands and supply.


    In the balanced trade GE with production models, we include production into the



                                          14
homogeneous goods pure exchange mode, in order to avoid specialization problems,

we use fixed sector specific inputs and diminishing marginal productivity production

functions in which the marginal productivity of labor equals zero as output in the

sector approaches zero. Here, labor is only factor in production, capital is not included.

In the equilibrium, goods and factor markets in every country clear.


    Then we extend the model to include trade cost by adding non-tariff barriers into

the model, and assume that non-tariff barriers are covered by non-tradable

non-manufacturing goods. We also extend the model to unbalanced trade. This group

of models have the same structure as the balanced trade models above, the only

difference being we capture unbalanced trade. We include an exogenous fixed trade

imbalance structure into the general equilibrium model, in which each country’s trade

imbalance is fixed and total world trade is balanced.


    We compile and compare these different model structures in Table 1.

3.2 Benchmark Data and Calibration


     We use 2013 as our base year in building a global benchmark general

equilibrium dataset for use in calibration and simulation using our model variants

following the methods set out in Shoven and Whalley (1992). Optimal tariffs are

calculated for country pairs, which means only two countries are involved in

computation. For two-country models, we have the US-ROW group, the EU-ROW

group and China-ROW group. For multi-country models, there are seven countries in

our data set, which are the US (United States), the EU (European Union), China, India,

Japan, Brazil and ROW (Rest of the World).


     Country group data are obtained by adding individual country data together.

ROW data is obtained by using total world values minus values for all other countries.

For the two goods, we assume secondary industry (manufacturing) reflects

manufacturing goods, and primary and tertiary industries (agriculture, extractive

industries, and services) yield non-traded non-manufacturing goods. For the two

factor inputs, capital and labor, we use total labor income (wage) to denote labor

values for inputs by sector. All data are in billion US dollars.


    All data are from the World Bank database (World Development Indicate). We

use agriculture and service share of GDP data and GDP data to yield production data

of manufacturing goods and non-manufacturing goods, and use capital/GDP ratios to

yield capital and labor input in production. These data are listed in Table 2. We adjust

some of the data for mutual consistency for calibration purposes.

       Trade data between each pair of countries are from the UN Comtrade database.

We use individual country total export and import values to indirectly yield exports to

and imports from the ROW, and add individual country trade data to yield country

group’s trade data. For trade balanced models, we use total export data to adjust total

import data to make them equal, and then adjust trade with ROW to make each

country’s trade balanced. For imbalanced trade models, we use real export, import and

imbalance data in calibration and simulation. Using production and trade data, we can

then calculate each country’s consumption values. The trade data we use are listed in

Table 3.

         Trade costs have two parts, import tariffs and all other non-tariff barriers. We

obtain each country’s import tariff data from WTO Statistics Database. For ROW, we

use world average tariff rates to denote these values. Import tariffs data are listed in

Table 4. We can then get non-tariff barriers by using trade costs minus import tariffs.

        We calculate trade costs following the approaches in Novy (2013), Wong (2012),

and Li and Whalley (2014). Calculation results are shown in Table 5 1. Non-tariff

barriers can then be calculated by using trade cost minus import tariffs.

         When the models include the foreign ownership of capital assumption, foreign

direct investment (FDI) data and overseas direct investment (ODI) data are needed.

We get these data from the UNCTAD FDI/TNC database (see Table 6). In the models

with the foreign ownership of capital assumption, capital input in production comes

from both domestic countries and foreign countries, we assume these capital are

    There are no available estimates of elasticities for individual countries on the

demand and production sides of the model. Many of the estimates of domestic and

import goods substitution elasticity are around 2 (Betina et al., 2006), so we set all

these elasticities in our model to 2 (Whalley and Wang, 2010). We perform sensitivity

analysis around these elasticities.

     With these data, we calibrate the model parameters for each model structure.

When used in model solution these regenerate the benchmark data as an equilibrium

for the model. Then, using these parameters we can form a numerical global general

equilibrium system, and can use this system to calculate optimal tariff. Figure 3 shows

the calibration process.


     3.3 Optimal Tariff Calculations


    We consider two different optimal tariffs following Hamilton and Whalley (1983).

One is “first step” optimal tariff, we call it optimal tariff without retaliation here; the

other is post retaliation optimal tariff, and we call it optimal tariff with retaliation in

this paper.


    (1) Optimal tariff without retaliation refer to tariffs countries would choose given

all other countries’ factual tariffs (Ossa, 2014). For country i , equilibrium is defined

by a vector of world market prices p* such that country i maximizes their welfare

function subject to the general equilibrium conditions:


     MaxU i( pi * , ti )   s.t. GE    i = country                                   (4)


where pi * denotes the vector of consumption prices in country i , and equilibrium is

supported by the optimal tariff ti of country i . Consumer and government budget

balance, and external sector balance should hold in equilibrium.


     (2) Optimal tariff with retaliation refer to tariffs countries would choose after

mutual retaliation and reach a steady equilibrium that no countries will move. This is

actually a Nash non-cooperative equilibrium. For country i , equilibrium is defined by

a vector of world market prices p* such that all countries maximize their welfare

function subject to the general equilibrium conditions:




                                            21
     Max U i( pi * , ti ) , ∀i
                                                                                     (5)
         s.t. GE      i = country

where pi * denotes the vector of consumption prices in country i , and equilibrium is

supported by the optimal tariff ti in all countries. Consumer and government budget

balance, and external sector balance all hold in equilibrium.


    In computation, we assume that the predetermined direction of trade remains

unchanged in the face of tariff retaliation. We follow the process of retaliation through

which optimal tariffs are calculated by each country, and revised in light of any

changes in tariffs adopted by the other country. When no further retaliation occurs, an

approximation to the Nash equilibrium is achieved. In calculation optimal tariff with

retaliation (non-cooperative Nash equilibrium), we iterate over calculations of optimal

tariff by individual country to tariff settings of other countries subject to the constraint

of full general equilibrium within the period. We then iterate across country tariffs

until convergence to a non-cooperative Nash equilibrium is achieved. Convergence

appears to be rapid in all the cases we have examined and the amounts of execution

time involved are small.

4. Optimal Tariffs Computational Results

     We divide and report optimal tariff computation results with six parts. The first is

optimal tariffs with pure exchange models, the second is optimal tariffs with simple

Armington assumption models, the third is optimal tariffs with multi-country

Armington assumption models, the fourth is optimal tariffs with homogenous goods

models, the fifth is sensitivity analysis, and the last is overall analysis and

comparison.

     4.1 Optimal Tariffs with Pure Exchange Models

     The basic structure for computing optimal tariffs of homogeneous goods and

Armington goods is the pure exchange model. We compute optimal tariffs for

homogeneous goods pure exchange model and compare them with Armington goods

model structures. Results are reported in Table 7.

     The results show that optimal tariffs under Armington goods structure are much

higher than under homogeneous goods structure. We take the China and ROW

country pair as an example, China’s optimal tariff without retaliation in homogeneous

goods model is 8.3%, and is 109.8 in Armington goods model; ROW’s optimal tariff

without retaliation in homogeneous goods model is 41.9%, and is 161.4% in

Armington goods model. Figure 4 gives a sensitivity analysis comparison to

elasticities for China-ROW case, it is clear that Armington goods structure will

generate high optimal tariffs.

     The analysis in this part suggests that optimal tariffs in models with the

Armington assumption are significantly larger than the ones with homogeneous goods

assumption, and that the Armington assumption produces a large upward bias

regarding optimal tariffs. As computations for Armington type models have been the

basis for the belief that trade retaliation, if unchecked, will lead to both very high

tariff and a sharp decline of trade, the behavior of major global economies in the

2008/2009 crisis is seen as hard to explain.

     4.2 Optimal Tariffs Variation with Simple Armington Assumption GE



                                                    24
Models

     We start with simple Armington goods models and gradually add more realistic

assumptions into the model. Simple Armington goods models have the pure exchange

structure and general equilibrium with production structure. We assume a 2-country

and 1-goods structure for pure exchange model, and assume both a 2-country and

1-goods structure and a 2-country and 2-goods structure for GE with production

model. We compute both optimal tariff without retaliation and optimal tariff with

retaliation. Table 8 report these results.


     We compare the results of pure exchange GE models with models with

production, and find that models with production will generate a smaller optimal tariff

compared with pure exchange models. But comparatively, the gap of optimal tariffs

between pure exchange models and models with production are smaller, which means

models with production cannot generate huge deduction on optimal tariff. Meanwhile,

we also find that two-goods model structures will generate slightly smaller optimal

tariffs compared with one-goods model structures.


    We compare optimal tariffs for models with foreign ownership of capital and

without foreign ownership of capital, and find that when we incorporate foreign

ownership of capital, optimal tariffs will decrease sharply. Meanwhile, optimal tariff

level will be influenced by the net capital balance position, net capital surplus

countries will have larger optimal tariff. Under the influence of net capital balance,

bigger countries are not always have larger optimal tariffs. Therefore, models with

foreign ownership of capital will significantly lower optimal tariff.

                                             25
     Simple Armington assumption GE models show a gradually decreasing optimal

tariffs as we add more realistic features into the model. Foreign ownership of capital

assumption has significant and prominent negative effects to optimal tariffs, including

production side into the model also has negative influence to optimal tariffs. These

results show that more realistic features will generate gradually lower optimal tariffs,

which is helpful for explaining why the 2008 financial crisis had not cause retaliatory

trade intervention.

4.3 Optimal Tariffs Variation with Multi-country Armington Assumption Models

     We extend the model from a two-country structure into a Multi-country structure

and explore optimal tariffs. As the traditional optimal tariff issues are discussed in a

two-country horizontal, so we keep on exploring optimal tariffs within two-country

pairs even though the model structure has extended to multi-country cases. We select

three different country pairs for research, which are China-US, China-EU, and

China-ROW. We gradually extend to include trade cost, exogenous fixed trade

imbalance, and endogenous monetary trade imbalance.

     We firstly compute and compare optimal tariffs under multi-country model with

the ones under two-country model. The results are clear that optimal tariffs under

multi-country structure are significantly smaller (see Table 8). We take China-ROW

case as an example to compare results. Optimal tariff without retaliation under

multi-country structure of China-ROW retaliation for China and ROW are separately

54.7% and 35.8%, but are separately 102.4% and 119.2% under two-country

structure.

      We next include trade cost into the multi-country model, and find that

multi-country model with trade cost will generate a slightly bigger optimal tariff

compared with model without trade cost (see Table 8).

     Then we extend the multi-country global general equilibrium model to

incorporate trade imbalance and compute optimal tariffs, and then explore how trade

imbalance structure influence optimal tariffs. We use two trade imbalance modelling

methods in our computation, which are exogenous fixed trade imbalance and


                                           28
endogenous monetary trade imbalance.

     We find that optimal tariffs under multi-country exogenous trade imbalance

model are smaller than under multi-country trade balance model. Meanwhile, bigger

countries are not always having larger optimal tariff under exogenous trade imbalance

structures (see Table 8). It seems that optimal tariff are influenced by imbalance

positions, trade surplus countries have lower optimal tariff but trade deficit countries

have larger optimal tariffs.

     We move to the endogenous monetary trade imbalance model structures, and it is

obvious that optimal tariffs under multi-country GE models with monetary trade

imbalance are prominently lower than trade balance models (Table 8). Meanwhile, it

seems bigger countries do not have larger optimal tariffs, and it is not clear whether

trade imbalance influence optimal tariffs.

     This part computation results also show a gradually decline optimal tariffs when

we add more realistic features into the model. Lower trade cost generate lower

optimal tariffs, trade imbalance and especially endogenous trade imbalance structure

have prominent negative effects to optimal tariffs. These more realistic features with

lower optimal tariffs reveal that the 2008 financial crisis will not lead to retaliatory

trade intervention.

     4.4 Optimal Tariff Variations with Homogenous Goods Models


    We move to the homogeneous goods GE model structure in this part. The basic

structure of homogeneous goods is pure exchange model, and then we incorporate

more assumptions into homogeneous goods models and explore their influence on


                                             29
optimal tariffs. These more assumptions are separately production, trade cost and

exogenous fixed trade imbalance.


     For the production function in homogeneous goods, we use structures with fixed

sector specific inputs and diminishing marginal productivity of mobile across sector

labor. The model avoids specialization by using a construction in which the marginal

productivity of labor equals zero as output in the sector approaches zero. For the trade

cost feature, we introduce non-tariff barriers into the model. For the trade imbalance

features, we use exogenous fixed trade imbalance structures. In the homogeneous

structures, only labor factors are needed in fixed sector specific inputs production

function, so the assumption of foreign ownership of capital cannot be included in the

structure.

     Results of homogeneous goods general equilibrium models with production

show significantly lower optimal tariffs compared with pure exchange structures.

Lower trade cost receives a little smaller optimal tariffs, and including fixed trade

imbalance assumption generates further lower optimal tariffs. These results prove that

when we include more realistic features into the model, trade retaliation or retaliatory

trade intervention will not take place again.


    4.5 Sensitivity Analysis on Elasticities


     We do sensitivity analysis of optimal tariffs to elasticities by changing the

elasticities from 0.5 to 6.5 in this part. We only choose homogeneous goods pure

exchange models and simple Armington goods pure exchange models to perform



                                           30
sensitivity analysis, and we only calculate OT without retaliation for simplicity. All

results are reported in Table 9.

       We find that as elasticities increase, all optimal tariffs for individual countries

decrease in both homogeneous goods and Armington goods structures. Sensitivity of

elasticity analysis also proves that Armington goods structure will generate higher

optimal tariff than homogeneous goods structure.


       4.6 Overall Comparison of Optimal Tariffs

       Our computation with different model structures show a continuously drop

optimal tariffs. When we switch the models from Armington assumption structure to

homogenous goods structure, and change the models from two country to

multi-country, optimal tariffs will decreasing greatly and significantly. Meanwhile,

when we add more realistic features, including production, lower trade cost, trade



                                                                31
imbalance, and foreign ownership of capital into the model, optimal tariffs will further

decrease step by step. These declining optimal tariff results prove that as the

deepening of globalization and economic integration, retaliatory trade intervention is

no longer a good choice for countries in crisis, which is why the 2008 financial crisis

had not run into retaliatory trade intervention.

5. Conclusions


    This paper aims to explain why the 2008/2009 financial crisis had not caused

global retaliatory trade interventions by showing gradually shrinking optimal tariffs

with different model structures and more realistic model features added.


    We consider two different kinds of optimal tariffs without retaliation and with

retaliation, and compute them separately under different model structures. We

separate all model structures into three groups, which are simple Armington

assumption GE models, multi-country Armington assumption GE models and

homogenous goods GE models. Under each group of models, we add realistic features

and assumptions step by step, including trade cost, trade imbalance and foreign

ownership of capital.


    Our research results reveal that homogeneous goods GE models generate much

lower optimal tariff compared with Armington assumption GE models, multi-country

GE models generate significant lower optimal tariffs compared with two-country GE

models. Structures with production, lower/no trade cost, endogenous trade imbalance

and foreign ownership of capital all will generate sharply lower optimal tariffs.


    Optimal tariffs are closely related to retaliatory trade policy, countries choose a

low optimal tariff means they will not choose trade retaliation. Our numerical

calculation results show that when we incorporate more realistic assumptions into the

GE model will generate a shrinking optimal tariffs. This means that as claimed reality

changes, retaliatory trade intervention is no longer in an individual country’s interest

                                           33
in financial crisis, which is the reason why the 2008 financial crisis had not generated

retaliatory trade intervention.
