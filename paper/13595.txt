                                             ABSTRACT

This paper examines the effect of body composition on wages. We develop measures of body composition
– body fat (BF) and fat-free mass (FFM) – using data on bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) that
are available in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III and estimate wage models
for white respondents in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979. Previous research used
body size or BMI for measuring obesity despite the growing concern in the medical literature that
BMI-based measures do not distinguish between body fat and fat-free body mass and that BMI does
not adequately control for non-homogeneity inside human body. Therefore, measures used in this
paper represent a useful alternative to BMI-based proxies of obesity. This paper also contributes to
the growing literature on the role of non-cognitive skills on wage determination. Our results indicate
that calculated BF is unambiguously associated with decreased wages for both males and females
among whites We also present evidence indicating that FFM is consistently associated with increased
wages. We show that these results are not the artifacts of unobserved heterogeneity. Finally, our findings
are robust to numerous specification checks and to a large number of alternative BIA prediction equations
from which the body composition measures are derived.

I. Introduction

         Obesity is defined as the presence of excessive body fat (Bjorntorp 2002, World

Health Organization 1998). Therefore, it is the excessive levels of body fat that makes

someone classified as obese and is responsible for the well-documented obesity-related

health problems.2 If it is the levels of body fat that define someone as obese, then it is

important to use a measure of body fat in order to develop a better understanding of the

potentially harmful effects of obesity on an array of economic and social outcomes

ranging from labor market outcomes to self-esteem, discrimination, and marriage

problems. Body fat, however, is not directly observed by researchers. In fact, most

individuals are unaware of exactly how much body fat they possess. While it can be

measured with the aid of clinical instruments, opportunities for such measurements are

rare. It would be an expensive and difficult undertaking to collect them in a survey. For

this reason most social surveys have relied on a variety of proxies for indicating the

presence of excessive body fat. The most commonly used of these proxies for body fat is

body mass index (BMI), which is calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in

meters squared (World Health Organization, 1995). An advantage of BMI is that it is

easily calculated from height and weight, which are readily obtainable.

         Unfortunately, BMI is an imperfect surrogate for body fat (Smalley et al., 1990;

Gallagher et al., 1996; Romero et al., 2006). BMI alone explains only 26% of the

variations in body fat (Gallager et al., 1996). A wide a range of conditions exist in which

BMI provides misleading information about the levels of body fat (Prentice and Jebb,

2001). In a recent review of the medical literature on the association between BMI-based


2
 Obesity-related diseases include coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertensions, stroke, cancers,
and liver and gallbladder diseases (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2007).


                                                     1
measures of obesity and total mortality for patients with coronary artery disease, Romero-

Corral et al. (2006) found that overweight patients actually have a better survival rate and

lower cardiovascular events than underweight or obese patients. Also referred to as

obesity paradox, this lack of association (or an inverse association) between obesity and

mortality has puzzled many medical researchers.3 Economists who recently studied the

effect of obesity on the labor market outcomes using BMI have also obtained mixed

findings.4

        While BMI is widely used by social scientists, a number of researchers have

recently suggested that the inconsistent effects of BMI may be due to its inability to

properly distinguish body fat from lean body mass (i.e. Allison et al., 2002; Romero-

Corral et al., 2006, Wada, 2007; Cawley, 2008). A consensus report by World Health

Organization (1995) warned researchers that BMI must be interpreted carefully to avoid

confusing muscularity with obesity. Then, BMI might be less sensitive to male obesity

due to the higher levels of lean body mass in males (Wada, 2005).5 Gallager et al. (1996)

and De Lorenzo et al. (2001) suggested that the reliability of BMI for measuring body fat

  Similar findings are also reported by several other studies that examine the association between BMI and
mortality in patients without evidence of cardiovascular disease (Flegal et al., 2005; McGee, 2005).
4
  There is some consensus on a negative association between obesity and wages for white females, but no
clear evidence of a wage penalty exists for males or other female population groups and some studies even
report a positive association between obesity and wages of black males .Averett and Korenman (1996),
Baum and Ford (2004), and Cawley (2004) have all found a negative association between BMI and wages
for white females but not for males or non-white females. For white males, the effect of BMI on wages
was found to be non-linear with overweight workers earning more than underweight or obese workers.
Cawley (2004) finds that BMI is positively and significantly associated with the wages of Black males.
Baum and Ford (2004) report a weak penalty for male obesity, but the result becomes mixed when the
sample is further divided by ethnicity, as reported by Averett and Korenman (1999) and Cawley (2004).

  A higher portion of women’s body consists of body fat due to demands of childbearing and other
hormonal functions.

is questionable, and that direct measurements of body fat would provide a significant

improvement towards the detection and diagnosis of obesity.6

         Direct measurement of body fat is available as a part of body composition

analysis conducted by clinical investigators. In body composition analysis, body is

analytically broken down to its various components (Heyward and Wagner, 2004). A

popular model for studying obesity is the two-compartment model of body fat (BF) and

fat-free mass (FFM).7 In this model, BF is the smaller component consisting mostly of fat

tissues, while FFM is the larger component that includes everything else, including

muscles and skeletons. One advantage of two-compartment model is that body fat, which

is characteristically unhealthy and the basis for classifying someone as obese, can now be

tracked independently from the rest of a person’s body. Indeed, using body composition,

it has been clinically shown that BF is responsible for the ill effects of obesity, while

FFM is associated with health and physical fitness (e.g., Heitmann et al., 2000; Allison et

al., 2002). Thus, the marginal effects of BF can be interpreted as the incremental effect

of obesity, while the marginal effects of FFM can be considered as that of healthy body

growth. In other words, BF and FFM can exert a complex influence on the economic and

social outcomes that cannot necessarily be captured by a single measure that fails to

distinguish one from the other. Because the expected effects of BF and FFM are opposite




6
  For more on the shortcomings of BMI as a measure of obesity, see Wada (2005, 2007) and Cawley and
Burkhauser (2006).
7
  The two-compartment modes were first proposed by Siri (1961) and Brozek et al. (1963). FFM is
sometimes referred to as lean body mass (Heyward and Wagner, 2004). Technically, lean body mass
contains a small amount of lipids, while FFM does not any lipids at all. In males, about 97 percent of lean
body mass is FFM, while it is about 92 percent in females (Lohman, 1992).


                                                     3
to each other, a single index such as BMI may actually result in a situation where the

opposing effects cancel each other out.8

        In this paper, we combine data from the National Health and Nutrition

Examination Survey 1988-94 (the NHANES III) and the National Longitudinal Survey of

Youth 1979 (NLSY) to estimate the effect of body composition on the wages of white

males and white females. Our paper makes four main contributions to the literature.

First, we develop and propose using body composition measures as an alternative to the

BMI-based proxies of obesity. Second, we empirically demonstrate that the calculated

body fat is unambiguously associated with decreased wages for white males and females.

This result is in contrast to the mixed results obtained by using BMI. Our results lend

further support to the notion that that obesity is associated with a wage penalty. Third,

we find that calculated fat-free mass is associated with increased wages for both white

males and females. This is important evidence in favor of the nutrition hypothesis

regarding worker productivity. In his Nobel address, Fogel (1994) hypothesized that

increased body size should be associated with increased worker productivity.9 This

assumption of “bigger-is-better” has been questioned in light of the obesity epidemic.10

Our result using the fat-free mass is important because it points to the beneficial effect of

healthy body growth on wages. Since health is the conduit through which body size is


8
  Many attempts were made to eliminate bias due to omitted variables and potential simultaneity, but they
were aimed at BMI instead of body fat itself. These include instrumental variables (Pagan and Davila,
1997; Behrman and Rozensweig, 2001; Cawley, 2004), individual, sibling, or twin fixed effects (Averett
and Korenman, 1996; Behrman and Rosenzweig, 2001; Baum and Ford, 2004; Cawley, 2004), and using
lagged values of obesity or weight (Sargent and Blanchflower, 1994; Gortmaker et al., 1993; Averett and
Korenman, 1996; Cawley, 2004).

  See Fogel (1994) and Steckel (1995) for a summary of the nutrition hypothesis.
10
   Behrman and Rozensweig (2001) explore the possibility that the negative effect of obesity is due to
unobserved heterogeneity and not necessarily due to increased body size. Fogel (1994) presents his theory
that the beneficial effect of body size is not properly captured by the observed relationship between BMI
and mortality, which is U-shaped.

thought to influence worker productivity, it should be the healthy body component or the

fat-free mass that should be associated with worker productivity. Fourth, our paper

contributes to the growing literature on role of non-cognitive factors in wage

determination by providing insights into the effects body fat and fat-free mass on

wages.11



II. Body Composition and Empirical Strategy

        Body composition has been used for almost hundred years by nutritionists and

physiologists for the purpose of studying nutrition, physical growth, and physical

performance (Forbes, 1999). Improvements in clinical measurements and the rising tide

of obesity have led to a renewed interest in body composition. In multivariate analyses,

body composition has been shown to be significantly better at explaining individual

variations in strength, health, and physical performance than body size (Bjorntorp, 2002;

Institute of Medicine, 2005). Furthemore, it has been demonstrated that fat-free mass

(FFM) has a positive effect on health and physical performance, while body fat (BF) has

a negative effect (e.g., Heitmann et al., 2000; Allison et al., 2002).

        A drawback of body composition is that it is considerably more difficult to obtain

than BMI. To overcome this difficulty, clinical investigators have developed the

bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) for measuring body composition (Kushner et al.,




11
  Given that a large body of research in the human capital literature has concluded that most of the
variation in wages across individuals remains unexplained even after extensive controls of human capital
investment (Keane, 1993; Bowles, Gintis, and Osborne, 2001), have led many economists to focus on the
potential role of non-cognitive factors on wage determination (e.g., Hamermesh and Biddle, 1994; Mocan
and Tekin, forthcoming - a; Mobius, and Rosenblat, 2006; Kuhn and Weinberger, 2005; and Persico,
Postlewaite and Silverman, 2004).


                                                   5
1990; Roubenoff et al., 1995; Sun et al., 2003; Chumlea et al., 2002).12 In the BIA, the

electrical resistance of an individual’s body is measured, which is then converted into BF

and FFM with the use of a predetermined prediction equation (National Institutes of

Health, 1994).13 At the 1994 National Institutes of Health (NIH) conference on BIA, it

was concluded that BIA is a useful technique for determining body composition in

healthy individuals (National Institutes of Health, 1994).14

        The construction of body composition from BIA has recently caught the attention

of several economists. For example, Wada (2005, 2007) takes a departure from the other

economic studies of obesity by using BIA information from the National Health and

Nutrition Examination Survey (the NHANES IIII) to estimate the effect of body

composition on labor market outcomes. Cawley and Burkhauser (2006) also used the

BIA and body composition information from the NHANES III to study the effect of body

composition on employment disability for respondents in the Panel Study of Income

Dynamics (PSID). Johansson et al. (2009) used a Finnish data set containing information

on body composition to ascertain the relationship between obesity and wages.

        In this paper, we also use BIA information the NHANES III, which is a nationally

representative cross-sectional survey conducted between 1988 and 1994. In the NHANES

III, trained technicians in mobile laboratories obtained the necessary information from

respondents over the age of 12 who were not known to be physically handicapped or

12
   Some of the other alternative methods of measuring body composition include skinfold thickness,
underwater weighting, dual x-ray absorptiometry, magnetic resonance imaging (Caterson, 2002; Heshka,
Buhl, and Heymsfield, 1994; Heymsfield et al., 1998). However, compared to BIA, these methods are
prohibitively expensive or unreasonably intrusive (Caterson, 2002; Heshka, Buhl, and Heymsfield, 1994;
Heymsfield et al., 1998) for use in large-scale epidemiological studies.
13
   FFM registers a lower electrical resistance due to its high water content, whereas BF does not conduct
electricity very well.
14
   The conference also stressed that the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES IIII),
which contain measurements of BIA for a nationally representative population, is promising for examining
the relationship between body composition and clinical risk factors.

pregnant at the time.15 The BIA information from the NHANES III can be converted into

body composition using the predictive equations developed by a number of clinical

researchers. We start our analysis by using those developed by Sun et al. (2003) for

mainly illustrative purposes, but also for the following reasons. First, these equations

were published in anticipation of use with the NHANES III. Second, this is one of the

most recently published studies on the subject. Third, other studies on the topic (Wada,

2005, 2007; Cawley and Burkhauser, 2006) also relied on this study. 16 However, we

recognize that relying only on a single set of prediction equations raises the legitimate

question as to whether our results are driven by the choice of this particular set of

prediction equations. To address this concern, we gathered a comprehensive set of

prediction equations from published sources developed by other clinical researcher. We

will present results from these equations as a robustness analysis.

         Sun et al. (2003) developed their equation using a sample containing 1,474 whites

and 355 blacks aged 12-94. Because many of the predictive equations are developed

using mostly white samples and the sample sizes are often too small when minority

groups are included, they are not expected to work for minority groups (see National




15
   For more information on the sample design of NHANES III, see U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services (1996).
16
   Sun et al. (2003) used data from five research centers to establish the models that predict fat-free mass as
a function of electrical resistance as well as height and weight. They obtain their measure of body fat by
subtracting fat-free mass from total bodyweight. Fat-free mass is calculated from a deterministic formula
based on bone mineral content, total body water, body volume, and bodyweight using a multicomponent
molecular model derived particularly for body composition analysis (Heymsfield et al., 1996). This
multicomponent molecular model is developed using superior clinical measurements by densitometry,
isotope dilution or dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (Heymsfield et al., 1996).

Institutes of Health, 1994; Segal et al., 1987). Therefore, we will restrict our analysis to

white men and white women only.17

        The predictive equation provided by Sun et al. (2003) takes the following forms

for males,

                                                          stature 2
         FFM = - 10.678 + 0.262 weight + 0.652                      + 0.015 resistance ,          (1)
                                                         resistance

and for females,

                                                         stature2
         FFM = - 9.529 + 0.168 weight + 0.696                      + 0.016 resistance ,           (2)
                                                        resistance

where weight is clinically measured weight in kilograms and stature is is clinically

measured height in centimeters. The resistance is a measure of electrical resistance

measured in ohms. The predictive power of these equations is excellent with the R-

squared values of 0.90 for males and 0.83 for females (Sun et al., 2003). Once the FFM

is obtained from above equations, BF can easily be calculated as the difference between

total weight and FFM.18 Once the FFM is obtained from above equations, BF can easily

be calculated as the difference between total weight and FFM.

        Unfortunately, the NHANES III does not contain information on hourly wages.

To overcome this problem, we use the information on body composition found in the

NHANES III to impute measures of body composition for respondents in the National

Longitudinal Survey of Youths 1979 (NLSY). The imputed body composition is then

used to estimate the wage equation for the respondents in NLSY. The parameters


17
   While there are a few predictive equations designed specifically for blacks or Hispanics, they are not
necessary for the main purpose of this paper, which is to demonstrate the usefulness of body composition in
research related to economics of obesity.
18
   They mentioned that their final equations tended to over-predict the FFM for white males by 0.4
kilogram and the FFM for white females by 0.3 kilogram. Our observations have been adjusted
accordingly by adding or subtracting the average errors from each gender group.


                                                    8
necessary to predict body composition was extracted from the NHANES by separately

regressing FFM and BF on self-reported characteristics found in both datasets. These

characteristics include the following self-reported variables: age, age2, age3, weight,

weight2, weight3, height, height2, height3, and height x weight.19

        The results from the prediction equations for FFM and BF are presented in

Appendix Tables 1A and 1B. To help account for differences across gender, they are

estimated separately for males and females. Age, weight, and height as well as their

polynomials and interactions between height and weight appear to be important

determinants of FFM for most males and females. The adjusted R-squared values for

FFM are quite high at 0.82 for both males and females. They are also high for BF at

about 0.76 and 0.90. These high R-squared values imply that a very large proportion of

the variation in the FFM and BF can be explained by the variations in the covariates

included in these regressions. Taken together, results in Appendix Tables 1A and 1B

suggest that these models accurately predict the FFM and BF in the NHANES III and that

the estimated coefficients can reliably be used to construct FFM and BF in other data sets

such as the NLSY.

        Using the parameter estimates from these prediction equations, we imputed levels

                                                                               ^            ^
of FFM and BF for respondents in NLSY. The imputed values, FFM it and BFit , are then

used to included in the hourly wage equation estimated in NLSY.20 The wage equation

has the following form,


19
    We only use self-reported characteristics in this regression using NHANES III because similar variables
are self-reported in NLSY Note that Cawley and Burkhauser (2006) used a similarly parsimonious
specification to predict BF and FFM in NHANES III.
20
   In a way, the logic used here is contextually similar to approximating years of experience as age minus
years spent in school minus 6, which is commonly used in estimating the Mincer’s equation since years of
experience is usually unobserved in the data.


                                                     9
                                  )           )
        ln(w it ) = β X it + α 1 FFM it + α 2 BFit + ε it   ,                           (5)

where ln(w it ) is the logarithm of the hourly wage rate for individual i in year t, X it is a

vector of the observed determinants of wages; β and α’s are the parameters and ε it is the

disturbance term.

        We will exclude both height and weight from the wage equations, since they are

                          ^           ^
already contained in FFM it and BFit . This is similar to the estimation strategy using

BMI, where height and weight enters the wage equation only through BMI. Here we

basically allow the data to determine how height and weight interact with other

characteristics of individuals to define someone as obese. However, height can also

influence earnings due to higher social capital accumulated through participation in social

and sport clubs during high school years as well as possibly more favorable treatment by

their peers (Persico, Postlewaite and Silverman, 2004). To account for the possibility that

height can have an independent effect on wages, we will control for a set of variables that

would serve as a proxy for the sociability of individuals, such as participation in high

school sports and clubs, as measured in the NLSY. Alternatively, we will use height

during adolescence (prior to age 18) as an additional specification check. We also

include in our wage models variables like education, AFQT test scores, and parents’

education, that can also help further control for the individual’s social skills. We will

also estimate all of our models with individual fixed effects that will account for all the

time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity, including social skills developed during high

school as well as height during adolescence. Finally, we will present the results using the

same-sex sibling differencing that will control for family-specific unobservable factors.




                                                  10
III. Data

        The NHANES III, which is described in the previous section, is an ideal dataset

for studying body composition because it provides information on both self-reported and

measured height and weight, and more importantly the BIA readings. The availability of

BIA readings in the NHANES III is critical for the purpose of this paper because it

enables us to construct measures of FFM and BF, which we later use in the wage

regressions.

        Our main data set is NLSY, which is a nationally representative survey of the

U.S. population. It started in 1979 with a cohort of males and females between ages 14

and 21. These individuals have been followed annually until 1993 and biannually

thereafter. The NLSY provides detailed information on the labor market outcomes of

respondents along with a rich set of personal and family characteristics. Although the

NLSY does not provide a direct measure of body composition, it is one of the few

economic surveys with longitudinal information on the body measurements, such as

height and weight. We pooled all the NLSY between years 1981-2004 to create our

analysis sample because self-reported weight information is available in this period. Our

NLSY sample for the wage models is between ages 18 and 49. To avoid changes in

body composition during pregnancy, females who were determined to be pregnant at the

time of an interview are dropped from our sample.21 We also omit respondents who are

in the armed forces (Baum and Ford, 2004) and omit the supplemental poor white

sample. Finally, we restrict our sample to whites because the BIA prediction formulas


21
  Reports of current pregnancies and past pregnancies were not collected at every interview. To overcome
this problem, a dataset was constructed from the birth dates of women’s biological children and the
interview dates. Women were identified as pregnant if the interview occurred between 9 months before or
after the birth of a biological child.


                                                  11
were developed mostly using white samples. After applying these exclusion criteria, we

have a pooled-sample of 22,833 white males and 19,468 white females with required

observations for variables of interest.

        The NLSY asks about the hourly wage of respondents at their primary jobs. We

deflated the hourly wages to 1991 dollars using the Consumer Price Index.22 The other

variables included in the analyses are age, years of education, years of job tenure, an

indicator for marital status, an indicator for urban residence, region indicators, the highest

grade completed by the mother, the highest grade completed by the father, the score from

Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) as a proxy measure of intelligence, years of

employment experience, and year dummies. We also include county unemployment rate

as a control for labor demand conditions. A dummy variable indicating whether the

individual has any health problems limiting the kind or amount of work one can perform

is also included. Finally, we also constructed a binary indicator indicating blue-collar

workers.

        The height and weight information provided in the NLSY is self-reported.

Previous studies show evidence of reporting error in self-reports of weight and height

(Rowland, 1989; Gorber et al., 2007).23 In order to avoid bias in their estimates, several

studies utilized the NHANES, which contains both measured and self-reported height and

weight, to correct for reporting bias in the NLSY (Cawley, 2004, 2006; Lakdawalla and

Philipson, 2002; and Chou, Grossman, and Saffer, 2004). Following the approach in



22
   Following Cawley (2004), hourly wages were top- and bottom-coded to be between 1 and 500 in 1991
dollars.
23
   Gorber et al. (2007) conducted a review of existing empirical evidence to determine the degree of
agreement between measured and self-reported measures of height, weight, and BMI. Their review of 64
studies suggested evidence for under-reporting for weight and BMI and over-reporting for height that
varies between men and women.


                                                 12
these studies, we regressed measured weight on self-reported weight, its square and cube,

age, age-squared, and age-cubed, separately by race and sex. We then repeated this

process for height. Finally, we used the coefficient estimates from the NHANES weight

and height regressions to construct measures of weight and height in the NLSY that are

corrected for reporting error. However, our results are not sensitive to this

implementation.

       Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics for the NLSY sample along with the

definitions of the variables, including the predicted FFM and BF. The descriptive

statistics is presented by the gender. As illustrated in Table 1, white males are taller and

heavier than white females, but this is due to their higher levels of FFM. White females,

in fact, possess a higher level of BF. White males and females earn about 13.59 dollars

and 10.39 dollars per hour, respectively. The proportion of sample having a health

problem limiting work and other activities is slightly higher for females. As expected,

there is little difference between the genders regarding the mother’s and father’s

education. Similarly, the AFQT test scores are almost the same. Finally, white males are

much more likely to work in blue-collar occupations than white females.



IV. Results

       Studies using conventional measures of obesity (BMI, weight, binary indicators of

overweight and obese) typically implement the empirical analyses in a numbers of steps.

First, they usually estimate models using contemporaneous measures of obesity. Second,

they repeat their analysis using lagged measures of obesity to guard against the

possibility of reverse causality from wages to obesity. Third, they estimate models




                                             13
controlling for fixed effects to control for time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity that

would potentially bias the results.24 We follow the same pattern in our analysis of the

effect of body composition on wages. Note that we also estimated our models using

these conventional measures to confirm the findings of the previous studies. Our results

are largely consistent with those of previous studies, but they are not discussed here to

economize on space.25

         Table 2A presents the results from the wage models with two contemporaneous

measures of body composition – FFM in kilograms and BF in kilograms. Table 2B and

2C display the results from the models with the lagged measures and the fixed effects,

respectively. Differently from the previous studies, we also estimate models with same-

sex sibling fixed effects, whose results are displayed in Table 2D.26

         As we discussed in Section II, in order to account for the possibility that current

height may serve as a proxy of the degree of the individual’s social skills and that this

may have an independent impact on wages, we also control for variables that would serve

as a proxy for the sociability of the individual in some specifications. Specifically, the

sociability variables that we include in the models are nine binary indicators for the most

active high school club participation, such as athletics or marching band.27 To better



24
   See Cawley (2004) for a more detailed discussion of the empirical specifications used in studies with
conventional measures.
25
   These results are available in a longer version of this paper and are available from the authors upon
request.
26
   Note that, since these models use measures of body composition constructed from the regressions
coefficients that are transferred from NHANES III to the NLSY, the standard errors will be underestimated.
Therefore, we present bootstrapped standard errors in all these tables. We implemented bootstrapping with
399 replications. The implications of the results remained the same when we repeated higher values of
replications.
27
   There are ten clubs minus one for the excluded category. It is likely that the contemporaneous sociability
variables are endogenous to wages because higher wages are likely to raise sociability. In order to avoid
bias due to potential reverse causality from wages to sociability, we use sociability indicators from high
school years rather than current indicators of sociability. Nevertheless, models that also included current


                                                     14
assess the effect of these variables on the impact of body composition measures, we

present results in Tables 2A and 2B with and without these indicators. Note that the

sociability variables are not included in Table 2C because their effects are captured by the

individual fixed effects.

         In Table 2A, we find that the coefficients on the measures of body composition

have the signs consistent with our expectations for both genders. That is, the FFM and the

BF are associated with an increase and a decrease in wages, respectively, regardless of

the gender. The results with social indicators remain very similar to those without them.

Including nine variables for high school clubs that capture the social skills of the

individual do not cause appreciable changes to the coefficient estimates. Looking at the

coefficients in the results with social indicators in Table 2A, a one kilogram increase in

the BF reduces wages by about one percent for both white males and females. When the

FFM is raised by one kilogram, the wages increase by about 0.8 percent for white males

and about 1.3 percent for white females. 28 These results indicate that, while an increase

in body size due to BF will hurt wages, an increase due to FFM is actually beneficial.

         Table 2B presents the result for lagged values of FFM and BF. We chose to lag

FFM and BF by seven years because larger lags will considerably reduce the number of

available observations, while smaller lags may not be sufficiently different from the

contemporaneous values.29 Sample size is reduced by approximately half as a result of

using 7-year lags. The results from the lagged estimations are largely similar to the

indicators of sociability such as measures of self-assessed “shyness” did not change the results. These
results are available from the authors upon request.
28
   Note that a one kilogram increase in BF is equivalent to about 5 percent increase in the body fat of white
males and about 4 percent increase in the body fat of white females. Similarly, a one kilogram increase in
the FFM is equivalent to about 2 percent increase in the fat-free mass of white males and white females.
29
   Seven lags were also used by Averett and Korenman (1996) and Cawley (2004) for their studies using
BMI. Note that our lags are for seven-year lags instead of seven-observation lags, given that NLSY
became biannual after 1994.


                                                     15
results using contemporaneous FFM and BF in Table 2A. Both the coefficients for FFM

and BF are significant for white males and females. The estimated magnitudes are also

similar to the contemporaneous results but slightly larger (away from zero).

       Table 2C presents the coefficients of FFM and BF from regressions with

individual fixed effects. These models account for all of the time-invariant unobserved

factors, including sociability from high school. Despite controlling for time-invariant

heterogeneity, the results from Table 2C indicate that the effects of BF and FFM are still

significant for white males and white females. More interestingly, the magnitudes of the

FFM and BF effects for white males and white females approximately double between

Tables 2A and 2C after controlling for fixed effects.

       The persistent and significant effects of body composition even after controlling

for individual fixed effects suggest that an increase in BF is indeed bad for the wages of

not only white females but also for white males. We also find that individuals earn a

wage premium for having an increase in their FFM. These findings are a departure from

the previous studies based on BMI that consistently find an obesity penalty for white

females but not always for males.

       Finally, we present the results from the models with the same-sex sibling fixed

effects in Table 2D. The number of available observations was significantly reduced by

this operation, 3,597 for males and 2,666 for females, which represent about 1/3 of the

original sample. We present the results with and without social indicators. The estimated

coefficients are remarkably similar to the earlier results in magnitude, although

controlling for high school sociability appears to slightly reduce the estimated effect.

Also the effects for white males are not estimated with much precision possibly due to




                                             16
reduced sample size and the fact that the identification in these model comes from

discordant measures between siblings. The results from the same-sex fixed effects

further support the notion that our results for FFM and BF are not generated by

unobserved heterogeneity in household or environmental characteristics.



Alternative BIA Conversion Equations for FFM and BF

         It is possible that the findings that are discussed above are driven by the choice of

a particular set of BIA conversion equations. In order to address this question, we

gathered a comprehensive set of predictive equations estimated by other clinical

researchers. This set includes 47 BIA separate equations derived and published by

various researchers at various times.30 We believe that this set includes most of the well-

known BIA prediction equations that exist in published sources. These equations are

presented in Appendix Table 4. We estimated our models using each of these alternative

equations. Note that we use the same set of regressors in these models and also include

individual fixed effects. Remarkably, as discussed below, these estimations produced

FFM and BF coefficients that are extremely consistent with those presented in this paper.

         In Table 3, we present the coefficients on the FFM and BF for each gender for

each of these 47 prediction equations. It is a very interesting that, in all 47 equations, all

four FFM and BF coefficients – a total of 188 regression coefficients (47 x 2 x 2) – have

30
   This is the same list identified in a recent study by Willet et al. (2006), minus one redundant equation due
to replication. We combine four equations in that list because they were body-fat specific equations of
Segal et al. (1988) that were originally meant to be combined (see Heyward and Wagner, 2004) and should
have been combined by Willet et al. (2006). All 4 equations based on percentage body fat (as opposed to
level measures of FFM or bodyweight) are dropped from the list due to high degree of prediction errors
stemming from a linear model being fitted to truncated values between 0 and 100. Many of the remaining
prediction equations are actually less suitable for the purpose of this paper because they are derived for
populations of different ages like children and older adults. Nevertheless, they are retained in our analysis
to show that the final result is largely robust to such built-in errors. To this list, we further add four
equations from other published resources.


                                                      17
the expected sign, that is, the effect of FFM is positive and the effect of BF is negative.

In our opinion, it is a remarkable finding that not a single coefficient has a sign that

contradicts with our expectations. As summarized in Table 4, the FFM coefficients are

statistically significant in 47 out of 47 models and the BF coefficients are statistically

significant in all 47 models for white males. This is consistent with our results presented

in Table 2C. For white females, the FFM coefficients are significant in 41 models and

the BF coefficients are significant in 43 models.

       In order to summarize the information in Table 3, Table 4 also presents the

medians of the 47 BF and 47 FFM coefficients for each group. The medians for females

are generally larger in magnitude (about 70%) than the estimated coefficients using the

prediction equations of Sun et al. (2003). For males, they are similar for FFM, but the

median for BF is about 20% smaller. The fact that most of the median values move away

from zero give support to our claim that our main result was not driven by the choice of a

particular prediction equation. We believe that this analysis provides strong and clear

evidence that the results presented in Table 3 are not driven by the choice of a particular

set of prediction equations.

       In summary, the persistent and significant effects of body composition even after

controlling for individual fixed effects suggest that an increase in BF is indeed bad for the

wages of not only white females as usually found in the studies using BMI but also for

white males. Also FFM is consistently associated with increased hourly wages.



Discussion and Robustness




                                              18
         Several potential explanations can be offered for the negative effect of body fat on

wages. One of these explanations is that body fat lowers an individual’s productivity

through adversely affecting health. Fixed effects would capture any time-invariant health

problems or limitations that would be correlated with body fat. However, this

explanation is still plausible if the health limitations or problems are time-variant. Note

that all of our wage models include a binary variable indicating any health limitation in

the kind or amount of work one can perform while on the job. This variable is also

included in the fixed effects models since it is available in every year, and thus can be

time-variant. The effect of this variable is negative in every model and it remains mostly

statistically significant even in the fixed effects models. Furthermore, the coefficients on

body composition variables remain essentially the same when the health limitation

variable is excluded from the models.31

         Customer discrimination may be another explanation for the negative effect of

body fat if customers in certain occupations have negative preferences against employees

with higher levels of body fat. Note that we include a binary indicator for the

individual’s blue-collar occupation in our models. The exclusion of the blue-collar

occupation indicator did not cause any appreciable chance in the coefficients of body

composition variables in Table 2C. As a further test of customer discrimination

explanation, we also constructed ten binary occupational indicators and included them in

the fixed effects models instead of a single indicator for blue-collar occupation. The

fixed effects results with occupation dummies are presented in Appendix Table 2. As

illustrated in the table, the estimates remained almost identical when we controlled for


31
  Another possible explanation is that health limitations due to high levels of body fat adversely affecting
the ability of individuals to work rather than their wages (Baum and Ford, 2004).


                                                     19
occupation indicators in the models. These results suggest that the opposing effects of

body fat and fat-free mass are independent of customer discrimination.32

           Another explanation would be that individuals with excess body fat may be less

concerned about their future and thus invest less in accumulating human capital (Baum

and Ford, 2004). Note that our models include education, tenure, experience, and current

school attendance, which should control for investments in human capital. Thus, this

hypothesis is unlikely to explain why body fat lowers wages in our analysis.

           Another possibility is the likely negative correlation between self-esteem and

obesity. Mocan and Tekin (forthcoming – b) show that wages of individuals are affected

directly by obesity and indirectly through the impact of obesity on self-esteem. Cawley

(2004) also offers self-esteem channel as an explanation as to why obesity has a negative

effect on the wages of white females. In order to support his argument, he cites evidence

indicating that obesity has a more adverse effect on the self-esteem of white females than

it does on the self-esteem of black and Hispanic females. Averett and Korenman (1999)

find that obesity is associated with low self-esteem among white females, but not among

black females. If increased body fat is indeed negatively correlated with self-esteem, this

may be an explanation for the negative effects of BF that we find in this paper. Note that

we control for a large number of variables that proxy sociability of the individual. For

example, we control in some of our models participation in high school clubs and sports

as well as self-assessed indicators of shyness. If these variables capture the self-esteem

of the individuals, then this explanation is unlikely to be responsible for the effects

obtained in this paper. Of course, we acknowledge the possibility that these controls are

imperfect proxies for self-esteem.
32
     Note that we cannot rule out the possibility of employer discrimination.


                                                       20
       The sociability indicators, which are included in the models to control for any

direct effect that height can have on wages through impacting an individual’s social

capital, do not cause any appreciable change to the coefficients. In order to guard against

the possibility that sociability indicators do not fully capture this channel, we

experimented with models controlling for height during adolescence. Specifically, we

estimated models with earliest available height before age 18 in addition to the sociability

indicators. In order to implement this, we had to restrict our sample such that earliest

available height of an individual is from a point in life before age 18. As a result of this,

our sample sizes went down to less than 1/4th of the original sizes. These results are

presented in Appendix Table 3. Despite dramatic reductions in the sample sizes, all of

the FFM and BF coefficients are in the expected sign and the effects are largely

consistent with those in previous tables. Note that sociability indicators are also

controlled for in these models. Results remained very similar when we controlled only

for height before age 18.



V. Conclusion

       In this paper, we examine the effect of body composition on wages of white males

and white females. Previous studies on this subject exclusively relied on BMI and

bodyweight to measure obesity. However, there is ample evidence to suggest that these

are not the best surrogates of obesity because of their inability to distinguish between fat

body mass and fat-free mass. Since it is the body fat that classifies an individual as obese,

the effects obtained in previous studies may be confounded by the impact of fat-free

component of body composition.




                                              21
       We measure body composition by body fat (BF) and fat-free mass (FFM). In

order to do this we utilize the information on the Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis that is

available in NHANES III and develop a method for directly calculating body

composition for use in regression analysis. By using measures of BF and FFM, we are

also able to distinguish between the effects of health physical growth (represented by an

increase in FFM) and an unhealthy physical growth (represented by an increase in BF) on

wages. The analysis of body composition also allows us to study the effect of FFM on

wages for the first time in the literature. Because FFM consists mostly of muscles and

skeletons, it presents a plausible way to estimate the effect of physical health on worker

earnings.

       Our results suggest that a rise in BF is associated with decreases in the wages of

both white males and white females, while a rise in the FFM is associated with an

increase in the wages of both groups. These findings are in contrast to the previous

studies that found strong evidence of a negative effect on white females but not always

for white males. Given that a higher proportion of women’s body consists of fat than

men due to demands for childbearing and other hormonal functions, BMI may serve as a

better measure of excessive fatness for women than men. Such gender-dependent

correlation could particularly explain the previously mixed and unstable findings for men.

       Our results indicate that individuals with high levels of FFM or lean body mass

earn a wage premium. In other words, it is the healthy growth in body size that is

beneficial for wages. To the extent that FFM can be seen as a measure of healthy growth,

our results provide evidence in favor of the nutrition hypothesis expounded by Fogel

(1994). It has been long hypothesized that increased body size should be associated with




                                            22
increased worker productivity. Our result using fat-free mass demonstrates that it is the

healthy growth of FFM that is beneficial. We also present evidence that these results are

not artifacts of other characteristics of the individuals that are correlated with obesity.

       Finally, we show evidence that our findings are robust to the choice of prediction

equation based on which the body composition measures are derived. Researchers have

recently found that non-cognitive characteristics such as beauty, leadership, and tallness

are positively related to earnings. By studying the effects of BF and FFM on wages, this

study also contributes to the growing literature on the role of non-cognitive factors on

wage determination.

Ht is height in centimeters, Wt is weight in kilograms, R is resistance in ohms, Xc is reactance in ohms
(reactance is a different type of resistance sometimes used in BIA). Source: Willett et al. (2006),
supplemented by Heyward and Wagner (2004), Deurenberg et al (1989), Kyle, et al (2001), Lukaski
(1985), and Macias (2007).a Lean body mass (LBM) is converted to FFM by the equation FFM =
0.97*LBM for males and FFM = 0.92*LBM for females (Willett, 2006; Lohman, 1992). Total
bodyweight (TBW) is converted to FFM by FFM = TBW/0.73 (Willett, 2006; Houtkooper et al., 1996).
