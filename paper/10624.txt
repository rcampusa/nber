Sources for Financing Domestic Capital – Is Foreign Saving a Viable Option for Developing
Countries?

                                        ABSTRACT

This paper proposes a new method for measuring the degree to which the domestic capital stock is
self-financed. The main idea is to use the national accounts to construct a self-financing ratio,
indicating what would have been the autarky stock of tangible capital supported by actual past
domestic saving, relative to the actual stock of capital. We use the constructed measure of self-
financing to evaluate the impact of the growing global financial integration on the sources of
financing domestic capital stocks in developing countries. On average, 90% of the stock of capital
in developing countries is self financed, and this fraction was surprisingly stable throughout the
1990s. The greater integration of financial markets has not changed the dispersion of self-financing
rates, and the correlation between changes in de-facto financial integration and changes in self-
financing ratios is statistically insignificant. There is no evidence of any “growth bonus” associated
with increasing the financing share of foreign savings. In fact, the evidence suggests the opposite:
throughout the 1990s, countries with higher self-financing ratios grew significantly faster than
countries with low self-financing ratios. This result persists even after controlling growth for the
quality of institutions. We also find that higher volatility of the self-financing ratios is associated
with lower growth rates, and that better institutions are associated with lower volatility of the self-
financing ratios. These findings are consistent with the notion that financial integration may have
facilitated diversification of assets and liabilities, but failed to offer new net sources of financing
capital in developing countries.

“For emerging markets, the consequence of these trends has been that they have rapidly become integrated into
international capital markets. This has had a number of advantages. Private debt or portfolio inflows in response to
economic liberalisation have expanded sizeably, from less than $40 billion per year over the period 1983-1990, to an
average of about $200 billion a year in the last five years. These capital inflows have provided additional resources to
supplement domestic savings and support high levels of investment.”

1.        Introduction and summary


          While capital account liberalization for developing countries may have been
enthusiastically embraced at the beginning of the 1990s, it is safe to say that by the end of the
decade, it had become the single most controversial policy prescription. Following the crises in
East Asia and Russia, the debate shifted from when to liberalize the capital account to whether to
liberalize it at all (e.g., Rodrik (1998)). John Williamson, the originator of the much-maligned
term, “Washington Consensus”, noted explicitly: “I specifically did not include comprehensive
capital account liberalization, because that did not command a consensus in Washington.”
[Williamson (2002)]. These developments bear a sharp contrast to the early 1990s, when waves
of market-oriented liberalization and greater financial liberalization fueled optimism about the
growth prospects of developing countries. Economists expected growing financial integration to
augment the capital stock in developing countries by making foreign saving available. This
paper proposes a new and simple method for measuring the degree to which this expectation was
fulfilled. The measure developed also provides useful information about the degree to which the
domestic stock of capital is self-financed.
          The seminal paper of Feldstein and Horioka (1980) focused on saving/investment
correlations as a measure of capital mobility. It concluded that financial markets had a long way
to go towards meaningful integration, even among advanced industrial countries. Their work
sparked voluminous research, updating their study, and investigating the usefulness of S/I
correlations in assessing the degree of integration of financial markets. Using saving/investment
correlations, some concluded that financial markets have become more integrated in recent
                                                           3

decades. Others concluded that such correlations do not provide enough information to ascertain
the true degree of integration of financial markets [see Obstfeld and Rogoff (1999) and
Coakleya, Kulasib and Smithc (1998) for useful overviews of the literature]. While the question
addressed in this paper is akin to the one in Feldstein and Horioka (1980), we use a different
methodology, focusing on the ratio of cumulative discounted gross national saving and gross
national investment. This ratio provides us with a measure of self-financing – the share of
domestic capital that was financed by domestic savings. We use this ratio to investigate the
1990s. The main results are:


         I.       We have not found evidence of a significant change in the pattern of financing
                  ratios of developing countries in recent years. This is consistent with the notion
                  that financial integration has facilitated greater diversification of assets and
                  liabilities [see Dooley (1988) and Mody and Murshid. (2002) for analysis of this
                  trend].1 Frequently, greater financial integration has resulted in inflows of foreign
                  saving financing outflows of domestic saving, with little net impact on financing
                  ratios. One should note, however, that our paper is focusing on high level of
                  aggregation. The relative stability of the self financing ratios documented in this
                  paper is consistent with significant changes in the decomposition of the various
                  forms of capital flows, as has been reported and analyzed by Bosworth and
                  Collins (1999).2
         II.      The average self-financing ratio for developing countries is about 90% (i.e, on
                  average, 90% of the stock of capital in developing countries is self-financed).
                  This ratio remained stable throughout the 1990s notwithstanding the wave of
                  financial liberalization—although there is significant heterogeneity, reviewed



1
  Mody and Murshid (2002) found in a sample of 60 developing countries that, while the growing financial
integration with the rest of the world has increased access to foreign private capital, the relationship between foreign
capital and domestic investment has weakened, reflecting changes in the composition of inflows, offsetting
outflows, and increased foreign currency reserve requirements.

2
  Bosworth and Collins (1999) found that a substantial share of the surge in capital inflows has been channeled into
reserves accumulation, and that an equal share found its way back out of the country. Using investment regressions,
they found that FDI shows the strongest link with aggregate investment, with a coefficient close to one.

               later in this paper. Interestingly, the greater integration of financial markets has
               not changed the dispersion of self-financing rates, and the standard deviation of
               the cross-country distribution of self-financing ratios in the 1990s is about 0.18.
       III.    There is no evidence of a “growth bonus” associated with increasing the financing
               share of foreign saving. The evidence suggests just the opposite: throughout the
               1990s, countries with higher self-financing ratios grew significantly faster than
               countries with low self-financing ratios. This reinforces the skeptical assessment
               of the growth effects of financial liberalizations [see Rodrik (1998) and
               Gourinchas and Jeanne (2004); and Aizenman (2004) for a review of the debates
               about financial opening]. Yet, our results do not rule out the possibility that
               financial liberalization may impact the “quality of growth,” as measured by TFP.
       IV.     Higher volatility of self-financing ratios, measured by the standard deviation of
               the ratio, is associated with lower growth rates. Better institutions are associated
               with a higher growth rate. Interestingly, in a growth regression, the quality of
               institutions variable “soaks” the explanatory power from the volatility of self-
               financing ratios, rendering it insignificant, but leaving intact the positive convex
               effect of self-financing ratios on real per capita GDP growth.


       Our analysis does not permit an inference about direct causality – we cannot infer that
policies aimed at increasing self-financing ratios would be growth and welfare improving. All
that we can infer is that despite greater financial integration, foreign savings on average have not
provided a viable source of financing domestic capital for developing countries. The main
benefit would seem to be greater financial asset diversification. Even on this account, the
welfare effects are not clear-cut. Some studies suggest we have a long way to go before
exhausting the bulk of the diversification gains [see Tesar (1999)]. Other studies suggest that the
welfare effect of diversification is mixed in the presence of political polarization, where capital
movements are motivated by the attempts to reduce the tax base available to future
administrations [see Alesina and Tabellini (1989)].

2.     Methodology


       We use the national income accounts to construct a self-financing ratio, indicating what
would have been the autarky stock of tangible capital supported by actual domestic past saving,
relative to the actual stock of capital. Let gross investment and gross saving at time t, in constant
PPP, be I t ; S t , respectively. Let k denote the fixed initial capital/GDP ratio, d the depreciation
rate, and Y real GDP in constant prices. We define recursively the following stock variables,
evaluated forward from time t 0 to time t 0 + n :


(1)     K t0 = kYt0 ;                K t +1 = K t (1 − d ) + I t ,   for t 0 + n ≥ t > t 0 .
                                                                              ~
Similarly, we define recursively the “hypothetical autarky stock of capital,” K ,


        ~                          ~        ~
(1’)    K t0 = kYt0 ;              K t +1 = K t (1 − d ) + S t       for t 0 + n ≥ t > t 0 .


             ~
The value of K t0 + n is the “hypothetical autarky stock of capital” at time t 0 + n , assuming the

country would have self-financed its investment (and assuming that the path of the domestic
saving would have been the one observed in the data, and a discounting horizon n).
                                ~
       The values K t 0 + n and K t0 + n rely on recursive discounting of n periods, depending on the

parameters n, d, and k, as well as on the accuracy of the GDP accounting data. If n and d are
                                 ~
large enough, then K t 0 + n and K t0 + n would be insensitive with respect to the initial estimated

stock of capital; and changing of the discounting horizon n would lead to negligible changes of
                                                                            ~
the estimated values. Henceforth we denote the estimated values of K and K at time t, evaluated
recursively use discounting horizon n, by


                 ~        ~
(2)              K t ;n = K t0 + n ; K t ;n = K t0 + n


       The self-financing ratio at time t, calculated using a horizon of n periods, is defined by:
                                                                            6

                      ~
                      K t ;n
(3)        f t ;n =             .
                      K t ;n


Applying (1) and (1’), the reduced form of (3) is


                       n

                      ∑S       t −i   (1 − d ) i −1 + kYt − n (1 − d ) n
(4)        f t ;n =   i =1
                        n

                      ∑I
                      i =1
                               t −i   (1 − d ) i −1 + kYt −n (1 − d ) n


          In Appendix A we show that


                                       S t −1 − I t −1                   d + gt                   K t ;n
(5)        f t ;n − f t −1;n ≅                         − ( f t −1;n − 1)        ,   where g t =            − 1 is the growth rate of
                                            K t ;n                       1 + gt                   K t −1;n

the stock of capital at time t. Hence, current account surpluses exceeding
                  d + gt
( f t −1;n − 1)          would increase the self-financing ratio.3
                  1 + gt


          If f were measured in ideal circumstances, a value of 1 would correspond to an economy
where the entire stock of domestic capital is self-financed. A self-financing ratio below one
indicates reliance on foreign saving -- 1- f is the foreign-financing ratio, measuring the fraction
of domestic capital that was financed by foreign saving. Given the difficulty in measuring f in
practice, we shall focus more on its trend than whether it is above or below 1. To allow
meaningful panel comparison across countries and across time we proceed by calculating the
financing ratios of developing countries, varying t but holding n constant. Next, we evaluate the
systematic changes of the distribution of the self-financing ratios in recent years.4 The choices of


3
  A natural benchmark is financial autarky ( f = 1), where the entire domestic stock of capital is self financed. A
balanced current account (S = I) would preserve the financial autarky position of the economy. In contract, a
country that over-finance its stock of capital (f > 1, like the position of Japan in the eighties), would find that
maintaining a stable self-financing ratio overtime requires running a current account surplus proportional to the
over-financing rate (f – 1) times the sum of the growth rate and the depreciation rate. For such a country, a
balanced current account position would reduce the self financing ratio overtime, towards f = 1.
4
  We use data for 47 developing and 22 high incem OECD countries that are available for every year between 1981
and 2001 from the 2004 World Development Indicators database. Variables GDP, gross national savings (including
                                                                  7

n and d are dictated by data availability and the desire to have a large enough sample of
developing countries. In the base specification, we set k = 3, n = 10 and d = 0.1, ending with a
panel of self-finance ratios covering the 1990s for 47 countries.5 As we do not have any obvious
benchmark year to anchor the calculations of the self-financing ratios for all countries, we
impose a fixed discounting horizon n for all countries. In Appendix A we show that an exact
version of (5) applies if the calculations of the self-financing ratios are anchored at fixed base
year t 0 (thereby implying a time dependent discounting horizon, of t − t 0 ). For large enough n
and d, the difference between the two possible ways is of a second order magnitude. In the
Appendix we also characterize the difference between the self-finance measure (4), and the ‘ideal’ self-

finance measure, denoted by fˆ . This ideal measure would be obtained by unbounded backward
discounting, had we have all the past information. The Appendix shows that for an economy growing at a
constant rate g,



         (6)       f t ;n − fˆt = (1 − f t ;n )
                                                    [(1 − d ) /(1 + g )]n .
                                                  1 − [(1 − d ) /(1 + g )]
                                                                          n



Consequently, for large n and d, the gap between (4) and the ideal self-financing measure is
inconsequential.
         It is useful to note that the self-financing ratio defined in (3) provides information that
differs from the calculations of country portfolios [see Kraay et. al. (2000)] and external wealth
of nations [see Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2001)]. These papers evaluate the net assets and
characterize the portfolios of a country, hence rely on current market prices of assets and
liabilities. In contrast, the self-financing ratio identifies the degree to which the stock of capital
has been self-financed, aggregating past gross domestic saving and investment. While valuation
changes (due to real exchange rate shocks, stock market changes, partial defaults, etc.) would
have first-order effects on the wealth and net worth of nations, these would have only second-
order impacts on the self-financing ratios.
         Before turning to the main results, we would like to acknowledge the obvious limitations
of our methodology. First, the quality of the self-financing ratios evaluated in this study is

  The choice of the depreciation rate follows Nadiri and Prucha (1996), estimating the deprecation rates of various
types of capital in the range of 0.06-0.12.

limited by the quality and availability of the data, and the accuracy of the assumptions about the
various parameters [k, d, etc.]. Second, the skepticism in the literature about the interpretation of
the Feldstein and Horioka correlations applies to this paper as well, as we do not attempt to
model the forces leading to the observed financing ratios. With these caveats, we argue that
sharp changes in self-financing ratios, or the absence of such changes, provide useful diagnostic
information about structural changes associated with the integration of capital markets.




3.       Self-financing ratios of developing countries in the 1990s


      The analysis begins by evaluating the patterns of self-financing ratios throughout the
1990s. For data limitation reasons, we choose n = 10 [recall that n is the window of calculating
the financing share, see (1) and (1’)], and a depreciation rate d = 0.1. The basic patterns of self-
financing ratios for developing countries in the 1990s are depicted in Figure 1.A. The mean
financing ratio hovers about 0.9, with no obvious trend6. Interestingly, despite the wave of
financial liberalizations, there is no detectable increase in the spread of the financing ratios, as
measured by one standard deviation around the mean. Disaggregating across regions in Figures
1.B-1.D reveals considerable heterogeneity. First, only in Latin America does there seem to be a
weak trend towards greater dispersion of the financing ratio, with a marginal decline of the mean
from about 0.9 to 0.87. The opposite is observed in Asia: the self-financing ratio increased from
1.01 to 1.06, and the dispersion declined. Most of the increase is observed in the aftermath of the
1997-8 crisis. However, the trend in Africa resembles that in Latin America, dropping from 0.87
to 0.83, but with a significant drop in dispersion. These figures are consistent with the notion
that, as a region, Asia has financed domestically its rapid accumulation of capital, and the 1997-8
crisis has led to a significant surge in precautionary saving. In contrast, Latin America and
Africa have increased their reliance on foreign savings as means of financing their tangible
capital, by about 3%. As the counterpart to self-financing dynamics in developing countries, we
observe the increase in mean and standard deviation of self-financing ratios among OECD
countries (Figure 1.E). However, the increase in the mean self-financing ratio from 0.98 to 1.04


6
  These figures depict arithmetic averages. Weighting would lead to much higher ratios, reflecting high self-
financing ratios in the most populous countries, including China.
                                                              9

overstates the increase in amount of saving available to the developing countries, as ratios in
major economies such as USA, Japan and Germany remained remarkably stable7.
         We now examine the association between real per capita GDP growth and the level and
volatility of self-financing ratios in the 1990s. Table 1 summarizes the cross country regressions
of the average real per capita GDP growth rate in the 1990s on the average self-financing ratio,
on the square and the cube of the financing gap, f – 1, and on the volatility of the self-financing
ratio. Column 1 presents results without controlling for quality of institutions and measures of
trade and financial openness. On balance, higher self-financing ratios (implying higher self
financing of a given investment) are associated with a significant increase in growth rates. This
effect is convex, as shown in Figure 2, which plots the relationship between the self-financing
ratio and per capita GDP growth rates for the case of a stable self-financing ratio. A rise in the
self-financing ratio from 1 to 1.1 is associated with an increase in the growth rate from 2.8% to
4.4%. Further, reducing the self-financing ratio from 1 to 0.9 is associated with a drop in the
growth rate from 2.8% to 2.2%. Regarding volatility, column 1 indicates that increasing the s.d.
of the self-financing ratio from zero to 0.05 would reduce the growth rate associated with a given
average self-financing rate by almost 1 %!
           Table 2 shows that better institutions are associated with less volatile self-financing
ratios, which suggests that the adverse effects of higher volatility of self-financing ratios on
growth may stem from institutional weaknesses. This conjecture is confirmed in column 2 of
Table 1, which repeats the regression reported in column 1 while controlling for the quality of
institutions. Better institutions are associated with a higher growth rate. Interestingly, the
quality of institutions variable “soaks” the explanatory power from the volatility of self-financing
ratios, rendering it insignificant, but leaving intact the positive convex effect of self-financing
ratios on real per capita GDP growth. Results from Table 2 indicate further that trade openness,
unlike financial openness tends to be positively associated with standard deviation in self-
financing ratios8.

    After the mild increase in first half of 90s US self-financing ratio was actually falling in the aftermath of series of
financial crises in emerging markets in 1997 and 1998, so that in 2001 it equaled 0.94 compared to 0.95 in 1991.
Self-financing ratio in Japan and Germany remained flat at 1.06 and 0.97, respectively.

 The quality of institutions was calculated as the average of measures of law and order, corruption and bureaucracy
quality from the International Country Risk Guide (2004). The data on trade openness – measured by [exports +

        Finally, cross-country differences in levels and changed of self-financing ratios cannot be
explained by variables such as quality of institutions, trade and financial openness9. Notably the
correlation between the change in de-facto financial openness between 1980s and 1990s and the
change in the self-financing ratio between 1991 (result of accumulation in decade of 1980s) and
2001 (accumulation in 1990s) is, for all practical purposes, zero (compare Figure 3). Also, while
the financial opening was substantial - the average and median increases in financial openness
were 65%, and 30%, respectively, changes in the self- financing rates were comparably
insignificant10.




4.      Self-financing ratios – regional and selected countries’ experience


        Figures 4-5 report the time patterns of the self-financing ratios, and the corresponding
growth rates, in the three blocks of developing countries [Latin America, Asia and Africa].
Throughout the nineties, Asia exhibits high self-financing ratios and high growth rates (with the
exception of 1998). In contrast, Latin America and Africa display low self-financing ratios, and
relatively low growth rates. Interestingly, the drop in the self-financing ratios in Africa through
much of the 1990s was not associated with a sustained growth bonus – the growth rate picked up
in the early 1990s, collapsing in the second half. The growth performance of Latin America was
more evenly distributed throughout the nineties, exhibiting no obvious growth bonus of the drop
in the self-financing rations. Unlike the experience of Africa, the growth drop of Asia in the
aftermath of the 1997-8 crises had been associated with a remarkable increase of the self-
financing ratios.
        We now briefly review the patterns of self-financing ratios and growth of selected
countries. Figures 6.A and 6.C pertain to the two most populous countries, China and India.
Both experience rapid self-financed growth --their self-financing 1990s ratios are greater than

imports]/GDP and financial openness--measured by [inflows + outflows of capital]/GDP--are from Frankel and Wei
(2004).

   Financial openness actually fell between the 80s and the 90s in number of countries, including Ecuador, Uruguay,
Bangladesh, Egypt and Morocco. Another outlier in the Figure 3 is Mozambique that doubled its self-financing ratio
since 1991 (but the ratio is still very low at 0.43 in 2001).
                                                            11

one. The main difference is that the self-financing ratio exhibits rapid downward trend in China,
and very mild upward trend in India. There results are in line with the cross country regression
reported in Table 1, which details the positive association between self-financing ratios and
growth. To complete this picture, figure 6.B focuses on Brazil, a country that experienced even
more rapid decline self-financing ratio as China from lower initial level. Characteristically, the
country failed to benefit from any associated “growth bonus”. This is a pattern common to the
“average” Latin American country [see Figures 3 and 4]. Another characteristic case is Bolivia
depicted in Figure 6.D, the country that is characterized by exceptionally low levels of self-
financing ratios, but also mediocre growth performance.
         While countries characterized by higher self-financing ratio in 1990s experienced, on
average, higher growth rates, there are several examples of countries that experienced large
increase in self-financing ratios, with no detectable growth bonus. Figure 6.E and 6.F reports the
experience of Ecuador and Pakistan -- the self-financing ratios of both countries increased
substantially in the 1990s, at a time when their growth rates were rather flat (Ecuador) or
dropped substantially (Pakistan). Thus, there is no guarantee that a rising self-financing ratio
will produce faster growth11. Economic growth depends on all the factors that explain the
magnitude and the quality of investment in all types of capital. For most developing countries,
the obstacles preventing higher growth are not the degree of financial integration, but other more
structural obstacles.
         Figure 7 focuses on special category of countries, those that experienced serious financial
crisis and associated sudden stop in external financing. All these countries, with exception for
Indonesia, are characterized by the reversal of declining self-financing ratios around the time of
the crisis episode. Interestingly, the harshness of the reversal varies greatly among countries.


         Figure 7.A summarizes the experience of Korea. Similar to China, throughout the 1990s
the relatively high growth rate of Korea was, on balance, self-financed. Yet, the Korean pattern
is dominated by the financial liberalization in the mid 1990s, and the sudden stop of 1997-8.
While the financial liberalization of the mid 1990s is associated with a sizable drop in the self
financing ratio, the sudden stop, and remarkable adjustment that followed, have led to a sharp

11
  For example, if a country has unsustainable public debt dynamics and cuts back fiscal spending (including public
investment), then this will tend to raise national savings relative to investment, raising the self-financing ratio at the
margin; but possibly with a growth slowdown because of the necessary reduction in aggregate demand.
                                                         12

reversal of the self-financing ratio. Yet, the self-financing rate in 2001 (marginally above 1),
was well below the self-financing rate observed in 1991 (about 1.035). Figures 7.C and 7.D
report the growth and self-financing ratios of Malaysia and the Philippines, respectively. The
patterns of both countries resemble that of Korea, however an increase in the self-financing
ratios in the aftermath of the 1997-8 crisis was much sharper. This can be explained by the fact
that pre-crisis self-financing ratios in these countries were substantially lower and falling below
0.9 shortly before the episode while in the aftermath of crisis, countries returned to full self-
financing. This is consistent with the observation that the East Asia crisis led the affected
countries to follow a similar pattern -- a sizeable increase in precautionary savings, quite
independently of their de-jure integration with the global financial system. Indeed, this pattern is
exhibited by the regional means and standard deviation of self-financing ratio in Figure 1.C.
         Figure 7.E deals with the dramatic experience of Argentina. The financial opening of the
1990s is associated with a sizable drop in the self-financing ratio, from about 0.92 to 0.88. This
drop ends with the sudden stop, which led to a partial reversal of the earlier decline. As in the
previous cases, the ability to finance a growing share of the domestic capital by foreign saving is
not associated with any “growth bonus.” In fact, the period of relatively rapid growth in the
early 1990s is associated with a higher self-financing ratio. Mexico, depicted in Figure 7.F,
exhibits the crisis triggered reversal in self-financing ratio decline, with economic growth that is
on average stronger during the time of increasing self-financing ratio. These results suggest that
political economy factors and political risk diversification are important in understanding the
association between the self-financing ratios and growth.12




12
  For example, for countries characterized by economic and political uncertainty, the opening of financial markets
would lead domestic agents to put greater share of their savings in offshore accounts, and in certain cases may lead
foreign consumers to purchase domestic assets, betting on the prospect of improvement in domestic conditions.
This may lead to large gross flows of capital, with little change in net flows [see Dooley (1998)].
                                                              13



  5.       Concluding remarks


           Our study proposes a new method for evaluating the net sources for financing the
domestic stock of capital. We illustrated the usefulness of this method by evaluating the actual
patterns of financing the capital stock of developing countries in the 1990s. Combining this
method with measures of de-facto financial integration enables one to trace the association
between gross and net capital flows. Among our results, we find that throughout the 1990s, a
period characterized by a rapid increase in gross capital flows, developing countries exhibit stable
self-financing ratios. As is frequently the case, the quality of the results is limited by the quality of
the data, and the auxiliary assumptions. For some countries, the calculated self-financing ratio
may underestimate the actual.13 Tracing these biases is left for future investigation. While the
exact results of the self-financing ratios are sensitive to these considerations, we expect the main
findings to be robust.




  13
     For example, if the trade data were distorted due to illicit capital flight intermediated via trade mis-invoicing, and
  if illicit capital flight exceeded illicit capital inflows, the actual gross saving would tend to exceed the one traced by
  our calculations. See Aizenman and Noy (2004) for further discussion of trade mis-invoicing and endogenous de-
  facto financial openness.

         The purpose of this appendix is to characterize the factors explaining the evolution of self-financing ratios
overtime, and to compare the self financing ratios associated with fixed versus variable discounting horizon.
Equations (1)-(4) correspond to the case of a fixed discounting horizon, n. The dynamics of the self-financing ratios
are summarized by the following :

                                             K t ;n                       1 + gt                             K t −1;n

Consequently,

         Had we used a fixed point in time for the base year, say t 0 , than the discounting horizon used to evaluated

the self financing ratio at time t would have been m = t − t 0 , increasing each period by one period. It is easy to

verify that in this case,

          ~     ~
          K t = K t −1 (1 − d ) + S t −1
(A5)                                        .
          K t = K t −1 (1 − d ) + I t −1

A modified version of (A4) will hold. The main difference between the cases of fixed versus moving discounting
horizon is that equation (A4) is an approximation, whereas (A4’) holds as a precise equality

         The difference of the time evolutions of two alternative self-financing ratios has the order of magnitude of

[ S t −1−n − I t −1−n ](1 − d ) n
                                  . For large enough d and n, the difference is of a second order magnitude. An advantage
              K t ;n
of the fixed discounting horizon n is that it should allow better comparison across time, especially for the case of
different base years applied to various countries.
The bias associated with fixed discounting horizon:

         Our empirical analysis was based on a fixed discounting horizon, n, assuming that the initial stock of
capital ( K t − n ) was self financed. We evaluate now the magnitude of the bias introduced by this assumption. For

simplicity of exposition, we focus on the case where the real GDP, real saving and real investment grow at a
constant rate, g, and each period a constant fraction of the investment is self-financed. Hence,

I j = I j −1 (1 + g ); S j = S j −1 (1 + g ) . We denote the ‘ideal’ self-financing ratio by fˆ . This ‘ideal’
measure is obtained by unbounded backward discounting --

Truncating the discounting horizon to n periods biases the self-financing ratio. The bias equals 1 − fˆ , times

[(1 − d ) /(1 + g )]n .   14
                               For large enough d, g and n, the resultant bias is inconsequential. For example, for n = 10, d
= 0.1, g = 0.03, and f = 0.9, the estimated self financing ratio exceeds the ‘ideal’ one by 0.035. A higher growth

rate reduces the bias. Had the growth rate been g = 0.06, the bias f − fˆ would drop to 0.025. An implication of
the above discussion is that applying fixed discounting horizon (n) prevents spurious dynamics in the self financing
ratio, by keeping the bias constant overtime.15




14
   The bias identified above applies for the full information case. Uncertainty may introduce another bias,
stemming from the possibility that the initial stock of capital is imprecisely estimated. Unlike the bias identified in
(A12), some of the uncertainty biases may be independent from the discounting horizon, n.
15
   Had we used a fixed point in time for the base year, say t 0 , then the discounting horizon used to evaluated the self

financing ratio at time t would have been m = t − t 0 , increasing each period by one period. This is equivalent to

increasing the effective n over time, reducing thereby the bias calculated in (A12).
