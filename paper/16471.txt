Birth Rates and Border Crossings: Latin American Migration to the US, Canada, Spain, and

                                             ABSTRACT

We use census data for the US, Canada, Spain, and UK to estimate bilateral migration rates to these
countries from 25 Latin American and Caribbean nations over the period 1980 to 2005. Latin American
migration to the US is responsive to labor supply shocks, as predicted by earlier changes in birth cohort
sizes, and labor demand shocks associated with balance of payments crises and natural disasters. Latin
American migration to Canada, Spain, and the UK, in contrast, is largely insensitive to these shocks,
responding only to civil and military conflict. The results are consistent with US immigration policy
toward Latin America (which is relatively permissive toward illegal entry) being mediated by market
forces and immigration policy in the other countries (which favor skilled workers and asylum seekers,
among other groups) insulating them from labor market shocks in the region.

1 INTRODUCTION

        Latin America and the Caribbean have among the highest emigration rates in the

developing world. In 2000, 3.8% of the region’s population was living in high-income

countries in North America, Europe, or Asia, compared with emigration rates of 3.0% in

the Middle East and North Africa, 2.5% in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, 0.7% in

Asia and the Pacific, and 0.6% in Sub-Saharan Africa (see Table 1). 1 While Mexican

migration to the US captures most of the attention, it is by no means the only significant

flow in the region. There are also sizable flows from the Dominican Republic, El

Salvador, and Haiti to the US; Barbados, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago to Canada

and the UK; and Bolivia, Colombia, and Ecuador to Spain (Fajnzylber and Lopez, 2008).

        In this paper, we examine the contribution of demographic changes, geographic

distance, and economic and political shocks in driving emigration from Latin America

and the Caribbean. What makes the region an interesting case is not just the scale of

emigration, but also its concentration. As of 2000, just four countries – the US, Canada,

the UK, and Spain – were host to 75.4% of the region’s emigrants (see Table 2). The

concentration of migration flows to proximate high-income countries (the US) and

countries with a shared colonial heritage (Canada, the UK, Spain) helpfully simplifies

1
  All rates are for emigration from developing countries in a particular region to high-income countries.
Among developing-country regions, total emigration rates are highest in Eastern Europe and Central Asia
(as seen in Table 1), largely because of the exodus of individuals (including ethnic Russians) from Former
Soviet Union countries to Russia following the breakup of the Soviet Union.


                                                                                                             1
both the measurement and analysis of international labor movements. 2

        Among the four main destination countries, there are sharp differences in how

immigration policy treats prospective entrants with regards to skill, refugee status, and

country of origin. These differences are important in light of the low skill levels of most

Latin American emigrants, the propensity of the region for civil and military conflict, and

the variation in countries’ colonial history. In the US, nearly half of immigration from

Latin America is undocumented, with government enforcement only partially impeding

the inflow of illegal migrants (Hanson, 2006). 3 Permissiveness toward illegal entry

creates ample opportunity for low skilled immigration. Canada’s remoteness keeps most

of its immigration legal. 4 The country uses a point system to regulate labor inflows,

which heavily favors skilled applicants, while also allotting slots to refugees and asylees.

In 2000, visas to skilled workers accounted for 58% of legal immigrant inflows in

Canada, compared with 13% in the US (OECD, 2004). Outside of EU members, the UK

restricts immigration, with exceptions for skilled workers, family members of UK

citizens, certain Commonwealth citizens, and asylum seekers. The country also has low

levels of illegal immigration compared to the US. 5 In Spain, large scale immigration is a

recent phenomenon. Agreements with former colonies have enabled individuals from

these countries to enter Spain, with many ultimately obtaining work permits. 6

        Surging emigration from Latin America is due in part to the high frequency of


2
  Current and former French and Dutch territories in Latin America and the Caribbean (French Guiana,
Guadalupe, Martinique, Netherlands Antilles, and Suriname) have high emigration rates to France and the
Netherlands, but are too small to obtain age-specific emigration rates, as is necessary for our analysis.
3
  Throughout the paper we use Latin America to refer to Latin America and the Caribbean.
4
  In 2002, for instance, Canada apprehended 9,500 illegal immigrants, compared to over 1 million in the US
(OECD, 2004).
5
  In 2001, the UK found and removed 45,000 illegal immigrants from within its borders (OECD, 2004).
6
  As distinct from the US, Spain has frequently regularized illegal immigrants in the country, facilitating
their access to work permits (Dolado and Velasquez, 2007).


                                                                                                         2
negative wage shocks in the region. Over the last three decades, much of Latin America

has experienced a demographic bulge, with large numbers of young people coming of

working age and entering the labor force (Birdsall, Kelley, and Sinding, 2001). One

would expect this increase in the region’s relative labor supply to have put downward

pressure on local wages and raised the incentive to emigrate. In some Latin American

countries, birth rates have begun to drop sharply (Bongaarts and Watkins, 1996), but in

others they are declining only slowly. While fertility rates in Mexico are on track to drop

below replacement level by 2020 (Tuiran et al., 2002), they remain high in much of

Central America and the Andes. Cross-national differences in fertility are useful

empirically for isolating the effects of labor supply on emigration.

        Macroeconomic instability associated with balance of payments crises, civil and

military conflict, and natural disasters are other factors reducing wages and contributing

to emigration from Latin America. While there is extensive literature on how such

shocks have affected the region’s growth performance (e.g., Collier et al., 2003; Raddatz,

2007; Edwards, 2008), much less work examines their importance for labor movements

in the hemisphere. Our approach is to estimate how labor supply and demand shocks at

the time a cohort enters the labor market affect initial and subsequent emigration. Since

individuals are most mobile when they are young, shocks at the time of labor market

entry may have long lasting effects on migration. Much of the work on the relationship

between income and international migration considers the contemporaneous correlation

between living standards and labor flows. 7 By identifying how shocks to young cohorts

affect migration over the mobile period of their working lives, we provide a dynamic

(2009) for a review of recent literature.


                                                                                                         3
account of how events in origin countries affect international migration. Linking changes

in labor supply to particular birth cohorts requires that we aggregate across skill levels (in

order to successfully track origin country cohorts across both time and national borders),

preventing us from accounting for migrant self-selection, the subject of much recent

literature (see, e.g., Hanson, 2010). The payoff is that we are able to examine

international migration over several decades and exploit sizable cross-country variation in

how the demographic transition to lower fertility affects subsequent labor supply growth.

        Related literature includes Hanson and McIntosh (2010), who find that variation

in labor supply across Mexican regions accounts for nearly a third of regional variation in

Mexican emigration rates, and Clark, Hatton, and Williamson (2007), who find that

countries with larger populations of young people have higher rates of legal migration to

the US. Because both papers examine a single destination – the United States – they are

silent on how variation in receiving country immigration policy affects the sensitivity of

migration to events in sending countries, a feature that is central to our analysis. Mayda

(2009) and Ortega and Peri (2009) find that tightening immigration policy reduces

bilateral migration flows. Still unknown is how immigration policy affects the

responsiveness of migration flows to different types of shocks.

        To preview our results, we find that migration rates to the US are more sensitive

to fluctuations in relative birth cohort size (i.e., to labor supply shocks), but less sensitive

to origin-country civil conflict than is migration to the other destinations. The raw effect

of distance as well as its interaction with birth cohort size is most pronounced in

migration to the US. The findings suggest that migration from Latin America to the

United States is responsive to labor market shocks that affect origin country relative




                                                                                               4
wages. The responsiveness and distance dependence of US labor inflows to economic

shocks in Latin America reflects the importance of illegal labor movements in regional

migration to the US, as these flows are largely mediated by market mechanisms.

       The results for migration to Canada, the UK, and Spain are quite different, with

migration rates to the countries being uncorrelated with origin country labor supply.

Further, origin country balance of payments crises and natural disasters are associated

with lower migration to Canada, the UK, and Spain. The one origin country shock that is

associated with higher migration to these countries is civil and military unrest, which may

facilitate applications for asylum. The results suggest that given the preference of

Canada and the UK for skilled workers and asylum seekers, shocks whose only effect is

to put downward pressure on origin country wages do little to increase Latin American

migration to these destinations. Indeed, given that negative wage shocks may make it

harder for individuals in Latin America to acquire skills (as would be the case if the

financing of education is budget constrained), it is not surprising that they tend to reduce

migration to countries that favor skilled workers.

       In section 2, we present a simple dynamic model of migration from a given origin

country to multiple destinations. In section 3, we describe data on labor supply,

migration rates, economic and political shocks, and other variables. In section 4, we

present the empirical results. And in section 5, we offer concluding remarks.



2 THEORY
       To understand emigration from Latin America, we construct a model of national

labor markets that are linked by migration. In each economy, there is one sector of

production. Workers from Latin America are differentiated by age but are not otherwise


                                                                                               5
distinguished by their skill. 8 We allow for costs in labor mobility, following models of

internal migration in Blanchard and Katz (1992) and Borjas (2006).

        In the origin country, the national wage for age group i at time t is given by,

(1)              Wit = X it ( Lit )η ,

where Wit is the wage, Xit is a labor-demand shifter, Lit is the population of working-age

adults in the country, and η ≤ 0 is the inverse labor-demand elasticity. The supply of

labor in the origin country is the population of group i that has not emigrated, such that

(2)              L=
                  it Li 0 − M it

where Li0 is the pre-emigration population of group i and Mit is the number of individuals

in i that have left the country by period t. Putting (1) and (2) together,

(3)              ln=
                   Wit ln X it + η ln Li 0 − ηmit ,

where mit=Mit/Li0 is the fraction of group i that has moved abroad. 9 In equation (1), we

treat wages as though they are a function of labor supply in a single age cohort. In the

empirical estimation, we also account for the size of neighboring age cohorts.

        An individual in the origin country has the option of staying at home or moving to

one of two possible destinations, country A or country B. In the year birth cohort i first

enters the labor market, the wage in country c is given by,

(4)              Wi 0c = X ic0 ( Lci 0 )η ,

where Xci0 is a labor-demand shifter, Lci0 is initial labor supply, and η is the inverse labor-

demand elasticity. In later periods, we assume the wage in country c is determined by

initial labor supply and subsequent innovations to labor demand, imposing the restriction


8
  We ignore other aspects of skill because in order to measure net migration by age in Latin America we
need to track populations by characteristics which are invariant to time.
9
  In (3), we utilize the approximation that, for small values of X/Y, ln(X+Y) ≈ lnX + Y/X.


                                                                                                     6
that the impact of immigration on the destination country’s wage is negligible. It is

straightforward to extend the model to allow for adjustment in destination-country wages;

we suppress such adjustment solely to simplify the exposition.10

         To allow for costs in the mobility of labor between countries, we assume that

migration from the origin country to destination-country c in any period t is an increasing

function of the lagged difference in wages between the two countries:

(5)                     σc ( ln Wi ,ct −1 − ln Wi ,t −1 − F c ) ,
                   vitc =

where vitc = ∆M itc / Li 0 is the net emigration rate to country c for group i at t, σc ∈ [0,1] is

the supply elasticity (specific to the destination country), and Fc is a wage discount that

origin country nationals associate with living in country c. As long as σc is sufficiently

small, it will take multiple periods before migration succeeds in raising the origin country

wage to destination country levels. 11 In the empirical analysis, we will allow the

magnitude of the labor supply elasticity, σc, to depend on origin and destination country

characteristics, including distance and number of countries crossed, as a means of

capturing how immigration policy in or migration costs to the destination may affect the

responsiveness of bilateral migration to labor market shocks.

         To solve the model, define the pre-migration effective wage differential between

the origin country and destination c as,

(6)                ωic0 =ln Wi 0c − ln Wi 0 − F c =η ln  ci 0 + ln xic0 − F c .

where ln=
         ci 0 ln Lci 0 − ln Li 0 is initial log relative labor supply and ln
                                                                           =  xic0 ln X ic0 − ln X i 0 is


10
   Allowing for destination-country wage adjustment changes the magnitude of the reduced-form
parameters in the emigration equation but does not change their sign. See Hanson and McIntosh (2010).

   For a zero migration disamenity, the condition that migration does not cause wage equalization in one

period is that, ln=



                                                                                                               7
initial log relative labor demand. The pre-migration wage difference is increasing in the

origin country’s relative labor supply (since η < 0) and decreasing in the origin country’s

relative labor demand. 12 Using (3), (5), and (6), we solve for the t = 0 emigration rate,

and then iterate forward, solving for the wage and emigration rate in each period. In an

appendix, we show that after dropping higher order terms (i.e., those that involve a

minimum of four-way interactions between the model parameters, all of which are

individually less than one in value) and using the approximation that (1+x)t ≈ 1+tx, the

net migration rate from the origin country to country A at time t can be written as,

(7)               vitA =σ AωiA0 1 + ησ A ( t − 1)  + ησ Aσ B ωiB0 ( t − 1) .


Plugging in the determinants of the initial wage differential in (6), we obtain,

                           𝐴                                𝐴
                              [𝜃 𝐴 + (𝜃 𝐴 )2 (𝑡 − 1)] + [𝑙𝑛𝑥𝑖0 − 𝐹 𝐴 ][𝜎 𝐴 + 𝜎 𝐴 𝜃 𝐴 (𝑡 − 1)]

                                     +𝑙𝑛ℓ𝐵𝑖0 𝜃 𝐵 𝜃 𝐴 (𝑡 − 1) + [𝑙𝑛𝑥𝑖0
                                                                   𝐵
                                                                      − 𝐹 𝐵 ]𝜎 𝐵 𝜃 𝐴 (𝑡 − 1)


where θc = ησc < 0 . Equation (8) shows the key predictions of the theoretical

framework: emigration to country A is decreasing (increasing) in the relative size of

country A’s initial labor supply (demand) and increasing (decreasing) in the initial

relative labor supply (demand) of country B, where the effects of initial conditions

diminish as a cohort ages, owing to adjustment in wages in the origin country. Since the

dynamic wage adjustment terms (i.e., those that involve t) depend on the square of labor

supply and labor demand elasticities, their effect on attenuating the impact of initial labor

market conditions may be small (which empirical results will confirm). Similarly, since

the effect of labor market conditions in country B on migration to country A depends on


12
  Here, we assume that labor demand is constant over time such that Xit=Xi0 and X*it=X*i0. It is easy to
generalize the model to allow for time-varying labor demand shocks, as in Hanson and McIntosh (2010)


                                                                                                           8
the three-way product of labor demand and supply elasticities, it may also be small

(which empirical results will also confirm).

       It is apparent in equation (8) that to examine the evolution of migration for a

given birth cohort we need to be able to track cohorts over time, preventing us from

accounting for time varying characteristics of individuals, such as education. Also

apparent is that equation (8) is missing the effects of past innovations to labor demand in

the source and destination countries on current migration flows. Allowing innovations to

labor demand to affect wages introduces into (8) a series of distributed lag terms in these

innovations (see note 12). In the estimation, we allow for such effects by including

measures of labor market shocks that occurred between the time a cohort comes of

working age and the current period.

       Equation (8) is the basis for the empirical estimation. For individual birth cohorts

in Latin American and Caribbean origin countries, we examine the correlation between

the decadal migration rate to a specific destination country and initial relative labor

supply, initial relative labor demand, and subsequent innovations to labor demand.

Consistent with theory, we allow the responsiveness of migration to labor-market shocks

to vary across destination countries. By pooling data across cohorts, origins, destinations,

and time, we are able to include a rich set of fixed effects in the estimation to control for

unobserved shocks to migration. The fixed effects also help absorb variation in migration

disamenities and migration policy across countries.



3 DATA
       The data we require for the estimation include measures of migration rates for

pairs of origin and destination countries, labor supply by birth cohort and country, and


                                                                                                9
measures of economic shocks for origin and destination countries.



3.1 Bilateral migration rates
         To calculate bilateral migration rates we use the number of immigrants by age and

origin country in each destination county’s census count, and the size of the relevant birth

cohorts in the origin country, as measured by the World Development Indicators. The

bilateral net migration rate for a given birth cohort and origin-destination pair is then the

change in the stock of immigrants in that cohort from a particular origin country in a

particular destination, divided by the size of the original birth cohort in the origin. In all

regressions, the dependent variable is the annualized bilateral net migration rate for a

birth cohort over the relevant time period (in most cases the ten years between censuses).

         For the US, we are able to measure age -specific stocks of immigrants from all but

the very smallest Latin American and Caribbean countries in 1980, 1990, 2000, and

2005, using data from decennial censuses and the American Communities Survey

(2005). 13 For Canada, we have similar measures from decennial censuses for 1981,

1991, and 2001, provided by Statistics Canada.

         Data for the UK and Spain are more problematic. For the UK, we have country

specific immigration stocks aggregated by five year birth cohorts in 1981, 1991, and

2001, based on data provided by the UK Census Commission. For Spain, we have

similar data for 1981, 2001, and 2007 (the 1991 census reports region rather than country

of birth for many countries in the sample). The aggregation of immigration stocks into

five year birth cohorts for the UK and Spain means we have fewer observations on cohort

specific migration rates for these countries. A further problem is that the UK provides

13
  We can measure immigrant stocks for the US in earlier years as well, but this is of no use since our data
on births do not begin until 1960 (meaning we cannot measure source-country labor supply before 1976).


                                                                                                         10
incomplete data on immigration stocks for non-Commonwealth countries in the region, as

does Spain for countries that are not former colonies. Consequently, UK and Spanish

data are a mix of stocks for individual origin countries and aggregates of remaining

countries in the region. In both cases, the residual aggregates are very small in size,

indicating that few individuals from former Spanish colonies migrate to the UK or vice

versa. Because of the limited scope of the UK and Spanish data, we begin the analysis

using data for the US and Canada, for which we have nearly complete data on origin

countries, and then expand the sample to include the two other destinations. The

appendix shows the number of usable cohort-specific bilateral net migration rates we

have for each origin and destination country pair.

           To gauge the magnitude of emigration from Latin America and the Caribbean,

Table 2 reports total emigration rates in 2000 by origin country, as well as the fraction of

emigrants residing in the US, Canada, Spain, and the UK, using data from Parsons at al.

(2007). Excluded are Cuba, which severely restricts emigration, and countries with fewer

than 200,000 inhabitants in 2000, all of which are Caribbean islands (on which we have

incomplete data). Evident in Table 2 is variation in the attractiveness of the four

principal destinations to emigrants from the region. In the Caribbean and Central

America, the share of emigrants going to the four destinations is above 50 percent in all

countries, except Nicaragua, 14 and above 70 percent in all other countries except Haiti, a

former French colony, and Antigua and Barbuda.

           In the more remote South American region, the share of emigrants going to the

four destinations exceeds 50 percent for only two countries, Ecuador and Guyana. For

Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay, neighboring Argentina is an important

     In 2000, 43% of Nicaragua’s emigrants resided in neighboring Costa Rica.


                                                                                           11
destination; the share of emigrants going to the four destinations plus Argentina is above

60 percent for each country. For Colombia, neighboring Venezuela is an important

destination; the share of its emigrants going to the four destinations plus Venezuela is

81.3%. Thus, in South America nearby rich nations appear to compete for migrants with

more distant high-income countries. In Table 2 we also see that Argentina and Brazil –

South America’s largest nations – have low emigration rates, in either case less than 2

percent. Of the countries in Table 2, we exclude from the analysis Argentina, which in

the sample period is more a destination for migration than an origin, and Brazil, which as

a former Portuguese colony sends few migrants to the US, Canada, the UK, or Spain.

       In the empirical analysis, we focus on migration rates for individuals aged 16 to

40, as these are peak years for migration (Hanson and McIntosh, 2010). Also, since our

birth cohort data from the World Development Indicators do not begin until 1960, we are

unable to measure migration for cohorts older than 40 years of age. To gauge the

variation in migration rates for the sample cohorts, Table 3 shows the average migration

rate across cohorts by origin and destination country pair in the latest available year.

Emigration rates for small countries are quite high, with over 10 percent of the sample

cohorts of Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Grenada, and Guyana –

each with fewer than 1 million inhabitants – having migrated to the US alone. Migration

rates into Canada and the UK are highest for former British colonies: Antigua and

Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, Granada, Guyana, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago.

For Spain, migration rates vary considerably across its former colonies, with the highest

rates found in South America, which is relatively distant from the US. Ecuadoran

migration to Spain is a curious outlier, with 17.8% of cohorts having migrated as of 2007.




                                                                                           12
       Table 4 provides perspective on the sample variation we will be exploiting in the

estimation, where the dependent variable is the annualized net migration rate calculated

over the interval between the previous and current destination census. The table gives the

net migration rates during the latest available interval. Apparent are sharp differences in

net migration rates across origin countries for given destinations and across destinations

for given origins. While migration rates to the US from Grenada, Honduras, Guyana,

Mexico, and El Salvador are high, they are practically zero for Bolivia, Chile, Colombia,

Nicaragua, and Paraguay, and the 2000-2005 period actually saw reverse net migration to

Antigua and Belize. For the countries with high migration to the US, only Grenada and

Guyana show high net migration rates to Canada. Similarly, among the countries

showing little net migration to the US, Bolivia, Colombia and Paraguay exhibit sharp

increases in migration to Spain. We turn next to facts that might account for this cross-

sectional variation in changes in migration rates.



3.2 Labor supply in sending and receiving countries
       The first labor market shock we consider are changes in labor supply, associated

with earlier differences in birth rates across countries. We measure labor supply using

the number of live births in each country, as reported in World Development Indicators,

which begin in 1960. Assuming that individuals enter the labor force at age 16, the

number of individuals born, say, in El Salvador in 1970 would indicate the number of

individuals coming of working age in 1986. By taking the ratio of origin country and

birth country labor supply, we can take advantage of the cross-destination country

heterogeneity in this dyadic data structure.

       In using number of births to measure labor supply, we ignore variation across



                                                                                            13
source countries in both mortality rates and labor force participation rates, data on which

we cannot obtain by age and year. While cross-country variation in mortality rates is a

concern, there are two reasons why it is unlikely to be a significant problem for our

analysis. One is that we focus on migration of those of prime migration age, which is 16

to 40. For individuals out of childhood but not yet in middle age, variation in mortality

across Latin American countries is relatively low. More importantly, much of the

variation in mortality rates is absorbed by the country and time dummies that we include

in the estimation. In a regression of annual mortality rates for nations in Latin America

and the Caribbean on country dummies and year dummies, the adjusted R squared is 0.94

for infant mortality, 0.95 for under-5 mortality, and 0.86 for adult mortality. Thus, most

of the cross-country variation in mortality can be removed by removing country-specific

means and time-specific means from the data, which we do in the empirical analysis.

       Figure 1 shows the time series of births for countries in Latin America and the

Caribbean from 1960 to 2005. Immediately apparent is strong variation in the time

pattern of births across countries. In the Andes, births grow steadily between 1960 and

1980 in all countries except Colombia and then flatten out. In Central America, births

grow steadily through the mid 1970s in all countries except Costa Rica and then flatten

differentially, slowing first in El Salvador, followed by Nicaragua and Honduras and

never slowing in Guatemala. By the 1960s, the Southern Cone had already entered an era

of slow population growth and births are flat across time in all countries except Paraguay.

The Caribbean contains a mix of outcomes, with some countries showing growth in births

(Belize, Dominican Republic, Haiti), and others showing declines (Barbados, Guyana,

Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago). Variation in the growth of births across countries




                                                                                            14
produces variation in the growth of labor supply 15 to 20 years hence. It is this variation

in birth levels we will exploit to identify the impact of labor supply on emigration.

        An important question is whether the factors that produce variation in fertility

across countries are correlated with emigration, potentially confounding our empirical

analysis. The literature associates national differences in levels and changes in fertility

with a large set of determinants (see, e.g., Dasgupta, 1995; Galor, 2005; Lehr, 2009).

Because realizations on emigration are observed between 16 and 40 years after the shifts

which caused the changes in birth cohort size, we take these changes to be pre-

determined for our analysis. We assume that, given country, year, and cohort fixed

effects, the most plausible explanation for correlation between country-level birth cohort

size and subsequent migration is the cohort size itself. Of course, the size of birth cohorts

may summarize more about a country than its labor supply. In section 4, we discuss

alternative interpretations of our results.



3.3 Labor demand shocks in sending and receiving countries
        To control for how changes in labor demand affect migration, we include in the

estimation of equation (8) per capita GDP in the year a cohort entered the labor market,

as well as contemporaneous per capita GDP, for both the origin and destination country.

As we control for origin and destination country fixed effects in the regressions, per

capita GDP effectively picks up how differential income values in a given year affect

migration. As it turns out, entry year and contemporaneous per capita GDP tend to be

highly correlated, such that we sometimes include just one of these variables.

        Average income is an obvious control, but by no means the only factor that

affects migrant perceptions of living standards at home or abroad. Over the time period



                                                                                              15
we study, which spans the mid 1970s to the mid 2000s, Latin America experienced

multiple balance of payments crises, frequent natural disasters, and episodes of intense

civil unrest. Such events disrupt the lives of individuals, reducing their income and

wealth and often displacing them from their homes. While these shocks are temporary,

they are often severe in nature, sufficient to lead to temporary or permanent emigration.

We construct measures of the incidence of these shocks equal to the number of events

that occur in a country over a given time period divided by the number of years in the

period, which we refer to as the annualized shock incidence.

       To capture balance of payments crises, which are typically followed by a banking

crises and collapse in GDP, we use the measures of sudden stops in Cavallo (2007),

which indicates whether a country has a large decline in its current account, with foreign

capital inflows suddenly reversing and becoming capital outflows. Calvo (1998)

associates such episodes with a loss in investor confidence in a country, as occurs when

investors downgrade expectations about a country’s capacity to service its debts or

maintain a pegged exchange rate. Cavallo’s definition of a sudden stop is whether a

country experiences a decline of greater than two standard deviations in a current account

surplus in successive years, where he measures the standard deviation four different

ways. We take the average incidence across the four measures between census intervals.

Table 5 reports the incidence of sudden stops over the sample period. Mexico, Colombia,

and Ecuador are the countries most prone to capital inflow reversals, with 11 other

economies experiencing at least one sudden stop in recent years. Nine countries

experience no sudden stops, with seven of these being Caribbean nations.

       Natural disasters are a common occurrence in Latin America, given its proximity




                                                                                           16
to the Ring of Fire and exposure to tropical storms in both the Caribbean and Pacific.

Following Yang (2008), we define a serious natural disaster as an earthquake over 7.5 on

the Richter scale, a windstorm (e.g., hurricane) lasting a week or more, or a landslide or

volcanic eruption that affects more than 1000 people. We count the number of events

that occur between census intervals. Data on these events are from the International

Emergency Event Database (http://www.emdat.be/). Mexico, Ecuador, Nicaragua, and

Honduras have the highest incidence of natural disasters, with only seven countries

escaping a serious disaster during the sample period.

       The last three decades have been a time of political transition in Latin America,

with military coups displacing democratically elected governments during the 1960s and

1970s, followed by a return to democracy in the 1980s and 1990s. Armed insurgencies

have occurred in over a half dozen countries, with these conflicts involving thousands of

casualties and lasting for a decade or more. We measure conflict as the number of years

between census intervals in which a serious conflict exists (be it extra-state, intra-state,

internal, or internationalized internal in nature) that resulted in the deaths of over 1000

people. The source is the CSCW Monadic Armed Conflict Database from the

International Peace Research Institute (http://www.prio.no/). Colombia, El Salvador,

Guatemala, and Nicaragua are the most conflict prone countries, with each country being

subject to a conflict of some type in one quarter or more of the sample years.



3.4 Immigration policy in receiving countries
       The four main receiving countries for Latin American emigration differ

considerably in their immigration policies. The US, which is the most important

destination for Latin American emigrants, manages immigration through granting



                                                                                               17
permanent residence visas and temporary work visas, and enforcing the US territory

against illegal immigration. The 2,000 mile long US border with Mexico makes illegal

entry an attractive option for migrants from Latin America. In 2005, the last year of our

US sample, there were 18.9 million immigrants from Latin America and the Caribbean

residing in the US (Camarota, 2005), of whom 46.2% were estimated to be in the country

illegally (Passel, 2006). The majority of legal immigrants from Latin America enter as

family members of US citizens and residents. In 2005, family sponsored visas accounted

for 76.6% of US legal inflows from the region, with employer sponsored visas (the

majority of whom are skill workers) accounting for 13.6% and refugees and asylees

accounting for 1.9% (DHS, 2005). 15 While the US is relatively open to inflows of low

skilled labor from Latin America, few individuals in the region qualify as skilled workers

and fewer still (outside of Cuba) as refugees or asylees.

           Canada has long managed its immigration policy through a regime that favors

skilled workers, the legal basis for which was established in 1976 and modified several

times since (Mayda and Patel, 2004). Individuals earn points for entry depending on their

youth, education, work experience, ability to speak English or French, and having a job

offer from a Canadian employer. In 2001, the last year in our Canadian sample, skilled

immigrants accounted for 60.6% of permanent immigration visas, family members of

Canadians 26.6%, and refugees and asylees 11.3% (OECD, 2004). Because of the

emphasis on skills, Latin America, where education levels remain relatively low,

accounts for a small share of Canadian immigration, comprising 8.0% of legal inflows in

2001. If an individual from Latin America cannot quality for a Canadian visa on the

basis of skills or family, the primary means of entry would be through asylum.
15
     These figures exclude Cuba, for which 90.0% of immigrants are refugees or asylees.


                                                                                          18
           The UK belongs to the European Union and allows for the unrestricted movement

of EU citizens. Outside of the EU, immigration is limited to family members of UK

citizens, skilled workers, temporary workers with a job offer from a UK employer,

citizens of Commonwealth countries with UK ancestry, and refugees and asylees.

Commonwealth citizens aged 17 to 30 who lack UK ancestry may qualify for a “working

holiday” in which they spend two years in the UK, with eligibility to work for one of

these. 16 Some individuals may abuse such visas by staying on in the country and

working illegally. In 2001, the last year of our UK sample, asylum seekers accounted for

24.5% of immigration admissions, temporary foreign workers 22.8%, and EU citizens

16.2%, with the remainder made up by family members of UK citizens and skilled

workers (OECD, 2004). In 2002, which is after our sample period, the UK implemented

a point system intended to expand skilled immigration (Mayda and Patel, 2004). For

Latin America, opportunities to migrate to the UK would appear to be limited primarily

to Commonwealth citizens and refugees and asylum seekers.

           Spain’s immigration policy is somewhat difficult to specify. As an EU member,

it allows the unrestricted movement of EU citizens. Until the late 1980s, the country was

primarily a source of emigration. Following the sudden increase in immigration inflows

in the 1990s, government policy responded slowly, being concerned initially with how to

treat those who had already found a way into the country. It appears that a large fraction

of non-EU immigrants who entered Spain in the 1990s and 2000s did so illegally or as

visitors (Dolado and Velasquez, 2007). For those able to obtain employment, the

government has been relatively permissive in granting legal work permits, offering

multiple amnesties to undocumented workers in the last two decades. The most

                                                                                        19
significant barrier to migrants from Latin America entering Spain may not be obtaining a

visa but the cost associated with travel, establishing residence, and finding initial

employment as an undocumented worker. Recently, Spain has expanded the number of

work visas it supplies in an attempt to direct immigration through legal channels,

requiring prospective migrants to line up a job before entering the country.

        Immigration policy mediates how labor demand and supply shocks affect

migration rates between origin and destination countries. In the absence of barriers to

immigration, the only barrier to moving between countries is the travel expense of

relocating from one place to another, which is likely to be positively related to the

distance between locations. Where illegal immigration is an option, distance is likely to

have an even more pronounced role. For individuals in Mexico, migrating illegally to the

United States is a matter of crossing the US-Mexico border. For individuals in

Guatemala, illegal migration is more difficult as they must successfully pass through

Mexico before negotiating the US border. And for individuals from countries further to

the south, illegal migration is likely to be more problematic still. Given the complication

of crossing multiple borders, it is perhaps not surprising that Mexico accounts for 56% of

illegal immigrants in the US, Central America 15%, and South America only 7% (Passel,

2006). Where legal immigration regulated by binding quotas is the only option, as in

Canada and the UK, distance may be a much less important factor. There is likely to be

greater weight on whether individuals have family members in the destination, ancestral

ties to the destination, sufficient skills, or claims on asylum.

        To consider the interaction between distance and immigration policy, Figure 2

shows how net migration rates to destinations change with distance from the origin




                                                                                          20
country, where we plot this relationship for each destination separately. For the US, in

which nearly half of Latin American immigration is illegal, migration rates decline

strongly with distance. Moving further away from the US appears to complicate

migrating to the country. For Canada, in which skill based immigration and asylum are

the primary options for most Latin Americans, migration rates change little with distance

from the origin. The relationship for Spain is similarly flat. Only for the UK do we also

see a negative association between migration rates and distance, where this relationship

may be attributable to British former colonies being concentrated in the Caribbean, which

is located relatively close to Europe. The variation in the distance-migration relationship

is initial evidence of how immigration policy may mediate the underlying drivers of

migration. In the next section, we examine a range of shocks more formally.


4 RESULTS
4.1. Partitioned Analysis
       Table 6 provides a first comparative overview of the results by estimating the

migration effects of labor supply and demand shocks separately for each destination.

The dependent variable in all specifications is the annualized net migration rate for a

given birth cohort and origin-destination pair (the change in the stock of immigrants in

that cohort from a particular origin country in a particular destination, divided by the size

of the original birth cohort in the origin). The first two columns present impacts in the

US and Canada using annual birth cohorts (meaning we measure migration rates in each

birth year separately). Data from Spain and the UK come aggregated into 5-year birth

cohorts, and when we perform pooled analysis we will aggregate the US and Canada in a

similar way. Table 6 presents partitioned results under both aggregation schemes.



                                                                                            21
         The analysis features variables that enter at the origin country level, the origin

birth cohort level, the destination birth cohort level, and interactions with destination

country dummies. The data therefore have a non-nested multi-level structure, and it is

not perfectly clear how we should handle our standard errors. The number of clusters is

relatively small across most of the primary dimensions (26 birth countries, 4 destinations,

10 destination census waves, and 12 aggregated birth cohorts), and so our ability to

estimate consistent cluster level covariance terms is limited. 17 As a conservative way of

estimating standard errors that nonetheless provides a sufficient number of observations

for consistent estimation, we cluster our analysis at the dyad level (origin * destination),

for 73 dyads in an aggregated dataset of 832 usable observations. 18 In the segregated

data structure of Table 6 this is equivalent to clustering by origin country.

         For the US, we find a strong impact of a demographic push created by large origin

birth cohorts.     The log birth cohort size ratio (birth cohort size in origin/birth cohort size

in destination) enters positively and highly significantly. Emigration to the US is

increasing and strongly concave in age, with the peak migration age being 28. There is

evidence of a complex relationship between initial income of a cohort, which increases

migration to the US, and current income, which weakly retards it. Canada displays

patterns that are similar but considerably muted in absolute terms; the marginal effect of a

given labor supply shock is one twenty-fifth as large for migration to Canada, and

insignificant. While migration to the US is increasing and concave in age, it is interesting

to note that Canadian immigration generates migration rates that are weakly increasing


17
   Cluster asymptotics are based on the number of clusters and not the number of observations per cluster
(Cameron, Gelbach, and Miller 2008).
18
   We have experimented with different clustering structures, and all results discussed here are robust to the
alternative strategy of clustering by origin country.


                                                                                                           22
and convex in age, perhaps reflecting the bias of the country’s point system in favor of

individuals who have completed their education and are therefore older.

         Columns 3-6 of Table 6 present results using birth cohorts aggregated at the five-

year level, as is found in the raw data from Spain and the UK. We collapse the North

American origins to match the age aggregation used in the UK census, and then define all

dummies effectively shifting the Spanish birth structure off by one year so that there is

full agreement between the census years, ages, and birth years in the aggregated cohorts

across all four destinations. 19 This aggregation makes little difference in the answers for

the impact of labor supply shocks on migration into Canada and the US; point estimates

and t-statistics are both very similar. We have little explanatory power in the partitioned

regressions over migration to Spain or the UK, although if anything the effect of labor

supply shocks appears to have an opposite sign in the UK as it does in the US. That the

results for the US are similar for one- and five-year birth cohorts suggests that the size of

neighboring cohorts, first discussed in Section 2, carries little weight in identifying how

initial labor supply affects later migration. We return to neighboring cohorts below.

         Figure 2 suggests a sharply different role of geographic distance for the US and

Canada. The basic role of the US in buffering Canada from overland migration implies

that the issue of contiguity of migration origins may also play less of a role. To

investigate this possibility, Table 7 interacts measures of proximity with labor supply

shocks to see whether they modulate the migration impact of demographic push factors.

As described in Section 3.1, the data from the US and Canada provide a more

19
  This is done to assure comparability when we move to pooled analysis. While the weighting of the
regressions by the size of the cohort takes care of any mechanical objections over correct sample inference,
there may additional problems arising from the error in the estimates differing, or the smoothing in the
impact that arises from aggregation of birth cohorts. We therefore transform the structure of the US and
Canadian data to match that of the other countries.


                                                                                                         23
comprehensive view of migration across origins. While all four destinations record a

complete set of origins in their final census, only the North American countries have

done so consistently over time. 20        Data from the US and Canada allow us to test for

marginal effects across the whole distribution of origins and not just those with strong

links to the destination. We therefore focus first on an analysis of heterogeneity in the

response to labor market conditions, using data from these two countries alone.

         The first four columns of Table 7 present results for the US and Canada

separately, taking advantage of the large set of origins available for these two countries.

For the US, the impact of labor supply shocks is lower for island nations, weakly lower

with great circle distance, and much smaller for non-island countries based on the number

of other countries that must be crossed to reach the US by land. Hence, proximity plays a

role in determining the impact of variation in labor supply, particularly for origins where

migrants make an overland trip to reach the US. For Canada, in contrast, birth cohort

sizes are insignificant overall as well as having no differential slope across any of our

measures of proximity. 21 Note that the uninteracted coefficients on labor supply shocks

are of real interest here as they represent the projected impact of a labor supply in an

idealized origin that is ‘on top of’ the destination, with no distance between them and no

countries to cross. Even in such an idealized case, immigration to Canada does not

respond to birth cohort size.

20
   The most obvious form of attrition bias caused by the UK and Spain recording only high-migration
origins in early years is that by definition a dyad with zero observed migration has demonstrated no
sensitivity to the shocks measured here. This would suggest that the UK and Spain would have marginal
effects that are biased upwards by attrition. Our results show precisely the opposite, namely that the US
(which records the most complete set of origins) is much more sensitive to a wide variety of shocks, and
hence we conclude that if anything this attrition problem is causing us to underestimate the true degree of
‘American exceptionalism’.
21
   Note that with only a single destination, we cannot include raw distance in combination with origin fixed
effects, and so the uninteracted impact of distance is omitted in columns 1-4. Countries crossed is not
defined for Spain and the UK, and so we do not include this variable in the pooled regressions.


                                                                                                         24
       Columns 5-8 of Table 7 pool together all destinations, a data structure that forces

us to consider the substantial heterogeneity present across destinations in the sample.

The US population is ten times that of Canada, and hence even with comparable

proportional migration the flow of migration measured relative to the size of origin-

country birth cohorts will differ by an order of magnitude. Furthermore, as seen in Table

3, migration to the US as a fraction of origin population is substantially higher than it is

to the other destinations. In order to prevent this cross-sectional heterogeneity in birth-

cohort ratios and migration rates from informing coefficients, we always include

destination-country fixed effects when multiple destinations are pooled together.

       The pooled analysis confirms the uniqueness of the US as a destination. Column

5 of Table 7 shows that birth cohort size is a stronger driver of migration to the US than

to the other destinations, and column 6 shows that proximity to the US is more important

as well. Column 7 combines these two effects and shows that the rate at which the

sensitivity to labor supply shocks falls off with distance is again greatest for migration to

the US. In column 8 we again confirm the unique sensitivity to labor supply of nearby

origins with overland migration routes to the US, but also find that for the (Caribbean)

island origins where overall migration to the US is lower, sensitivity to birth cohort size

is also lower. This poses an interesting geographic divide, suggesting that population

growth in Mexico and Central America primarily pushes migrants to the US, while

growth in labor supply in the Caribbean, equally close to the US but tied to the UK and

Canada through historical bonds, pushes migrants to those destinations instead.



4.2. Shocks
       We next consider how a broader set of shocks may drive migration, and may



                                                                                              25
modulate the effect of labor supply shocks themselves. Our data provide an intuitive way

to examine the impact of shocks on migration because we have long time series over

many countries, and so observe a sufficiently large number of shocks in the data to

estimate precise impacts. The three shocks we consider in Table 8 are:

•   Number of Serious Natural Disasters is the annualized count, over census intervals,
    of earthquakes over 7.5 Richter, windstorms lasting a week or more, or landslides or
    volcano eruptions affecting more than 1000 people in origin country. In order to
    remove heterogeneity introduced by the raw size of the country, we divide the
    number of shocks by land area (thousand square kilometers).

•   Number of Sudden Stops is the annualized count, over census intervals, of Sudden
    Stops 1-4 from Cavallo (2007), defined as a year-on-year fall in the current account
    surplus of at least 2 standard deviation from the sample mean, with standard
    deviations calculated four alternative ways.

•   Civil Conflict is from CSCW Monadic Armed Conflict data, calculated as a the
    number of years between census intervals in which conflict exists in the origin
    country in which more than 1000 people died.

Table 8 takes the pooled data structure to the analysis of origin-country shocks in driving

emigration from the Americas. The table can be read by taking the ‘Shock’ referred to in

the third row from the column title, so the first two columns examine the effect of and

interactions with natural disasters, and so on.

        Negative shocks that are not political in nature will likely increase the desire for

emigration from origin countries, but will not alter the access to legal immigration in

asylum-driven destinations. Civil conflict, on the other hand, both increases the ‘push’

factor behind emigration and creates the ability to apply for asylum. Correspondingly, in

Table 8 we find that non-political shocks (weakly) increase migration to the US (columns

1 and 3), while political shocks increase migration to all other destinations (column 5).

The uninteracted coefficient on civil conflict is 0.25, indicating that average migration

rates to all three other destinations will go up by 2.5% over ten years, or an additional


                                                                                            26
7.5% of the birth cohort emigrated to all three destinations over the 10 years around the

conflict. Even here the US is distinct; in the case of civil conflict migration rates to the

US are significantly lower, both relative to the other destinations and in absolute terms.

       The even-numbered columns in Table 8 intersect the two families of shocks by

examining whether the responsiveness of migration to labor supply and income shocks is

larger when these coincide with shocks of other types. In other words, perhaps an

individual in a large, low-wage cohort would have stayed put had economic times been

good, but in the face of a downturn will choose to migrate. Large cohorts that also face

non-political shocks are far more likely to migrate to the US (columns 2 and 4), and large

cohort facing political shocks are far more likely to migrate to the other destinations

(column 6). Labor supply does interact with other shocks in powerful ways. The

heterogeneous response of migration to origin-country shocks across destinations is most

pronounced when labor supply pressures are increasing the incentives to migrate.

       Columns 3 and 4 of Table 8 present a nuanced picture of the ways in which

income and national economic shocks interact to drive migration to the US, because they

allow us to separately identify the impact of the overall initial wealth of a cohort (GDP pc

at age 16) independently from a sudden macroeconomic shock (sudden stops). We see

that when a cohort does experience an economic shock, the higher is income at the time

when the shock occurs, the greater is the impact of the shock on migration to the US.

Combined with the results in the second row of Table 6, this suggests that on the whole

income is a sharper determinant of the ability to undertake the economically costly move

to the US, but that underlying there is a stronger tendency for a downturn in a migrant’s

economic prospects in the origin country to trigger migration to the US.




                                                                                               27
       Column 6 of Table 8 continues to provide evidence of the uniqueness of political

shocks across the destinations. While labor supply plays a relatively larger role in driving

migration to the US under all the other shocks, here we see it playing a much weaker role

when there is a civil conflict. That is to say, once a political shock has opened up the

asylum conduit for migration to Canada, Spain, and the UK, birth cohort sizes become

more influential, again in both absolute and relative terms.



4.3 Network Effects
       A different cut on Table 8 is that where shocks deliver a comparatively large

direct effect on the number of migrants going to a destination, further migration to that

destination becomes more sensitive to birth cohort size. One interpretation of this result

is that network effects begin to lower the costs of further migration once it has begun, and

so the constant pressure that birth cohort sizes exert on the incentive to migrate becomes

more visible. We now proceed to examine these network effects more directly.

       A standard way to investigate heterogeneity that arises from network effects is to

use the historical stock of migrants as a proxy for the strength of networks (see the survey

in Hanson, 2010). The analogy in our data is to use the earliest census year in which we

have an observation on migration between an origin and a destination, and calculate the

dyadic stock of migrants across cohorts in that year. This is then the first available

observation on the number of people from each origin living in each destination.

       Column 1 of Table 9 gives a base specification for comparison purposes. Column

2 illustrates the strong overall effect of initial migrant stocks on subsequent migration

rates across the sample. Column 3 shows that the full-sample sensitivity to labor supply

shocks is not significantly higher when a large base stock of migrant exists, although the



                                                                                            28
interaction between labor supply shocks and initial migrant stock is positive and is

significant at the 90% level. The final column tests whether the raw effect of base

migrant stocks is stronger in the US; the results indicate that these stocks matter about

twice as much in the US as elsewhere. 22 Our results thus demonstrate a role of network

effects that is strong overall and substantially stronger in the US. While variables that

proxy for the strength of network effects explain migration overall, they are particularly

critical in determining the predominantly economically-driven migration to the US.



4.4. Extensions and Robustness Checks
         A first concern that may arise when considering these results relates to the use of

relatively fine-grained birth cohorts (even our most aggregated analysis uses five-year

cohorts). While the comparison of aggregated (five-year birth cohorts) and disaggregated

(one-year birth cohorts) results in Table 6 does not incline us to think that this

aggregation will be the source of major measurement problems, a question remains as to

the relationships between adjacent cohorts. To the extent that the size of a given cohort

has strong effects over the behavior of its neighbors, at the very least we will encounter

problems with the independence of observations, and may even find biased answers to

the extent that these cohort sizes are correlated.

         Issues of multicollinearity prevent us from simply controlling for the size of the

preceding and following cohort, because these neighboring cohorts will be highly

correlated with the size of one’s own cohort in the data. As a way of getting around this
22
  Additional analysis not presented here draws on the extension of the model presented here in Hanson and
McIntosh (2010). This work explicitly considers the role of network effects, showing that the dynamic
adjustment path of migration as a given cohort ages presents a tension between the dampening effects of
wage arbitrage on further migration (which would decrease the effect of a shock with age) and the
formation of migration networks with peers as your cohort is increasingly in that destination. Our results
here show little heterogeneity in the impact of shocks across cohort age, indicating that these two forces on
average are in balance both in the overall sample and to the US specifically.


                                                                                                          29
problem, we calculate the growth rate from the previous cohort to this one, and the

growth rate from this cohort to the next, and control for these rates rather than for the raw

cohort size itself. Table 10 repeats the analysis of Table 6 using aggregated cohorts and

controlling for these cross-cohort growth rates. No significant effects of the size of

adjacent cohorts are found in the US (the only country in which the raw effects are

significant) and while the coefficient on the growth rate from the last cohort to the current

one is significant in the overall sample, it is not significantly negative in any individual

country. Most importantly, the coefficient estimates on the contemporaneous effects

remain very stable when we control for cross-cohort effects. Hence we find no evidence

that spillover effects across cohorts are likely to be causing major measurement errors.

       A similar concern could arise in our analysis of shocks if it were the case that

countries that had shocks in one period always had them in later periods, or if the impact

of the shocks themselves displayed sufficient persistence. To analyze this Table 11

calculates annualized shock variables over the preceding census interval and includes

them in a specification similar to Table 7. We find natural disasters to be the only type of

shock with any persistence in migration impacts, but the lagged effects are always of the

same sign and with a reduced magnitude from the original shock. The heterogeneity

observable in the response to shocks for migration to the US is very similar in the

response to lagged shocks. Again, inclusion of these lags does not change our overall

read on the results, which is that natural disasters disproportionately increase migration to

the US and political shocks increase it to the other destinations.

       In unreported results, we examined whether the results may be driven by Mexico,

which is the largest source country for immigrants in the US. All of our results are robust




                                                                                               30
to dropping Mexico from the estimation sample. In other results, we considered whether

the importance of agriculture may mediate the impact of labor market shocks. Since the

supply of agricultural land is relatively inelastic, increases in labor supply may have a

more negative effect on wages in agriculture dependent economies than in economies

specialized in manufacturing (which is intensive in relatively elastic capital). We found

no evidence that the level of agricultural development in origin countries, on its own or

interacted with labor supply or labor demand shocks, matters for emigration.



5 DISCUSSION

       We intersect data on the size of birth cohorts in origin countries with data on the

size of immigrant stocks by age and origin country in the US, Canada, Spain and UK to

examine factors associated with emigration from 25 Latin American and Caribbean

countries over the period 1980 to 2005. We find that for migration to the US labor

supply shocks, in the form of abnormally large or small birth cohorts, are a significant

push factor, while they are uncorrelated with migration to Canada, Spain, or UK. The

effect of labor supply shocks decreases with distance from the destination for the case of

the US but not for the other countries.

       Our cohort panel data cover a long time span over a broad set of countries and

therefore provide a good platform for examining how large but relatively rare shocks may

contribute to migration. We find that natural disasters and balance of payments crises

increase the impact of labor supply shocks on migration to the US, but not to the other

destinations, whereas civil and military conflict have the reverse effect, decreasing

migration to the US but raising it to Canada, Spain and the UK.

       These results draw a picture of one destination, the US, that is uniquely engaged


                                                                                            31
in a demographic dance with its neighbors. Inaccessibility by land, along with

immigration regimes that are more formulaic and asylum-based, have effectively turned

off a susceptibility to labor supply-driven migration in Canada, the UK, and Spain. The

United States displays a similar insensitivity with respect to the far-off countries of South

America. With its close neighbors, migration rates to the US respond strongly to

shocks; larger or richer cohorts are most likely to migrate to the US, with this sensitivity

heightened by economic volatility in the destination.

Using equations (3), (5), and (6), we solve for the t = 0 emigration rate, and then iterate
forward, solving for the wage and emigration rate in each period. After some algebra, the
emigration rate to country A for age group i in period t can be shown to be,

where there is a continuing series of high-order interactions of the model coefficients up
to the power t-1. The expression for country B is analogous. While the expression
appears complicated, the determinants of current emigration from the source country are
simply initial wage differences between the origin and the two destinations, ωiA0 and ωiB0 .
The large number of terms in (A1) comes from the fact that positive emigration occurs
only along the transition from an initial period in which there are large international wage
differences to a final equilibrium of small wage differences. 23 Migration from the origin
country to destination A today affects migration to B tomorrow, which affects migration
to A in the following period, and so on. Since these higher order effects depend on a
minimum of four-way interactions in the labor demand elasticity and labor supply
elasticities (which are each less than one in absolute value), they are likely to be very
small in practice; to simplify the expression, we exclude these terms.

To interpret (A1), consider each term in the expression. The first term on the right
indicates that the current emigration rate to country A is higher the larger is the initial
wage gap between the origin country and destination-country A. Note that the emigration
rate declines over time (owing to the assumption that 1 + ησ A < 1 ), as the exodus of labor
pushes up source-country wages. The second term on the right indicates that the current
emigration rate to country A is lower the larger is the initial wage gap between the source
country and destination-country B, as the availability of an alternative location siphons
off migrants who would have otherwise gone to A. The terms on the second and third
lines of (A1) are the initial terms in a series of higher order effects, which capture the
implications for current migration to country A of how past migration to country A has
affected migration to country B and of how past migration to country B has affected
migration to country A. Excluding the higher-order terms and using the approximation
that (1+x)t ≈ 1+tx, we can rewrite (A1) in much simpler form as

     Because of the migration disamenity, international wage differences may not be fully eliminated.

# of Serious Natural Disasters: The sum, over census intervals, of earthquakes over
7.5 Richter, windstorms lasting a week or more, or landslides or volcano eruptions
affecting more than 1000 people.

# of Sudden Stops: The sum, over census intervals, of Sudden Stops 1-4 from Cavallo
(2007), defined as a year-on-year fall in the current account surplus of at least two
standard deviations from the sample mean, with the standard deviation calculated four
alternative ways.

Civil Conflict: Calculated as the number of years between census intervals in which a
serious conflict exists (Extra-state, Intra-state, Internal, or Internationalized Internal)
that killed over 1000 people in a country.

# of Serious Natural Disasters is the sum, over census intervals, of earthquakes over 7.5 Richter, windstorms lasting a
week or more, or landslides or volcano eruptions affecting more than 1000 people in sending country.
# of Sudden Stops is the sum, over census intervals, of Sudden Stops 1-4 from Cavallo data, defined as a fall in the
CA surplus of at least 2 SD from sample mean, with standard deviations calculated four different ways.
Civil Conflict is from CSCW Monadic Armed Conflict data, calculated as the number of years between census
intervals in which a serious conflict exists (Extra-state, Intra-state, Internal, or Internationalized Internal) that killed
over 1000 people in the sending country.

All regressions calculated using five-year birthyear cohorts, with birth cohort, birth country, destination country, and
census wave fixed effects included in all specifications. Interactions of Cohort Size ratio*US only and GDP ratio*US
are
. included in columns 2, 4, and 6 but not reported. Regressions are weighted by the size of the birth cohort.
* significant at 95%, ** significant at 99%, t-statistics in parentheses and SEs clustered by origin/destination dyad.
# of Serious Natural Disasters is the sum, over census intervals, of earthquakes over 7.5 Richter, windstorms lasting a
week or more, or landslides or volcano eruptions affecting more than 1000 people in sending country.
# of Sudden Stops is the the sum, over census intervals, of Sudden Stops 1-4 from Cavallo data, defined as a fall in the
CA surplus of at least 2 SD from sample mean, with standard deviations calculated four different ways.
Civil Conflict is from CSCW Monadic Armed Conflict data, calculated as the number of years between census
internals in which a serious conflict exists (Extra-state, Intra-state, Internal, or Internationalized Internal) that killed
over 1000 people in the sending country.
