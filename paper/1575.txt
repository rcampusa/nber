                                   ABSTRACT



        The role of a real interest rate and a credit aggregate as inter-

mediate monetary policy targets are investigated under the assumption of

rational expectations. The analysis expands a standard aggregate model to

include a credit market and a market determined interest rate on bank

deposits. This allows the implications for output stabilization of real

interest rate policy to be examined for a wider variety of shocks than

normally considered in the literature, as well as allowing a credit aggregate

policy to be studied.

1.   Introduction

                During the 1970s, monetary authorities in a number of

countries reoriented the conduct of policy toward setting explicit

targets for monetary growth. Two principal criteria of this approach

('rieciman   [1975   })
                          are that the measure of the money supply be closely
related to the policy objective variable —         usually   nominal income

growth — and that the money supply contain reliable information about

the future path of this variable. However, instability in estimated

money demand equations in the mid—1970s and, more recently, the extent

and speed at which innovation has been occurring in financial markets

in response to record high interest rates, deregulation, the

computerization of the financial industry and other factors 1 have

raised concern about the appropriateness of using iaonetary growth

targets for short—run policy purposes. Indeed, two consequences of

financial innovation can be identified which would suggest (or in some

circumstances clearly have indicated) that the aforementioned criteria

are not being met.

                The first involves the spread of cash management

techniques whereby transactions oalances are kept at a minimum. This

development results in a shift in the relationship between the money

supply and the ultimate policy objective, thereby rendering monetary

growth targets less useful unless the changing relationship can be

monitored closely. The second involves combining transactions and

savings balances, particularly those of the household sector, into an
                                  —2—




all—in—one account which earns a near—market rate of interest.2 This

development introduces an interest—rate—setting decision, or an

own—rate, into the relationship between the money supply and the

policy variable.

               Because of these changing circumstances, increasing

attention is being focused on the possible role of real interest rates

as intermediate targets for monetary policy.      In considering real

interest rates for purposes of conducting policy, four important

issues need to be addressed: Ci) what real interest rate measure

should be used (Feldstein and Summers [1978 ]),   (ii)   what ability does

the monetary authority have to control the real rate (Shiller [1980 ]),

(iii)   what is an appropriate target level, if any, for the real rate,

and (iv) what are the consequences of focusing on real interest rates

as opposed solely to a monetary aggregate for purposes of setting

policy. In this paper, the last three issues are addressed with

particular attention being placed on the fourth issue.

               As an alternative to both monetary aggregates andreal

interest rates, Friedman [1983 ] has suggested that the close

correlation between nominal income and a credit aggregate be exploited

in the design of monetary policy. By incorporating a rudimentary

credit market, the model developed here can also examine the role of a

credit aggregate as an intermediate target for monetary policy.

                In the next section, a basic aggregate, rational

expectations model is extended to incorporate a market for loans, a
                                  —3—




market determined interest rate on deposits, and a monetary policy

rule which permits non—borrowed reserves to deviate from a target path

in response to both real interest rate movements and movements in the

aggregate quantity of loans. The model is used, in section 3, to

examine the implications of such a policy rule for aggregate output

and price stability. Conclusions are summarized in section 4.


2. The Model

               This section extends a standard aggregate rational

expectations model (McCalluni [1980 )   to   incorporate a market for loans

and bank reserves. It differs from the recent models of Parkin

[1978], Turnovsky [1980] and Benavie and Froyen [1983 ] by considering

policy rules which incorporate responses to a real interest rate and a

credit aggregate.

               The real side of the economy consists of two equations.

The first is a very simple IS relationship determining aggregate

demand. This is assumed to take the form


(1)       =
              8_r+€
where y is the logarithm of aggregate output and r is the real rate

of interest on bank loans, the only nonmonetary asset in the model; e

is a white noise disturbance term.
                                     —4—




                The second equation, which completes the specification

of the goods market is an aggregate supply function given by



(2) y =     y + c(p—             +
                                     u.
Equation 2 is a Lucas—type aggregate supply equation with 5 and Pt

denoting the logs of capacity output and the price level

respectively.     The notation            signifies an expectation of a

variable x formed at time t—1. This general notation is used

througnout the analysis and expectations are assumed to be rational.

The disturbance term in (2), u. is assumed to be a white noise


process.

                The demand for loans is assumed to be inversely related

to the real interest rate on loans and positively related to income.

This latter effect reflects an assumption that both firms and

households increase their demand for loans as aggregate real spending

rises. The loan demand   equation    is then given by


           1 =           +        + Vt


where i is the log of the noatnal quantity of loans. Like u and

v is taken to oe a white noise disturbance cer.
 t
                                                    5—




                 Money     demand is specified in equation (4)             as   the   demand

for oank   deposits:


 (4)     clp =         +
                           'i    1dt
                                       —
                                           12't +           +


where   dt is the log of tue nominal stock of deposits, 1dt IS the

nominal interest rate on deposits, i is the nominai                    loan   rate and

is a white noise disturbance term.

                Banks are assumed to issue loans and deposits and to

hold reserves against their deposits.                     If banks face a downward

sloping demand for loans as a function of the interest rate on loans,

an upward sloping demand for deposits as a function or dt' and an

upward sloping supply of federal funds as a function of the interest

rate on federal funds, i, bank supply of loans will take the form



        It—pt = a    +            —            —
                           a1i         a2id        a3if ÷       e..


The supply of deposits is assumed to be


(b)     d_p =    b   + but        —
                                       bZidt
                                               +
                                                   b3if    +
                                                                e2.
               The demand for reserves by banks will be assumed equal

to requirea reserves; excess reserves are set equal to zero. If the

lo of the reserve requirement ratio is p and the log of total

reserves is trt,
                                            —6—




7)        tr = p+ d.


                   The supply of reserves has two components: non—borrowed

reserves nbc, the monetary authorities' policy instrument, and

borroweu reserves. To represent bank borrowing behaviour, assume the

ratio of total reserves (borrowed plus non—borrowed) to non—borrowed

reserves is given by


                           =                    + C3ift + e3.
(8)       trt —   nb           C0 + C1i + C2l


Equations (5)—(8) provide a very simple representation of the banking

sector. For a discussion of the aerivation of such relationships from

a model of profit maximizing banks, see Benavie and Froyen [1982 J.

                   To link the real and nominal interest rates on loans,

the Fisher equation is assumed to take the form


             =         +          —
(9)
                  rt                  Pt.

One key feature ot this model is that participants in financial

markets are assumed to have current—period aggregate information when

forming expectations about the one—perioc ahead rate of inflation. In

the supply function, however,                   appears. This can be rationalized

in terms of one—period wage contracts in the labour market and in

terns of quick processing an dissemination ot intoruation in

financial markets. This feature of the model is incorporated by using

      —          + Pt instead of (the more common)         —              as the
                                  —7—




real interest rate. As ficCallum [1980 ] has demonstrated, this

specification invalidates the policy ineffectiveness proposition

characteristic of one class of rational expectations models developed

by Sargent and Wallace [1975 ] and others by making the unconditional

variance of the expectationaJ. error for Pt potentially dependent on


policy paranieters.

               To complete the model, a specification of the monetary

authorities' behaviour nest be adopted. One formulation of policy is

that used by Poole [1970 } in which a fixed money stock rule is

compared with a fixed nominal interest rate rule. However, Sargent

and Wallace [1975 J have shown that under such an interest rate rule

tne price level is indeterminate. 6 Accordingly, policy will be

characterized by a feedback rule for nbt that allows nb to deviate

from a (constant) target in response to past fluctuations in the real

interest rate from its expected level.   In considering a potential

role for real interest rates as an intermediate target, however, it is

important to bear in mind t1at the monetary authorities cannot

arbitrarily fix rt given the model's assumption that aggregate supply

equals aggregate uecaand. In addition, to capture the role of a credit

aggregate in the design of monetary policy, the monetary authorities

are assumed to adjust nb in response to unanticipated movements in

the stock ot loans. The feedback rule is assumed to take the form
                                         —8—



(10)        nb = Ia + m1(r1 —         2r1) +              — t—21t—1


                                                                                8
where        denotes the logarithm of the non—borrowed reserves target.

If      =        =   0, the authorities act to hold non—borroweu reserves at
            m2


the targetec level. If m1                         the monetary authorities allow


       to deviate from        If,   in the previous period, there was an


unanticipated movement in the real rate (stock of loans). At the

beginning of period t, when the monetary authorities are setting nbc,


rt and           are not yet observable. Any feedback rule for setting nb

can contain only variables observable at the eric of t—1. '           If   rt_l or

        differ from what had, at the beginrting of period t—1, been

expected, the expectational error is viewed as a signal of shocks to

the system. The monetary authorities are assunied to respond to

(r1 —       t2'tl        and 1t—1 —
                                      t—21t—1'
                                                 rather ttian the underlying


disturbances (ui, v1, etc.) directly. As the interuieciate target

literature has made clear, this leads to suboptimal stabilization

policy (Friedman [1975 J).          However, it is also the case that the

relevant     class of policies which are likely to actually be followed by

central banks, and wtiich have recently been proposed, are more closely

captured by a rule such as equation (10) than they are by an optimal

feedback rule.

                      Obtaining the rational expectations solution to the

model is straightforward and the details can be found in the

appendix. It is shown there that

Equations (11)—(14) will be utilized in the next section to examine

the role of in1 and in2 in      stabilizing economic activity.

3.     Policy Analysis

                   As a necessary prelude to any analysis of stabilization

policy, it must be shown that the policy feedback rule (10) does allow
                                                    — 10 —

choice of m , m         ,   and m
           o    1                    2

                   From (12),

                             —
                                     —1                 —       +

Denoting the elements of it, by ir11, i =                           1,   ...,   7,   the conditional


variance of r can be defined as

                                                                    22   222

         2                                                           a + 11rj3a        +

where     denotes the variance of the random variable x, and the


elements of 0 are assumed to be independently distributed. Dealing

first with the case in which m2= 0 (the monetary authorities do not

respond to the credit aggregate), inspection of the solution reported


in the appendix reveals                       + o as        +            Thus, making the level of


non—borrowed reserves respond to past unanticipated movements of the

real rate of interest allows fluctuations iti the current real rate to

be smoothed. In the Poole [1970 1                       analysis,         the monetary authorities

can arbitrarily fix the nominal interest rate. Here, the monetary
                                                  — 11 —




authorities          can fix the real rate, but             only    at the value

                —1            —
        =             (   $—y) which equates expected aggregate supply and

aggregate demand.

                                         2                          2
                          From (13), a = E                              as   +     Thus, a

policy of stabilizing the real rate of interest also serves to

insulate real output from financial sector and aggregate supply

shocks, but not from aggregate demand shocks. In addition, as


        +   '             —
                                    + (1/ c*1}(   —
                                                      ut)

while                approaches a finite limit. Note that the financial

disturbances
                              v,   and the e.'s, have no effect on either output or

prices under a fixed real rate policy. The price level is determinate

under such a policy because, from (10), expected future values of

non—borrowed reserves are given by m and are thus finite (see


HcCallum [1981 1)•

                       Having demonstrated that r is affected by policy in the

model, the consequences of targeting on the real interest rate by the

monetary authorities can now be analyzed in the context of the model

solution when m1 is finite. The general solution for y is given in

(13). Comparing (13) with (12) shows immediately that only in the

face of aggregate demand (
                                         c)   shocks is there a conflict between real
                                   — 12 —




interest   rate and real output stabilization. To insulate r from

requires that          =   0 which, In turn, requires m1 =   From (13),


however, m1 = o'makes the coefficient on      in the equation for y

equal to 1. The appendix shows that stabilizing output in the face of

aggregate demand shocks would iequire that m(. 0, but insulating y
                                              j



from demand stocks makes ce's coefficient in (12) equal to          A

clear conflict exists between stabilizing r and stabilizing y. Shifts

In the IS curve cause r and y to move in the same direction. By

affecting interest sensitive components of aggregate demand, the

movement in r tends to work as an automatic stabilization mechanism.

If policy attempts to prevent movements in r, this automatic

stabilization mechanism Is eliminated and larger output fluctuations

result.

                Under a pure non—borrowed reserve rule, m1=m2=O and the

coefficient on      in (13) is less than one so that y responds less to

   than under a rule which fixes rt. This result corresponds to that

of Poole's analysis in which a money supply rule is preferred if

disturbances occur to aggregate demand. The combination policy which

insulates y from      shocks requires the monetary authorities to

reduce the current level of non—borrowed reserves if last period's

real interest rate was unexpectedly high (m1( 0).

                 In    the face of the seven sources of stiocks modelled


here, the value of m which minimizes                  will be a complicated

function of the       relative   variances of the underlying disturbances.

However, increases, for example, in the variance of the error term in

the money demand equation (4) would tend to increase the                 minimizing

value of m1. Thus, greater money demand instability calls for greater

deviations of the level of non—borrowed reserves from its target path

in response to real interest rate movements.

                 In rational expectations, equilibrium business cycle

models (Barro [1981. ]),    it       is usually not optimal to attempt to

stabilize output in the face of supply shocks. Barro [1976 J suggests

a policy criterion which, in the present fralAework, would call for

                                 2

be the case that real output and real interest rates are cotapleEely

insulated from financial sector disturbances.

                 Suppose now the monetary authorities respond to

unanticipated movements in bank loans but not to real interest rate

policy of stabilizing rt insulates real output from all but aggregate

demand shocks. If 1 is stabilized (around                    equations   (1)—(3)

                  Equations    (17)—(19) show that a policy which eliminates

unanticipated movements in a credit aggregate such as bank loans would

prevent money demand and banking sector disturbances from affecting

output,   the real interest rate on loans, and the price level. For

these disturbances, then, a real interest rate policy and a credit

aggregate policy are equally effective in stabilizing output. As

indicated by equation (17), however, aggregate supply shocks,

aggregate aemand shocks, and disturbances to loan demand continue to

produce output and price fluctuations under a credit aggregate policy.

               The factors relevant for a cotiparison of a real rate

policy and a crecit aggregate policy are similar to those important in

the Poole [1970 J   comparison of roney supply and nominal interest rate
policies. Under a policy which eliminates unanticipated movements iii

the real rate, YttiY = %. Under        a credit aggregate policy,

still affects output, but the coefficient on      in (17) is less than

one. Demand disturbances have a snaller effect on real output uncer a

policy which prevents unanticipated fluctuations in bank loans than in

real interest rates.

               On the other hand, ut and v influence            under a


credit policy but do not under a real rate policy .    Both policies

succeed in preventing money demand disturbances from affecting either

real output or the price level.


4. Summary ano Conclusions

               This paper utilizes an expanded aggregate rational

expectations model which includes a crenit market to investigate

possible roles tor real interest rates ana a credit aggregate as
                                   — lb —




intermediate   targets for purposes of short—run stabilization policy.

For this purpose policy is characterized by a feedback rule that

permits non—borrowed reserves to cieviate from a constant target in

response to past fluctuations in either the real interest rate or the

stock of loans outstanaing from expected 1CVCIS.

               The analysis shows that stabilizing real interest rates

and stabilizing output and the price level (or nominal income) in

response to demand shocks is not possible. A non—borrowed reserve

rule, as with the money supply rule in the original Poole analysis, is

preferred in this circumstance. With pure supply or financial sector

shocks, output can be stabilized by stabilizing unexpected fliOVeUieflCS

in real interest rates, at the cost, for supply shocks, of increased

price variance. Moreover, the monetary authorities can only stabilize

the real interest rate at the value determined by equating aggregate

supply with aggregate demand.

                Stabilizing output and the price level in response to

deiuand shocks is also not possible by following a credit aggregate

rule. However, oecause interest rates ntst adjust to prevent any

unanticipateci fluctuations in bank loans with such a rule, the

contributions of demand shocks to the variance in output is less than

in the case of a real interest rate rule. In contrast, stabilizing

credit in response to an aggregate supply shock would not prevent

output fluctuations as would a real rate rule, because the resulting

moveuents in interest rates have a proportionate impact on aggregate

aemand.   With financial sector disturbances, other than those to loan

demand, the analysis shows the equivalence of a real interest rule and

a credit aggregate rule.

1 Financial innovation in Canada has been spurred primarily by market
   forces, whereas in the United States, the Depository Institutions
  Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980 has given additional
   impetus to developments in financial markets.

2 The most recent example in the United States is the Super—NOW
   account which was introduced in early 1983. In Canada, most
   chartered banks now offer daIly Interest chequlng accounts which
   combine features of daily interest savings and personal chequing
   accounts.

  See, for example, Benavie and Froyen [1982] for an analysis of the
  relationship between policy variables and the money supply with a
  flexible deposit rate.

  Moreover, in the United States, recently proposed bills in both
  Houses of Congress seek to amend the Federal Reserve Act by
  requiring the Federal Open Market Committee to establish targets
  for long—term nominal or short—term real rates of interest. For
  discussions of real rate targeting, see Hester [1982] and Walsh
   [1983].

  See Benavie [1983] for an analysis of monetary policy when the real
  rate of interest enters the aggregate supply curve.

6 McCallum [19811 has shown, however, that the nominal interest rate
  can be used as a policy instrument to achieve a money target
  without leading to problems of price level indeterminacy.
  Turnovsky [1980] explicitly takes the view that an indeterminate
  expected price level is not a problem if the conditional variance
  is finite.

  This differs from Woglom [1979] and Benavie [1983] who allow the
  monetary authorities to respond contemporaneously to the nominal
  rate of interest.

8 Because the error terms in (1) and (2) are assumed to be serially
  uncorrelated, t_2rt_l =            is a constant. This would not
  be the case if c or u were serially correlated.

  If the objective is to minimize the variance of           a
  comparison of (19) should be made with (1/ a)( —u) since this is
             when r—1r = 0.    The coefficients of both    and v in
  (19) are less than 1/c in absolute value.
