                     presents an overview of current models of consumption and
            This paper
investment behavior, First, the stochastic implications of the permanent
income model and empirical tests of these implications are discussed. Then
the simple theoretical model is extended to include expenditure on consumer
durables.     In addition,     the implications of liquidity constraints and the
                    of   the   rate of return on wealth are discussed.  The overview
unpredictability
of consumption behavior closes with a critical discussion of the Ricardian
Equivalence Theorem.
     Investment behavior is analyzed using a dynamic optimization model of a
firm facing costs of adjustment. This framework integrates the accelerator
                                                 The model is then used to
model, the neoclassical model and the q theory.
                                                      and investment and also
analyze the interaction of corporate taxes, inflation
to analyze the effects of uncertainty on investment. The overview of
investment concludes with a discussion of inventory investment.

expenditures on durable goods. Becaose durable goods produce services to consumers over
several periods, these goods are consumed over several periods. Because the expenditure on a

durable good usually takes place in one period, it is importar.t to distinguish the consumption of
durable goods from the expenthture on these goods. From the viewpoint                of the individual
consumer, what matters is the flow of consumption ser"tces from duranic go-ods. From the

viewpoint of the macroeconomic determinadon of aggregate income, expenditure on durable
goods is important. Section II enriches the permanent income model to incorporate durable
goods as well as non-alurabie goods and services into the decision problems              of individual
consumers.

         The theoretical analysis of consumer expenditure in Sections      1    and II is based on the
assumption that consumers have access to perfect capital markets and can borrow or lend at an

exogenous rate of interest. However, a substantial fraction of consumers is unable to consume as
much as predicted by the permanent income model because they cannot borrow as much as they
would like at the prevailing interest rate. Consumers who would like to increase their current
borrowing in order to increase current consumption are said to be liquidity constrained. The
importance   of liquidity constraints from the viewpoint of macroeconomics is that the relation
between consumption and contemporaneous income           is generally different for liquidity con-

strained consumers than it is for consumers who do not face binding liquidity constraints. The

implication of liquidity constraints for the relation between consumption and income is discussed
in Section III.
        In analyzing the relation between income     and consumption in the first three sections of
the paper, the rate of return on wealth is assumed to be constant. However, there are important

links between asset markets and consutiptionbehavior. In particular, the level of consumption
                                                                                       on the
depends on the consumer's wealth, and the intertemporal pattern of consumption depends
rate of return on assets. Section IV presents a formal model of consumption by an infinitely-
lived consumer who faces a stochastic rate of return on wealth. This model produces a simple
relation between consumption and wealth and allows us to distinguish the effects of cx post

changes in the rate of return from changes in the cx ante rate of return.
      Although the statement that consumption depends on the consumer's level of wealth
                                                                                        is

not controversial, there is still wide-ranging disagreement about what constitutes the wealth of a

consumer. In particular, should a consumer's holding of government bonds be counted as net
wealth? An equivalent question in a different guise is whether a bond-financed cut in lump-sum
taxes has an effect on consumption. At first glance, it would appear that consumers who receive
a tax cut would view themselves as having an increase in lifetime disposable resources and
would increase their consumption accordingly. However, because the government must eventu-

ally pay interest on the newly issued bonds and repay the principal, the bond-financed tax cut
implies that future taxes will be increased. Indeed, the increase in future taxes will have a
present value equal to the current tax Cut, and thus, it is argued by some economists, there will be
no response of consumption to a change in tax policy. In Section V, this argument, which is
known as the Ricardian Equivalence Theorem, will be presented and critically evaluated.
        The discussion of capital investment begins in Section VI with the Jorgensoniari neoclas-
sical theory   of investment. This theory explicitly treats the demand for capital as a derived
demand by starting with the firm's production function and demand curve. The demand curve
and production function are used to obtain a relation between a firm's cashflow and its contem-

poraneous stock of fixed capital (plant and equipment). The firm's demand for fixed capital is
                                                    -4-



 set at a level that equates the marginal profit of capital with the user cost of
                                                                               capital. The user cost
 is a concept that captures the cost of using a unit of capital in production over a certain period of
 time. The neoclassical theory      of investment predicts that a firm's demand for canital    wili be

 positiveiy related to the firm's level of outout and will he negatively related to the user cost of
 capital. A more resolctedmodel which corresponds to a special case of the neoclassical model is
 the accelerator model, in which the demand for capital      i
                                                         'opontonalto the level of oumut but is
 independent of the user cost. The accelerator modci and the more general neoclassical model are
 discussed in Section V.A.
        An ultomadve theory of investment behavior by firma is the q
                                                                            theory. Tohin (1969)
 defined q to be the ratio of the market value of a finn to the replacement cost of the loan. This
 ratio is meant to measure the value of lured capital reladve to its cost. The greater is this ratio.
 the greater would be the incentive to acquire the capital and hence the greater would he the rate
 of investment. Because the value of the firm is measured using data from equity and bond
 markets, the link between asset markets and investment expenditure is quite explicit. Although
 Tohin's presentation of the q theoty did not explicidy model the firms' production function and
 demand curve, it is possible to start with the demand curve and the pnodttctionfdnction and then
derive the q theory as the result of intertemporal maxin-dzation by firms. A formal derIvation of
the q theory, and the link between the formal model and Tobin's q, is presented in Section VI.B.
         The corporate tax environment--in particular, the corporate tax rate, the investment tax
credit, and the schedule of depreciation allowances--has a potentially important impact on capital
investment decisions, Although the effects of these aspects of the tax code on investment are

important in their own right, from the viewpoint          of monetary economics the most interesting
feature of the taxation   of capital income and expenditure is the interaction of inflation, taxes and
investment. This interaction is briefly discussed in Section VII.
       The models of investment analyzed in Sections VI and VII do not take explicit account of
uncertainty facing firms. The decision to present deterministic models in these sections reflects
two considerations: First, as a matter of expositional
                                                       clarity, the deterministic models are much
simpler than the stochastic models. Second, and more importantly, is that, in contrast to models
                                                    -5-




of consumption, state-of-the-art models of investment behavior do not rely critically on the
stochastic nature of the decision problem facing firms. Nevertheless, a brief discussion of the

impact of uncertainty is presented in Section Vifi.
       In addition to investment in plant and equipment, firms also invest in inventories. Inven-
                                                                       demand. It would appear
tory behavior has been a particularl puzzling component of aggregate
that just as consumers with concave unity functions would want to have smooth time profiles of
                                                             to have smooth time profiles of
consumption, firms with convex cost functions would want
                                                     to have smooth production in the face of
production. Inventories provide firms with a means
                                                                   take advantage of inventory
fluctuating sales. However, it does not appear that firms actually
accumulation and decumulation to smooth out production relative to sales. Section IX discusses
this apparent contradiction in the simple production smoothing model as well as possible

explanations.

I. Consumption
        The life cycle and permanent income hypotheses, which are the major theories of con-
                                                                his lifetime income rather than
sumption behavior, each relate the consumption of a consumer to
to his contemporaneous income. The underlying choice-theoretic framework is that a consumer
has an intertemporal utility function that depends on consumption in every period of life. The
consumer maximizes utility subject to single lifetime budget constraint. There is no static, or
                                                                          to     the income in
 period by period, budget constraint that requires consumption in a period equal
 that periodi2  Indeed, in the absence of uncertainty, the life cycle and permanent income
                                                                            and contemporaneous
 hypotheses both predict that there will be no relation between consumption
 income. However, the introduction of uncertainty will generally induce a positive relation
 between consumption and contemporaneous income.
       To develop the implications of the permanent income model, consider the decision
                                                                                 after-tax labor
 problem facing an individual consumer at time t. Let YtÃ·j denote the consumer's



     the presence of binding liquidity constraints, which are discussed in Section ilL the consumer will face a
 sequence of period by period budget constraints.

 income at time t+j, forj       0, 1, 2,         It is convenient to assume that the consumer      lives forever.
 Sthctlv speaking, this assumption          is   consistent with the permanent income hypothesis bet            is

 inconsistent with the life-cycle hypothesis. One              of the major implications of the life-cycle
 hothesis is that saving is done by consumers when they are working to provide for consump-
 tion when they are retired. This implication will not be capnired in a model in which the con-
 sumer lives, and earns income, forever. However, for the puose of
                                                                         examaning the cyclical
 relation between consumption and contemporaneous iecome, it is simply not important whether

 the consumer has a finite hor-izon. Let c,., denote the consumption of the consumer in period N-j
 and let W denote the werith of the consumer at the beginning of period before earning interest.

 The rate of return on wealth caoded from period t-i to period t is r,. The accumuiauon of wealth
 is described by
                                                  = (1 +r.)W+y,c,.

       Equation (1) describes the evolution of the consumer's wealth over time but, by itself,
does not consu-ain behavior, There is nothing in equation (1) that prevents the consumer from

borrowing to finance arbitrarily large consumption. An additional constraint is needed. If the
consumer has a finite lifetime, with period T being the last period of his life, then one could

impose the consu-aint WTÃ·I           0, which states that the consumer cannot die in debt, Under               an
infinite horizon, the appropriate constraint is

                       lim{(l + r) (1 + r+i) (1 + r2) . . . (1       rÃ·1)}1   W'+-      0

         The intertemporal utility function of the consumer is assumed to be additively separable

overtime.4 Let u(c) denote the utility of consumption in period t+j. The period utility function
u() is assumed to be strictly increasing and strictly concave. As of the beginning of period t the

alence Theorem discusted below depend critically on whether the horizon of an individual consumer is finite or
infinite. Poterba and Summers (1987) argue that empirically the distinction between infinite horizons and finite
horizons has a small effect on the impactof tax policy.

To interpret (3) consider a reduction in    c of one unit accompanied by a one unit increase in the
wealth carried into period t+l. The additional unit of wealth carried into period t+l produces an
additional I +   r1 units of disposable resources in period tÃ·l which can be consumed in period
                                                     of the consumer.     In evaluating whether   this
t+l without affecting    any future opportunities

potential intertemporal rearrangement of consumption is a good idea, the consumer compares
        which is the loss in utility from the unit reduction in c, with

                                   (1 +   p) E{(l + rt+i) U'(CtÃ·t)}
which   is the expected discounted gain in utility from the increase of (I + rÃ·1) in cÃ·1. If the
utility loss associated with a unit reduction in    c is smaller than the expected discounted utility
                                                                           can increase expected
gain from the increase in period t+l consumption, then the consumer
                                                                     with a unit reduction in ct is
utility by reducing c. Alternatively, if the utility loss associated
greater than the expected discounted utility gain from the increase in penod
                                                                               t+ 1 consumption,

then the consumer can increase expected utility by increasing c1. Optimality requires that neither
an increase nor a decrease in   c can lead to higher expected utility, which is impliedby equation
(3).
         Now suppose that the rate    of return on wealth is perfectly predictable one period in
advance; more precisely, suppose that r1Ã·1 is in the information set at time t. This assumption
                                                                                                  a
                                               r
holds, for example, if the real interest rate is constant overtime. Empirically, if the length of

  period   is   taken to be a calendas quarter and if r, is the real return on
                                                                               90-day Treasury Bills, then
  the assumption that      r is perfectly predictable one period in advance may be a reasonable ap-
  proximation. Alternatively, if rL is the one-period homing remm on common stocks, then the
 assumption that r, is perfectly predictable one period in advance is clearly inaporopriate.
 Nevertheless, I make this assumption to understand some of the implications of the first-order
 condition in equation (3). Observe that equadon (3) can be rewritten as

                                  uicÃ·;) = (l p)I(i           r1Â±i)1 u'fc1)       eÃ·                          (4)

 where e,Ã·. is an unpredictable random variable. More
                                                      precisely, E {e,Â±i} = 0. Equation (4) is
 particularly useful for understanding the stochastic implications of the oeanent income
 hypothesis. Before exsining the stochastic implications of (0, 1 will first discuss the implica-
 tions of intertemporal utility maximization in the absence of uncertainty.

 A.   Deterministic Income
        In the absence of uncertainty the random disturbance
                                                                              et
                                                                         in (4) is identically equal to
 zero, in this case, equation (4) implies that the marginal
                                                            utility of consumption grows (or falis) at
 a rate equal to (p - r+j) 7(1 + r+i). Thus, if the rate of return r,.. exceeds the discount rate
                                                                                                  p, then
the marginal utility falls over time which implies that consumption rises over time. That
                                                                                          is, if the
reward to postponing consumption (rÃ·) cxcceds the impatience cost of
                                                                             waiting (p), then the
consumer will choose to have lower consumption today than in the future.
                                                                              Alternatively, if the
rate of return on saving is less than the rate of time preference, then the consumer 'will choose to
have higher consumption today than in the future.

                                                                              r
      Now make the stronger assumption that the rate of return is a constant, and furthermore

      r
that is equal to the rate of time preference p. It follows
                                                           immediately from (4) that if rt = p and
if eÃ· is identically zero, then consumption is constant over time. The level of consumption will
be the maximum permanently sustainable flow of consumption, which Friedman (1957) has



5Although the nominal rate of return on 90-day T-bills is perfectty predictable, the rate of inflation cannot be
predictedperfectly,so the real rate of return cannot be predictedperfectly.

called permanent income. Note that if the consumer always consumes an amount equal to the net

return on his or her wealth (appropriately defined, as below, to include human as well as non-
human wealth), then his or her total wealth will remain constant over time. Any attempt to
                                                                       sustainable. Thus permanent
permanently consume more than the return on wealth will not be
income is equal to the real rate of return on total wealth multiplied by total wealth.
       To calculate the level of perma. 'it income, it is necessary to calculate human wealth.        In

the absence of uncertainty, and in the presence of a real interest rate which is constant and equal

to p, human wealth is simply the present value of current and future labor income,6 which I will
denote as H. More precisely,

                                                                                                     (5)


The factor 11(1 + r) appears in front of the summation because, consistent with the definition of
non-human wealth, I am defining human wealth in period t to be calculated prior to earning the
rate of returnr in that period. The implication of this definition is that if income is always equal
to some constant, say y0, then human wealth would be equal to         y/r. In this case, the return to
human wealth would be y0 so that in the absence of nonhuman wealth, permanent income would
be equal to y0.
        In the presence of nonhuman wealth, permanent income,           y' *   is equal to the return on

human plus nonhuman wealth so that

                                         y'*=r(wt+H)          .                                       (6)


Recall that with r = p. consumption is constant over time. The invariance of consumption over
time holds even if labor income is (deterministically) time-varying. Thus, for an individual

        a world without uncertainty, there would be no relation between consumption and
living in

contemporaneous income over time. However, in a cross-section of individuals
                                                                             with different




6Flavin (1981) pointed Out that Sargent (1978) erroneously defined permanentincome as the present value of
disposable income. However, because disposable income includes the return on wealth, this concept involves
doublecounting.

Suppose that the consumer sets consumption in period t equal to ex ante permanent income         y so
that

Sa'ictly speaking, it is not generally optimal to set consumption equal to permanent income as in
(8). The uncertalnty associated with future income flows may generate precautionary saving
which would imply that an intertemporally optimizing consumer would choose to consume less

principle implies that it is indeed optimal to set consumption equal to permanent
defined in (6). I will ignore the complications associated with a nonzero third derivative of u(),
and proceed as if optimal consumption is equal to permanent income in (6).
        Before proceeding to study          response of consumption to income for a fairly general
                                            tin..

stochastic process     for income, I first derive a consumption function for a simple special case.

Suppose that y evolves according to the first-order autoregressive process

                                            Yt   -y      =ai(yti -y)   +u

where   0    a < 1,        {ut}   = 0, and y        is   the unconditional expected value of y. In this            case,


            = y + a (Yt -      so that using the definition of permanent income in (5) and (6) it can be

shown that consumption is

                         ci   =rW + [r/(1 +r- ai)}yt + [(1 -ai)/(1 +r- aj)J.

Equation (10) relates consumption to wealth and contemporaneous income and thus resembles
                                                                                          a

traditional   aggregate consumption function.8                Note that   the coefficients on    y and y     are   each

positive and they sum to one. Thus, ignoring wealth    W, consumption would be a weighted
average of current income and the unconditional average value of income. The weight on current
income is an increasing function of a1 which measures the persistence of deviations in income.

Although (10) may not appear at first glance to be a forward-looking consumption function, it

assumes that the consumer has a finite horizon, the consumer consumes some of the principal in addition to the
intereston his wealth. In thiscase, the coefficient on wealthis larger than the real interest rate r. Empirically, Ando
and Modigliani (1963) estimated this coefficient to be in the range from 0.04 to 0.10 for a sample of U.S. data; in

does take account of forecasts of future income. It mrns out that for a fst-order autoreciessive

 process, y contains all information that is known about future deviations of income from 7.
        For   a more generai stochastic process on   y1,   I will not derive a consumption funcdon

relating consumption to wealth and current and past income. Instead 1 will focus on thc relation
 between fluctuations in consumption and fluctuations in income.

        To study the fluctuations In consumptson,recah that consumption,cc is equal to contern-
poraneous (cx ante) permanent income       y.    Therefore, fluctuations iu consumption will be
identical to fluctuations in permanent income. if the rate of return nn wealth is constant, then ad
fluctuations in permanent income are due to fluctuations in human wealth; specifically, fluctua-
tions in permanent income are due to revisions in expectations about future labor iocome,         it
follows immediately from the definition           of human wealth        (5j   and thc   fact that

Et{Et+t{yÃ·j}}    ={yt+j},j = 1,2, 3,., that

                                                [y+Et{Hoc}J.                                   (11)




                                     r
Adding nonhuman wealth to both sides of (11) yields

                         W +H =           [(1                 +E{H}]                           (12)

Now multiply both sides of (12) by (1 + r) and use the wealth accumulation equation (1) to

replace (1 + r)W1 y by c1 + WÃ·. to obtain

                           (1   + r) [W + HJ   = e + W + E {H1} .                              (13)

Equation (13) was derived simply by manipulating the definition of human wealth and using the
wealth accumulation equation; it does not embody any behavioral assumptions. Now suppose
that consumption is equal to permanent income and use (8) and (13) to obtain

                                r(W + H) = r(W+i +          {lÃ·})   *                          (14)

Equation (14) indicates that if consumption is equal to permanent income, then permanent
income is not expected to change. Equivalently, any change in permanent income and consump-
tion between period t and period t+1 must be unanticipated from the viewpoint of period t. The
                                                               -13-



                                                                                wealth is equal to the
underlying economic reason for this result, of course, is that if the return on
rate of time preference, the individual optimally plans to have constant consumption over his life.

Indeed, using the definition of permanent income in (8), and using the fact that
            = E{E+1 {H+j}} yields

                                        c =y' =E{y1}                  =E{ct+i}

Thus, the conditional forecast of cÃ·1 based on information available in period t is equal to c1.9
Therefore, any deviation from constant consumption must be the result of unanticipated factors.
         It follows immediately from (15) and the permanent income hypothesis in (8) that

                                            c+1   -CtYi -E{y}
The change in consumption from one period to the next                         is equal to the innovation, i.e., the
unanticipated change, in permanent income.
         In order to calculate the changes in permanent income and consumption, it is necessary to
                                                                                               to
specify the stochastic process for after-tax labor income. The simplest stochastic environment
analyze is one in which after-tax labor income is stochastic but the rate of return on wealth
                                                                                               is                      r
constant. Let r denote the constant value of r. Suppose that y evolves according to a univariate

autoregressive process
                                             y -y =a(L)(y -y)               +
where a(L) is a polynomial in the positive powers of the lag operator L, and the innovation u is a
random disturbance with the property that                    E {Ut+1 } = 0.   For example, if      y follows the first-
order autoregressive process y - y = a1            (y -           + Ut, then the polynomial a(L) is simply a1L. It

is sometimes more convenient to work with the moving average representation of the income

9F[all (1978) first observed that consumption should follow a random walk. This observation is based on the
first-order condition (3). If the utility function u(c1) is quadratic and if the interest rate is equal to p. then (3) can be
written astsi -   d c = E( -     i       which implies that E,{cÃ·1} =c.

 where h(L) is a polynomial in the non-negative powers of the lag operator U It foilows from

 Using the definitions of cx post and cx ante permanent income yields an expression that relates

 b(L) is the polynomial in the non-negative powers                     of L, the expression for the innovation in
permanent income in (20) can he wtitten more succinctly as

          Equation (21) relates the innovation in permanent income to the innovation in current
after-tax income.tO It is perhaps easiest to interpret (21) and its implications in the special case
of a first-order autoregressive process. In this case the coefficients are equal to at for
                                                                                    b1

Equation (22) relates consumption to the contemporaneous innovation in income. Interpreting
the response of consumption to the contemporaneous innovation in income as the marginal
propensity to consume (MPC), equation (20) implies that the MPC is equal to r!(1 + r - The                    a1).
size of the marginal propensity to consume plays a crucial role in Keynesian models of
                                                                                                             aggregate
demand. Equation (22) illustrates that the value                      of the MPC depends on the nature of the

stochastic process of income as stressed by Friedman (1957).                If income is serially uncorrelated,
then a1 =   0   and the MPC is equal to rI(1        r). The average annual real rate of return in the U.S.

is, depending on the asset, somewhere between zero and perhaps seven percent. This suggests
that if annual income is serially uncorrelated, then the MPC is quite small, ranging roughly from
zero to 0.07.
       The MJC is an increasing fw -tion of the parameter a1, which is the first-order serial
correlation coefficient of a first-order univariate autoregressive process for income. In fact,

income--more precisely aggregate income--tends to be very highly serially correlated. Note that
if income follows a random walk, then a1 = 1 and the MPC is equal to one. The reason for a
unitary MPC in the case of a random walk is that any innovation in income is expected to be
permanent. That is, a one dollar innovation in income at time t raises the forecast of income at
all future dates by one dollar and hence raises the expectation of permanently sustainable con-

sumption by one dollar.
         The relation between consumption and income that is predicted by the permanent income

hypothesis serves as a basis for econometrically testing this hypothesis. Flavin (1981) examined
the joint behavior of consumption and income and concluded that consumption displays exces-
sive sensitivity to the anticipated change in contemporaneous income. Of course, this conclusion

depends on the estimated stochastic process for income. More recently, Deaton (1986) and

Campbell and Mankiw (1986) have suggested that income has a random walk component so that,
for example, a positive innovation to income raises the forecasts of future income into the
indefinite future, Deaton (1986) and Campbell and Deaton (1987) have estimated the stochastic

process for income including a random walk component and have argued that permanent income
is more variable than current income because changes in labor income are positively serially
correlated. Therefore, if consumption is equal to permanent income, then consumption should be
more variable than current income. Deaton and Campbell and Deaton calculate, based on the



           and Prescott(1985) reportthat in the U.S. over the period from 1889 to 1978 the average real rate of return
ott short-termbonds is 0.80% per year and the averagereal rate of return on equityis 6.98% per year.

 estimated time-series process for income, the degree to which the variance of consumption

 should exceed the variance of current income.             They conciude that consumption          is   'too

smooth."2 At first glance Fiavin's finding of excess sensitivity of consumption to income
appears to be contradicted by Campbell and Deaton's finding tltat consumption responds too
httie to innovations in income. Campbeli and Deaton rcsoive this apparent conrtadictiot by

obsen'ing that Flavin's result concerns the relation betoccn consumption and the anticipated
change in income, whereas their excess smoothness re nIt conerrns the relation between con

sumption and the contemporaneous innovation to the income, process. When Campbell and
Deaton examine the reiadon between consumption and anticipated changes tin income, they aiso
find excess sensitivity. in addition, they present an anaiytic argcment that "chere is no contradie
tion between e.eess sensitivity and excess smoothness; they are the same phenontenon." tp 33)

      The tests of the permanent income hypothests based on the time-series properties of
income and consumption maintain the assumption that the rate of interest used to discount future
cash flows is constant This seemingiy innocuous assumption has important implications for the

interoretadon   of tests of permanent income hypothesis. Miehener (1984) developed a simple
stochastic general equilibrium model in which the interest rate is cndogenoosi determined, He
showed that even if consumers maximize the expected value of a standard time-separable utility

function, the stochastic process for aggregate consumption can fail to satisfy the properties
discussed above, Although Michener's model includes production and capital accumulation, his

point can be made more simply, and more starkly, by considering an endowment economy in
which each (identical) consumer receives an endowment y, of the homogeneous perishable good.
In equilibrium, aggregate consumption (per capita), c1, will be equal to aggregate income, y' and
hence aggregate consumption would inherit the time-series properties of aggregate income. In

this situation, consumption and income would have equal variances so that comparisons of the
variances   of these series would be uninformative. Also, if the change in income were



        (1987) models the income processwith a random walk componentand develops a variance bounds test of
the permanent income model. He also findsthat consumptionis too smooth relative to income,

forecastable, the change in consumption would be forecasublewhich violates one of the implica-
tions of the permanent income hypothesis. The lesson from Michener's analysis is that the tests
of the permanent income hypothesis discussed above maintain several auxiliary assumptions in
addition to the hypothesis that consumers maximize an intertemporal utility function subject to a

budget constraint and subject to available information about future income. Therefore, rejections
of the permanent income hypothes based on the time series properties of consumption and
income can be interpreted as rejecting specific formulations of the permanent income hypothesis
but do not necessarily reject the hypothesis                of intertemporal utility maximization under
uncertainty.

II. ConsumerDurables
        The discussion so far has proceeded under the assumption that there is a homogeneous
consumption good. While this assumption is intended to be only a simplifying abstraction, one
must ask what sorts of important or interesting differences among goods are masked by this

assumption. The major heterogeneity among goods that is recognized in the literature on con-
sumption is the distinction between durable goods and non-durable goods. In fact, expenditure
on durable goods and consumption of nondurable goods (and services) have quite different

cyclical behavior. Durable goods expenditures display much more volatility over the business
cycle than do nondurable goods and services. More precisely, the percentage variation in
durables expenditures is much greater than the percentage variation in nondurables consumption.

However, the level of expenditure on durables is much smaller than the level of expenditures on
nondurables. In fact, it is this difference in the average level of expenditures on durables and
nondurables that accounts for the difference in the percentage variation. The variation in the

absolute level of durables expenditures is smaller than the variation in the absolute level of

nondurable expenditures)3



t3startz (1987) reports that 'the standard deviation of deviations from trend for durablesis large (60 dollars), about
one-half the size of that for nondurables." (p. 2) Mankiw (1982) uses lagged information to forecast durables
expenditureand nondurablesconsumption. He finds that the standard deviationsof the forecasterrors are roughly
equal (13.1 for durables vs. 13.2 for nondurables).
                                                     -18-



         In analyzing     the behavior of consumer durables, it is important to distinguish between
expenditure on consumer durables which I will denote by x,, and the consumption of the services
of durables which 1 will denote by d,. I will assume that the flow of consumption services from
durabies during period t,       d, is proportional to the   stock    of durables held   at the beginning   of
period t,   DL,   plus the durables acquired during period t, x. In particular, suppose that

                                                 =          x(   -                                    (23)


Although the concept of the consumption of the flow of services from the durable good is
important for some puoses, it is the level of expenditure on durable goods which is important
for the determination of aggeegate demand.
       It is useful to introduce the concept of the user cost of durabies. To simplify the analysis.
suppose that the relative price of durables and nondurables remains fixed over time, Let p.
denote the price of durabies in terms of nondurables. In the absence of relative price changes,
there are ewo components to the user cost of the durable: foregone interest and depreciation. By

holding a unit of a durable rather than interest-earning wealth, the consumer foregoes interest cf
qj. per period, where r is the real interest rate. In addition, if the durable depreciates at a rate P
per period, then depreciation imposes a cost of Pp. per period to the owner of the durable.
Therefore the user cost of a durable is (r
       The introduction of durables implies that the consumer holds two assets: interest-earning
wealth and durables. Previously, W was defined to be the nonhuman wealth of a consumer at

the beginning of period t. Now W is to be interpreted as the interest-earning wealth, or equiv-

alently, as the nonhuman wealth         of the consumer minus the value of the consumer's stock of
durable goods. The budget constraint in (1) must be amended to

                                      W+1   =(l +r)W +Yt -ct -                                        (24)

where   c is now interpreted as the consumption of nondurables. Recalling that 6 is the deprecia-
tion rate per period of the durable leads to the following relation between the stock of the durable
                                                       -19-




and expenditures on the durable
                                        D+1   =(l - Ã¶)(D +Xt)                                          (25)

        In order to motivate expenditure on durables as well            as nondurables, the utility function

must be augmented to include services from durables as well as from nondurables. Let u(c, d1)
be the utility function in period t. The consumer will allocate spending in period t between the
purchase of nondurables and the rental of durables. The optimal allocation will equate the
marginal rate of substitution with the rental price.    Writing the utility function as

u(c, i(D + x')) makes clear that        the marginal rate      of substitution between nondurables and
durable goods is Wud/u where     u is the derivative of u(c, d) with respect to durable services and
u is the derivative of u(c, d) withrespect to nondurables. Setting this marginal rate of substitu-
tion equal to the rental priceof durables yields

                                                                                                        (26)

        For simplicity, supposethat the period utility function has the following Cobb-Douglas

specification
                                          u(c,d)        =cd        .                                    (27)


In this case, the consumer will allocate a fraction 1-a of his or her consumption basket to non-
durables, c, and a fraction a to the rental of services of durables, (r + Ã¶) i.i(D + x'). Therefore,


                                  D+XL=('&)
Substituting (28) into (25) yields

                                  D+1   =(l-S) (r+)L                     c.                             (29)

To obtain the relation between expenditures on durables and expenditures on nondurables,
substitute (29) into (25) to obtain
                                         x = K{c - (1 - 3)c.1}                                        (30a)

pemaanent income model to include consumer durables as well as nondurables explains the fact
that the percentage volatility of durables expenditures exceeds that of nondurable

        Equation (32) can be used to get an estimate of the parameter K using data on the rate of
depreciation and the average levels of expenditures on durables and nondurables. Using the
figures for average durables expenditure and average nondurables consumption reported in Startz
(1987, p. 2) yields a value of X7k equal to 12.2%. Therefore, the factor K is equal to .122/6.
Bernanke (1985, p. 53) reports a depreciation rate for consumer durables of 0.0506
                                                                                      per quarter.
Therefore, for quarterly data, the value of K is 2.41. This value of K appears to be substantially

larger than is reflected in consumer spending. It implies, counterfactually, that     a (x) should be
                                                       -21-




larger than   a (c).    Also recall from (30) that     i is   equal to the ratio of the effect of an income
innovation on durables expenditure to the effect of an income innovation on nondurables con-
                                                                                     calculated
sumption. Bernanke (1985, p. 57) estimates this ratio to be .775. The fact that the
value of K       to overstate the cyclical variability of durables expenditures may reflect that
              appears

the model derived above has ignored costs of adjusting the stock of durables (see Bernanke

(1985)) and has ignored implications f irreversibility discussed below.
                                                                                   on consumer
       Equation (30a) can be used to analyze the serial correlation of expenditure
durables. The contrast between the predicted serial correlation of durables expenditure and
nondurables consumption is particularly striking in the case in which durables are perfectly

durable. Formally, durables are perfectly durable when the rate of depreciation, & is equal to
                                                                       -
zero. In this case, equation (30a) implies that x is proportional to c1 cr1, the change in non-
durables consumption. Under the permanent income hypothesis the change in nondurables
                                                              on durables cannot be predicted.
consumption is completely unpredictable, and thus expenditure
Equivalently, Ei {Xt} = 0. Therefore, in the absence of depreciation, expenditure
                                                                                  on durables

follows a white noise process but expenditure on nondurables follows a random walk.
        It is also worth noting that if the rate of depreciation is equal ro one, so that durables are
completely nondurable, then equation (30a) states that x is proportional to c.
                                                                               That is, x and                    c
both follow a random walk, as should be expected because in ihts case 'durables' are
nondurable.
        The analysis above suggests that the serial correlation of expenditures on durables is an

increasing function of the rate of depreciation. In fact, expenditures on durables

Alternative explanations for the high degree of serial correlation would point to departures from

 the simple model. Two such departures are liquidity constraints, to be discussed later, and

 irreversibility of durables expenditures.
        The term 'irreversibility' of durables expenditures is meant to capture the notion that an
 individual who tries to sell a used consumer durable generally receives a price that is lower than
 the value of the remaining durables services evaluated at the markal price for new durables. In

 the extreme case of complete irreversibility, the consumer cannot obtain any resources by selling
 a used durable good. To see the effects of irreversibility, consider a small unanticipated decrease
 in the consumer'sincome. Under perfect reversibility, the consumer should reduce consumption
of both durables services and nondurables. However, if the resale price of the durable is low,
then the consumer may choose not to sell any of the durable, but instead may reduce nondurable

consumption or interest-earning wealth by more than in the optimal plan undercomplete revers-
ibility. If income continues to be unexpectedly low for a few periods, then the consumer may
have to sell off some of the durable in order to avoid a large decline in nondurables consumption.

The date at whichit becomes optimal to sell some of the durable depends on the level of the
consumer'sother wealth. With a higher level of wealth, the consumer can wait longer before
selling some of the nondurable. Although this discussion has focused on the response to a
decrease in income, the consumer will display a conservative response to an increase in income
because of the possibility of a future decline in income. At the level of the individual consumer,
the effect of the introduction of irreversibility is to reduce the marginal propensity to purchase
durables in response to an increase in income. As for the behavior of aggregate expenditure on

durables, Lam (1986) has used simulation techniques to show that if there        is cross-sectional
variation in household wealth, then irreversibility will induce a high degree of serial correlation
in aggregate durables expenditures.

ilL Liquidity Constraints
       The permanent income hypothesis presented above is based on the assumption that an
individual consumer can borrow and lend at the same interest rate, and furthermore that the
consumer can borrow or lend any amount subject to the lifetime budget constraint described
                                                      -23



above. An important departure from this assumption is the possibility that the consumer may

face a liquidity constraint. Broadly interpreted, the term liquidity constraint is meant to capture

                                                                      the individual may be able

piecewise linear, with a kink occurring at a point where current consumption equal
income plus liquid financial wealth. An extreme example of this type of liquidity constraint,
which corresponds to an infinite borrowing rate, is the case in which the consumer is simply
                                                                                           form
unable to borrow. Alternatively, the capital market imperfection may manifest itselfin the

of an interest rate on borrowing that rises with the level of the consumer'sborrowing.15 For the
sake   of simplicity, I will use the term liquidity constraint to refer to a situation in which the
consumer is unable to borrow at all.
                                                                  relation between consumption

 constraint in the current period, the prospect       of a binding liquidity constraint in the future would
 affect the current marginal propensity to consume,17
       Although liquidity constraints have strong implications for the marginal propensity to
 consume, they may be difficult to detect in aggregate data. The reason for this difficulty is that
 under the permanent income hypothesis, the marginal propensity to consume depends on the
 stochastic properties of income, Since aggregate income is highly serially correlated, and indeed

 may even be     a random walk, the permanent income hypothesis predicts an MPC of about one
 even in the absence of liquidity constraints, Thus an MPG near unir'' could result from either a

 binding liquidity constraint or highly serially correlated income.
         Evidence of binding liquidity constraints has been found in econometric analyses of panel
data. Hall and Mishkin (1982) analyzed expenditures on food in the Panel Study of Income

Dynamics and concluded that about 20% of the households in their sample of U.S. households
were liquidity constrained. Hayashi(1985a) and Zeides(1985) used data on individual household
wealth and found that households with large amounts of liquid assets appeared to adhere to the

permanent income hypothesis but households with small liquid wealth appeared to behave as if
liquidity-constrained, The importance of liquidity constraints from the viewpoint of the cyclical
relation between consumption and income is that the MPG of constrained households is
                                                                                                        equal to
one. Thus, if the MPG implied by the permanent income hypothesis is less than one and is less

than the apparent      MJDC   in the data, one might appeal to liquidity constraints to explain the
 excess sensitivity'    of consumption. Alternatively, if income has a unit root and if the changes
in income are    as persistent   as estimated by Campbell and Deaton (1987), then one might appeal
to liquidity constraints to explain excess smoothness.




t7For example, suppose that p = r = 0 and the consumer does not currently (in period t) face a binding liquidity
constraint. If the consumerwill face a binding liquidity constraint inperiod t + N, thenthe marginal propensityto
consume out of a one-timeadditionto wealth in period t is 1/(N + 1).

IV. Interest Rate and Wealth Effects on Consumption
         The response of consumption to changes in after-tax labor income y1 were analyzed above

in a model in which consumers take account of stochastic vanation in                y1
                                                                                         in optimally reaching
                                                                                  in the rate of
consumption decisions. Ideally, to analyze the response of consumption to changes
interest or to changes in the value of wealth, one would like to develop a model of a consumer

maximizing an intertemporal utility 'inction subject to random variation in the rate of
                                                                                          return as

well as random variation in labor income. Unfortunately, it is difficult to develop a simple model

with a closed form solution for a consumer facing both labor income uncertainty and rate of
return uncertainty. To analyze the response of consumption to changes in the rate of return on

wealth, I will present a simple model in which the only source of income is the return on non-
human wealth.

         Suppose that the consumer has no labor income so that the wealth accumulation equation
(1) can be written as
                                            W = (1 + r)W1 - c                                                 (33)


where the real rate of return on wealth is now treated as a random variable. For analytic simplic-

                                                    r
ity suppose that the random rate of return is identically and independently disttibuted over
time. The consumer attempts to maximize the time-separable utility function in (2). The maxi-

mum attainable value of U depends only on the consumer'savailable resources in period t,

(1   + r1)W1. Let the function V((l + r)WL) denote the maximum attainable value of U in (2) and
note that

                  V((i + r1) W) = max u(ct) + (11(1 + p)) E {V((l + rtÃ·1) W1+1)} .                             (34)


The function V( ) cannot be specified independentiy. It is a solution to the functional equation in
(34).
         In general the functional equation in (34) is difficult to solve, but in the case of isoelastic

utility a solution can be derived in a straightforward manner)8 Suppose that the utility function

 u(c) has the isoelastic form u(c) = c"Y/(l - 'O where 7> 0 is the (constant) coefficient of relative
 risk aversion. In this case, the intertemporal utility fonction in (2) is homothetic so that income

 changes in (1 + r3W, induce an equiproportionate change in c,, A solution to the functional

 equation is'9

 (34) by     (11(1   + p)) E, {(1 + r,Â±l) V'((l + r,+,) W,1)}, At the optimum, the net effect on the
 consumer's utilmi will be zero, and henceconsumption 'will be at the optimal level when

                                    = (11(1        p))E,{( + r,) Viii + r,Ã·t)W1)}            .              (36)

           Using the isoelastic specificahon for no and using (35), equation (36) can be written as

                           (c,)Â° = (Mi + p))            1(1 r1)t'1} ((I + r,) IV, -    c,j                  (37)

Now raise both sides of (37) to the           -   l/y power to obtain

                                                      c, = 0(1 + r,)W,                                     (38a)

Substituting the optimal consumption rule (38a) into (34) and using the definition of 0 in (38b)




19The functional equation (34) has a continuum of solutions of the form

                                 V((t + r1)W,) = A((I + r,) W,)'-/(t     -   + $(t +
where   $ is an arbitraryconstant, The solutionin (35) sets   equal to zero,

implies, after some manipulation, that
                                                A=G'                                                (39)

Finally, substituting (39) into (38b) yields

                                G= 1- [E{(l +rL+i) }I(l         +p)J.
Observe from (38a) that      0 is the m ginal (= average) propensity to consume out of available
resources.   I have now derived the optimilconsumption rule of a consumer who faces a stochas-
tic rate of return on wealth. It follows immediately from (38a) that consumption is proportional
to the contemporaneous value of wealth including the current return to capital. Note, in par-

ticular, that consumption in period t is an increasing function of the ex post rate of return r.
         This model allows us to distinguish the effects of changes in the ex ante probability
distribution of the rate of return from changes in the cx post rate of return. From the point of

view of period t, the ex ante information about the stochastic rate of return ri+i is summarized by
the factor  [E {(l + r+i)}J in the marginal propensity to consume out of wealth, 0. Note
first that if y is equal to one, in which case the utility function u( ) is logarithmic, then
0 = 1 - [11(1 + p)}. Thus, under logarithmic utility, consumption, c, is invariant to the ex ante
distribution of the rate of return. The reason for this invariance is that the income and substitu-
tion effects associated with an increase in the prospective rate of return offset one another

exactly. An increase in the prospective interest rate has a positive income effect because the
consumer is assumed to be a net lender rather than a net borrower (i.e.,W > 0). The substitution

effect   of a higher prospective interest rate is to make current consumption more expensive
relative to future consumption and thus to reduce current consumption. The income and substitu-
tion effects are in opposite directions, and for the case of logarithmic utility, they are      of equal
magnitude.     If the utility function u() displays less curvature than the logarithmic function, i.e., if
y< I, then the substitution effect is strengthened; if the rate of return, r11, is nonstochastic, then
consumption, c, would be a decreasing function of r+1. Alternatively, if the utility function is
more curved than the logarithmic function, ('j> 1), then the substitutioneffect is diminished;if
the rate   of return, r11, is nonstochastic, consumption, c, would be an increasing function of r1Ã·1.

           I have shown that consumption, c, increases in response to an increase in the cx post
interest rate r., but may rise, fall, or remain unchanged in response to a given chge in the cx

ante distribution of the rate of return r,,. The difference in the effects of ex post and cx ante
interest rates is that the cx post interest has oniy an income effect associated with it, whereas a

change in the cx ante interest rate has hoth an income effect and a aubstitodon effect. In par-
ticular, if, at the beginning of period t, the consumer               s that the reah'zed vaiue of the interest
rate   r   is higher than expected, then the consumer            as   wealthier than expected acd therefore
increases consumption. The interest rate           r represents the consumer's terms of trade hetweera
periods t    - 1   aud period t; because   r does not affect the terms nf trcdc between petiod t end any
future perich. there is no substitutton effect on cc By contrast, if iu period t the "cUe of r., is
seen   to increase, then the terms of trade between period t and period t               I are altered, thereby

inducing a substitution effect in addition to the income effect,
           The magnitude of the respohse of consumption to changes irt the expected rate of interest
can be measured by the intertemporai elasticity of substitution, Under the isoelastic utility
function u(c) =cÂ°'Y(i - y), the intertemporal elasticity of suhstisutionis equal to i/y This result
can be derived by substituting u'(c) = c' hate the first-order condition (3) and rearranging                t.o

obtain

                        boc1Ã·t/c =-(l/'y)in(i   +p)                          -(I/y)iniiÂ±t                 (41)

where 'rh+i is a positive random variable and    i'ltÃ·t} = i. Recalling that I + r11 is the relative
                                                     E1


price of consumption in periods t and t+i, it is clear from (41) that a one percent change in the
relative price      of c4,1 and c induces a 1/y percent change in           c,Ã·5/c.   Thus, the intertemporal
elasticity of substitution is equal to     l/y Using monthly data and tueasuring the rate of return on
wealth by the value-weighted aggregate return on stocks on the New York Stock Exchange,
Hansen and Singleton (1983) estimated yto be between zero and two,
           The formal analysis of the effect of the interest rate is based on the assumption that all of
the consumer's disposable resources come from return on wealth. In particular, after-tax labor

income is ignored. To the extent that there will be positive flows of after-tax labor income in the
                                                          -29-




future, an increase in the ex ante interest rate would have a smaller income effect, or possibly
even a negative income effect. Intuitively, art increase in the prospective rate of return would
reduce the present value of future labor income and thus would reduce the current value of
human wealth. Indeed, if the consumer's current nonhuman wealth and current income are

sufficiently low compared to his future earnings, the consumer may be a net borrower rather than
a net lender (i.e., may be negative1. In this case, an increase in the interest rate would have a
                     W
                                                                                      to reduce
negative income effect; both the income effect and the substitution effect would tend

consumption in response to an increase in the interest rate.20

V. Government Bonds and Ricardian Equivalence
                                                                                      the next
         Having shown that consumption is an increasing function of nonhuman wealth,
task is to examine whether government bonds are to be included in wealth. To see why this is an

interesting question consider the effects of a $100 cut in current lump-sum tax revenues that the
government finances by issuing $100 of bonds. It was pointed out by Ricardo (1911), and later
modeled formally by Barro (1974), that under certain conditions forward-looking consumers

would not change their consumption at all in response to this tax change. The reason is that
consumers recognize that the government will have to increase taxes in the future to repay the
                                                                                  taxes in the
principal and interest on the newly-issued bonds. Because of the need to increase
future, the opportunity set of the representative consumer is unaltered by this policy. The
consumer can achieve exactly the same path of current and future consumption by increasing
current saving by $100, and by holding this additional saving in the form of government bonds.
The consumer can hold these bonds in his portfolio earning interest until future taxes are in-
creased to pay the interest and principal on the bonds. The future tax increases will be exactly



                                                                                            that accompaniesan tncrease
2OUsing a simulation model,Summers (1981) finds that the reduction in human wealth
in the interest rate is quantitatively substantial. In addition, he finds that the interest elastsciiy 01 savIngs is quite
substantial(roughly in the rangefrom 1 to 3) and that this interest elasticity is not very sensitiveto the parameterq.
Estimates of this elasticity based on consumption and rate of return data are generally much smaller (Boskin's
(t978) estimate of 0.4 for the interest elasticity of saving is at the high end of the range), but Summers attributes
much of the difference to the fact that these other studies hold wealth constant, whereas he takes account of the
negativeimpactof higher interest rates on human wealth.
                                                -30


 equal in value to the principal and interest earned by the consumer, Therefore, the consumer can
 support the same path of consomption as initially planned. Furtheore, since the tax change is
 in a lump-sum tax, mere will be no change tn relative prices, Therefore, it is both feasible and

optimal for the consumer to maintain the same consumption and portfolio decisions (except for
increasing the holdine of govemment bonds) as before the tax change. This invariance of private
spending to changes in the tisniog of lump-sum taxes its been dubbed "The Ricardian Equiv-
alence Theorem" by Buchanan (1976), It is worth noting that although Ricardo stated the basic

argument, he cautioned against taking thc argument seriously as        a descdpdon of the actual
impact of debt financed tax cuts, claiming that such a system tends to discourage saving (1911,

pp. 162-163),

       To analyze the question of whether govemrnent bonds are net wealth, suppose that the
interest rate is constant and use the expression for peanent income implied by (5) and (6) to
obtain

                       c =r w +(1/(l            E {(i                                        (42)

                                                                                            (43)

It is also convenient to separate after-tax labor income alto pre-tax labor income y. and taxes T

Substituting (43) and (44) into the consumption function (42) yields

                        c =r[}c +(l/(l +r)) L {(1
                                                  +r)'iEt{yuÃ·j}}]
                                                                                            (45)

The Ricardo-Bo insight is that the government's budget consint implies that the present
                                                -31-



value of tax revenues must equal the sum of the current government debt outstanding plus the

present value of government expenditure on goods and services. Thus, the second line of (45),
which is the excess of the present value of current and future tax revenues over the value of

currently outstanding government bonds, is equal to the present value of current plus future
government spending. Therefore, debt-financed changes in taxes that leave the path of govern-
ment spending unchanged have no        e'-ct on consumption    To make the point starkly, suppose

that government spending on goods and services is always equal to zero so that the second line of

Inspection   of (42) and (46) sheds light on the question of whether government bonds should be
ieated as part of net wealth in an economy in which the Ricardian Equivalence Theorem holds.
It follows from (42) that if the income variable is net of taxes, then the wealth variable should
include government bonds. Alternatively, if the income variable is pre-tax labor income, then it
follows from (46) that the wealth variable should not include government bonds as net wealth.
In addition, if there is government spending, then (45) implies that the present value   of govern-

ment spending should appear as an additional explanatory variable along with pre-tax labor
income and Kr
       The above discussion has proceeded under the assumption that the Ricardian Equivalence
Theorem holds. There is a large theoretical literature that explores many reasons why the
Ricardian Equivalence Theorem may not hold.      I will mention only three reasons why the impact
of actual tax policy may not      be accurately described by the Ricardian Equivalence Theorem.

First, the argument underlying the Ricardian Equivalence Theorem requires the taxes to be

non-distortionary taxes. However, virtually all taxes are distortionary taxes in that they affect the
relative price   of some economic activity.   In addition to non-distortionary taxes, the Ricardian

Equivalence Theorem relies on the assumption       of forward-looking intertemporally optimizing
consumers who do not face binding constraints on the intertemporal allocation of consumption.

 The Ricardian Equivalence Theorem will fail to hold if coosumers lack the foresight to take
 account of the implications for future taxes of current fiscal policy,
         A third source of departure from the Ricardian Equivalence TI eorem may          arise    if con-
 somers face binding constraints on the intertesnpora]. allocation of consumption. One such:

 binding constraint is a binding liquidity constraint as discussed abeve tn Section III. Consumers
 who face currently binding liquidity constraints wsll rrd.uce their current
                                                                                 consumption by an
 amount equal to the current increase in taxes, sf the constraInt on thess borrowing does not
                                                                                              change
 when taxes are changed. It is possible so consnstcs models in which the borrowing constrain

 endogenously ad.iusts. with sax changes in a way that lrayes current consumption unchanged.
 However, whether the borsowing constraint cndogenousi.y adjusts in a massner to maintain
 Pricardian Equivalence depends on the rationale for liquidity constraints and on the extent of

 communication asnong lenders.2t
        An aitemative type of constraint on the intertemporal allocation of consumption that
violates the Ricardian Equivalence Theorem is a binding cnnstratnt on the intergenerational
aiiocatson of consumption.    If current taxes are reduced, t,nS if tin impitest future sax increase is
ievied on future generations, then the current recipients of the sax reduction wousd increase their

consumption unless they have operative aisnaistic bequest motives. in particular, current con-

have bequest mottves;   (2) the bequest motive is a funetson of the size of the bequest; (3) the
bequest motive is of the altruistic form, but is not strong enough to induce the consumer to leave

                    a large empirical literature that attempts to test whether the Ricardian
        There is also

Equivalence Theorem accurately describes the impact of tax policy in actual economies. There
are manypapers which support each side of this question. This literature can be read as

will limit attention to three models: the accelerator model, the neoclasstcai model and the

q-theory model?3

A. The Neoclassical Model and the Accelerator

        The demand for productive capital is a derived demand by fsrms, I will begin by consid-

ering the investment and employment decisions of a finn in a determintstie environment without
taxes. For analytic tractability and clarity, the model wtll be set in continuous tIme Let K, be


      for example,Lucas and Prescott (197 t), Harman (1972), and Abel (1985).
2'See, example,Pindyckand Rotentberg (1983) and Bemanke (1983).
      for
        Bisehoff (l97t) and Clark (1979) for comparison of the empsricat performance of alternative investment
models. Niekell (1978) provides an excellentcomprehensive weament of several models of invesment and many
issues related to invesment behavior.
the stock of capital at time t, let L1 be the amount of labor employed at time t, and let I. be the
firm's gross investment at time t. Let           Y(K1, L1)   be the real revenue function of the firm     and

assume that it is concave. This function embodies the firm's production function and the demand
curve it faces. For a price-taking firm Y(K1, L1) is simply the output of the firm multiplied by the
real price of its output. At the level of the aggregate economy, Y(K1, L,) is to be interpreted as
the aggregate real revenue function, which depends on aggregate demand. The net real cash flow
at time t, X1, is
                                  X1   = Y(K, L) - w1L1 - PtIt - c(11, K1)                                (47)

where Pt IS the real price of investment goods and           w1 is   the real wage rate. The final term in the

expression for cash flow in (44), c(1.,        K1),   requires furtherexplanation. This function represents
the cost of adjusting the capital stock. This cost is in addition to the price of investment goods.
The adjustment cost function is meant to capture the notion that if the capital stock is to be
increased by a given increment, it is more costly to achieve this increase rapidly rather than

slowly. This idea was formalized by Eisner and Strotz (1963) and was used later by Lucas
(1967), Gould (1968), Treadway (1969), Mussa (1977), Abel (1980, 1982), Yoshikawa (1980)
and Hayashi (1982). The adjustment Cost function is non-negative and is convex in the rate                  of
investment I, It is convenient to think of the adjustment cost function as representing installation
costs. With this interpretation, p1 can be called the price of uninstalled capital, and p1 + c1(11, K1)

is the marginal cost of new installed capital. Although the neoclassical and accelerator models

ignore costs of adjustment, I introduce adjustment costs at this point to develop a unifying
framework that will include the q theory of investment to be developed in the next section.
       The firm attempts to maximize the present value of its net cash flow over an infinite
horizon. Let r1 be the instantaneous real rate of interest at time t and define R(t, s)

ex-1                to be the discount factorthat discounts real cashflows at date s back to date t. Let
         rvdvl
V. be the value of the firm at time t and observe that

         To solve the finn's maximization problem, employment and investment must be chosen
to maximize H5. Substituting (47) and (49) into (50) yields

Differentiating H with respect to L and I, respectively, and setting the dersvatives equal to zero,
yields
                                             YL (K4,    L) = Wt                                        (52a)

Equation (52a) simply states that the firm hires labor to the point at which the marginal revenue
                                                         -36-




product of labor is equal to the wage rate. Equation (52b) states that the firm chooses a rate of
invesmient such that the marginal cost, which is equal to the price of the investment good P1 plus
the marginal adjustment cost         c1(I1, K1),   is equal to the value of an additional unit of installed

capital q1.26 This equation has important implications to which I will return later.

                                      I
        In addition to choosing and L1 to maximize H1, the solution to the firm's intertemporal
maximization problem in (48) requires that the shadow price                           q1   obey the relation
  -  rq= -H1/K1. Using (51) this relation can be written as

                                    = (r + h) q - YK (K1, L1) + CK (k,            .                          (53)
                                                                       K1)

Although equation (53) may appear to be merely                  a technical condition for optimality, it has
important economic interpretations. As       a step toward interpreting (53), observe that it is a
differential equation and that the stationary solution of this differential equation is


                            q1   = 5 [YK (Ks, L) - cK (Is, Ks)] R(t, s) ett) ds.                             (54)

Equation (54) states that the shadow price of capital is equal to the present discounted value of
the stream of marginal cash flow attributable to a unit of capital installed at time t. At each future
date s, the marginal cash flow consists of two components: (I)
                                                                      YK(KS, L5) is the extra revenue
attributable to an additional unit of capital at time s; (2)
                                                             -cK(IS, K) is the reduction in the adjust-
ment cost made possible by an additional unit of installed capital. The (instantaneous) rate at
which marginal cash flows at date s are discounted is equal to r1 + h ratherthan simply because
                                                                                       r5
a unit of capital depreciates at rate h. Thus, if a unit of capital is installed at time t, then at some

future time s, only a fraction e5t) of the unit of capital remains.
        A second interpretation of (53) is based on viewing the shadow price q1 as if it were the
price at which a marginal unit of installed capital could be bought or sold. With this interpreta-
tion in mind, consider the decision of whether to invest in an additional unit of installed
                                                                                            capital at

Equation (55) is the analogue of the Jorgensonian user cost of capital, except that in piace of he
shadow price q, Jorgenson uses the price of the investment good. p0 The reason for this differ-
ence is that Jorgenson ignores the adjustment cost function, or equtvaientiy, assumes that ccl,, K1)

is identically zero. Under this assumption, equation (52b) indicates that q1 is equal to p1 so that
the user cost in (55) is identical to the Jorgensonian user cost in this ease.

        The definition of the user cost in (55) can be used to rewrite equation (53) as

capital is equal to the user cost u. Except for the fact that Jorgenson's formulation does not
an adjustment cost function, so that CK(It, K5) is identically zero, this relation is the same as
Jorgenson's condition which states that the marginal product of capital is equal to the user cost of

capital.
           For the purpose of expositional clarity, I will assume that the adjustment cost function has
the following form
                                                                -                                         (57)

where g( )       0, g(0) = 0, g(0) = 0, and        The adjustment cost function specified in (57)

is a non-negative convex function of the rate of net investment. When the rate of net investment

is zero, the adjustment cost is assumed to be zero.2'
        Now suppose that the price of investment goods, p., the real wage rate w, and the real

interest rate are constant and consider the steady state in which both the capital stock, K5, anti
                r1

the shadow price of capital, q. are constant. When the capital stock is constant, I. = hK,, so that
it follows from the specification of the adjustment cost function in (57) that the adjustment cost is

equal to zero. In addition, the partial derivatives c1 and CK are each equal to zero. The fact that c1
is equal to zero implies, using (52b), that the shadow price q5 is constant and equal to the price of
investhient goods, p5. Because q5 is equal to p, it follows from the definition of the user cost in

(55) that

                                                u5=(r+h)p5.                                               (58)


 Finally, recall that the partial derivative, cK, is equal to zero in the steady state so that (56)



          (19681, Treadway(1969) and Abel (1985) express the adjustment cost function as a function of gross
 investment. Expressing the adjustmentcost function as a function of net investmentimplies that in the long run,
 when K = 0, the value ofcapital, q1, is equal to its replacement cost, p, as argued by Tobin (1969).

Equation (62) expresses the steady state capital stock. K, as a function of the real revenue       of the
firm and the user cost of capital. Of course, the revenue of the firm is a decision variable of the

firm, so (62) cannot properly be regarded as a relation expressing the steady state capital stock as
a function of exogenous variables. It is more appropriately regarded as a relation among en-

dogenous variables in the steady state.
       The neoclassical investment model developed by Jorgenson is based on a special ease of

(62;. In particular, Jorgenson assumed that the revenue function is Cobb-Douglas, which in
terms of (62) implies that the elasticity of substitution, a, is equal to one. In this ease, the steady

       Jorgenson's derivation of the investment equation proceeded in two steps. The
was the derivation of a "desired capital stock", which corresponds to the steady state capital stock
in (62) with   equal to one. The second step is the determination of the rate at which the firm's

capital stock approaches its desired level. Rather than specifying a particular dynamic adjust-
ment mechanism, such as an adjustment cost function, in the firm's optimization problem,
                                                                                  rate at which
Jorgenson assumed that there is some exogenous mechanism that determines the
the gap between the desired capital stock and the actual capital stock is closed. In particular,

Jorgenson specified the investment equation as

                                    =
                                        In          -           hK                               (63

where K is the desired capital stock at time t.
        Observe that a strong implication of Jorgenson's assumption of a unitary elasticity of
substitution between K and L is that the desired capital stock depends only on the ratio of reve-
nue to the user cost of capital. Jorgenson exploits this fact in his estimation by constraining the
                                                                                         as the re-
response of investment to revenue to be the same (proportionately, except for sign)
sponse to the user cost. However, Eisner and Nadiri have clalmed that this procedure may
overstate the response of investment to cost of capital changes because the elasticity of substitu-
tion is less than one. When the elasticity of substitutionis not equal to one, then it follows from

(62) that the elasticity of the desired capital stock with respect to real revenue Y is still unity hut
the elasticity of the desired capital stock with respect to the user cost is equal to -o With an

elasticity of substitution less than one, the magnitude of the response of investment to the
                                                                                                   user

cost will be smaller than the response to revenue. Therefore, constralning the responses to be of

 equal (percentage) magnitude, as Jorgenson does, will tend to overstate the response of invest-
 ment to the user cost. Eisner and Nadiri argue that the elasticity of substitution is nearer zero
 than unity (1968, p. 381), but Jorgenson and Stephenson (1969) claim that empirical evidence

 supports a unitary elasticity.

       There is another reason to expect the response of investment to the user cost to differ
from the response to output or revenue, in discussing the elasticity of substitution between

capital and labor, it ts important to distinguish the cx ante elasticity of substitution from the cx
post elasticity of substitution. More specifically, before        a piece of capital is built and put   into

place, there may be a substantial degree of substitutability between capital and labeL However,
after the capital is put in place, there may be very limited, or even zero, substitutability. An
exerne version of this notion is the putty-clay hypothesis: cx ante, capital is malleable lIke
putty and the firm can choose the capital labor taco; cx post, capital is not malleable, like clay,
and there is no substitutability between capital and labor. Under the putty-clay hpothcsis. we

might expect to see larger and mote rapid responses to changes in output than to changes in tin'
user cost. For example, an increase in output may lead to an increase in the destred capital 5:ock
as described above in equation              However, a fall in the user cost would lead to a        maler
response of the desired capital stock than in (62). The reason i5 that a fall in the user en st leads
to an increase in the desired capital labor ratio but under the putty-clay hypothesis, the           apital
labor ratio on existing capital     is   immutable, Thus newly installed capital will be less labor

intensive, but the old capital will not be replaced with labor-saving capital until the old capital
becomes uneconomical.
        An even more extreme limitation on capital            labor substitutability gives   rise to the ac-

celerator model of investment. In particular, suppose that there is no substitutability either ex

ante or cx post. In terms of the expression for the desired capital stock in (62), suppose that the

elasticity of substitution, r,   is equal to zero. In this case, the desired capital stock in (62) is
simply proportional to revenue, investment in this case would be a distributed lag function of
changes in the level of revenue

The accelerator model (64) is a special case of the neoclassical investment model (63) in which
                                                   .47-



the user cost of capital is ignored.28 Although some studies find significant effects of the user
cost,29 it is pan of the "fol.k wisdom" that user cost effects on investment are harder to estimate in
the data than are accelerator or output effects. Perhaps one reason for the difficulty of finding
user cost effects is the problem of simultaneity. If there is an exogenous increase in the real
interest rate, then the user cost would increase and investment would decrease. However, if for
some reason there were an upward shift in the investment function, (for example, Keynesian
"animal spirits," (Keynes (1936), pp. 161-163)) then investment would increase and would put

upward pressure on the real interest rate. Thus, as a consequence of the upward shift in the
investment function, both investment and the user cost would increase, if data contain both

exogenous increases in the real interest rate and exogenous shifts in the investment function, then
the predicted negative relation between user cost and investment might be masked by the positive
relation between user cost and investment in response to exogenous shifis in the investment
function.
        It should be noted that simultaneity of the son discussed above would tend to exaggerate,
rather than diminish or reverse, the estimated accelerator effects. An exogenous upward shift in
the investment function would increase investment, which would increase output. This positive
relation between investment and output reinforces the positive relation due to the accelerator
effect discussed above. Finally, it should be noted that althbugh simultaneity problems can be
alleviated by the use   of inswumental variables, the resulting estimates are only as good as the
instauments.
        An additional complication in estimating the effect of the user cost          is the question of
whether to use a short-term or long-term interest rate in measuring the cost of capital. Tradition-

ally, the long-term interest rate is viewed as the appropriaterate but Hall (1977) argues that "as a
matter of theory, what belongs in the service price of capital is a short-run interest rate, though
the issue of short versus long rates is unlikely to be resolved empirically" (p. 100). Hall's point

that the user cost depends on the short rate rather than the long rate is illustrated by equation (55).
In the absence of adjustment costs, q1 is equal to the price of investment goods p, and the expres-
sion for the user cost of capital in (55) yields the Jorgensonian user cost u, = (r, + h) PL +

         While it is true that the user cost is related to the contemporaneous instantaneous interest

rate, one must avoid the temptation to say that investment depends on the short-term interest rate
rather than the long.term interest rate, Halls' argument that the short-term rate is the appropriate
interest rate was based on a model without adjustment costs in which the 'finn faces an open
choice about the scheduling of investment" (p. 74). However, the essence of adjustment costs is
to interfere with "the open choice about the scheduling of investment". In the presence of costs
of adjustment. the scheduling of investment affects        the cost   of investment. In this case, invest-
ment is necessarily forward-looking and depends on the present value of the stream of marginal

products accruing to a newly-installed unit of capital. Observing that the real interest rate prevail-

ing from date t to date s is [Rti, 5)] - I, equation (54) implies that q1, and a fortiori investment,
depends on the entire term structure of real interest rates. To make this point more sharply,
consider the response of investment to an instantaneously-lived increase in ri and, alternatively,
the response of investment to a permanent increase in the interest rate. An instantaneous increase
in   r will have no effect on R(t, s) and will have no effect on q or investment at time
                                                                                       t. By
contrast, a permanent increase in the instantaneous interest rate would reduce the stream of
discount factors, R(t, s), and would reduce    04   and investment. In the presence of adjustment
costs, invesunent depends on the entire term structure of interest rates.

         Although there is no consensus about the magnitude of the response of investment to
changes in interest rates, the analysis above offers some guidance on the size of this effect.

Suppose that the relevant real rate of interest is equal to 4% per year and the rate of depreciation
is equal to 6% per year, which is an appropriate depreciation rate for stmctures. Now consider
the effect of a 1 percentage point decrease in the real interest rate (from 4% to 3% per year). It
follows immediately from the expression for the user cost in (58) that this decrease itt the real
interest rate decreases the user cost of capital by 10%.              Under a Cobb-Douglas production
                                                        -44-




function, this 10% decrease in the user cost increases the desired stock of capital by 10%. In the

long run, the rate of investment would rise by 10% in order to maintain the capital stock at its
higher level, In the short run, the rate of investment would increase by even more than 10% in
order to increase the capital stock to its new desired level. The magnitude of the increase in the
rate of investment in the short run depends, of course, on how rapidly the new desired capital
stock is achieved.
         The 10% increase in the desired capital stock in response to a 1 percentage point decrease
in the real interest rate may overstate the response of the desired aggregate capital stock for three
reasons. First, as emphasized by Eisner and Nadiri (1968), the elasticity of substitution between

capital and labor may be substantially less than one. Recalling that this elasticity of substitution
is denoted by cT, it follows immediatelyfrom (62) that the response of the desired capital stock to
this one percentage point decrease in the real interest rate is equal to (lOa)%. Thus, if = 0.1.
the desired capital stock rises by only 1% in response to a one percentage point fall in the real

interest rate. Second, the depreciation rate of 6% per year may be a reasonable rate for struc-
tures, but the depreciation rate for equipment           is about   16% per year. Thus, for equipment a

decrease in. the real interest rate from 4% to 3% reduces the user cost of capital by only 5% rather

than the 10% calculated for structures.3Â° Third, the real rate of interest used by firms in capital

budgeting decisions is generally a risk-adjusted rate of return such as a weighted average of the
after-tax interest rate on debt and the expected rate            of return on equity.3' Feldstein (1982)
calculates the cost of funds annually for the period 1954-1977. Although this real cost of funds

is about 4% for the first half of this sample, it is higher than 4% throughout the second half of the
sample and reached a value of 7.2% in 1977. A one percentage point increase in the real cost of
funds has   a smaller impact on the user cost of capital if the cost of capital starts from a higher
value.


30Ha11 and Jorgenson (1967) estimate the depreciation rates for broadly defined capital aggregates using the
so-called Bulletin F lifetimes from the Department of the Treasury. They presentthe following (annual) deprecin-

value of the capital exceeds its cost the greater is the incentive to invest. To capture thss notion
in an observable quantitattve measure. Tobin defined the variable q to be the ratio of the market
value of a firm to the replacement cost of its capital stock. He then argued that investment is an

increasing function of q. A majoradvantage of Tobin's q is thai it relies on securities markets to
value the prospects of the firm.

        Before discussing the q theory of investment more formally, it is worthwhile to digress

briefly to discuss   a related model in which the rate of investment depends on the market valua-
don of capital. Foley and Sidrauski (1970) developed a two-sector model of the economy in
which there is a concave production possibilities frontier relating the aggregate output of the

rmns may optimallyforego someprojectswhose presentvalue exceedstheir cost. See McDonald and Siegel (1986).

consumption good and the aggregate output of the capital good. In a competitive economy,
resources are allocated to these two sectors depending on the relative prices of these two goods.
More precisely, the production     of new capital goods is an increasing function of the price of
capital goods relative to the price of consumption goods. In the Foley-Sidrauski model, the price
of capital is determined endogenously in a securities markets in which three assets--money,
bonds, and capital--are uaded. The price of capital is determined to equilibrate the demand for
                                                                                 of new capital
capital with the existing supply of capital. This price then determines the flow
goods production. Although the formal model is different from the q theory, in both the Foley-
Sidrauski model and the q theory, the rate of investment is an increasing function of the price of

capital goods whichis determined in asset markets.
       A version of the q theory of investment can be derived from the adjustment cost model of
investment presented above. For the sake of continuity of exposition, suppose that the adjust-
ment cost function is as specified in (57) so that the marginal cost of investment is c(I, K) =

g'(I - hK). Using this form of the marginal adjustment cost function in the first-order condition
for the optimal rate of investment, (52b), yields

                                                        p) + hK
                                          =         -                                        (65)

where Go    = g1() so that G' > 0 and 0(0) = 0. Equation (65) expresses the rate of investment
as an increasing function of the shadow priceof installed capital, Note that in the steady state,

with K = 0, the rate of gross investment, I, is equal to depreciation hK; the shadow price of a
unit of capital, is equal to the price of investment goods, Pt. The latter result, (q Pt in the
steady state) is a consequence of specifying the adjustment cost function such that the marginal

adjustment cost c1(I, K) is equal to zero when net investment is equal to zero. Alternatively, if
the adjustment cost function is specified so that the marginal cost of investment is equal to zero

when gross investment is equal to zero, then in the steady state q would exceed p by the mar-

ginal cost of replacement investment, hK.
        The investment equation in (65) is related to Tobin's q theory of investment. To under-
stand the relation between (65) and Tobin's q theory of investment, it is important to distinguish

Tobin defines q to be the ratio of the average value of the capital stock VJK, to the price of a

unit of capital, Pt. Thus. Tobin's q is qA where

                                              u' =V,I(pK,)                                         66)

(67) imply that
                                    I =G((q           i)pt)
         A natural question is whether there are conditions under which average q and marginal q

are equal to each other. The answer can be obtained using the following proposition. 'ahich is a

generalization of a result due to Hayashi (1982): Suppose that the revenue function Y(K, L, is
linearly homogeneous in K and L, the adjustment cost function is linearly homogeneous in I anti
K, and that p. w,, and R(t, s) are exogenous to the firm. Then the value of the firm, V1, is propor-
tional to the stock of capital, K0 Under these conditions, it follows that dV/dK is equal to V/K,;

thus, (66) and (67) imply that average q is equal to marginal q in this case.
         The equality of average q and marginal q holds more generally than under the conditions
stated above. It holds even if the interest rate is stochastic, It also holds if the cash flow, X,, is

subject to random multiplicative shocks. The key assumption about the behavior of cash flow is
that it is a linearly homogeneous function of the three variables K, L, and I.
       The use of Tobin's q to explain investment provides an attractive link between asset
markets and investment activity. In particular, stock and bond markets are relied upon to value

the firm's capital stock, thereby relieving the economist from having to calculate the relevant

expected present value of future cash flows. Unfortunately, investment equations based on
                                                -48-



Tobin's q are not free of difficulty. Typically, estimated equations relating investment to Tobin's

q leave a large unexplained serially correlated residual.33 In addition, lagged values of Tobin's q
often enter significantly as explanators of investment, which contradicts the simple adjustment
cost model described above. Finally, other variables such as output and capacity utilization have
additional explanatory power in investment equations with q. This fmding contradicts the notion
that all information that is relevant to the valuation of capital and to the investment decision is

captured by the market value of the firm.
       There are several possible explanations for the departures            of empirically estimated
investment equations from the simple predictions of the theory. First, average q and marginal q

may display different movements. For example, consider          a firm that has a large amount of
energy-intensive capital.   If the price of energy rises dramatically, then the value of the firm
would fall as the quasi-rents available on existing energy-intensive capital would fall. However,
the firm may undertake substantial investment in energy-saving capital. Therefore, an observer

of this firm would see a drop in average q coinciding with an increase in investment. This
example makes clear that heterogeneity of capital can potentially destroy the relation between

average q and investment. As for marginal q,      it is important to distinguish the marginal q, or
shadow price, for the different types of capital. In the example above, the marginal q of energy-
intensive capital is reduced and the marginal q of energy-savingcapital is increased by the rise in
the price of energy.
       The fact that lagged values of q are found to be significant explanators of investment is
perhaps suggestive of the importance of delivery lags in the investment process. For many types
of capital, especially structures, there may be a substantial delay between the date on which it is
decided to the acquire and install new capital and the date at which the capital expenditures are

VII. CorporateTaxes and Inflation
        The incentive to invest is influenced by the corporate tax environment in gene'al and by

the interaction of corporate taxes and inflation in particular. Toe three aspects of the corporate
tax code that have been analyzed most widely in the context of investment are the corporate tax

rate, the depreciation allowance and nbc investment tax credit.36 Let t be the tax rate assessed on
corporate proflts. Taxable corporate profits are calculated as revenues less wages, depreciation
allowances and adjustment costs. For simplicity, I will assume that adjustment costs are ex-

pensed, which is consistent with treating adjustment costs as foregone output or revenue. Let
D(x) be the depreciation allowance for an asset of age x that cost one dollar when new. Then,

following Hall and Jorgenson (1967), let a = J D(x)            e' dx be the present value of depreciation

34Alel and Blanchard(1986) have have found thai for nonelectrical machineryand fabricated metals there is a an
avenge delivery lag of 2 quarters, and for electrical machinery the avenge lag is 3 quarters. For structures, the
average lags range from 3 to 8 quarters.

deductions overthe life of the asset, where i is the nominal interest rate. Finally, let k be the rate
of the investment tax credit so that for each dollar spent on investment goods, the firm receives a
rebate of k dollars.37 Thus the net cost to the firm                 of a dollar of investment goods is
(1 - k - tz).38
        Now define X to be the excess of after-tax real revenues over real wages, adjustment
costs and the real net priceof investment goods at time

                     X = (1 - t) [Y(K, L) - c(11, K) - wILl - (1 - k - tz) p1 I.                             (69)

In the absence of taxes,      X would be equal to the cash flow X in (47).                 The maximization

problem of the firm is equivalent to maximizing the present value of the sn-earn of X.39 This
maximization problem can be solved using the same procedure as presented earlier in the ab-
sence of taxes. The current value Hamiltonian, which is analogous to (51), is

                  =(l -t){Y(}c,L) -c(,}c) -w] -(1 -k-tz)p111 +q(11 -hK1).                                    (70)

Differentiating the current value Hamiltonian with respect to L1 and setting the derivative equal
to zero yields the condition that labor is hired until the marginal revenueproduct of labor is equal
to the wage rate (equation (52a)). Differentiating (70) with respect to the rate of investment, I,

yields the analogue of (52b)
                                   (l-t)cs(I,K4) =q -(1-k-tz)p.                                              (71)

The shadow price q must obey the relation                 - rq = -H IK which implies the following
analogue of (53)
                              =   (r + h)     - (1 - t) [YK (Ic,      - cK (It, K1)] .                       (72)




37The Tax Reform Act of 1986eliminatedthe investment tax credit in the United States.
38Under the Long Amendment, which was in effect in 1962 and 1963, the basis for depreciation allowances was
reduced by the investment tax credit, and the net price of investmentgoods was (1 - k) (1 - tz). The expression in
the text is appropriate for the period after the repeal of the Long Amendment.
39The present value of x; is not equal to the presentvalue of cash flow because it ignores the depreciation allow-
ances on capital installedbefore date t. Because the cash flows assnciated with these deductions are predetermined
at time t, they can be ignoredin the maximization problem at time I

Now suppose that the adjustment cost function has the specification in (57) so that the mar7tna

adjustment cost, eT, is equal to zero tn the steady state, In this case, the first-order condition in
(71) implies that, in the steady state, the shadow priceof capi'al is equal to the tax-adjusted pnce
of investment goods
                                        q   =(l -k-tz)pi.
Next set the right hand side of (74), which is the present value of after-tax marginal cash flow,

equal to the right hand side of (75), which is the tax-adjusted priceof capital, to obtaln

                                             -        = T(r + h)p                               (76a)

The right hand side of (76a) is equal to the tax-adjusted user cost of capital derived by Hall and
Jorgenson (1967). The factorT is a tax-adjustment factor; when T is equal to one, as it would be
in the absence of taxes, then the user cost is identical to the steady state user cost presented above
in (58).
        To obtain a simple investment equation in the presence of corporate taxes, suppose that
the adjustment cost function is independent of the capital stock, i.e.,      c   0. In this case, the
first-order condition in (71) can be rewritten as

                                                                                                    (77)


where Ho = C (     ,   ) is an increasing function. The behavior of the investment equation (77) can
be easily examined under the assumption that the revenue function is linearly homogeneous in K
and L. The linear homogeneity    of Y(K, L) implies that when cash flow is maximized with
respect to labor, L, the maximized value of Y(K, L) - wL is equal to 8(w)K where O(w) is a
positive but decreasing function of the real wage rate w. Therefore, when the firm follows an
optimal employment policy, we obtain

                                           YK(K,   L) = 8(w)                                        (78)

so that the marginal revenue product of capital is positive and decreasing in the real wage rate.

Recalling that cJ( is identically equal to zero, the shadow price of capital can be easily calculated
from (73) to be

                                  =5   {(i -   ) B(w)   R(t, s)   et)} ds.                          (79)


It follows immediately from (79) that c1   1(1 - t) is independent of the tax rate t. The effect   of the
tax code is captured by the tax adjustment factor T, and inspection of (77) reveals immediately
that the rate of investment is a decreasing function of T. Therefore, investment is an increasing
function of the investment tax credit, k, and is also an increasing function of the present value of

depreciation deductions, z.
       Now consider the effects on investment of changes in real and nominal interest rates. In
the neoclassical model, an increase in the real rate      of interest raises the user cost of capital and
hence reduces the desired capital stock and investment. It would appear that changes in the
nominal interest rate would not affect the user cost unless they were accompanied by changes in
the real interest rate. However, the U.S. tax code contains an important inflation non-neutrality,
which gives nominal interest rates an effect on investment over and above the effect of real
interest rates. Depreciation allowances are based on the nominal historical cost of a piece of

capital rather than on its replacement cost. Thus, inflation reduces the real value of future
depreciation deductions so that an increase in inflation reduces z, the present value            of real
                                                        -53-



depreciation deductions. An alternative, but equivalent, explanation for the negattve relation
between inflation and z is that the depreciation deductions represent a sri-earn of nominai flows
and can be discounted by        a nominal interest rate, If the (expected and actual) rate of riflation
rises without any change in the real interest rate, then the nominal interest rate also rises so that
the present value of the unchanged sri-earn of nominal flows is reduced, The redueu3n in z

increases the tax adtustment parameter T and thus tends to reduce the rate of invectroent, In

VIII. Uncertainty
         The investment behavior of firms has been derived above in the absence                   of uneera:rtr.
It seems intuitively plausible that the desirability of investment projects would depend on the risk
associated with the project and, furthermore, one might suspect that an increase in risk would
reduce the rate of investment.           However, much         of the existing analytic work on investment
under uncertainty does not support the notion that greater uncertainty inhibits investment,
Hartman (1972) and Abel (1985) have shown that an increase in the variance of the output price
or in the variance of the price of variable factors will induce a competitive firm to increase its
rate of investment. Pazner and Razin (1974) have shown that an increase in interest rate uncer-
tainty also induces the firm to increase its rate of investment. The argument underlying these
resultscan be illustrated using the expression for q in (79) which was derived under the assump-
don that the revenue function is linearly homogeneous in K and L. This equation would apply to
a competitive firm with a constant returns to scale production function.              It can be shown that the


40See Auerbach (t979b), Kopcke (1981), and Abel (1981).
4tFelthtein (1982) analyzes other inflation non â€¢'eutralities such as the fact that nominal interest payments,rather
thanreal interest payments,are tax deductible.
                                                      -54-



marginal revenue product of capital, e(w5), is a convex function of w. Therefore, if the variance
of w is increased while its expected value is held constant, then Jensen's inequality implies that
the expected value  of O(w) increases. This increase in the expected value of e(W) implies that
the expected present value of marginal revenue products of capital increases and thus the optimal
rate of investment increases. Similarly, it can be shown that R(t, s) is a convex function of future
instantaneous rates of interest,    r for v > t, and hence     an increase in the variance    of interest rates
will also increase investment.

        Recently, Zeira (1987) has developed a model of a monopolistic firm that is uncertain
both about its own capacity and about the demand curve                 it faces.   In this particular model,

increased priceuncertainty will reduce investment.
        It should be noted that in all of the above-mentioned works on investment under uncer-
tainty, the firm is modelled as risk-neutral. More precisely, the fiim is assumed to maximize the
expected present value of cash flow. It seems that future work could usefully model risk-averse

managers and/or couldmodel the covariance of the firm's returns with the market portfolio.

IX, Inventories
        Up to this point, the discussion of investment has focused on fixed investment. In
addition to fixed investment, firms invest in inventories. Although the average value of inven-

tory investment, i.e., the average change in the stock of inventories, is quite small relative to the

average level of fixed investment, the volatility of inventory investment is quite large.42 Rather
than develop a formal analytic model of inventory behavior, I will simply discuss some of the

major issues. The first step is to explain why firms hold inventories. Two reasons that have been
studied are: (a) for technological reasons, there is a lag between the beginning of production and
the sale of a good. To the extent that the production process takes time, there will be an inven-

tory of goods in process. To the extent that there is a delay between the completion of produc-




2B1inder (1981) reports that declines in inventory investmentaccountfor 70% of the peak-to-trough decline in real
GNP during recessions. During the period 1959:1 to 1979:4 changesin inventory investment accounted for 37% of
the varianceof changes in GNP.
tion and the sale of the good, there is a finished goods inventory, n) men if it werc postole to
make production always equal to the contemporaneous valoe of sales so that there mignt be no
need to hind inventories, cost-minimizing firms may choose to hold inventories as a means        of

avoiding large fluctuations in production in the face of large fluctuations in sales          Th1s

 production smoothing motive for holding inventories would arise if the :nargina            riyt of
production were an increasing function of the level of production. In this case, the cost-

mintmizing scheduling of any eve1 of average prc'du;con        reqore minimiz'ng f1uctuiu'ri     to

production.
       The production smoothing model of nventcriesnsa a smking resemblance to tne ;etrra-
nent income model of consumption, which could he descrioed           s a mode of consumption
smoothing. Indeed, some of the lemons from the permanent income model could be rarried 01cr
to the production smoothing model of inventor,es. For example, if all changes in a firm       .ales

were perfecdy forecastable, then the production smoothing model would predict thit 'he firm
would malntaln a smooth pmflle of production in the face of variations in its sales. Only coin-

ticipated changes in sales would lead firms to alter production. The macroeconormc impiicaoun
of fnis observation is that an anticipated increase in final demand, aristng from (say) govemment
spending, would not affect GNP because the firm would meet the cxtiti demand by selling out of

inventory. The increase in government spending would be exactly offset by negative inventory
invesmient. Alternatively, if the increase in government spending were unanticipated, then the
ftrm would presumably revise its production plans and raise production somewhat.
       The production smoothing model of inventories has the implication that the variance of
production should be less than or equal to the variance of sales. However, Blinder (1986) and
West (1986) argue convincingly that the data on production and sales contradicts this implication
of the theory. There are a few potential explanations of the apparent production "counter-
smoothing" in the data. A simple but unsatisfying explanation is that shocks to the production
function or to the cost of inputs lead firms to vary their production even in the face of unchang-

ing demand. An alternative explanation is that an unanticipated increase in sales implies that
future sales will be even higher.   If the average level of expected future sales increases by more
                                                      -56-



than the current increase in sales, then a firm facing increasing marginal costs                of production
would respond by increasing production by more than the current increase in sales. Hence, the

variance of production responses to sales shocks would exceed the variance of sales shocks.43
Thus, for example, an unanticipated increase in government purchases of goods would lead firms
to increase production by an even greater amount, thereby increasing inventory investment. Thus
the initial sales innovation has a magnified effect on GNP.
        A third explanation of production counter-smoothing is that firms have a desired level                 of

inventories that depends on the stochastic distribution of          sa1es. An unanticipated increase in
sales would deplete inventories by an equal amount. In order to restore inventories to the origi-

nally desired level, production would have to increase by an amount equal to the unanticipated
increase in sales. If, in addition, the unanticipated increase in sales leads the firm to revise

upward its forecast of future sales, the desired level of inventories would increase. In order to
reach the new, higher, desired level of inventories, the firm would have to increase production by
even more than the increase in sales. Again, the production response to an innovation in in-
ventories magnifies the effect on GNP.
        In addition to depending on sales expectations, inventory investment may depend on the
behavior of interest rates. The reason for the dependence of inventory investment on interest
rates is similar to the reason that fixed investment should depend on interest rates. Specifically,
the interest rate measures the opportunity cost of holding inventories rather than interest-earning

assets. An increase in the real interest rate should lead to a decrease In the desired holding of
inventories. However, as in the case of business fixed investment, it has been difficult to detect

the effect of interest rates on inventory investment econometrically. Recently, Irvine (1981) and
Akhtar (1983) have reported statistically significant negative responses of inventory investment
to increases in short-term interest rates. Specifically, Akhtar finds that a one percentage point

rise in the short-term nominal interest rate would reduce aggregate inventory investment by about

See    Feldstein and Auerbach (1976). Kahn (1987) motivates the desired level of inventories by explicitly consid-
ering stockoutcosts.

$2 billion; a one percentage point increase in the expected rate of inflation leads to an increase tn

inventory investment of about $0.8 billion.

X. Concluding Remarks
       Although the last decade has seen u-emendou progress in understanding the             't-hesdc
behavior  of consumption, many questions still remain. As mentioned earlier in this chapter.
                                                               y
recent evidence suggests that labor income is characterized a unit root, and the presence ,jf a
unit root has important impiea.ions    fx consumption nehavur, Whether it is uLtimatey deter
rnjned that the u-end in labor income 15 stochastic, as suggested by the evidence on a ur,h no o, or

is deterrnnistic. there ttili remains the question of whether consumers think of the u-end as being
stochastic or deterministic in making consumption deci.hot s.      iThe   formal analysis at tee pernm

nent income model employs the assumptson of ratio'ai expectations xhiah implC that â€¢un-
sumers know wuether the u-end is stochastic or deterministic; however, it must be recognized that
the assurr'ption of rational expectations is simply an assumption. Whether it will prove truitful to

explore alternative assumptions about the expectations of consumers is an open question.
       Other important questions about consumption behavior remain for policy makers. For

instance, are there quantitatively important departures from the Ricardian Equivalence Theorem?
If so, what is the source of these departures and is there scope for tax policy to achieve alterna-
tive allocations   of consumption that might be preferred according to some critenon? Another
unresolved question relevant for policy involves the interest elasticity of saving. If this elasticity

could be reliably estimated, then there would be scope for fiscal policy to increase the level of

saving by somehow subsidizing the rate of return on saving.
        The empirical performance of investment equations could also benefit from future
advances. Many capital goods are indivisible and take a long rime to build. The indivisibility of
these goods and the delivery lags associated with capital continue to pose challenges to the

theory of investment and its empirical implementation.
        Another area of open research questions involves the cost of capital and its relation to
investment. The theory     of corporate finance is still working toward an understanding of the
                                               -58-



financing decisions of firms and an appropriate concept of the cost of capital. Further develop-
ments in this theory may help to clarify the role of risk in affecting the cost of capital and the
investment decisions of firms.
