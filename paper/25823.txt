This article presents the eqregsel command for implementing the estimation and bootstrap
inference of sample selection models via extremal quantile regression. The command estimates a
semiparametric sample selection model without instrument or large support regressor, and
outputs the point estimates of the homogenous linear coefficients, their bootstrap standard errors,
as well as the p-value for a specification test.

              This article presents the eqregsel command for implementing the estimation and
          bootstrap inference of sample selection models via extremal quantile regression. The
          command estimates a semiparametric sample selection model without instrument or large
          support regressor, and outputs the point estimates of the homogenous linear coefficients,
          their bootstrap standard errors, as well as the p-value for a specification test.
              Keywords: eqregsel, sample selection models, extremal quantile regressions.


1        Introduction
In this article, we present the command eqregsel for estimation and inference of endoge-
nous sample selection models that implements the procedures developed in recent work by
D’Haultfœuille et al. (2018).1 Prior methods proposed in the econometric literature to esti-
mate endogenous sample selection models rely on instruments and/or large support regres-
sors. For the former, see, among others, Heckman (1974, 1979, 1990), Ahn and Powell (1993),
Donald (1995), Buchinsky (1998), Chen and Khan (2003), Das et al. (2003), Newey (2009)
and Vella (1998) for a survey. Chamberlain (1986) and Lewbel (2007) develop identification
strategies for sample selection models in the absence of an instrument for selection. These
alternative methods rely on the existence of a large support regressor. However, in practice,
valid instruments, as well as large support regressors are often difficult, if not impossible to
find.

Instead, the method implemented in eqregsel does not require the presence of instruments
or large support regressors.2 Identification relies instead on the strategy initially proposed by
D’Haultfoeuille and Maurel (2013), which is based on the idea that, provided that selection
is endogenous, one can expect the effect of the outcome on selection to dominate those of
the covariates, for large values of the outcome. eqregsel builds on the estimation method
proposed by D’Haultfœuille et al. (2018) and implements a series of quantile regressions in
the tails of the outcome distribution (extremal quantile regressions).3 The command outputs
estimates for a set of user-specified coefficients of interest, their standard errors (estimated via
bootstrap), and a p-value for the specification test described in D’Haultfœuille et al. (2018).

Our command complements the existing Stata command heckman for the estimation of sample
selection models. In terms of underlying assumptions, eqregsel has at least three distinctive
features compared to heckman. First, it does not require normality of the error term in the
selection equation, nor linearity of the conditional expectation of the error term in the outcome
equations. Second, it does not restrict the selection process, apart from an independence at
infinity condition. Third, it allows for heterogeneous distributional effects of other control
variables.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we recall the setup of the
semiparametric endogenous sample selection model considered in D’Haultfœuille et al. (2018),
and describe the data-driven procedure used to choose the quantile index for the extremal
quantile regression. Section 3 describes how to implement the method in practice. Section 4
presents the eqregsel command. Section 5 illustrates the use of our command by estimating
the black-white wage gap on US young males of the 1979 and 1997 National Longitudinal
Surveys of Youth. Section 6 concludes.


2     The framework and estimation method

2.1    Model and estimation

We consider the following outcome equation:

                                                Y ∗ = X10 β1 + ε
    2
      See Honoré and Hu (2018) for a related recent work, also motivated by the difficulty of finding instruments
for sample selection. As is the case here, they do not require exclusion restrictions nor large support regressors.
However, their approach is based on a different set of assumptions and, in contrast to our framework, delivers
set- rather than point-identification.
    3
      See Chernozhukov et al. (2017) for an overview of extremal quantile regression methods and recent appli-
cations.



                                                        2
where Y ∗ ∈ R and X1 ∈ Rd1 are the outcome and covariates of interest, respectively. In
the following, we seek to identify and estimate β1 . For that purpose, we rely on two key
conditions. The first is that for any τ ∈ (0, 1), the τ -th conditional quantile of ε satisfies

                                     Qε|X (τ |X) = β0 (τ ) + X20 β2 (τ ),                                 (2.1)

where X = (X10 , X20 )0 and X2 denotes other covariates. Then

                                   QY ∗ |X (τ ) = X10 β1 + β0 + X20 β2 (τ ).                              (2.2)

The effect of X1 is thus assumed to be homogenous across different quantile indices, while the
effect of the other covariates X2 is allowed to be heterogeneous across the distribution of Y ∗ .
Y ∗ is not directly observed. Instead, and denoting by D the selection dummy, the econo-
metrician only observes D, Y = DY ∗ and X. The second key condition is that conditional
on having “large” outcomes, selection is independent of the covariates. More precisely, we
assume that there exists a constant h ∈ (0, 1] such that for all x ∈ Supp(X),

                                   lim P (D = 1|X = x, Y ∗ = y) = h.                                      (2.3)
                                   y→∞


Combining (2.2) and (2.3), D’Haultfœuille et al. (2018, Theorem 1) shows that, under some
regularity conditions on the upper tail of ε, as τ → 0,

                Q−Y |X (τ |X) = Q−Y ∗ |X (τ /h|X) + o(1)
                                  = −X10 β1 − β0 (1 − τ /h) − X20 β2 (1 − τ /h) + o(1).                   (2.4)

Therefore, (2.4) suggests that we can estimate β1 by running a quantile regression of −Y on
−X with a sufficiently small quantile index τ , i.e.,

                                                       0         n
                        0 b                 0
                                                                   X             0
                       β1 , β0 (1 − τ /h), β2 (1 − τ /h) = arg min
                       b                   b                         ρτ (−Yi + X i β),                    (2.5)
                                                                  β
                                                                      i=1


where ρτ (u) = (τ − 1{u < 0})u is the check function used in quantile regressions and X i =
(X 0 , 1, X 0 )0 . Intuitively, for βb1 to be consistent, τ should depend on n and tend to 0 as
   1i      2i
n tends to infinity. However, it should not tend too quickly to 0, otherwise the extremal
quantile regression would be unstable. Formally, and letting τn denote the quantile index,
D’Haultfœuille et al. (2018) establish that if τn → 0 and nτn → ∞,4 , and under additional
   4
    This corresponds to the so-called “intermediate order case” in extreme value theory, in contrast to “extreme
order cases” where one would have nτn → k for some k > 0.


                                                       3
technical restrictions, βb1 is consistent and asymptotically normal.

As is standard with extremal quantile regressions (see Chernozhukov et al., 2017), the rate of
convergence is not the usual parametric root-n rate. Moreover, in this case, this rate depends
on unknown features of the distribution of (D, Y ∗ , X).5 Importantly, D’Haultfœuille et al.
(2018) show that the bootstrap is consistent for inference, and does not require the knowledge
of the rate of convergence. To illustrate this, let qγ∗ denote the quantile of order γ of the
bootstrap estimator βb∗ , assuming for simplicity that X1 is a scalar (d1 = 1). Then, Theorem
                            1
2 in D’Haultfœuille et al. (2018) implies that the percentile bootstrap confidence interval
  ∗ , q∗
[qα/2  1−α/2 ] of β1 has an asymptotic coverage of 1 − α. Such an interval does not require the
knowledge of the rate of convergence.

The results above rely on two main conditions, namely (2.1) and (2.3). Importantly, we can
develop a specification test of these conditions, based on the implication that the coefficient
β1 in Q−Y |X (τn |X) is the same across different extremal quantile indices τn (see (2.4)). Then,
if the model is correctly specified, the two estimators βb1 (`τn ) (with 0 < ` < 1) and βb1 (τn )
of β1 , obtained respectively with τ = `τn and τ = τn , should be close. Following this idea,
consider the following J-test statistic:

                                                                    b −1 (βb1 (τn ) − βb1 (`τn )),
                    TJ (`) = [(1/`) − 1]2 (βb1 (τn ) − βb1 (`τn ))0 Ω                                      (2.6)

where Ω
      b is a (bootstrap) estimator of the asymptotic covariance of βb1 (τn ), properly normalized
by the rate of convergence in view of the discussion above. Then we reject the test at the
nominal level α whenever TJ (`) > qd1 (1 − α), where qd1 (1 − α) is the quantile of order 1 − α
of a χ2 distribution with d1 degrees of freedom. Theorem 2.3 in D’Haultfœuille et al. (2018)
establishes that for any 0 < ` < 1 the test has an asymptotic level of α. It also proves that
under some local alternatives, the local power is maximized at `∗ = arg max`∈[0,1] `[ln(l)]2 /(1−
`) ' 0.2.


2.2      Choice of the quantile index

The performance of extremal quantile estimators depends on a trade-off between bias and
variance, which is governed by the quantile index τn used in the extremal quantile regression.
We present in the following the algorithm outlined in D’Haultfœuille et al. (2018), which
selects a suitable quantile index based on estimators of the bias and the variance of βb1 .

Specifically, consider the same test statistic as in (2.6), but where (`τn , τn ) are replaced by
  5
      We refer to the definition of the rate above Theorem 2.2 in D’Haultfœuille et al. (2018) for more details.



                                                          4
(`1 τn , `2 τn ), with `1 < 1 < `2 :

                TJ (τ ) = [1/`1 − 1/`2 ]2 (βb1 (`2 τ ) − βb1 (`1 τ ))0 Ω
                                                                       b −1 (βb1 (`2 τ ) − βb1 (`1 τ )).


D’Haultfœuille et al. (2018) shows that the difference between the median of TJ (τ ) and the
median of a chi-squared distribution with d1 degrees of freedom can serve as a proxy for the
bias of the estimator.

The idea, then, is to estimate this difference using subsampling.6 For each subsample and
each quantile index τ within a grid G, one can compute TJ (τ ). Let Msub (τ ) denote the median
of these test statistics over different subsamples for a given τ , and let Md1 denote the median
of the chi-squared distribution with d1 degrees of freedom. Then, the proxy of the bias is
defined as
                                         c n (τ ) = |Msub√
                                         diff
                                                         (τ ) − Md1 |
                                                                      ,
                                                           bn τ
where bn denotes the subsample size.

Similarly, the asymptotic covariance matrix is estimated by the covariance matrix of the
subsampling estimator of β1 , multiplied by the normalizing factor bn /n. Denote by Var
                                                                                    d n (τ )
the sum of the diagonal elements of this covariance matrix. The quantile index is selected to
optimize the bias-variance trade-off:

                                       τbn = arg min Var
                                                     d n (τ ) + diff
                                                                c n (τ ),
                                                  τ ∈G


where G denotes a finite grid within (0, 1). This procedure results in undersmoothing in
comparison with a more standard trade-off between variance and squared bias. Similarly
to the case of nonparametric regressions, this is needed to control the asymptotic bias that
would otherwise affect the limiting distribution of the estimator. We refer to D’Haultfœuille
et al. (2018) for simulation-based evidence that this choice leads to estimators that are both
accurate and only very mildly biased, thus leading to reliable inference on β1 .


3       Implementation
We summarize how we implement the method described above in eqregsel.

    1. Draw B bootstrap samples and B subsamples of size bn .
    6
     We recall that subsampling corresponds to a bootstrap without replacement of size bn < n. Though often
less accurate than the standard bootstrap, subsampling has the advantage of being consistent under much
weaker conditions. See Politis et al. (1999) for an introduction.

     The term bn /n accounts for the fact that the rate of convergence of the J statistic on the subsample is
bn /n times the rate of convergence on the whole sample.

In practice, we consider an equally-spaced grid G with lower bound min(0.1, 80/bn ), upper
bound 0.3 and a number of points equal to nG . The lower bound is motivated by the fact that if
the effective subsampling size τ bn becomes too small, then the intermediate order asymptotic
theory is likely to be a poor approximation (see Chernozhukov and Fernandez-Val, 2011 for
a related discussion). To compute TJs (τ ) in Step 2.(c) above, we use (`1 , `2 ) = (0.9, 1.1).


4     The eqregsel command
We describe below the syntax, options and saved results associated with the eqregsel com-
mand. Note that it relies on the moremata Stata package. If the latter is not already installed,
one must type ssc install moremata in Stata command line. The eqregsel command is
compatible with Stata 14 and later versions.


4.1   Syntax

The syntax of eqregsel is as follows:
                                                                               
eqregsel Y X1    X2       if         in         , hom(#)   subs(#) grid(#) rep(#)


4.2   Description

eqregsel computes βb1 in(2.2) based on the data-driven τn detailed in Section 2.2 above. It
also reports its standard errors and 95% confidence intervals. Finally, it computes the p-value
of this specification test using ` = 0.2.

X1 is the list of variable entering in X1 in Model (2.2).

X2 is the list of variable entering in X2 in Model (2.2).


4.3   Options

hom(#) specifies d1 , the number of variables in X1 . The code then returns their estimated
effects and standard errors. The default value is 1.

subs(#) specifies the subsample size bn . Following D’Haultfœuille et al. (2018), and letting
x+ = max(0, x), the default value is set to
                                                                    
                                            +             ln(2000)
                                                               +
       bn = 0.6n − 0.2(n − 500) − 0.2(n − 1000) − 0.2 1 −            (n − 2000)+ .
                                                            ln(n)

grid(#) specifies nG , the number of grid points. The default value is 40.


                                                           7
rep(#) specifies B, the number of bootstrap and subsampling replications. The default value
is 150.


4.4       Saved results

The eqregsel command saves the following in e():

    1. e(tau0), a scalar containing the quantile index τbn .

    2. e(specificationtest), a scalar containing the p-value of the specification test.

    3. e(subs), a scalar containing the subsample size bn .

    4. e(homvar), a scalar containing d1 , the number of variable(s) with homogenous effect(s)
       on the outcome.

    5. e(beta hom), a d1 × 1 matrix containing the estimated coefficient(s) of interest.

    6. e(std b), a d1 × 1 matrix containing the standard error of the estimator(s).


5     Example
We use the command eqregsel to estimate the black-white wage gap among young males
from the National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth 1979 and 1997 (NLSY79 and NLSY97),
revisiting the work of D’Haultfœuille et al. (2018) on this question. We are in particular
interested in the evolution of the gap between these two cohorts. We use the same samples
and definitions of variables as in D’Haultfœuille et al. (2018). In particular, we consider that
an individual in the NLSY79 is a nonparticipant if he did not work in 1990 nor in 1991. The
outcome of interest is the (potential) log-wage, which is defined as the log of the mean real
wages in 1990 and 1991 for workers who worked both years, and the log of the real wage in
the year of employment for those who worked only one year. We apply the same rules with
the years 2007 and 2008 for individuals in the NLSY97.

In our specification, we estimate for the two samples the effect of the Black dummy on the log
of wages (log wage), controlling for Hispanic dummy (hispanic), age (age), AFQT (Armed
Forces Qualification Test score) and AFQT squared (afqt and afqt2). The AFQT scores
cannot be directly compared across both NLSY cohorts, in part because of changes in how
the test was administered. To handle this issue, we use a modified version of the AFQT
constructed using the equipercentile mapping proposed by Altonji et al. (2012). We also
restrict the samples to the respondents who took the test when they were 16 or 17, to address

                                                8
the issue that the rank within the AFQT distribution may vary with the age of the respondent
at the time of the test. The final sample sizes are equal to 1, 077 and 1, 123 for the NLSY79
and NLSY97 cohorts, respectively. The overall labor force participation rates for the two
corresponding samples are equal to 95.1% and 89.7%. They only reach 90.6% and 81.4% for
Black males, however.

We report below the output of the eqregsel procedure applied to the NLSY79 and NLSY97
samples, respectively. We use the default parameters. We can see from the estimation output
that the default subsample sizes used in bootstrapping are 515 and 524, given the total sample
size of 1,077 and 1,123. The procedure also displays the estimated computing time, along with
a progress bar. Although in this example estimation is performed at a limited computational
cost, this feature makes it possible for the user to stop the execution of the command. If
needed, one can then save on execution time by setting a lower number of bootstrap and
subsampling replications, or a lower number of grid points.8

The estimation results point to statistically as well as economically significant black-white
wage gaps for the two cohorts. We also observe a wider black-white wage gap for the 1997
cohort relative to the 1979 cohort, with an increase in the estimated gap from about 11.9% to
15.9%. Note, however, that the difference is not significant at usual levels (p-value=0.51). In-
terestingly, the p-values of the specification tests imply that one cannot reject our specification
for either cohort at any standard statistical level.

It is interesting to compare the estimated black-white wage gap with the results of a simple
OLS regression of the log of hourly wages on a black dummy and the same set of controls.
The estimated black-white wage gap drops from 11.9% and 15.9%, for our specifications, to
8.1% and 9.7% (with standard errors equal to 0.035 and 0.041), for the OLS specification
that ignores selection. That the estimated wage gap is larger in magnitude when we use our
method is consistent with the underlying sample selection issue. Indeed, among males, blacks
are significantly more likely to dropout from the labor market (Juhn, 2003). Since dropouts
tend to have lower potential wages, one can expect that not controlling for endogenous labor
market participation will result in underestimating the black-white wage differential.9


6       Conclusion
In this paper we have discussed how to use the eqregsel command to estimate and conduct
inference on sample selection models, following D’Haultfœuille et al. (2018). Unlike alternative
    9
    We also estimate the wage gap using the Heckman two-step estimator, without any instrument. We obtain
very imprecisely estimated gaps of 24.2% and -21.2%, with standard errors of 0.48 and 0.68. This could be
expected: in the absence of instrument, this estimator strongly relies on functional form restrictions and is
often unstable.

estimation methods that have been proposed in the literature, the method does not require
the presence of instruments or large support regressors. The estimator is simply based on a
quantile regression in the tail, but with a quantile index chosen in a data-driven fashion. The
Stata command eqregsel makes it possible to easily use this procedure.
