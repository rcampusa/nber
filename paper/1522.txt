     Two facts that corporations, underwriters and investors have been

complexity in the design of securities. However, these two facts, increased

volatility and increased complexity, are not unrelated. Virtually all of

the complexity in securities can be viewed as the inclusion of different

options in a straight debt contract. Given the fact that the value of

options is driven most significantly by volatility, the advantage of

including options, Le. financial flexibility, in securities has increased

with increased market volatility. This would appear to explain why

corporate issuers and institutional investors have shown substantial

interest in securities which improve their flexibility in volatile markets.

Therefore, techniques which can consistently reflect the role of volatility

in the value of options or flexibility, should be of interest to issuers,

underwriters, and investors.

and Rosenfeld (MR), (1984), and presents some new results, which test the

ability of a CCA model based on Black and Scholes' option pricing

principles to predict the market price of callable corporate debt, and

therefore, the price of such common debt covenants as call provisions and

call protection, In addition, some numerical CCA results are reported

which demonstrate the impact of changing interest rate volatility on

the value of call provisions and call protection.

I.    Introduction


      Two    facts   that corporations, underwriters and investors have been forced to

confront are increased capital market volatility and increased complexity in

the design of securities. A seemingly endless list of new security ideas has

compounded the already difficult problem of making sound issuance, under—

writing and investment decisions in highly volatile markets. However, these

two facts, increased volatility and increased complexity, are not unrelated.

Virtually all of the complexity in securities can be viewed as the inclusion

of different options in a straight debt contract. Even such common debt

features as call provisions and call protection can be viewed as options.

The value of a call provision is the value of an option to redeem debt at a

fixed price prior to maturity and the value of call protection is the value

of shortening the life of that option. Given the fact that the value of

options is driven most significantly by volatility, the advantage of

including options, i.e. financial flexibility, in securities has increased

with increased market volatility. This would appear to explain why corporate

issuers and institutional investors have shown substantial interest in

securities which improve their flexibility in volatile markets. In low

volatility markets, corporations and investors would not lose a great deal

of flexibility if options were excluded from the design of securities and

would not make large valuation errors if options were ignored in valuing

securities. But given that options are more valuable in a volatile market,

significant valuation errors could result from ignoring options or valuing

them through possibly outdated "rules—of—thumb." Therefore, techniques which

can consistently reflect the role of volatility in the value of options or

flexibility should be of interest to issuers, underwriters, and

investors.

     A major breakthrough in the valuation of options came in 1973 when Fisher

Black and Myron Scholes presented a technique for valuing calls and puts written

on common stock. While their findings had an immediate and significant impact

on the stock option markets, Black and Scholes offered a qualitative insight

which may pro-se of even greater practical significance than their famous

quantitative formula: corporate liabilities and covenants can be viewed as

combinations of simple options contracts. This generalization of option

pricing models to corporate securities and covenants became known as

Contingent Claims Analysis (cCA).

     This paper summarizes the results of some research by Jones, Mason, and

Rosenfeld (JNR) (1984), and presents some new results, which test the

ability of a CCA model based on Black and Scholes' option pricing principles to

predict the market price of callable corporate debt, and therefore, the price of

such common debt covenants as call provisions and call protection. This research

had its origin in some earlier work, JMR (1983) done for the National Bureau's

conference on Corporate Capital Structures in the United States. In addition

some numerical CCA results are reported which demonstrate the impact of changing

interest rate volatility on the value of call provisions and call protection.

First, however, the paper briefly reviews the basics of option pricing and

demonstrates the significance of option pricing to pricing corporate securities

and individual covenants.

II. Corporate Liabilities as Options1

     To understand the relationship between corporate liabilities and options,

consider first the most fundamental options: calls and puts. An American
                                   —3—



call option, whose price is denoted by C, gives its owner the right to purchase

an asset, e.g. one share of stock, with current price S, at an exercise price, X,

on or before an expiration date which is T time periods from now. The call

option owner will only exercise his right to buy if it is to his advantage.

Figure 1 depicts the value of the call option as it depends on the stock price

on the expiration date. Should the stock price on the expiration date be less

than the exercise price then the call option owner will not exercise his right

to purchase the stock and the option will expire worthless, i.e. C=O. If,

however, the stock price is greater than the exercise price, then the call

option will be worth S—X, the difference between the stock price and the

exercise price.   An option is termed "American" if it can be exercised on or

before the expiration date and is termed "European" if the option can be

exercised only on the expiration date,

     Clearly, a call option pays off more the higher the underlying stock

price at expiration. If the volatility of the stock increases, then the

probability increases that the stock price will be higher at expiration.

It is also true that an increase in volatility increases the probability

that the stock price will be lower at expiration but the effect of a lower

stock price on the expected payoff to an option is bounded since the option

holder has the right not to exercise, i.e. not to surrender the exercise

price, if it is not in his best interest. Therefore, increased volatility

increases the expected payoff to the option and increases the option's

value.

     M American put option, P, gives its owner the right to sell one

share of stock, S, at an exercise price, X, on or before its expiration

date T periods from now. Again, the put option owner will only exercise

his right to sell if it is to his advantage. Figure 2 depicts the value of

the put option on its expiration date. If the stock price on the expiration

date is greater than the exercise price then the put option owner will not

exercise his right to sell the stock and the put option will expire worth-

less, P=O. However, should the stock price be less than the exercise price

then the put option owner will exercise his right to sell the stock and the

put option will be worth X—S, the difference between the exercise price

and the stock price. The expected payoff to the put also increases

given increased volatility since the probability that the stock price will

be lower increases and the put owner need not exercise if it is not to his

advantage, i.e. the stock price is above the exercise price.

     An important relationship between European call and put prices can be

derived from Figures 1 and 2. Consider buying a European call and selling

a European put on the same stock, with the same exercise price and expira—

tion date. The net investment is


                                       C   — p.


The value of this investment position at expiration of the options is

depicted in Figure 3. The value of the investment position on the expira-

tion date is S—X, the difference between the stock price and the exercise

price. The investment can have negative value if the stock price is below

the exercise price because the call will expire worthless and the put will

be exercised against its seller. However, there is another investment

position involving no options which can replicate the payoff depicted in

Figure 3. Consider buying one share of stock, S, borrowing on a discount

basis X dollars for T time periods at rate r, i.e. the proceeds from the
                      T
loan will be X(l+r)       allowing for discounting. This second investment

is then                                                              -




                      S_X(l+r)T.

In the T periods the value of this position will be S—X, since the position

owns one share of stock and owes X dollars. But, if these two positions

have precisely the same value in T time periods, then it must be true that

the initial net investment necessary to establish the positions be the same.


                      c—p=S-X(l+r)T                                          (1)


Expression (1) is well known by professional traders as "put—call parity."

The expression simply says that prices in the call, put, stock and lending

markets must be such that (1) is always true. If this were not the case,

traders would simply buy the lower priced alternative and sell the higher

priced alternative and earn an immediate riskiess return on zero net

investment.

     With these fundamental options properties as background, the

correspondence between options and corporate liabilities can now be

established. Consider Figure 4, the economic balance sheet of a simple

firm which has only two liabilities: equity, E, and a single issue of zero

coupon debt, D, where the equity receives no dividends and the firm will

issue no new securities while the debt is outstanding.
                                     —6—

                                Figure 4



The left—hand side of the balance sheet represents the economic value, V, Of

the firm. The right—hand side lists the economic value of all the liabil-

ities of the firm.

     Figures 5 and 6 depict the value of equity and risky debt as they depend

on the value of the firm on the maturity date of the debt. If, on the debt's

maturity date, the value of the firm is greater than the promised principal,

V > B, then the debt will be paid off, D=B, and the equity will be worth V—B.

However, if the value of the firm is less than the promised principal, V < B,

then the equity will be worthless, E=O, since it is preferable to surrender

the firm to the debtholders, D=V, then repay the debt. Both equity and risky

debt are contingent claims securities whose value is contingent on the value

of the firm.

     Now compare Figures 1 and 5, equity in the presence of zero coupon risky

debt is directly analogous to a European call option written on the firm

value, V, with an exercise price, B, equal to the debt's promised principal,

and an expiration date equal to the maturity date of the debt. In other

words, equity can be viewed as a call option with the right to buy the firm

for B dollars T time periods from now.

                                         —7—


        Now, return to the put—call parity result, (1), for options demon-

strated earlier. In the characterization of corporate liabilities as

options, the value of the firm, V, is the underlying asset on which the

options are written, the debt's promised principal, B, is the exercise price,

and the debt's maturity date is the option's expiration date. But, since the

value of the firm is the sum of the value of the equity and the value of the

debt,


                      V = E   +D

and since the value of the equity is analogous to a call option written on

the value of the firm, it then follows that


                      D =   B(1+r)T.p.                                       (2)



The value of risky debt is equal to the price of a risk—free bond with the

same terms minus the price of a put written on the value of the firm.

        Expression (2) has an intuitive interpretation. It is commonly under-

stood that risky debt plus a loan guarantee has the same value as risk—free

debt. The loan guarantee is like insurance, i.e. it will pay any shortfall

in the value of the firm necessary to fully repay the debt. Figure 7 depicts

the value of a loan guarantee, C, on the maturity date of the risky debt. If

on the maturity date of the debt the value of the firm is greater than the

debt's promised principal, i.e. V > B, then the guarantee will pay nothing

since the firm is sufficiently valuable to retire the debt. However, if

the value of the firm is less than the promised principal, V < B, then the

guarantor must pay the difference between the promised principal and the

value of the firm, B—V, in order that the debt be fully repaid. Now compare

Figures 2 and 7. It is evident that a loan guarantee is analogous to a

European put option written on the value of the firm, i.e. G=p. And,

therefore, expression (2) is simply the statement that risky debt plus a

loan guarantee is equal to a risk—free bond.

     The characterization of corporate liabilities as options goes much

deeper than the simple corporate securities studied so far. For example,

assume that the debt receives coupon payments. Then equity can be thought

of as analogous to a European call option on a dividend paying stock where

the coupon payments are the "dividends." Now assume the coupon bond is

callable under a schedule of prices. The equity is now analogous to an

American call option on a dividend paying stock where the exercise price

changes according to the specified schedule. Furthermore, the value of

the call provision can be characterized as the difference between the value

of an American and European call option where the exercise price changes

according to the specified schedule. The value of call protection against

redemption for the first T1 <   T time periods can be viewed as the difference

between the values of two American call options on a dividend paying stock

where the first call can be exercised at any time according to a schedule

and the second call can only be exercised in the last T —        time periods.
                                                            T1

As is evident from these examples, the correspondence between corporate

liabilities and options extends to a wide variety of securities and

covenants.

     As shown, equity, zero—coupon debt, and loan guarantees can be

represented as combinations of simple option contracts. The correspondence

is, moreover, sufficiently complete that it is possible to characterize many

of the complex securities and covenants encountered in practice by similar
                                      —9—



analogies to basic options. Note that this correspondence is not dependent

upon any particular option pricing model, but instead is a fundamental relation-

ship which must hold independently of how options and corporate securities are

assumed to be priced. Therefore, given any option pricing model with all its

direct implications for pricing stock options, that same model has corresponding

direct implications for the pricing of corporate liabilities and covenants.

     The traditional approach to the pricing of different corporate liabil-

ities and covenants employs different valuation techniques and rules of thumb

for different problems, and rarely attempts to integrate the various components

of the firm's capital structure as even a check on the internal consistency

of these diverse valuation methodologies. In contrast, the CCA approach to the

pricing of corporate liabilities and covenants begins With the firm's total

capital structure and uses a single evaluation technique to simultaneously

price each of the individual components of that structure. Thus, the CCA

methodology takes into account the interactive effects of each of the

securities on the prices of all the others and ensures a consistent evalua-

tion procedure for the entire capital structure.

III. Call Provisions and Call Protection

     JMR (1983, 1984) test the ability of a CCA model based on the option

pricing principles of Black and Scholes (1973) to predict the prices of

multiple issues of callable coupon debt subject to sinking funds. The test

not only accounted for all the debt covenants present but also recognized the

interactions among the different issues in multiple bond capital structures.

Data were collected for a total of 27 firms on a monthly basis from January

1975 through January 1981 when possible. The firms were selected according to

a number of criteria at the beginning of 1975:
                                   —10--



1.   Simple capital structure (i.e. one class of stock, no convertible bonds,

     small number of debt issues, no preferred stock).

2.   Small proportion of private debt to total capital.

3.   Small proportion of short term notes payable or capitalized leases

     to total capital.

4.   All publicly traded debt is rated.

     Based on these criteria the following firms were selected:

     CCA requires three kinds of data in order to solve for prices of

individual claims as functions of total firm value: (1) indenture data,

(2) business risk data, and (3) interest rate data. For example, the

following data were collected for each bond for each firm: principal,

coupon rate, call price schedule, call protection period, sinking fund

payments, seniority, and options to sink at market or par. The bond

covenant data were collected from Moody's Bond Guide, except that sinking

fund payments were collected from the monthly S&P Bond Guide. For purposes

of testing the model, actual bond prices were also collected from the latter

source. Business risk was estimated by measuring the volatility of the

firm's equity returns and adjusting these estimates in a manner consistent

with the CCA model and the observed leverage of the firm. Lastly, it was

assumed that the future course of the one year rate of interest is known

and is consistent with the one year forward interest rates implied by the

current term structure.

     Tables 1—3 summarize the results. Percentage error is defined as the

predicted price minus the actual price divided by the actual price.

Absolute percentage errors and results from a naive model are also reported.
                               —12—


The naive model essentially assumes that the value of the firm is sufficiently

large to make all debt riskiess. These results were obtained from the same

runs of the model that produced the CCA estimates. Thus the naive model

prices simply reflect the magnitude and timing of promised payments discount-

ed back by the risk free interest rates, plus the effects of the call provi-

sion and the sinking fund option to sink at the minimum of par or market.

Incrementally, the CCA model prices attempt to capture the risk of default

through the consideration of business risk, and financial risk, i.e. finite

firm value relative to promised payouts. In addition, the CCA model intro-

duces the distinction between senior and junior debt as well as the presence

of equity which complicates (relative to the naive model) the optimal call

policy.
     Table 1 presents the pricing errors for the CCA and the naive model.

Results are reported for investment grade (bond rating of BBB or higher) and

non—investment grade subsamples as well as the entire sample. As is evident

from inspection, the CCA and naive models are virtually indistinguishable

for investment grade bonds. This can be interpreted as evidence that default

risk is not playing a significant role in explaining investment grade bond

prices. This also suggests that a stochastic interest rate model could be

a better predictor of investment grade bond prices and therefore a better

predictor of the value of call provisions and call protection.   There do

appear to be significant differences between the CCA and naive models for

non—investment grade bonds where default risk is undoubtedly playing a

 large role.

      Tables 2 and 3, which present the results by firm and year respectively,

 suggest that the valuation errors could be firm and year specific. A firm
                               —13—


effect could be induced by a specific bond effect, i.e., the fact a specific

bond is underpriced in one year increases the probability it will be under—

priced in other years. A firm effect could also be induced by a systematic

bias in the estimate of the business risk of the firm, i.e., a systematic over-

estimate of business risk will lead to systematic underpricing of bonds for

that firm. A year effect could be induced by the nonstochastic interest rate

assumption. Table 3 suggests that the year effect is stronger for investment

grade bonds which is consistent with viewing interest rates as the major

source of uncertainty for this set of bonds.

     One of the reasons why the CCA model tested by JMR (1984) does not do a

better job of predicting callable debt prices is that the model uses the value

of the firm as the source of volatility, i.e. default risk. As practitioners

well understand, it has been the increased volatility of interest rates, not

firm value, which has contributed most substantially to the overall volatility

of the market. It is possible to recast the CCA model, following Cox, Ross,

Ingersoll (1984) such that the source of uncertainty driving the value of such

common debt covenants as call provisions and call protection is interest rate

risk not default risk. Tables 4 and 5 present some CCA numeric results for the

value of a call provision and call protection on a risk free bond in both a

rising and falling term structure environment. In both cases it is assumed

that the short term interest rate is 10% and the bond's maturity is 10 years.

In Table 4 the term structure is assumed to be falling, with long rates at the

6% level. When interest rates have low volatility, the CCA model computes the

coupon on the ten year par bond at 8.625%. The value of the particular call

provision considered, callable after 7 years at 100, is computed as 43.5 basis

points (906—862.5). One less year of call protection is shown to have no

value. When interest rates have high volatility, the CCA model computes the
                                    —14—



coupon on the ten year bond as 7.875% and the value of the call provision

as 87.5 basis points. One less year of call protection is calculated as

having the value of an additional 35 basis points.

    Table 5 shows the same calculations when the term structure is rising,

i.e. long rates at the 15% level, and the short rate at 10%. Here, logical-

ly enough, the value of the call provision and call protection is less

given the upward sloping term structure. In fact, for low volatility, the

CCA model shows these provisions to have no value. In the high volatility

case, while there is some reduction in value due to the rising term

structure, it is not significant. The value of the call provisions is

62 basis points and the value of one more year of call protection is 32

basis points. This underscores the relative importance of volatility versus

the shape of the term structure, i.e. expectations, in valuing call

provisions and call protection.

IV. Conclusion

    Increased capital market volatility has increased the value of any

financial flexibility built into the design of securities. The options

based CCA approach to valuing financial flexibility holds forth the

potential of not only valuing a wide range of covenants but also account-

ing for the interaction of various securities and covenants within a

capital structure. As is evident from the empirical work of JMR (1983,

1984) the application of CCA to complex capital structures is still in

the development stages. However, CCA techniques are being used to help

value individual covenants as demonstrated with the reported numeric

analysis of call provisions and call protection. In addition, CCA is
                                      —15—


being used to value such new forms of financial flexibility as debt with

warrants to purchase additional debt, puttable debt and extendible debt.

Various forms of equity linked debt, e.g. convertible debt, units of debt

with warrants, exchangeable debt and exchangeable units of debt with

warrants are also being valued using CCA techniques. While the cost of

using CCA is the fact that it is more complex than traditional valuation

techniques, the benefit is that CCA more correctly incorporates the role

of volatility in the valuation of financial flexibility. As markets

become more volatile and securities more complex, interest in correctly

valuing financial flexibility should also increase.
