                                             ABSTRACT

The War for Independence left the National Government deeply in debt. The spoils from winning
that war also gave it an empire of land. So, post-1783, was the National Government solvent? Was

its net asset position, land assets minus debt liabilities, positive or negative? Evidence is gathered

to answer this question by constructing a yearly time series of its net asset position, including time

series of the subcomponents of that position, from 1784 through 1802. The answer to this question

may help explain the constraints that determined why the National Debt was funded in the particular

way that it was. The results from the data series constructed indicate that the National Government

was solvent, had more than enough land assets to cover its debt liabilities, in this period but only if

it maintained the default on the Continental Dollar (its non-interest-bearing debt). To do this and not

ruin its creditworthiness it had to distinguish, legally and in the marketplace, between its interest-

bearing and its non-interest-bearing debt. It did this, in part, by only paying interest and no principal

on its debts and by curtailing direct swaps of land for debt.

                                       Introduction

       The U.S. National Government incurred significant debt during the War for

Independence (1775-1783). By 1790 almost nothing had been paid on this debt. The

National Government was in default and had been in default on the domestic portion of

its debt for over a decade. In 1790, under the auspices of the new Constitution adopted by

Congress in 1789, the National Government “un-defaulted” part of its domestic debt and

also assumed responsibility for the remaining war debts of the individual states, but only
               2
after a fashion. It funded the interest payments due on these debts only—intending for

the most part to pay nothing toward reducing the principal. In 1791 the face value of the

funded principal of the National Government’s debt totaled $77 million (Spanish silver

dollars). In 1802 the National Government was still $77 million in debt.

       Yet, by the mid-1790s the U.S. National Government—mired deeply in debt, with

no intention of paying down the principal of this debt any time soon, having failed to un-

default all its war debt, and having yet to garner a reputation for never missing an interest

payment on the portion of the debt it had un-defaulted in 1790—was still able somehow
                                                                                              2

to garner an excellent credit rating in Europe. John Steele Gordon (1998, p. 39) observed

that, “By 1794 it [the U.S. National Government] had the highest credit rating in Europe,

and some of its bonds were selling at 10 percent over par. Talleyrand, who later became

the French foreign minister, explained why. The United States bonds, he said, were ‘safe

and free from reverse. They have been funded in such a sound manner and the prosperity

of this country is growing so rapidly that there can be no doubt of their solvency’”

       How was this possible? Many scholars point to the plan for funding the National

Debt proposed in January of 1790 by the Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton,

as the explanation. This plan, adopted by Congress in August of 1790 with only minor

alterations, has even been called a financial revolution, a miracle and, by Hamilton, a

“national blessing.” (Syrett, 1962, v. 6, p. 106) How this plan instantly overcame all the

negatives mentioned above to the National Government’s credit record and why the plan

took the exact shape it did has remained somewhat enigmatically, or at best incompletely,

explained—being for some writers just what miracles are made of (Gordon, 1998).

       The literature on the National Debt frequently forgets the asset side of the ledger.

War can produce a mountain of debt, but the spoils from winning a war can also

produced a treasure chest of assets. Between 1784 and 1802 the U.S. National

Government acquired an empire of land—claims legally gained as the spoils of war in the

Treaty of Paris that granted the U.S. independence. While initially the individual states

claimed these lands based on old colonial grants and Indian treaties, one by one the states

from 1781 through 1802 ceded their claims to the National Government. By 1802 the

U.S. National Government had been ceded 222 million acres of land between the current

borders of the original 13 states and the Mississippi River. The states considered that the
                                                                                               3

lands they had ceded to the National Government were to be used for the common benefit

of all U.S. citizens. In particular, the lands were to be used to payoff or provide the

security that would back up the war debt incurred to gain independence.

       So—did winning the War for Independence leave the U.S. National Government

in a net positive or a net negative asset position? Were its land assets sufficient to cover

or provide security for its debt liabilities? In other words, was the National Government

solvent? If it was solvent, then its excellent credit rating may have had more to do with
                                                                             3
the spoils of war—land backed debt—than with Hamilton’s funding plan. If it was

insolvent, then maybe Hamilton and Congress really did work miracles in 1790.

       The task here is to answer this question by estimating the net asset position of the

U.S. National Government including its subcomponents in both real and nominal terms

from 1784 through 1802. The starting point is determined by the Treaty of Paris (late

1783) that recognized the U.S. as an independent sovereign entity. Without sovereign

recognition, the debts incurred and lands claimed prior to 1784 lacked legitimacy. The

end point of 1802 was chosen because it was when the last of the lands granted under the

Treaty of Paris and claimed by one the original 13 states (Georgia) was finally ceded to

the U.S. National Government. Using 1802 as the end point also carries the estimate

through the administrations of the “High Federalists” (Washington and Adams) covering

the financial revolution most closely identified with Alexander Hamilton. In 1803 the

Jefferson administration changed the net asset position of the nation with the Louisiana

Purchase—complicating the calculation and altering the inferences that might be drawn.

       By estimating the government’s net asset position in this period new perspectives

are gained on why the financial revolution took the exact shape that it did and on how the
                                                                                             4

U.S. could have achieved an excellent credit rating in Europe despite being a new country

with a new government and a checkered history of debt default. In particular, why did the

U.S. National Government in 1790 chose to un-default its interest-bearing debt but not its

non-interest bearing debt? Why did it or how could it un-default the interest-bearing debt

at face value rather than at market value? How could it responsibly assume the remaining

war debts of the states? Finally, why did it turn its interest-bearing debt into callable

perpetuities—making full and regular interest payments but exempting itself from ever

paying down the principal unless it so exercised its option to pay it down?

        Before the net asset position is estimated and these questions answered, a model is

developed to show that the government’s asset position matters to its creditworthiness,

and evidence is offered to show that contemporaries viewed land assets as backing the

National Debt, i.e. viewed the public domain and the National Debt as inexorably linked.

  Do Government Assets Matter? A Budget Constraint Model of Creditworthiness

        The government’s budget constraint connects its cash flows to its capital stocks.

In particular, the government’s yearly tax revenue (Ti) minus its yearly expenditures (Gi)

must equal the change in its stock of net capital assets (Ai - Di), where A are salable

capital assets—e.g. inventories of specie and land, and D are the face value of its debt

liabilities—principally callable perpetuities with the principal payable only at the
                                                                            4
government’s discretion and old fiat currency for the U.S. in this period.

Ti [(t * Ii)   + O i]   - Gi [((1 – ki)*Rg*Di)   + Ei]    = ∆(Ai - Di)

        For the U.S. National Government in this period the principal tax revenue came

from a tariff (t) on current imports (Ii), with Oi representing all other current-year tax

revenues, such as from the whiskey tax. Yearly expenditures comprise the interest the
                                                                                                 5

National Government owes on the face value of its current stock of interest-bearing debt

(Rg * Di) that it does not default on (1 - ki), where ki is the default rate (0 ≤ ki ≤ 1), with Ei

representing all other current-year expenditures, such as military expenditures.

        When the government has a budget surplus [Ti – Gi > 0] it has excess revenue

and, assuming that it is not in default on its interest payments (i.e. that ki = 0), it must

either increase its stock of assets [Ai + 1 > Ai] and/or pay down and retire some of the

principal on its debt [Di + 1 < Di]. When the government has a budget deficit [Ti – Gi < 0]

then the shortfall in revenue must be covered either by selling some assets [Ai + 1 < Ai]

and/or borrowing more [Di + 1 > Di] and/or increasing its default on its interest payments

(ki + 1 > ki). If an important goal of the government is to protect its creditworthiness by

keeping ki = 0, then increasing k is not an option but a last resort. If the government has

no assets (A) then it has to increase its debt liabilities (D). However, increasing D via

interest-bearing liabilities raises G in the future [(Rg * Di + 1) > (Rg * Di )] which puts

increased pressure on the budget to stay in deficit [Ti + 1 – Gi + 1 < 0] particularly given

that in this period the U.S. National Government’s ability to raise taxes in the near future

was tightly constrained, i.e. it is likely that Ti + n = Ti. This scenario puts the government

in an unsustainable long-run position and so puts increasing pressure on the government

to increase k, i.e. to default in the near future (Taylor, 1950, p. 5). It also puts the

government in a position where the likelihood of it being able to pay down or retire any

of the principal of D at face value in the near future is greatly reduced. This in turn makes

potential lenders reluctant to contract with the government in the near future.

        This last scenario fits the United States in the late 1780s as James Madison

explained it to Thomas Jefferson on October 24, 1787,
                                                                                                6

        Such is the state & prospect of our fiscal department that any new loan however
        small, that should now be made, would probably subject us to the reproach of
        premeditated deception. The balance of Mr. Adams’ last loan will be wanted for
        the interest due in Holland, and with all the income here, will, it is feared, not
        save our credit in Europe from further wounds. It may well be doubted whether
        the present Govt. can be kept alive thro’ the ensuing year, or untill the new one
        may take its place. (Rutland, 1977, v. 10, p. 218; Swanson, 1963, p. 36)

        As such, the government’s net asset position (Ai – Di) should be an important

factor in assessing its creditworthiness. It represents a safety valve that could potentially

relieve the pressure to default when the budget would unexpectedly fall into deficit, as

well as provide a potential resource to draw on if the government’s ability to pay off or

retire D at face value became a concern to potential lenders. It is important to note that it

is not the actual current revenue or contemporaneous cash flow from the sale of A that

matters to assessing the government’s creditworthiness but A’s potential salability to

cover or back the government’s current and future debt position that matters.

        The government’s budget constraint can be transformed into a model of its

creditworthiness. The government’s relatively poor credit rating compared with the

market is measured as the risk spread between the interest rate the government is charged

(Rg) and the rate in the marketplace on low risk loans (Rm). This risk spread is a positive

function of the government’s reputation failure, i.e. its record of not paying interest on its

debt—how close k is to 1—as a weighted average (a) over the recent past; a negative

function of the government’s expected budget surpluses (Ex[Ti + n – Gi + n]); and a

negative function of the government’s net asset position (Ai – Di).
                                                                    i-n
(Rg - Rm) = f [(Ai – Di); Ex(Ti+n - Gi+n);                   i=1∑     (ai*ki)]

[Where i=1∑i-n(ai) = 1; (Rg - Rm ≥ 0); and n = a number of years looking into the future

(i + n) or into the past (i - n)].
                                                                                              7

       Between 1781 and 1790 the U.S. National Government made next to no interest

or principal payments on the domestic portion of its debt (Taylor, 1950, p. 2). In effect,

k = 1 over the recent past so that even when the government started paying interest in full

(k = 0) after 1790, its reputation for paying the interest on its debt would not fully recover

until well after 1790. Expected budget surpluses did not look promising even after

1790—even after the new constitution gave the National Government an independent

power to levy taxes. The government’s revenue expectations were in doubt given its

inability to prevent smuggling and enforce tariff (t) payments; in doubt given fluctuations

in tariff revenues (the main source of tax revenue) due to ubiquitous fluctuations in

foreign trade (Ii) caused in part by uncertainty in trade treaty negotiations; and in doubt

given questions about the government’s ability to raise other taxes (Oi) considering the

public’s willingness to engage in violent large-scale tax revolts, e.g. Shay’s Rebellion
                                                                       5
1786-1787, the Whiskey Rebellion 1794, and Fries’ Rebellion 1798.

       As such, the net asset position of the U.S. National Government may have been

especially important in this period to establishing and then sustaining its creditworthiness.

A positive net asset position would have been viewed as a potential safety valve to the

pressure of increasing k to balance unexpected budget shortfalls in a world where the

government’s reputation and yearly tax revenue capacity were still in doubt.

      Were Land Assets Viewed as Backing the National Government’s Debt?

       The linkage of land to public finance was deeply rooted in the American

experience. Colonial governments formed land banks where a subject’s land served as

collateral or security for loans of government paper money. A colony’s paper bills of

credit were understood as being backed by the mortgaged land assets of the colony
                                                                                            8

(Kemmerer, 1939; Newell, 1998, pp. 215-229; Perkins, 1994, pp. 44-46; Ratchford, 1941,

pp. 10-12, 18, 21-22). Similarly, states made use of land to back and pay off their

Revolutionary War debts. And in the state cessions of lands to the National Government,

some states retained “reserve” lands for paying soldiers and war debts, e.g. Virginia and

Connecticut held on to sizable chunks of Ohio as their “western and military reserve”

lands. Land being used to back public debt was not a strange concept—it was a first and

obvious consideration of people in this era (Behrens, 1923, pp. 69-77; Donaldson, 1884,

pp. 82-85; Gates, 1968, p. 62; Hibbard, 1939, pp. 10-14, 53; and Figure 1 below).

       In the early Congressional debates over western lands ceded to the National

Government, using said lands to back or pay off the national war debt was a prominent

theme (Donaldson, 1884, pp. 60-81; Gates, 1968, p. 61). In 1779 congressmen from

Delaware and Maryland asserted that the western territories were “gained from the King

of Great Britain, or the native Indians, by the blood and treasure of all, and ought

therefore to be a common estate, to be granted out on terms beneficial to the United

States.” (Donaldson, 1884, pp. 61-62) In 1780 congressmen from New York asserted

that the, “…uncultivated territory within the limits or claims of certain States ought to be

appropriated as a common fund for the expenses of the war…” (Donaldson, 1884, p. 63)

Later in 1780, Congress resolved that all lands so ceded by the states to the National

Government “shall be disposed of for the common benefit of the United States…”

(Donaldson, 1884, p. 64) The obvious common benefit was to service the National Debt.

       After 1780, Congress continually linked its land assets with the National Debt

(Gates, 1968, pp. 61-62, 124; footnote 8 below). A Congressional Committee, reporting

on September 5, 1782, favored “ceding of the western lands, to be sold to ‘discharge the
                                                                                                  9

national debt.’” (Hibbard, 1939, p. 33) The Ordinance of 1784 pledged that the proceeds

of the sale of public land now belonging or which may belong to the United States were

to be used solely to pay off the National Debt until said debts were fully satisfied

(Hibbard, 1939, pp. 4-5). A report to Congress in 1786 stated, “The whole product [from

sales of western lands]…is appropriated for the payment of the principal and interest of

the national debt, and no part thereof can be diverted to other purposes.” (Syrett, 1962, v.
            6
5, p. 63)       Finally, the August 4, 1790 Funding Act (United States Congress, Register of

Debates in Congress (House of Representatives), v. 2, p. 2311) stated,

        That the proceeds of the sales which shall be made of lands in the western
        territory, now belonging, or that may hereafter belong, to the united states, shall
        be, and are hereby appropriated towards sinking or discharging the debts, for the
        payment whereof the United States now are, by virtue of this act may be, holden,
        and shall be applied solely to that use, until the said debts shall be fully satisfied.

        Financiers, those involved in high finance as well as those involved in public

finance, also understood the importance of a pledge of security by the government to the

backing of its debts and to the fostering of confidence in its debt position. For example,

William Bingham, a director of the Bank of North America, in a letter to Alexander

Hamilton, U.S. Treasury Secretary, on November 25, 1789 explained,

        The Credit of the Funds [the National Debt] must essentially depend on the
        permanent Nature of the Security; & if that is not to be relied on, they will fall in
        value, the disadvantage of which, Government will experience by the payment of
        an exorbitant Interest, whenever it is compelled to anticipate its revenues, by the
        Negotiation of domestic Loans. … If we offer a less Substantial Security, we must
        Submit to a consequent Depreciation in the Value of our Funds…. A Government
        should therefore pledge every security it can offer, to engage the Confidence of
        the public Creditors, which, if once impaired, the pernicious Effects can be felt in
        all its future Dealings. (Syrett, 1962, v. 5, pp. 540-541)

Bingham’s reference to “security” of a “permanent nature” would seem to mean

government capital assets. And the only capital assets the government possessed at this
                                                                                         10

                                                         7
time in any substantial quantities were its western lands.

       Along a similar vein, Hamilton in July of 1782 wrote, “The disposal of the

unlocated lands will hereafter be a valuable source of revenue, and an immediate one of

credit.” (Syrett, 1961, v. 3, p. 105—italic added) In a letter to Nathaniel Chipman, July

22, 1788, dealing with how the National Debt might affect Vermont tax-wise if it joined

the union, Hamilton said, “The public debt, as far as it can prudently be provided for, will

be by the Western lands and the appropriation of some general fund.” (Syrett, 1962, v. 5,

p. 186) And in his January 1790 “Report on Public Credit” Hamilton said,

       It is presumable, that no country will be able to borrow of foreigners upon better
       terms, than the United States, because none can, perhaps, afford so good security.
       Our situation exposes us less, than that of any other nation, to those casualties,
       which are the chief causes of expense; our incumbrances, in proportion to our real
       means, are less, though these cannot immediately be brought so readily into
       action, and our progress in resources from the early state of the country, and the
       immense tracts of unsettled territory, must necessarily exceed that of any other.
       The advantages of this situation have already engaged the attention of the
       European money-lenders… (Syrett, 1962, v. 6, p. 89)

       Lastly, many schemes to swap land for debt in large amounts were planned in the

years leading up to the 1790 Funding Act. Some failed to be executed and some were

executed—though not all with success. For example, in 1787 the Ohio Company offered

to purchase 1.5 million acres and the Scioto Company another 5 million acres of the

public domain. In 1788 Judge John Cleves Symmes made a similar offer for 2 million

acres between the Great and Little Miami Rivers (Donaldson, 1884, p. 17, Gates, 1968,

pp. 70-71; Hibbard, 1938, pp. 44-55; Robbins, 1942, pp. 10-11).

       The Founding Fathers were aware of these possibilities. Edward Carrington wrote

to Thomas Jefferson on October 23, 1787, in reference to the schemes just mentioned,

       This mode of sale will relieve the U.S. of much expense, and the progress of the
       sales promise to be sufficiently rapid to give our people early relief from the
                                                                                            11

       pressure of the domestic debt. I am inclined to believe that some successful
       experiment might be made for the sale [of] a part of the territory in Europe, and
       have suggested a trial with a few Ranges of the surveyed Townships. (Boyd,
       1955, v. 12, pp. 256-257)

And James Madison writing to Jefferson on October 24, 1787 reiterated the same

information about potentially large land sales (Rutland, 1977, v. 10, p. 218).

       William Findley, congressman from Pennsylvania, claimed that proposals for

large sales of the public domain were still being made by 1790, but were being ignored

by Hamilton. Findley said,

       Flint and Parker had agreed to purchase three millions of acres. To the second
       session of the New Congress, Scriba made proposals for four or five millions.
       And Hannibal William Dobbyne proposed to take more than all the others, and to
       settle it with people from Ireland. These proposals were referred to the secretary
       of the treasury [Hamilton], while he was privately preparing the funding system:
       but he never reported on them….If the proposals of Messrs. Parker, Dobbyne, and
       others, which were offered before the funding system was originated, had been
       accepted, it is a moderate computation to suppose that fifteen millions of dollars
       would have been redeemed. (Taylor, 1950, p. 62)

He guessed that such schemes might reduce the debt to $6 million.

       Hamilton himself in his 1790 “Report on Public Credit” proposed one plan

(perhaps disingenuously, see below) whereby a full third of the National Debt would be

extinguished by swapping it for land—“The inducement to the measure [this particular

plans] is, the payment of one third of the debt in land.” (Syrett, 1962, v. 6, pp. 91-92)

       The point here is that contemporaries believed the National Government had

pledged the public domain, and had the potential to sell large chunks of it if necessary, to
                                      8
cover and service the National Debt. But was there enough land to cover the National

Debt or was the debt just too big?

                              The National Debt, 1784-1802

       Several issues need to be addressed in the construction of a yearly time series for
                                                                                             12

the U.S. National Debt during this period. First, even if the National Government’s

liabilities are confined just to its interest-bearing debt, yearly evidence on this exists only

after 1790. From 1784 through 1790, these numbers must be estimated. Second, given

that prices fluctuated greatly over this period (Bezanson, 1936, p.392; Cole, 1938, pp.

120-156; Grubb, 2003, pp. 1782-1783), inflation-adjusted debt exposure should be

considered along side the nominal debt exposure. Third, in order to have a consistent time

series for evaluation, some estimate of state debts pre-assumption (pre-1791) should be

incorporated as the expected state debts to be assumed by the National Government.

Fourth, the non-interest-bearing debt, the Continental Dollar, should be considered and

incorporated in some way. The literature typically glosses over the non-interest-bearing

debt—either not counting it at all or simply noting that it was worthless, defaulted on, or

paid off at 100 to 1 without explaining the ramifications of this or why this debt could be
                                                   9
treated differently than the interest-bearing debt.

       What is estimated here is the face value, and not the market value or the default

value, of the National Debt. This is because the key question addressed is whether the

National Government was financially solvent net asset-wise given the face value of its

debt. In other words, could it honor the financial obligation clause in the new

Constitution? Written in 1787, ratified by the states, and adopted by Congress by 1789,

this new U.S. Constitution said, “All Debts contracted and Engagements entered into

before the Adoption of the Constitution, shall be as valid against the United States under

this Constitution, as under the Confederation.” (Article VI).

       From 1781 through 1790 the National Government had been in default on both its

interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing domestic debt (Taylor, 1950, p. 2). These debts
                                                                                           13

traded in the marketplace at far below their face value and some citizens held them as

speculative investments hoping for the day when better economic times and stronger

political will would honor these debts at face value. The new Constitution, not only due

to the above clause but due to the enhanced taxing power given the Federal Government,

gave renewed hope that these debts would be un-defaulted and paid off at face value.

       The winning arguments put forward by the “Federalist” for funding the interest-

bearing debt at face value in 1790 were both that the new U.S. Constitution obligated the

Federal Government to honor its prior obligations as originally contracted, i.e. honor the

face value, and that it was absolutely necessary for reestablishing the creditworthiness of

the government. But these arguments would appear to hold equally well for paying off

the Continental Dollar at face value. As in the colonial period, bills of credit such as

Continental Dollars were non-interest-bearing contracts for payment which the issuing

government had originally agreed to accept at face value for payment of the taxes it

levied, effectively redeeming them at face value for public liabilities (taxes).

       Printed on Continental Dollars were statements such as the following printed on

the $80 note: “The Bearer is entitled to receive EIGHTY Spanish milled DOLLARS, or

an equal Sum in Gold or Silver according to a Resolution of Congress of the 14th January,

1779” (Newman, 1997, pp. 59-68). The only difference in contractual obligation between

Continental Dollars and other government debts was the non-payment of interest to

holders of Continental Dollars. As such, the face value of the outstanding Continental

Dollars, and not their market or default value, should be considered when assessing

whether the National Government had the ability to un-default this debt circa 1790. This

comparison may help explain the financial constraints that led Hamilton and Congress to
                                                                                           14

reaffirm the government’s default on the Continental Dollar while at the same time un-

defaulting its interest-bearing debt.

       Table 1 presents yearly estimates of the face value of the National Government’s

liabilities from 1784 to 1802, separately for the interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing

debt in both nominal and real values, as well as incorporating the “expected” [in

brackets] assumption of state war debts before 1791 and the actual assumption of state

war debts after 1790.

                                    [Place Table 1 Here]

a. Estimating the Face Value of the Interest-Bearing Debt

       For the interest-bearing debt, the data for 1791-1802 are the official government

statistics taken from the Historical Statistics (1975, part 2, p. 1104). For 1784-1790 these

numbers are estimated as follows: $27 million of principal at 6 percent annual interest is

taken as the National Government’s starting domestic debt in 1782 (Perkins, 1994, p.

213; Swanson, 1963, p. 48). No interest or principal was paid on this debt through 1790

so that $27 million grew each year until reaching just over $43 million in 1790 (Taylor,

1950, p. 2). This algorithm yields an estimate for the domestic portion of the National

Debt in 1789 of $40,598,017. This estimate closely matches the estimate of $40,414,086

reported by Hamilton for 1789 (Taylor, 1950, p. 1; Syrett, 1962, v. 6, p. 86).

       To this number each year is added $11,710,379 of foreign debt owed by the

National Government (Taylor, 1950, p. 1; Syrett, 1962, v. 6, pp. 85-86). Interest had been

paid on this debt for the most part, but no principal (Perkins, 1994, p. 213). To this

number each year is also added an estimate of $20,000,000 of expected assumption of

state debts [reported in brackets underneath each number] (Taylor, 1950, pp. 1, 4;
                                                                                            15

Perkins, 1994, p. 215; Trotter, 1968, p. 372; United States Congress, Register of Debates

in Congress (House of Representatives), v. 2, p. 1586 (April 21, 1790)). This estimation

algorithm grafts onto and hits the starting value for the official statistics (the 1791 value)
                    10
almost on the nose.

b. Face Value of the Continental Dollars Still Outstanding from 1784 to 1790

       The total amount of Continental Dollars emitted by the National Government, the

total amount withdrawn, and the time series of the outstanding balances are not exactly

known. A variety of estimates are offered in the literature. For example, in the modern

published literature the total amount reported as emitted from 1775 (the first) through

1779 (the last) ranges from $204 to $241.5 million (e.g. see Calomiris, 1988, p. 58;

Ferguson, 1961, p. 67; Michener, 1988, p. 690; Newman, 1997, pp. 58-69; Perkins, 1994,

p. 103; Ratchford, 1941, p. 37; Swanson, 1963, p. 36). These estimates are in turn derived

from estimates ranging from $191.5 to $241.5 million found in the older authoritative

literature (e.g. see Bullock, 1895, p. 135; Elliot, 1843-44, p. 8; Harlow, 1929, pp. 50-51).

       The differences across these estimates are reconciled in Appendix Table A1.

Some estimates suffer from errors of addition and some from errors of omission. But the

major point of discrepancy comes from the amount of the $50 million emission of

January 14, 1779 that was exchanged for prior emissions (as instructed in the authorizing

legislation) and how much leaked out as a net new emission. Lacking direct evidence,

guesses in the literature vary widely, see Appendix Table A1.

       The one hard data point for the total amount of Continental Dollars outstanding at

a specific moment in time offered by Congress was on September 2, 1779 when it said

there was $159,948,880 outstanding on that date (Bullock, 1895, p. 136; Elliot, 1843-44,
                                                                                               16

p. 8). The discrepancy between that number and the totals reported across the literature to

that date were used to adjust the guesses across the literature about how much of the

January 14, 1779 emission should be counted as new. When the addition and omission

errors and the discrepancy just described are corrected across the literature, the result is a

single consistent estimate of $200,000,000 Continental Dollars emitted from 1775
                                                                          11
through 1779 and still outstanding as of 1780, see Appendix Table A1.          Taxes to pull

these Continental Dollars out of circulation were not initiated in earnest until after 1780

(Ratchford, 1941, pp. 32-33, 37-38; and Appendix Table 2A).

       With the requisition act of March 18, 1780, Congress defaulted on the Continental

Dollar—no longer accepting it at face value but only at a rate of 40 Continental Dollars to

1 dollar in specie for payments of taxes and requisitions. While Continental Dollars

traded at an even greater discount in the marketplace, the 40 to 1 rate remained that at

which the National Government credited states for the payment of taxes to it from 1780

through 1789 (Boyd, 1953, v. 7, pp. 221-223; Bullock, 1895, pp. 136-138).

       The amount of Continental Dollars (in face value) taxed out of circulation,

remitted to the U.S. Treasury and burned between 1780 and 1790 under this policy is

seldom discussed. Yet U.S. Treasury records report these amounts for 1780 through 1789

(Elliot, 1843-44, pp. 73-76). These numbers, slightly rearranged, are reproduced in

Appendix Table A2. These sums, totaling $119.5 million, are subtracted from the $200

million of total emissions as of 1780 to get the time series reported in Table 1 of the face

value of Continental Dollars still outstanding and unredeemed from 1784 through 1790.

       Using this estimation algorithm leaves $80.5 million Continental Dollars still

outstanding and unredeemed in 1790, which is close to Congress’ guess of $78 to $80
                                                                                           17

million still unredeemed and unfunded in 1791 (Elliot, 1843-44, p. 12, item #3), and

close to Hamilton’s implied estimate for 1789 (see footnote 10 above). Congress’ guess

of how many Continental Dollars were exchanged for bonds at the 100 to 1 default rate

set after 1790 (by the 1790 Funding Act) was $6 million (face value), leaving something

around $72 to $74 million (face value) as a total loss, i.e. never funded or redeemed
                                     12
(Elliot, 1843-44, p. 12, item #4).

       Apparently the requisition act of March 18, 1780 that set the default rate at 40 to 1

Continental Dollars to specie dollars in the payment of taxes led some citizens to hold on

to Continental Dollars instead of using them to pay taxes, speculating that better days or a

new political regime would un-default the Continental Dollar and redeem them at face

value. For example, in 1784 one foreign observer noted in reference to the Continental

Dollar, “At present there are many private Gentlemen holding large sums of Paper

money, that is to be called in. But when this will happen, at what rate it will be redeemed,

congress do not yet agree upon.” (Boyd, 1953, v. 7, p. 213) As such, even by 1790, 40

percent of the Continental Dollars were still outstanding (Bullock, 1895, p. 138). The

same motive led people to purchase and hold the interest-bearing debt, even though no

interest had been paid for a number of years and it traded at 20 cents on the dollar in the

marketplace. They were speculating that better days or a new political regime would un-

default the interest-bearing debt and redeem it at face value.

       Under the Funding Act of August 4, 1790, Hamilton and Congress thrilled the

speculators in the interest-bearing debt by making interest payments on this debt’s face

value to the current holders of the debt. They, however, disappointed the speculators in

Continental Dollars by not only not un-defaulting the Continental Dollar but by
                                                                                           18

increasing the default rate under which the National Government would accept

Continental Dollars to 100 Continental Dollars for 1 dollar in interest-bearing bonds

(Taylor, 1950, p. 62). Only $6 million, of the $80 million, Continental Dollars still

outstanding in 1790 were so exchanged at that default rate between 1791 and 1797—

when the exchange program was discontinued (Elliot, 1843-44, p. 12; Newman, 1997, p.

69). “The rest [$74 million] seems to have remained in the hands of people who held it

after the time fixed by the funding act, hoping that ultimately the notes would be

redeemed in full.” (Bullock, 1895, p. 138) After 1797, however, they would be

disappointed and nothing would be received—a total loss for those still holding these

non-interest-bearing debt claims on the National Government.

                       Deflation, Inflation, and the National Debt

a. Deflation and the Interest-Bearing Debt 1784-1790:

       Before 1790 and the Hamilton funding plan, the nominal interest-bearing debt

grew mostly from non-payment of interest on the domestic portion of that debt. The real

interest-bearing debt also grew due to deflation. From 1784 through 1789 the combined

National and state interest-bearing debt grew by $10.3 million in nominal value and

$25.8 million in real value. In other words, the growth in the real debt was due 40 percent

to accumulating interest arrears and 60 percent to deflation. Thus, in the half decade

leading into the formulation of Hamilton’s funding plan in 1790, deflation may have been

a bigger concern than interest arrears in assessing the National Government’s ability to

pay this interest-bearing debt. In real terms the interest-bearing debt peaked in 1789-

1792, just as the funding plan was being formulated and enacted.

       Why did the Hamilton funding plan restructure the interest-bearing debt into
                                                                                               19

callable perpetuities? Perhaps the rapid rise in the real value of the interest-bearing debt

over the prior half-decade constrained Hamilton’s choices. The smallest cash flow needed

out of new taxes (the Hamiltonian tariff) to support the interest-bearing debt so it would

trade at face value would result from turning this debt into perpetuities (Swanson, 1963,
       13
p. 50).     The result of this expedient, however, was that it tied up the Federal budget

with about 30 percent of annual revenues having to go to interest payments on the debt.

At the end of the Adams administration the Federal Government was even led to borrow

long-term to cover short-term liabilities—an unsustainable position (Taylor, 1950, p. 7).

While the Federal Government met its interest payments throughout 1791-1802, whether

it always could from current tax revenues was less than certain.

          If this is the only explanation of the debt-funding method Hamilton favored, it

does little to flatter him, for while it did fund the interest-bearing debt, it also tied up the

Federal budget thus leaving the government in a precarious fiscal state over the next

decade. It also makes his effort to dissuade Congress from swapping land for debt look

fiscally irresponsible. Was there some other hidden, clever, or sinister reason afoot?

b. Inflation and the Interest-Bearing Debt 1791-1802:

          Between 1789-1791 and 1795-1802 prices rose about 50 percent. This was a

permanent price rise—at least through 1818 (Bezanson, 1936, p. 392). Between 1792 and

1801, while the nominal value of the interest-bearing debt changed little, inflation

reduced its real value by about 31 percent (see Table 1). Were the Federalist and

Hamilton just lucky, or was there a causal link to Hamilton’s funding plan? Did Hamilton

intend to inflate his way out of a significant portion of the Federal debt? At least within

Hamiltonian rhetoric it seems hard not to conclude that he may have so intended.
                                                                                          20

        Hamilton clearly understood the quantity theory of money, or at least a naïve
             14
version of it.    Money scarcity causes price deflation and when money is pumped into

the economy, price inflation results. In his “Report on Public Credit” Hamilton wrote,

        The value of cultivated lands, in most states, has fallen since the revolution from
        25 to 50 per cent. … This decrease, in the value of lands, ought, in a great
        measure, to be attributed to the scarcity of money. Consequently whatever
        produces an augmentation of the monied capital of the country, must have a
                                                                               15
        proportional effect in raising that value. (Syrett, 1962, v. 6, p. 72)

Later in 1790 he also wrote,

        The stamping of paper [emission of paper money] is an operation so much easier
        than the laying of taxes, that a government, in the practice of paper emissions,
        would rarely fail in any such emergency to indulge itself too far… If it should not
        even be carried so far as to be rendered an absolute bubble, it would at least be
        likely to be extended to a degree, which would occasion an inflated and artificial
        state of things… (Syrett, 1963, v. 7, p. 322)

        Hamilton also argued that the interest-bearing debt when funded by his plan

would turn this debt into paper money, meaning a circulating medium of exchange and

not just bank vault assets. In the January 1790 “Report on Public Credit” Hamilton wrote,

        [When]…the national debt is properly funded, and an object of established
        confidence, it answers most of the purposes of money. Transfers of stock or
        public debt are there equivalent to payments in specie; or in other words, stock, in
        the principal transactions of business, passes current as specie. …[T]he public
        debt, by a provision for it on true principles, shall be rendered a substitute for
        money… (Syrett, 1962, v. 6, pp. 70-71)

        The debt would become “asset” money, basically paper contract claims to a

stream of Federal tariff revenues in the form of yearly interest payments in specie or

banknotes. Thus, by Hamilton’s own rhetoric, he was dumping about $52 million of new
                                                   16
cash into the domestic economy circa 1790-1792.         This was a lot of money. The

population of the U.S. in 1790 was about four million (Historical Statistics of the United

States, 1975, part 1, p. 8, Series A 6-8), which would imply about a $13 per capita
                                                                                           21

injection of money into the economy as a result of Hamilton’s funding plan. By contrast,

the total volume of money in the U.S. in 1790 (pre-Hamilton funding plan) was only

about $3 per capita (Hepburn, 1967, p. 87). Thus Hamilton’s plan would lead to about a

five fold increase in the domestic money supply.

       However, being a near substitute to specie some of this money leaked out of the

country—just as specie coins had from 1783 through 1789 due to the imbalance in

foreign trade—via foreign purchases and ownership of the Federal debt (or effectual

ownership of the stream of specie it commanded via debt-leverage over American

importers of foreign goods). In addition, how much of the Federal debt actually served as

investment assets and how much as circulating currency, i.e. what its velocity of

circulation was, is unknown. And how much might have been absorbed through an

increase in the monetization of transactions in the economy is also unknown (Grubb,

2005, p. 1343). Thus, the true monetary expansion would be less than five fold.

       As such, the permanent price rise of around 50 percent that followed over the next

few years, peaking in 1796, would seem to be an obvious and likely result of this
                                                                     17
Hamiltonian monetary injection—following Hamilton’s own logic.            And given

Hamilton’s statement (above) over proportionality of money increases to prices increases,

Hamilton may have expected much more than a 50 percent price rise—something more

in the range of a 400 percent price rise which would have reduced the real value of the

Federal debt by a far greater amount between 1792 and 1801 than the 31 percent that was

actually experienced—maybe more in the range of an 80 percent reduction.

       This evidence and line of logical deduction turns the monetary rhetoric of the

early Republic, as typically pontificated in the literature, on its head. Supposedly the
                                                                                                22

Federalists argued that those who wanted states to issue paper money were simply

debtors out to defraud their creditors by causing inflation so they could pay back their

nominal debts in depreciated money—lowering the real value of their debts. The

Federalist used this argument effectively to constitutionally take monetary powers away

from state and national legislatures in 1787 (Grubb, 2003, 2006). Yet by Hamilton’s own

rhetorical logic, he had done just that, namely inflate his way out of debt. By Hamilton’s

own words and logic, he clearly advocated inflating the economy and so should not be

viewed as a conservative on monetary issues but instead as an arch monetary activist and
                                                                                         18
inflationist, or perhaps “re-inflationist,” in his role as the Secretary of the Treasury.

        If this is the true explanation of the debt-funding method Hamilton favored, it

does little to flatter him for it turns him into a premeditated inflationist—taking actions

that by his own words and logic could have brought back hyper-inflation and wrecked the

economy. Or was Hamilton’s rhetoric here just that—rhetoric designed only to persuade

those who desired more specie-linked money in the economy into supporting the debt-

funding plan he favored? Was there some other clever and deeply hidden reason afoot?

                  The National Government’s Land Assets, 1784-1802

        Even if the primary asset of the National Government is taken to be the public

domain, estimating the amount of acres the National Government possessed and their
                                                             19
value year by year over this period is not straightforward.       First, the cession of lands

from the states to the National Government did not occur all at once, but at different

times by different states from 1781 through 1802. In addition, some state land claims

overlapped with other states, and some land had already been alienated before being

ceded or was conditionally retained by the ceding state, see Figure 1 and the notes to
                                                                                           23

Table 2. The evidence in the original sources is not organized as a net transfer of land

year by year to the National Government. As such, the evidence has to be resorted and

closely interpreted to estimate the net saleable land possessed by the National

Government year by year over this period, see Table 2.

                                   [Place Figure 1 Here]

                                    [Place Table 2 here]

       By 1787, of the 222 million acres that would be ceded by the states to the

National Government, roughly 75 percent had been so ceded. The remaining 25 percent

would not be ceded until 1802 (by Georgia). The National Government also sold a small

portion of the public domain between 1784 and 1802. These transfers are identified by

year of sale and subtracted from the total remaining available for sale. The public

domain, net of sales, that was still in the possession of the National Government and

potentially saleable was 106 million acres when the Treaty of Paris recognized U.S.

sovereignty in 1784. It grew to 164 million acres by 1787, the year the Founding Fathers

crafted a new U.S. Constitution. It more or less stayed at that level until 1802 when it

grew to 220 million acres with the completion of the land cession by Georgia.

       The difficult issue is how to assign a value to these land assets for the purpose of

calculating a net asset position. Several approximations will be used. First, given that the

true average price per acre of the public domain is unknown, the data in Tables 1 and 2

are used to back out what the average price would have to be for the National

Government to be just solvent. This first approximation is reported in Table 3.

                                   [Place Table 3 Here]

       Looking just at the interest-bearing debt [including the assumption of state debts],
                                                                                           24

if the average price per acre of the public domain was $0.50, then between 1785 and 1802

the National Government was solvent in terms of having assets equal to or in excess of

the value of its debt. By 1802 this price would only have to be $0.35 per acre. As argued

below, this price looks within the likely range of what the true average was.

       By contrast, looking at the total interest-bearing plus non-interest-bearing debt

[including the assumption of state debts], if the average price of the public domain was

between $0.93 and $1.02 an acre, then between 1786 and 1790 the National Government

would just be solvent. If the expected assumption of state debts are excluded then this

number would be between $0.81 and $0.89. As argued below, both these sets of prices

appear on the high side of the likely range of what the true average was.

       Thus, as a first approximation, the National Government would appear to be

solvent only if the non-interest-bearing debt—the Continental Dollar—is eliminated, such

as through Congress’ 1790 reaffirmation of its absolute unwillingness to un-default it.

The inclusion or exclusion of the expected assumption of state debts between 1784 and

1791 does not matter much. The National Government appears solvent in either case. The

key to solvency was writing the non-interest-bearing debt off the ledger.

       Table 4 refines this first approximation by using average prices per acre of the

public domain that were actually mentioned and used at the time. This yields a “high to

low” range for the value of the public domain. With the exception of the lowest price

reported in Table 4—discussed below, the other prices are for actual sales of large tract of

the public domain. Because land is extremely heterogeneous, only the sale of large tracts

can give some reassurance that the average price observed is close to a true average price.

Because these prices are reported for a specific year and given that prices fluctuate over
                                                                                             25

this period, Table 4 inflation-adjusts them to get time series of average prices per acre.

                                    [Place Table 4 Here]

       The lowest price series based on a large transfer, and what will be used hereafter

as the “Best Guess Conservative Estimate,” is for the Erie Triangle land transfer to

Pennsylvania in 1792 [202,187 acres for $151,640 or an average price of $0.75 an acre]

(Donaldson, 1884, pp. 17, 198). In the same inflation-adjusted range would be the

average price of all public domain sold prior to 1800 [1,281,860 acres for $1,050,085, i.e.

$0.82 an acre], and the proposed 1 million acre sale to Symmes in 1788 at $0.67 an acre

(Hibbard, 1939, pp. 51, 55, 100). By contrast, the highest overall inflation-adjusted price

series comes from the cash sale of 72,974 acres for $117,108 or $1.60 an acre on average

in 1787 at New York City (Donaldson, 1884, p. 17). While this was a cash sale, it also

was small and selective, and so might represent only the sale of high valued acres.

       The official minimum price set by Congress (which was not strictly adhered to)

for purchasing the public domain, which had to be purchased in large tracts—i.e. a

minimum purchase of a 640 acre lot, was $1.00/acre in 1785, raised to $2.00/acre in

1796, and then lowered to $1.25/acre in 1820 (Robbins, 1942, pp. 15-16). If these prices

are inflation adjusted from the year they were enacted back, they are all pretty much
                                       20
identical at $1.00/acre in 1785 dollars.    On balance, the time series of real prices based

on the nominal $2.00/acre enacted in 1796 yields the highest price series among the

official minimum prices enacted by Congress. An average price of $1.00/acre in 1785 or

$2.00/acre in 1796 (inflation-adjusted), therefore, would not necessarily be out-of-bounds

for estimating the value of the public domain. However, the slowness of sales at these

official prices suggests that these prices were on the high side of what was the true
                                                                                             26

                                     21
average price of the pubic domain.        As such, the 1796 inflation-adjusted price of

$2.00/acre will be used as the upper range estimate of the value of the public domain.

       Finally, for heuristic purposes a low estimate of $0.30 an acre is also reported.

This price does not come from an actual sale, but is the price that Hamilton proposed for

extinguishing some of the principal of the National Debt by swapping it for western lands

in his “Report on Vacant Lands” sent to Congress July 22, 1790 (Donaldson, 1884, pp.

198-199; Syrett, 1962, v. 6, p. 504). Hamilton also mentioned a price of $0.20 an acre in

his January 1790 “Report on Public Credit” (Syrett, 1962, v. 6, pp. 90-91). Hamilton

combined two observations to deduce this land price. First, some of the public domain

had been sold for $1.00 an acre which could be paid for either in specie or in public debt

at its face value. Second, the public debt, because it was in de facto default, had been

trading for $0.20 to $0.30 per dollar of face value. Thus, Hamilton deduced that the price

of an acre of land was not $1.00 as announced but was really only $0.20 to $0.30.

       Hamilton’s deduction, however, is arbitrage inconsistent. Either anyone paying

specie for land at the $1.00 per acre price was a fool or anyone selling their public debt

for $0.30 per dollar of face value was a fool. Something is not right here, and Hamilton’s

price should be used with caution. Hamilton may have been intentionally undervaluing

the price of land in his rhetoric to dissuade Congress from using land to retire debt and to

persuade them to go with his plan to turn the debt into callable perpetuities. Alternatively,

he may just have been honestly in error about land prices. Hamilton’s rhetorical

argumentation often has such a disingenuous tone that it hard to say. As such, it may be

important to estimate the value of the National Government’s land assets using

Hamilton’s land price in the off chance that he truly believed that that was the average
                                                                                          27

price of an acre of the public domain.

       Table 5 presents a range of estimates of the value of National Government’s land

assets from 1784 through 1802. Between 1784 and 1802, regardless of what price is used,

the value of the public domain grew by 2.5 to 2.8 times. Using Hamilton’s “low estimate”

of $0.30 an acre in 1790, the value of the public domain was only $49 million in 1790

when the National Debt funding plan was being put in place by Hamilton and Congress,

rising to $90 million by 1802. Using the “Best Guess Conservative Estimate” of $0.75 an

acre in 1792, the value of the public domain was $117 million in 1790, rising to $215

million by 1802. Using the other land price estimates makes these numbers much higher.

           The Net Asset Position of the National Government, 1784-1802

       Table 6 combines the information in Tables 1 and 5 to estimate the net asset

position of the National Government from 1784 through 1802. It does so separately for

just the interest-bearing portion of the National Debt as well as for the combined interest-

bearing and non-interest-bearing debt, including an estimate both with and without the

expected assumption of state debts between 1784 and 1790 [in brackets for the former].

                                   [Place Table 6 Here]

a. Regarding the Interest-bearing Debt Only:

       At Hamilton’s price of $0.30 an acre at no time prior was the National

Government solvent if it assumed state debts. Prior to the assumption of state debts (pre-

1791), the National Government, sans state debts, was marginally solvent from 1785

through 1787 and marginally insolvent from 1788 through 1790. Hamilton’s insistence

on the assumption of state debts in his 1790 funding plan, while arguably a politically
                                                                                          28

savvy move, was financially reckless given his land price estimate—pushing the National

Government into a substantially insolvent position. Using Hamilton’s land price would

also indicate that the good credit rating the U.S. garnered in Europe by the 1790s was not

due to its net asset position. So perhaps Hamilton’s reckless plan was saved by a miracle.

        However, Hamilton’s land price, as argued above, seems excessively low by all

the other evidence that exists. Hamilton may have been intentionally undervaluing the

price of land in his rhetoric to dissuade some members of Congress from seriously

considering swapping land for debt. Why this might have been a necessary, intentional,

and clever strategy, and not just an honest mistake, will be addressed below.

        If the “Best Guess Conservative Estimate” of $0.75 an acre is used as the average

price of the public domain, then the National Government was substantially solvent

throughout the period vis-à-vis its interest-bearing debt even with the expected

assumption of state debts. As such, the assumption of state debts was not a reckless

financial act. And the good credit rating the U.S. garnered in Europe by the mid-1790s

may have had as much to do with its positive net asset position as with Hamilton’s

funding plan. Under this interpretation Hamilton’s debt-funding plan basically just solved

the cash flow problem—raising annual tax revenues high enough to meet annual interest

payments due on the face value of the debt—a miracle of sorts, but not incomprehensible.

b. Regarding the Combined Interest-bearing and Non-interest-bearing Debt:

       Between 1784 and 1791, adding the face value of the non-interest-bearing debt to

that of the interest-bearing National and to-be-assumed state debts, the National

Government was substantially insolvent when using the “Best Guess Conservative

Estimate” of $0.75 an acre for the price of the public domain. The average price of the
                                                                                          29

public domain would have to be over $0.90 an acre for it to be just solvent, an average

land price which seems unlikely for this period. Even at the high estimate of $2.00 an

acre in 1796, the National Government was still insolvent in 1788 and 1789 if it assumed

state debts. But the assumption of states debts was not the big issue. The government’s

net asset position was overwhelmed by the size of the non-interest-bearing debt.

       In addition, given that tax revenues after 1790 were barely enough to pay the

interest (and no principal) on the interest-bearing debt, converting the non-interest-

bearing debt into callable perpetuities paying 6 percent annually on its face value was

outside the yearly revenue capabilities of the National Government. Doing so would have

doubled the annual interest payment of the National Government, pushing interest

payments on the National Debt from approximately 30 percent to something like 60

percent of annual revenue—which would have been an unsustainable position.

       The outstanding non-interest-bearing debt (the Continental Dollar) was the

“gorilla in the closet.” By necessity the National Government had to default on it—which

is what it did as part of the funding aspect of the financial revolution. In 1790, Hamilton

advised reaffirming the old default rate of 40 to 1 set by Congress in 1781, but Congress

opted for reaffirming the default at an even higher rate, namely at 100 to 1 (Ferguson,

1961, p. 296). Citizens holding Continental Dollars hoping that said dollars would be un-

defaulted and paid off at face value as Congress was about to do with the domestic

interest-bearing debt were mightily disappointed (Taylor, 1950, p. 62).

       Paying off the non-interest-bearing debt at 40 to 1 or at 100 to 1 probably didn’t

matter to the government’s creditworthiness. It was a massive default in either case. And

the 100-to-1-exchange was not for principal, but for interest-bearing bonds only, one
                                                                                          30

third of which paid no interest until 1800. Thus turning in 100 Continental Dollars in

1791 did not yield $1, but only $0.04 at that year’s end.

       At 40 to 1, the face value of the non-interest-bearing debt would be reduced to $2

million and, at 100 to 1 to $0.81 million. Even if all the outstanding Continental Dollars

were turned in, the National Government would become substantial solvent with either

default algorithm. The decision to reaffirm the default the Continental Dollar in 1790 was

necessary to put the National Government back into a solvent position thereafter. But this

required credibly distinguishing between its interest-bearing debt over which it was

solvent and could fund interest payments in perpetuity out of tariff revenue, and its non-

interest-bearing over which it was insolvent and had to default.

                                       Conclusions

       In 1790, the new Federal Government had to maintain the default on the

Continental Dollar—the non-interest-bearing part of the National Debt it inherited from

the Confederation period. But how could it do so without destroying its creditworthiness?

The key was to legally and financially distinguish between the interest-bearing and the

non-interest-bearing debt, and doing so determined the structure of the debt-funding part

of the financial revolution.

       At the Constitutional Convention in 1787 the Founding Fathers explicitly voted

not to give the new Federal Government the power to emit additional non-interest-

bearing debt, i.e. bills of credit (Farrand, 1966, v. 2, pp. 308-310; Grubb 2006). Thus, the

new Constitution distinguished between the Federal Government’s interest-bearing

debt—which it could continue to issue anew, and its non-interest-bearing debt—which it

was no longer allowed to issue anew. But while this Constitutional distinction may have
                                                                                            31

been a necessary condition, it was not a sufficient condition for preventing the default on

the Continental Dollar from damaging the Federal Government’s creditworthiness.

       If the National Government paid any principal at face value, it could not credibly

distinguish between its interest-bearing and its non-interest-bearing debt legally or in the

marketplace. To default on the Continental Dollar without hurting its creditworthiness, it

had to fund its debt in a way that paid no principal. The answer was to pay interest on the

debt only. Since the Continental Dollar paid no interest, no funding provisions were

required. This may explain why Hamilton devised a funding plan that turned the interest-

bearing debt into callable perpetuities, and why the Continental Dollar was redeemed for

bonds and not for cash.

       The National Government also had to curtail direct swaps of land for debt,

because such swaps were payments of principal—at least until after the funding plan was

established and after the default on the Continental Dollar had been successfully closed

(at least until after 1797). As such, Hamilton’s failure to report on proposed land-for-debt

swaps in 1790 and his excessively low land price used in his reports to Congress in 1790

may have been intentional. He wanted to dissuade members of Congress from funding

schemes that might involve swaps of land for debt which in turn would dissolve the

distinction between the interest and the non-interest-bearing debt (Taylor, 1950, p. 62).

       As such, the debt-funding aspect of the financial revolution is both less

impressive and more complex than typically thought. In one sense, Hamilton’s

contribution to solving the National Government’s financial situation was trivial—merely

solving the immediate cash-flow revenue problem by meeting yearly interest payments

on the debt via the Hamiltonian tariff. The long-run solvency problem was already solved
                                                                                               32

by the spoils of war—the U.S. National Government’s acquisition of land assets. But this

debt-funding aspect of the financial revolution would have been all for naught if they

could not find a way to permanently default on the Continental Dollar with impunity.

       The genius of the U.S. financial revolution and its architects (Hamilton and the

majority in Congress) was in recognizing that they had to legally and financially find a

way to distinguish between the interest-bearing and the non-interest-bearing debt, and

default on the latter without hurting the National Government’s creditworthiness over the

former. Their choices successfully put the gorilla in the closet, and the constraints of

doing this explains the structure of the financial revolution enacted. The result was that

the U.S. garnered an excellent credit rating in Europe soon after 1790 because it only had

interest-bearing debt left. And its ability, in terms of actual tariff revenue and potential

revenue from saleable land assets, to meet the interest payment on this debt and to

eventually retire all this debt was well in excess of what was needed. It was substantially

solvent net asset-wise post-1790.

         Notes and Sources: Column (1): Data for 1791-1802 are the official government statistics taken

from the Historical Statistics (1975, part 2, p. 1104). For 1784-1790 this number is estimated as follows

that described in the text. Column (2) is taken from Bezanson (1936, p. 392). Column (3) equals Column

(1) / [Column (2) * 0.01]. Column (4) starts with the total of $200,000,000 Continental Dollars emitted

through 1779. See Appendix Table A1. From this total is subtracted the amount of Continental Dollars paid

into the U.S. Treasury and burnt between 1780 and 1790 (Elliot, 1843-44, pp. 73-76). See Appendix Table

A2. This leaves roughly $80.5 million outstanding in 1790, which is close to the U.S. Treasury’s guess of

$78 to $80 million still unredeemed and unfunded in 1791 (Elliot, 1843-44, p. 12, item #3). The Treasury’s

guess of how many were exchange for bonds at 100 to 1 after 1790 was $6 million, leaving something

around $72 to $74 million as a total loss—never funded or redeemed (Elliot, 1843-44, p. 12, item #4).

Column (5) equals Column (4) / [Column (2) * 0.01].

Notes and Sources: Column (1) is derived from Donaldson (1884, p. 11); Gates (1968, p. 57); Hibbard

(1939, p. 13). Hibbard’s low number for Virginia is used as it appears to accounts for some additional

restrictions on land transfers that Donaldson and Gates seem to miss. North Carolina’s cession of
                                                                                                          40

29,184,000 acres in 1790 was not counted as most of this land, being in Tennessee, had already been

alienated. The time path of accumulation of acres was organized by using the year of each state’s cession

for the portion of land that was undisputed by other states, and for disputed lands among several states by

using the latest year of cession among the states claiming that land. Virginia’s military tract and the

Western Reserve were excluded. Figuring out both the total and the time path of land acquisition from

these sources is not an obvious exercise. The data must be resorted and so these figures must be regarded as

estimates. For example, between 1781 and 1802 total National land acquisition in acres is given as

267,730,560 by Hibbard (1939, p. 31); 259,171,787 by Donaldson (1884, p. 11); 233,416,000 by the

Historical Statistics (1975, part 1, p. 428); 233,415,680 by Gates (1968, p. 86); 224,975,200 by Gates

(1968, p. 57). Thus, the numbers given here could be considered a conservatively low estimate.

         Column (2) is derived from Donaldson (1884, p. 17) and Hibbard (1939, pp. 55, 100). Hibbard’s

adjustment to Donaldson’s numbers regarding the size and dating of some sales is used.

         Column (3) is Column (1) after netting out the lands sold in Column (2).

Notes and Sources: The nominal prices listed are inflated/deflated over time using the Bezanson (1936, pp.

392-393) 140-Commodity Price Index by taking the nominal price as reported for its given year as the true

value for that year of an average acre of public land. This price is then taken as equal to 100 for the price

index and the Bezanson price index is renormalized to that year. By multiplying that price by its particular

renormalized price index (times 0.01) this nominal price is inflation/deflation-adjusted to other years.

         * indicates the year the nominal price was observed.
                                                                                                           43

         The $0.30 price is from Hamilton’s July 20, 1790 “Plan for the Disposition of the Public Lands”

or “Report on Vacant Lands” sent to Congress July 22, 1790 (Donaldson, 1884, pp. 198-199; Syrett, 1962,

v. 6, pp. 502-506).

         The $0.75 price is from the actual sale of a large seemingly representative block of land in 1792—

the average price for the Erie Triangle land transfer to Pennsylvania (202,187 acres for $151,640, see

Donaldson (1884, pp. 17, 198)).

         The $1.00 price is Congress’ minimum price per acre set in the land ordinance of 1785 which held

until it was changed to $2.00 an acre in 1796 (Donaldson, 1884, p. 197; Hibbard, 1939, pp. 37-41).

         The $1.25 price is the official minimum land sale price set by Congress in 1820 (Donaldson, 1884,

p. 205; Gates, 1968, pp. 127, 140-142; Hibbard, 1939, pp. 63-64).

         The $1.60 price comes from the average price realized on the cash sale of 72,974 acres for

$117,108 in 1787 at New York City (see Donaldson, 1884, p. 17).

         Lastly, the $2.00 price is the official minimum land sale price set by Congress in 1796 through

1820 (see Donaldson, 1884, pp. 200-201; Gates, 1968, pp. 125-133).

Notes and Sources: The net asset position equals the nominal values in Table 5 minus the nominal values in

Table 1 Columns 1 and 4 each year. The Low Estimate uses Hamilton’s $0.30 price per acre. The Best

Guess Conservative Estimate uses the $0.75 price per acre. The High Estimate uses the $2.00 price per

acre. See the notes to Table 4 and the text for discussion. The Interest and Non-Interest-Bearing Debt

includes the nominal face value of the Continental Dollar Fiat Currency added to the interest-bearing debt.

Adjustment Guess Made for Jan. 14th 1779:
In addition, on Jan. 14th Congress voted $50,000,400 to be exchanged for issues since May 20th 1777 that
were being counterfeited. How much was actually exchanged and how much was a net new emission is
unknown. * = emissions exchanged as interpreted by Bullock. ** = emissions exchanged as implied by
Newman. ^ = the exchanged sum chosen by Elliot such that “C. Discrepancy [A – B]” below equals zero.

Notes and Sources: Bullock (1895, pp. 135-136); Calomiris (1988, pp. 57-58); Elliot (1843-44, p. 8);

Harlow (1929, pp. 50-51); Michener (1988, p. 690); Newman (1997, pp. 58-69).
 a
      Because Elliot’s numbers for 1779 and for Sept. 26th 1778 through Nov. 29th 1779 sum to the same total

as those for Harlow and Michener, and those for Newman, respectively, the values reported by Elliot were

used to apportion Harlow and Michener’s, and apportion Newman’s, numbers for 1779 into before versus

after Sept. 2, 1779, respectively.
  b
      Elliot omitted these sums between 1775 and early 1777, designated as “?” in the table.

 c
      Bullock’s individual sums (231,550,000) simply do not add up to what he reports as the total

(241,500,000). Calomiris did not correct this addition error when using Bullock’s numbers.
 d
     As such, the Jan. 14th 1779 adjustment is made uniform across estimates such that [50,000,000 –

41,552,380 (exchanged)] = 8,447,620 of net new emission. The remaining differences are due to rounding.
                                                                                                        50

This correction made to Bullock’s estimate solves the anomaly that Bullock himself puzzled over (Bullock,

1895, p. 136). This estimate also accords with Ferguson (1961, p. 45) who claims that $41,500,000 was

exchanged out of the $50,000,400 authorized for exchange which would then potentially leave $8,500,400

as a net new emission. This estimate also accords with the limit set by Congress on September 3, 1779 of a

maximum of $200,000,000 Continental Dollars that could be emitted before emissions were permanently

discontinued (Ferguson, 1961, p. 46).

Notes and Sources: Derived from Elliot (1843-44, pp. 73-76) “Schedule E. Statement of the sums, in the old

continental emissions, paid by the following States into the treasury of the United States, on account of

their several quotas of the requisitions of Congress, of March 18, 1780.” No payments by South Carolina

and Georgia are recorded which is consistent with the other U.S. Treasury records on the payments by the

various state in different mediums of exchange, see Elliot (1843-44, pp. 68-69). No payments are recorded

as being received for years 1784 and 1785.

      The literature typically refers to “un-defaulted” debt as restructured, redeemed, paid-

off, or reassumed debt. The term un-defaulted is used here in place of these other terms

because I feel it more accurately and starkly captures what was being considered at this

time as applied both to the interest-bearing and the non-interest-bearing debt in the U.S.
  3
      As a sovereign entity the U.S. National Government could not be forced to liquidate

its assets to pay off its debts when in default like a private business. Nevertheless, default

is costly to sovereign entities in terms of lost reputation, credit rating, and access to

borrowing in the future—a cost that the potential sale of capital assets could avert.
  4
      Debt liabilities (D) include both interest-bearing bonds (B) and non-interest-bearing

bills of credit, or fiat paper money (M), i.e. D = B + M. The National Government did

not issue new M after 1779 and the new U.S. Constitution, by convention vote in 1787,

prohibited the Federal Government from issuing new M thereafter (Farrand, 1996, v. 2,

pp. 308-310; Grubb 2006). As such, only the B portion of D factors into G. Paying down

or retiring any of the face value of the principal, either of B or M, without liquidating

assets, however, would still require a current-year budget surplus (T – G > 0). As such,

distinguishing between B and M in the model is not necessary, except with regard to

whether the mass of M issued prior to 1780 that was still outstanding in this era as part of

D could potentially be retired by the National Government at face value.

      On the government’s chronic budget deficits, see Taylor (1950, p. 5); on Shay’s

Rebellion, see Richards (2002) and Szatmary (1980); on the Whiskey Rebellion, see

78); and on Fries’ Rebellion, see Tindall (1988, pp. 333-334). All three rebellions were

tax revolts that involved calling out the regular army on a substantial scale to confront its

own citizens. The Whiskey Rebellion witnessed the only time a sitting U.S. President as

commander-in-chief has taken the field at the head of an army. The Founding Fathers

were aware that public resistance was a constraint on raising new taxes. In late 1789

James Madison, congressman from Virginia, wrote to Alexander Hamilton, the Secretary

of the Treasury, that, “In my opinion, in considering plans for the increase of our

revenue, the difficulty lies, not so much in the want of objects as in the prejudices which

may be feared with regard to almost every object. The Question is very much What

further taxes will be least unpopular?” (Syrett, 1962, v. 5, p. 439) Hamilton may have

doubted the government’s ability to raise enough revenue to meet expenses. In late 1789

as Secretary of the Treasury he broached the possibility of quietly approaching the

French to see “…if the installments of the Principal of the debt [the U.S. owed France]

could be suspended for a few years, [as] it would be a valuable accommodation to the

U.S.” (Syrett, 1962, v. 5, pp. 426, 429) Letters between Hamilton, as Secretary of the

Treasury overseeing the tariff revenue tax, and his port agents often alluded to the

problem of smuggling, the difficulty of enforcing the tariff, and the difficulty of

collecting tariff revenues. As one customs officer put it in late 1789, “The difficulties that

have occurred in the Execution of the laws respecting the Customs have been infinite,

and present themselves daily. The System itself is the most complicated and

embarrassing of anything that has employed my attention…[and] the Owners pay with

reluctance…others not at all without compulsion; and the law provides none.” (Syrett,
                                                                                              55



1962, v. 5, pp. 422, 427, 459-464; 1972, v. 17, pp. 6-7) Hamilton expected revenue

shortfalls from the tariff as he suggested new taxes, such as the Whiskey Tax, in his

December 13, 1790 “First Report on the Further Provision Necessary for Establishing

Public Credit” sparking the 1794 rebellion (Tindall, 1988, pp. 301, 320; Syrett, 1963, v.

7, pp. 225-236). Finally, the yearly value of imports (the principal revenue source of

government via the tariff) fluctuated greatly during this period making tariff revenues

uncertain, see North (1966, pp. 19-32, 228). Regarding problems with trade treaties in

this period, see Tindall (1988, pp. 316-318, 330-331); Madison in 1786 on “…the present

anarchy of our commerce…”(Rutland, 1973, v. 8, pp. 502-503); and Hamilton’s 1794

letter to President George Washington (Syrett, 1972, v. 16, pp. 261-279).

      Interestingly, Tench Cox, in a pamphlet circulated at the Constitutional Convention

[1787], observed that “The general impost…the sale of the lands and every other

unnecessary article of public property … would put the sinking and funding of our debts

within the power of all the states.” (Syrett, 1962, v. 5, p. 63—italics added)
  7
      Talleyrand, in his statement quoted above touting the safety of U.S. bonds, refers to

the “solvency” of the U.S. National Government. It is hard to interpret “solvency” here as

meaning anything other than a positive net asset position, with land being the principal

asset. In the 1790s Talleyrand himself had flirted with speculation in U.S. western lands.
  8
      For more on the land to debt linkage, see Robbins (1942, p. 15); Taylor (1950, p. 40);

Syrett (1962, v. 5, p. 526); and the United States Congress, Register of Debates in

Congress (House of Representatives), v. 1, pp. 647-654 (July 13, 1789); v. 2, pp. 1345-

1347 (February 22, 1790); v. 4, p. 1314 (December 15, 1794), pp. 1017-1018 (December

23, 1794); and v. 5, p. 60 (February 18, 1829). Gates concluded (1968, p. 56), “The
                                                                                            56



transfer of these territories probably did more than anything else at the time to give

prestige to the government.” Finally, even by 1832 congressmen still referred to the

requirement of applying the proceeds from the sale of public lands first to payments on

the National Debt and only after the National Debt was paid off could they use the

proceeds for some other use (United States Congress, Register of Debates in Congress, v.

5, p. 1452 (December 27, 1832); v. 5, pp. 1475-1478 (January 4, 1832)).
  9
      For example, Ferguson’s explanation of this differential treatment is that the interest-

bearing debt was held in high esteem and the non-interest-bearing debt was held in low

esteem (1961, pp. 67-69, 295-297)—which is a vacuous explanation.
  10
       Hamilton estimated the total Federal Debt (state and national) to be $77,124,465 for

1789/1790 (Taylor, 1950, p. 1; Syrett, 1962, v. 6, pp. 85-87). In this number Hamilton

included $2 million Continental Dollars. He did not say why he included it or how he

calculated it. Perhaps this was his anticipated value of the outstanding Continental

Dollars at his proposed continuation of the 40 to 1 default rate that had been used by

Congress since March 18, 1780 ($80,537,630 million Continental Dollars outstanding in

1789—see Table 1—converts to $2,013,441 million when using the 40 to 1 default rate).

This explanation is consistent with the $80.5 million estimate here of the amount of

Continental Dollars still outstanding in 1789. Hamilton, as Secretary of the Treasury,

would have had all the same treasury evidence as that presented here in the Appendices

and so could have made the same calculation. If Hamilton was not simply dividing $80

million Continental Dollars by 40 to get $2 million Continental Dollars in defaulted

value, then his $2 million statement is a mysterious curiosity. (If he really meant that only

$2 million Continental Dollars in face value were still outstanding at the time, then his
                                                                                           57



proposed default on the Continental Dollar was an unnecessary and financially reckless

act.) As such, the analysis here indicates that Hamilton, in his 1790 “Report on Public

Credit,” while proposing to un-default the interest-bearing debt was also in effect

proposing to not un-default the Continental Dollar. Subtracting out this $2 million of

Continental Dollars leaves Hamilton at $75 million in 1789/1790 for the interest-bearing

debt alone, which is not far off the $72.3 to $74.7 million estimated here in Table 1.
 11
       This value also concurs with that of Ratchford (1941, p. 37) and with Congress’ limit

set on September 3, 1779 of a maximum of $200,000,000 Continental Dollars that could

be emitted before emissions were permanently discontinued (Ferguson, 1961, p. 46).
  12
       Ferguson (1961, p. 67) says in regard to the mass of Continental Dollars issued and

outstanding prior to the 1790 default affirmation act, “Eventually the dead mass of

currency was drawn in by the states. A good part of it was scattered or destroyed, and in

1790 only about $6,000,000 remained in the hands of individuals.” Ferguson’s source for

his $6 million number is Elliot (1843-44, p. 12). As such, Ferguson clearly misinterprets

his source here. The $6 million was the number estimated to have been actually

exchanged at the 100 to 1 default rate for bonds after 1790, not the amount outstanding at

this date, which was estimated to be $78 to $80 million in the same source.
 13
       Hamilton’s plan to extinguish the principal of the interest-bearing debt was to devise

a small sinking fund from any unexpected excess tariff revenue that would be used to buy

up Federal debt in the marketplace when it traded at below face value. Given that the debt

plan entailed forcing a small portion of debt holders to exchange their debt for new debt

that carried a below-market interest rate, and given that Federal debt in general was being

turned into callable perpetuities, these below-market interest rate bonds would trade at
                                                                                                58



below face value. In effect, Hamilton was repudiating some of the interest-bearing debt

and setting in motion a scheme to pay only the market rate for that debt. See Swanson

and Trout (1992); Syrett (1962, v. 6, pp. 51-168); Taylor (1950, pp. 4-7). This

observation and line of reasoning turns the monetary rhetoric of the early Republic on its

head. Hamilton and the Federalists had argued that the debt had to be funded at face

value and not market value. But in fact the sinking fund scheme did the opposite.
  14
       This is a naïve version of the quantity theory of money in that Hamilton asserts strict

proportionality between money growth and price inflation and he does not grasp the

Fisher equation, i.e. that the nominal interest rate must equal the real rate plus inflation.

Hamilton claims in his report that pumping money into the economy will permanently

drive up prices and drive down nominal interest rates (Syrett, 1962, v. 6, pp. 71, 88-89).
 15
      In the context of Hamilton’s address he clearly is means the specie price of land.

Thus Hamilton’s fall in prices since the revolution of 25 to 50 percent refers to the fall in

specie prices. Price indices in this period, 1783-1789, were denominated in state paper

monies. Between 1783 and 1789 the Philadelphia price index fell only 18 percent, the

Charleston, South Carolina price index fell only 20 percent, and the New York City price

index fell only about 6 percent (Bezanson, 1936, p. 392; Cole, 1938, pp, 121-122, 156).

Prices denominated in specie falling faster than prices denominated in state paper money,

as Hamilton’s statement implies, is consist with foreign trade disruptions in this period

generating a sharp temporary shortfall in specie inflows. Thus, state paper money could

be appreciating in goods (price deflation) but depreciating in terms of how much specie it

could command (acute specie scarcity driving specie prices of goods down faster than the

decline in the state-paper-money price of goods). The economic problem facing Hamilton
                                                                                             59



and the Founding Fathers in the mid-1780s was not inflation or state paper money per se

but foreign trade shocks reducing specie money supplies (Grubb, 2006; Nettels, 1962, 45-

46, 105). See also the assessments of James Wilson in 1785 (Adams, 1930, p. 145) and

James Madison in 1786 (Rutland, 1973, v. 8, pp. 502-503).
 16
      In 1791 the face value of the Federal interest-bearing debt totaled $77 million. About

$12 million was foreign debt leaving $65 million in the domestic economy (see Table 1).

By Hamilton’s own estimate in 1790 this debt traded at about 20 cents on the dollar of

face value (Syrett, 1962, v. 6, p. 91). Thus, given that Hamilton’s plan would re-inflate

this debt to face value, the resulting amount of new cash so injected into the domestic

economy would be [$77 million minus $12 million] * 0.8 = $52 million.
 17
       Hamilton also argued that the effect on prices would not be immediate or

instantaneous. Some lag would intervene. In the January 1790 “Report on Public Credit”

Hamilton wrote, “It ought not however to be expected, that the advantages, described as

likely to result from funding the public debt, would be instantaneous. It might require

some time to bring the value of stock to its natural level, and to attach to it that fixed

confidence, which is necessary to its quality as money.” (Syrett, 1962, v. 6, p. 72)
  18
       See also Swanson and Trout (1992, pp. 428-429). Determining what Hamilton

actually believed based on his words and logic is fraught with risk. Ratchford concluded

that (1941, p. 52), “It is difficult, if not impossible, to determine the extent to which

Hamilton really believed these things and the extent to which he used them because they

fitted in with the ideas prevalent at the time, and thus were likely to meet with approval

of legislators.” Often Hamilton presented arguments for the position he wanted that

appear designed primarily to win over different constituents—appearing to be as much
                                                                                            60



political expediency as his own true belief. He would solicit opinions from others and

then parrot back as many arguments as he needed to craft a winning coalition for his

desired position (Syrett, 1962, v. 5; v. 6). For example, see the letter William Bingham, a

director of the Bank of North America, sent to Hamilton on November 25, 1789 in which

Bingham lays out many arguments that Hamilton puts in his January 1790 “Report on

Public Credit” (Syrett, 1962, v. 5, pp. 538-554). In particular, Bingham wrote “The

Scarcity of money had reduced even real Property 40% below its standard Value before

the War…” and “…when the public Debt of a Country is well funded, which brings into

the Market a Quantity of circulating Medium, readily transferable, & which represents all

the alienable Property of the Country, [it serves] almost as well as Specie...”
  19
       By creating the First Bank of the U.S. in 1791 and then selling its shares in said

bank, the National Government could also be considered to be able to create saleable

assets for itself via creation of such corporations—no matter how constitutionally

questionable such acts might have been. Such assets will be abstracted from here.
 20
       Interestingly, he sale of the Chickasaw Trust Lands from 1836 through 1850

(4,025,395 acres for $3,326,404) yields an average nominal price of $0.83 an acre which

when deflation-adjusted back to 1785 would be approximately $1.00 an acre (Gates,

1968, p. 186; Bezanson, 1936, p. 392).
 21
       Part of the slowness of sale of the public domain early on may have been due to the

several states that had retained significant western and northern lands outbidding the

National Government for settlers by pricing their lands under that set by the National

Government for the public domain (Gates, 1968, p. 128; Robbins, 1942, p. 9).
