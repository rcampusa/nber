       be imposed on the interbank market. Such discipline, in principle, could be imposed on
       either debtor or creditor banks. ... Alternatively, the issue of moral hazard in interbank
       markets could be addressed by charging banks for the existence of the sovereign
       guarantee, particularly in more vulnerable countries where that guarantee is more likely
       to be called upon and whose cost might deter some aberrant borrowing. For example,
       sovereigns could charge an explicit premium, or could impose reserve requirements,
       earning low or even zero interest rates, on interbank liabilities. Increasing the capital
       charge on lending banks, instead of on borrowing banks, might also be effective."

1.     Introduction


       The global financial market has been shaken throughout the nineties by a series of major

financial crises. In retrospect, the Mexican crisis of 1994-95 was a mild tequila overhang in comparison

to the major Asian flu of the late nineties. Attempts to stabilize the global system have led to massive

bailouts, the sizes of which seem to increase exponentially.2 This experience suggests that the present

system cannot survive indefinitely, as the willingness of tax payers in the OECD countries to engage in

continuing bailouts is approaching its limits. Growing recognition of this has resulted in a spirited

debate among economists, and soul searching among policy makers.

       At one end of the spectrum of views, we find believers in the inherent efficiency of private

financial intermediation, arguing that the crises are due to global moral hazard generated by quasi public

financial institutions and government interventions. The provision of implicit (or explicit) insurance has

subsidized private lending at the expense of the tax payers. According to this view, preventing these

crises requires alleviating the global moral hazard problem. To accomplish this task may necessitate a

scaling down of the role of the IMF and that of other quasi public institutions in orchestrating bailouts.

commitments of the IMF and the OECD countries to South Korea, Indonesia and Thailand of about $
115 billion.

        At the other end of the spectrum are economists who argue for stringent capital controls, needed

in order to cut international lending to emerging markets. According to this view, large capital flows are

destabilizing, and are frequently welfare reducing for both the emerging markets and the OECD

countries, potentially benefiting only the speculators.

        In between these extremes exists a large array of views. Most share the presumption that we deal

with a second-best situation, in which there is no quick fix but welfare can be enhanced by the proper

regulatory changes. While prudent borrowing of emerging market economics is beneficial, excessive

borrowing may be disadvantageous due to existing distortions. In such an environment, one should

either reduce the existing distortions, or induce borrowers and lenders to internalize them. An example

of these views is provided by Chairman Alan Greenspan, in his remarks cited above, in which he

proposes the imposition of reserve requirements on foreign bank loans as a possible means of imposing

discipline on the market.

        To put this issue in the broader context, we observe that most mainstream economists agree that

approaching free trade in goods and services is beneficial. But such a consensus is lacking when we

deal with financial integration. Indeed there is a spirited debate concerning the wisdom of unrestricted

capital mobility between the OECD and emerging markets, and various previous studies have identified

circumstances in which unlimited capital mobility may be sub-optimal.3

        The notion of introducing reserve requirements as a means of stabilizing capital flows between

advanced and emerging markets is an innovative idea, one that merits serious analysis. The novel aspect

of this paper is in applying a public finance framework to evaluate the general macroeconomic impact of

reserve requirements in a second-best world, where in the absence of credible pre-commitments, we

observe moral hazard on the lender's side, and sovereign risk on the borrower's side. We are particularly

concerned with determining how the effects of bailouts interact with the reserve requirements and how

the optimal design of reserve requirements is impacted.

        An important objective of our analysis is to identify the welfare consequence of imposing a

country-specific reserve requirement, and to investigate in whose interest these regulations would work.

We consider costly financial intermediation between lenders and emerging markets in the presence of

sovereign risk. Moral hazard is modeled on the lender side, due to the "Too-Big-to-Fail" doctrine --

large defaults of major banks are destabilizing, hence agents expect public bailout for large defaults.4

There is uncertainty regarding the default size that would trigger such a bailout, where larger defaults

are associated with higher probability of bailout. While debtors may benefit from imposing a reserve

requirement on borrowed funds, the presence of moral hazard on the lender side reduces the borrower's

incentive to restrict borrowing.

        Our results are summarized in a series of propositions that highlight the importance of reserve

requirements in determining the welfare effects of a more generous bailout. Specifically, we shall show

that a more generous bailout, financed by the high income block, encourages borrowing and increases

the probability of default, thereby raising the expected yield to lenders. In the absence of reserve

requirements, the associated higher bailout costs have a positive welfare effect on the borrowing country

but at the expense of the lending country. The impact on overall world welfare depends upon whether

the net benefits of the higher lending exceed the higher monitoring costs, ultimately paid by the

borrowers. At the same time we show that the introduction of a reserve requirement in either country

reduces the risk of default and raises the welfare of both the high income block and the emerging market

economies. In these circumstances, the lender's optimal reserve requirement is shown to increase with

the expected bailout. Such a policy induces the lender to internalize the expected tax payer cost of the

bailout. Thus a more generous bailout that is accompanied by an optimal adjustment in the lender's

reserve requirements exactly neutralizes its effects on welfare, leaving welfare in both countries

unchanged. The effect of a more generous bailout on the borrower's optimal reserve requirement is

ambiguous as are the welfare effects. We also contrast the optimal choices of reserve requirements in

the two cases where the agents act non-cooperatively with the optimum chosen by a global planner,

4This doctrine goes back to the nineteenth century, when Bagehot identified circumstances where
systemic risk would induce the central bank to act as the lender of last resort. See Hughes and Mester
(1993) for a recent empirical evidence on the "Too-Big-to-Fail" doctrine is the U.S.


                                                   4
thereby enabling us to identify the impact of the externality on the policy choice. Finally, we show that

the imposition of the reserve requirement may also improve the availability of information about the

debt exposure of the emerging market economies, which by itself will reduce the optimal reserve

requirement, and may prevent the drying up of the market for sovereign debt.

       The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 outlines the model and identifies

the supply of debt and introduces reserve requirements. Section 3 discusses the equilibrium borrowing

and lending and analyzes the effects of changes in reserve requirements and in more generous bailouts

on the equilibrium. Section 4 analyzes the effects of these changes on the respective welfare of lenders

and borrowers, and characterizes the optimal reserve requirement from the perspective of the various

parties, on the assumption of a non-cooperative environment, in which each regulator designs the

optimal regulation from his perspective, taking the other's regulation as given.        Section 5 briefly

discusses the globally optimal choice of reserve requirements, while Section 6 identifies another

rationale for reserve requirements, namely as a mechanism for improving the transparency of borrower's

debt exposure. Section 7 concludes.



2.     The model


       Consider a global economy consisting of two blocks, high-income countries and emerging

market economies, and assume a two-period planning horizon. Agents in the high-income countries are

risk neutral, and their preferences are

                                           C2
                               V ≡ C1 +                                           (1)
                                          1+ ρ


where ρ is the rate of time discount and coincides with the risk-free interest rate. Agents in the

emerging market are also risk neutral, having preferences represented by

                                              C*2
                               V * ≡ C1* +                                                (2)
                                             1+ ρ *




                                                      5
where we assume that their rate of time preference, ρ * > ρ , reflecting the fact that the real interest rate in

the emerging market economy is (substantially) higher than in the high income block. Output in the
high-income and the emerging market blocks at time t is Yt ,Yt* , respectively, with Yt >> Yt* . The only

source of macro uncertainty is the stochastic shock, ε , to second period output in the emerging market

block


                                Y2* = Y * (1+ ε )                                              (3)


where ε is governed by the probability density function f (ε ), − ε ≤ ε ≤ ε , ε ≥ 0 . All private agents are

price takers.


2.1     Borrowing Constraints and Reserve Requirements


        The emerging markets block may borrow internationally, but its borrowing capacity is restricted

by the limited enforceability of international contracts.5 To simplify the analysis we consider the case

where the initial outstanding foreign debt is zero.         Suppose that the high income block lends an
aggregate amount B1 in period 1 to the emerging market block at a contractual interest rate of r. We

shall assume further that the lending agency is required to maintain a fraction θ of its loans as reserves

that yield a zero real interest rate. Thus, with the reserve requirement, gross lending by the high income
block, B1 , is associated with net lending to the emerging market of


                                         B1* ≡ (1− θ)B1 ,                                      (4)


as a fraction θB1 is lend to the central bank. Hence the reserve requirement provides the fiscal

authorities with an interest-free loan, leading to second-period income of ρθB1 .

        In period 2, the borrowing country is required to repay its net loan, B1* , but because of the

stochastic output it may default partially. Let S2 denote the debt repayment to foreign creditors in

period 2. In the event of default, creditors are assumed to be able to penalize the borrowing country,

5See Eaton at. al. (1986), Chapter 6 in Obstfeld and Rogoff (1996) for a review of the literature on
sovereign debt, and Bulow and Rogoff (1989) and Helpman (1989) for related models.


                                                        6
reducing its net output by χY2* . The parameter χ reflects the bargaining power of foreign lenders,

indicating that up to a fraction χ of output can "confiscated" due to the threat of embargoes, etc.6

Consequently, the effective ceiling on net resource transfers to creditors is:


                       S2 = min[(1 + r)B1* ,χY2* ]                                         (5)


Equation (5) implies that the productivity threshold leading to partial default, ε * , is determined by the
condition (1+ r)B1* = χY* (1+ ε * ), implying that:

                                 (1+ r)B1*         
                       ε * = max           − 1,− ε                                       (6)
                                 χY                
                                       *




For realized productivity below ε * , partial default saves the borrower (at the expense of the lender) the

difference between the contractual repayment and the actual one. We denote this gap -- the potential

bailout -- by b


                       b ≡ (1+ r)B1* − χY * (1+ ε) = χY* (ε * − ε)                         (7)


The international credit market is risk neutral, characterized by competition among banks that are fully

informed regarding the debt exposure of the country. Partial default by the emerging markets requires
that banks should spend real resources µ in order to verify the productivity shock and to enforce the

repayment according to (5).7

       Large defaults are potentially destabilizing, leading agents to expect the possibility of public

bailouts. There is, however, uncertainty regarding the exact default size leading to the bailout. We




6The  term χ captures all the factors that may influence the integration of markets [like openness, trade
dependency, the state of the global economy, etc.].
7To simplify, we lump these costs together and we ignore the possibility of randomized monitoring [see

Towsend (1979) for a model where a debt contract is optimal in the presence of state verification costs].
As was shown by Boyd and Smith (1994), random monitoring adds significant complexity to the
financial contract, without generating first order welfare effects [see also Bernanke and Gertler (1989)
for a related analysis].


                                                        7
summarize the bailout expectations in a reduced form equation, where the bailout probability φ

increases with the default size:


                  φ = φ(b), where φ(0) = φ ′ (0) = 0; φ ′(b) > 0 for b > 0                    (8)


In the event of a bailout, the tax payer would compensate fully the lenders for the revenue shortfall
induced by default, b.      8     Hence, with the bailout, the bank's income on the foreign loan B1* is

b + χY * (1+ ε ), which equals the contractual repayment, B1* (1+ r).

         We assume that the partial default decision is centralized, being made and enforced by the policy

maker (like the Central Bank or the Treasury), who follows the default rule described by (6). Suppose

that the policy maker in the emerging market imposes a borrower's reserve requirement θ * on borrowed
funds.    Although the aggregate borrowing of the emerging market block is B1* = (1− θ)B1 , only

(1− θ * )B1* is available to the private sector directly. The remaining borrowed funds, θ * B1* , are set aside

in a reserve account that is assumed to yield a zero real interest rate. An agency of the central bank
borrows from the foreign banks B1* = (1− θ)B1 , and intermediates the foreign loans to domestic

borrowers, charging a domestic interest rate r* , and imposes the borrower's reserve requirement. This

agency collects the interest repayments in states of nature where no external default occur (i.e., when
ε > ε * = (1+ r )B1* χY * − 1).     In states of partial default, this agency collects the partial default

repayment, (1+ ε * )χY * . Any net revenue of this agency is reimbursed to the public in the merging

market in a lump-sum fashion.9 If there is no default, the loan repayment is financed by the domestic
interest rate, r* , in accordance with 1 + r = (1− θ * )(1+ r * ) + θ * ⋅1. The borrower's reserve requirement

thus induces a wedge between the interest rate, r* , facing private agents in the emerging market, and the

contractual interest rate, r, charged by the lender on sovereign debt, summarized by the relationship:


                                   r* (1− θ * ) = r                                           (9)


8We  can extend the analysis to account for partial bailouts, without modifying the key insights.
9Alternatively,taxes are imposed if the net revenue is negative. In our example, the imposition of
reserve requirements on borrowing implies that the agency gets an interest-free loan, ending up with net
revenue.

3.      Equilibrium Borrowing and Lending


        The intertemporal pattern of consumption is determined by agents who maximize their

discounted expected utility. The lender's risk neutrality implies that they offer an elastic supply of credit

at an expected yield equal to their time preference rate [see equation (1)]. Hence, the interest rate r is

determined by an arbitrage condition, equating the expected yield on foreign debt to the risk free interest

rate. The former, given by the right hand side of (10) consists of the following components: (i) the

return on the loan in the absence of default; (ii) the return on the loan in the presence of default, which

equals the full return on the debt in the event of a bailout and the share of foreign output claimed in the

absence of a bailout, all less the enforcement costs; and (iii) the return of the reserve on the loan.

                                    {                                          }
        = (1+ r)B1 (1− θ) − ∫− ε [(1+ r)B1 (1− θ) − χY * (1+ ε )](1− φ ) + µ f (ε )dε + B1θ

Recalling (6) and (7) enables the right hand side of (10) to be written as:

                                             ε*
                        [1+ r(1− θ )]B1 − ∫−ε {b(1− φ) + µ} f (ε)dε                                 (10')


Thus equations (10) and (10') imply that the financial spread is

                                                 ε*
                        [r(1− θ) − ρ ]B1 = ∫− ε {b(1− φ ) + µ } f (ε)dε                             (11)


Equation (11) is a fundamental financial equilibrium relationship in the model. The risk premium

implied by (11) reflects the presence of default risk; in the absence of default risk, this equilibrium
condition implies r(1− θ ) = ρ .

        Relationships such as (11) have been used to justify the presence of an upward sloping supply

curve of debt, facing developing countries. Beginning with Bardhan (1967), several authors have
introduced reduced form relationships of the form r = r(B1 ), r ′ > 0 to reflect foreign asset market

                                                  *
                                                    f (ε )dε − ω    1+  r

where:

Evaluating the expression in (13), we may write ω in the equivalent form

                                   µf (ε * )     ε*
                             ω=

where ηφ, b = d ln φ d ln b is the elasticity of the bailout probability with respect to the bailout size.

         The expected repayment of the emerging market on its external debt of B1* is

                               ε                     ε*                               ε*

which, using the equilibrium arbitrage condition (11), can be written

                             1 + ρ  B* + ε {µ − bφ } f (ε)dε

                                    


From this expression we see that the bailout impacts in two ways on the budget of the borrowing
                                                                                 ε*

but passed on to the borrowers through the higher lending rate, r. Offsetting this, the bailout subsidizes

borrowing by   ∫   −ε
                        bφf (ε )dε . This is also the expected net transfer from the tax payers in the high income

block to the banks (and indirectly to the borrower country).

         Returning to (12) and (13), we see that ω represents the marginal impact of a larger bailout on

the net expected bailout costs to the borrowing country. Combining these two equations we see that the
familiar assumption, dr dB1 > 0 , holds if and only if:

which under plausible conditions is likely to be met, and a condition that henceforth is assumed. 10

            The final component of the equilibrium in the world economy is the interest rate parity condition

in the borrowing country. Being a price-taker, the agent in that economy views the interest rate and the

default threshold, ε * , as exogenously given, determined by the corresponding aggregate variables. The

agent in the emerging market determines his borrowing by maximizing his expected utility, where from

his point of view the interest rate is r* . Given risk neutrality, the first order condition characterizing

optimal borrowing by the agent in the borrowing country is11
                                                                                    ε
                                                          1 + ρ * = (1+ r* )∫ε * f (ε )dε                                                        (15)


The equilibrium interest rate in the borrowing country thus exceeds the rate of time preference there by

an amount that depends upon the probability of default.


10The   critical default level, ε * , increases with the level of external debt. For a sufficiently low level of
such debt, ε * = −ε , and (12) and (13') imply that the critical condition (14) for dr dB1 > 0 reduces to
µf (−ε ) χY * < 1 , a condition that is satisfied for a low enough but positive enforcement cost, µ . If
µf (−ε ) χY * > 1 , the supply of credit is backward bending at interest rates marginally above the risk-free
rate. In these circumstances it would be in the interest of the borrower's central bank to prohibit
borrowing, rendering the problem being analyzed in this paper trivial. Consequently, we assume
µf (−ε ) χY * < 1 , implying that the supply of credit is upward sloping at relatively low interest rates. In
general, the external debt-borrowing rate relationship may include a backward bending portion, as will
be the case for high enough interest rate and external debt. In these circumstance it would be in the
interest of the borrower's central bank to apply policies that would prevent reaching the backward
bending portion [a point on the backward bending portion of the supply of credit entails lower welfare
than the point where the external borrowing is maximized, see Aizenman (1989) for further discussion
of related issues]. Due to these considerations, we assume that we operate in the range where (14) is
satisfied.

3.1    Effects of Reserve Requirements


       The equilibrium in the world economy is summarized by the six relationships, (11), (6), (7), (15),

(4), and (9), repeated here for convenience:

                                                    ε*
                            [r(1− θ) − ρ ]B1 = ∫− ε {b(1− φ ) + µ } f (ε)dε                      (16a)


                            χY * (1+ ε * ) = (1+ r)B1 (1− θ )                            (16b)


                            b = χY * (ε * − ε )                  (for ε < ε * )                  (16c)

                                      ε
                            (1+ r* )∫ε * f (ε )dε = 1 + ρ *                                      (16d)


                            B1* ≡ (1− θ)B1 ,                                                     (16e)


                            r* (1− θ * ) = r                                                     (16f)


These relationships determine the equilibrium solutions for gross lending, B1 , net lending, B1* , the

international contractual lending rate, r, the interest rate in the emerging market, r* , the threshold break-

even productivity shock (probability of default), ε * , and the (stochastic) bailout, b, in terms of the

lending and borrowing reserve requirements, θ,θ * , and other aspects of the probability distribution

characterizing the bailout.
       Substituting: (i) for r from (16b), for B1 from (16e), and for b from (16c) into the interest

arbitrage relationship for the lending country, (16a); and (ii) for r from (16b) and for r* from (16f) into

the interest arbitrage relationship for the borrowing country, (16d), enables us to reduce the equilibrium

to the following pair of relationships:

                             ρ  * ε*
        (1+ ε * )χY * − 1+   B1 − ∫− ε {χY * (ε * − ε)(1−φ) + µ} f(ε )dε = 0                  (17a)

               [(1+ ε       )χY * − θ * B1* ]∫ε * f (ε )dε − (1− θ * )(1+ ρ * )B1* = 0
                                               ε
                        *
                                                                                                 (17b)




                                                               12
These conditions describe equilibrium in (i) the world lending market, and (ii) the internal financial
market in the emerging block, the solution to which jointly determines the values of (ε * , B1* ) for a given

pair of reserve requirements, (θ,θ * ) and the characteristics of the bailout.

        From these relationships we see that the effects of changes of reserve requirements on (ε * , B1* )

can be summarized in the form

                        1 −θ        ε *




        In imposing the above signs, we are making two plausible assumptions -- ∆ < 0 and Γ > 0 --

the rationale for which we now discuss. First, both (18b) and ∆ contain the expression Γ . To interpret

this quantity, consider the equilibrium condition (16d), the left hand side of which can be interpreted as

the mean borrowing costs (inclusive of debt repayment), say c , in the emerging block economy [i.e.,
             ε
c ≡ (1+ r* )∫ε * f (ε)dε ]. It is readily established that the partial effect of a higher threshold break-even

productivity shock, ε * , and therefore of a higher probability of default, on the mean cost of funds in the
borrowing economy is given by (∂c ∂ε * )B * const = (1+ r )Γ (1+ ε * )(1− θ * ). On the one hand higher ε *
                                                    1



raises the contractual lending rate, thereby raising r* , but it also raises the probability of default and

eventual bailout, thereby lowering borrowing costs . It is plausible to assume that the former effect

dominates, so that Γ > 0 , implying that higher default risk is associated with higher borrowing costs.




                                                             13
               Second, consider the term l ≡ 1 + r(1− θ ) − ∫−ε [(b(1− φ ) + µ ) B1 ]f (ε )dε , obtained from (16a).
                                                                                            ε*




This reflects the mean return on the loan to the lending country and consists of the loan rate net of the

reserve requirement less the net costs of partial default, inclusive of monitoring costs. Analogously one
can show (∂l ∂ε * )B * const = (1+ r)(1− θ ) ∫−ε f (ε)dε − ω  (1+ ε * ) . As long as the supply of debt is
                                                ε

                    1                                        

upward sloping this is positive, implying that the higher default risk is also associated with a higher

mean return to the lending country.

               The condition ∆ < 0 can be expressed in the form

                                              (∂c ∂ε )

and intuitively asserts that an increase in default risk has a relatively greater impact on the borrowing

costs of the emerging economy than it does on the returns to lending of the high income block. The pair

The inequalities in (20) can be transformed to upper and lower bounds on the monitoring costs µ .12

               In addition, we can establish:




12The   condition ∆ < 0 may appear to impose unrealistically high restrictions on monitoring costs.
Taking θ = θ * = 0 , the right hand inequality in (20) implies that the share of monitoring costs to the total
value of the claim [debt plus interest] exceeds (1+ ρ) (1+ ρ * ) . Taking ρ = 0.02, ρ * = 0.20 as representative
of real interest rates in advanced and developing economies, the cost ratio must exceed over 80%. This,
however, is an artifact of the two period model we are employing. If the model is applied to an infinite
horizon and the bailout applies to default on interest costs, the corresponding cost ratio reduces to ρ ρ * ,
which is of the much more realistic order of 10%. But despite this, our focus on two periods is justified
in that it preserves the character of the problem, and has the important advantage of permitting us to
analyze the issue in the most transparent way.

       Conditions (18), (19), and (21) imply the following. An increase in the reserve requirement

imposed by either the lending country or by the borrowing country reduces ε * and therefore decreases

the probability of default and reduces the contractual lending rate.               An increase in the reserve

requirement imposed by the emerging market leads to an unambiguous decrease in net foreign

borrowing. Similarly, an increase in the reserve requirement imposed in the lending country reduces net
lending, B1* , though gross lending, B1 , could increase.

       The final comparative static exercise of importance concerns the effect of a more generous

bailout. We define a more generous bailout scheme as being an increase in the probability of bailing out

a given partial default, b. A uniform increase in the generosity of the scheme is obtained by modifying
the probability of bailout by a shift parameter ξ , replacing the initial probability of bailout, φ with ξφ ,

where dξ > 0 .13 We can easily show that the effects of a more generous bailout, for given reserve

requirements, θ,θ * are given by
                                         ε
                        ∂ε *    (1+ r )∫ * f (ε )dε       ε*

                                        ε
                                                                                               (22a)
                        ∂ξ               ∆            −ε



                        ∂B1* − χY * ε *
                            =      Γ ∫−ε bφf (ε)dε > 0                                         (22b)
                        ∂ξ     ∆


13We assume that, in the relevant range, ξφ < 1 . Otherwise, the shift parameter replaces φ with
min[1, ξφ].


                                                               15
Thus a more generous bailout will encourage more borrowing and raise the probability of default, doing

so by an amount that is proportional to the bailout itself.




4.        Welfare Effects and Optimal Reserve Policy


          We turn now to the consequences of alternative policies on the welfare of the representative

agents in the two country blocks. We shall assess the welfare effects of the exogenous policy changes
(i.e. changes in θ, θ * , and ξ ) analyzed in Section 3, as well as optimal policy and the determination of

the optimal reserve requirement from the perspective of the various parties. We first analyze the effects

of a reserve requirement imposed on the lending nation and then study the impact of a reserve

requirement imposed on the borrower. In analyzing optimal policy, we assume a non-cooperative

environment, in which each regulator designs the optimal regulation from his perspective, taking the

other's regulation as given. This is eventually contrasted with the global optimal policy derived in

Section 5 below.

          We assume the presence of lump sum taxes, financing the net cost of the bailout. The expected
                                                                                                          ε*
net bailout cost to the treasury of the high income country is                                        ∫   −ε
                                                                                                               bφf (ε )dε − ρθB1 . The first term is the

expected bailout, the second term adjusts the cost by the government revenue from the risk free loan.

The expected utility of the high-income block, adjusted to reflect the lump sum taxes, is14



14In evaluating the expected utility of the representative agent, we consolidate the budget constraints of
the private sector with that of the public sector. For simplicity of exposition, we assume that all taxes
and transfers are lump sum, and that the public sector demand for public goods is zero. With these
assumption, the ultimate first-period consumption is the GNP minus external lending, Y 1 − (1 − θ )B1 .
Similarly, the consolidated second-period consumption is the second-period GNP plus the expected
repayment on the external debt, net of the enforcement cost:

From (23) it is clear that the impact of a more generous bailout (dξ > 0) or of an increase in a reserve

requirement imposed by either the lending country (θ ) or borrowing country (θ * ) on the welfare of the

high-income block depends upon its impact on the expected bailout cost to the treasury

economy, we consolidate the budget constraints of the private sector with that of the public sector. For

simplicity of exposition, we assume that all taxes and transfers are lump sum, and that the public sector

demand for real goods is zero. With these assumptions, the ultimate first-period consumption is the

GNP plus the borrowing. Similarly, the consolidated second-period consumption is the second period

GNP minus the repayment on the external debt. The expected utility of the emerging market block is

       The effects of an increase in the reserve requirement in the lending country, θ , on the level of

welfare of the lending country and the domestic (borrowing) economy are given by:

We turn to the foreign spillover effect first. Differentiating (25a) with respect to θ , the impact on the

welfare of the emerging block economies is:

where ω , defined in (13'), is the marginal impact of a larger bailout on the net expected bailout costs to

the borrowing country. Evaluating (26) we find

Condition (27a) brings out two conflicting factors in determining the effects of the higher reserve

requirement imposed by the lending economy on welfare in the borrowing country. On the one hand, by

reducing default risk and lowering the world interest rate it raises welfare abroad. But it also reduces net

foreign borrowing and thus lowers foreign consumption in the first period, and is welfare reducing. In

the important case where there is no reserve requirement in the borrowing nation, θ * = 0, the first effect

dominates and welfare in the emerging country block is improved unambiguously.

       Evaluating (25b), we see that the effect of a higher reserve requirement imposed in the lending

country on that country's welfare is

where it will be recalled that ηφ, b ≡ d ln φ d ln b is the elasticity of the bailout probability with respect to

the bailout size. The effects described by are ambiguous. While the reduced probability of default has a

positive effect on welfare in the high income economy, this is offset by the lower borrowing. Evaluating

this expression at θ = 0 , we can establish that:

                                                     >0                                         (28)
                                         ∂θ  θ = 0


We may summarize these results with


        Proposition 1:      Starting from an initial situation of no reserve requirements, the

        introduction of a reserve requirement by the lending country will raise welfare in both

        economies.


        The optimal reserve requirement for the lending country is obtained by setting ∂V ∂θ = 0 ,

thereby minimizing the expected tax payer cost of the bailouts:

                       ∂B       ∂ε * ε *
                                  ∂θ ∫− ε
                ρ B1 + θ 1 = χY *          φ (1+ ηφ ,b ) f (ε )dε                               (25b')
                       ∂θ 


This condition has a simple welfare interpretation -- the left hand side is the marginal benefit associated

with raising the extra taxes, paid indirectly by the borrower. The right hand side is the marginal cost

associated with the increase in the resource transfers via the bailout.15

        Substituting from (18a) and (18b) into (25b') the optimal reserve requirement for the lending can

be expressed conveniently in the form:


15We  do have to be careful to ensure that there is a well-defined interior maximum. This is not always
the case. For example, if θ * = θ = 0 , and the probability distribution f (ε ) is uniform, the condition
∂ V ∂θ = 0 yields a minimum. A well-defined interior maximum can be attained for other distributions,
such as a truncated normal.

minimized. Given the chosen reserve requirement, θ * , of the borrowing country, this then determines

the corresponding optimal reserve requirement in the lending economy. Intuitively, (29) asserts that the
expected discounted revenue to the lender from the additional gross loan ( (1+ r)B1* ), less the loss from

the expected cost of financial intermediation triggered by marginal gross lending, equals the discounted

increase in the mean loan costs abroad (c).16 In the absence of any reserve requirement imposed by the
borrowing country (θ * = 0) (29) simplifies to

We see that in the absence of a reserve requirement in the lending country, θ = 0 , a higher reserve

requirement imposed by the borrowing block has a positive effect on welfare in the lending country.

This is because by reducing the probability of default, it reduces the expected bailout cost to the treasury

of the high income economy and thus has a positive welfare effect on that economy.

         The effect of the higher reserve requirement imposed by the borrowing country on that country's

welfare is

Using the inequality (20) one can establish that if θ = 0 then ∂V * ∂θ * > 0 . We may thus state:


        Proposition 2: Starting from a situation where there are no reserve requirements, the

        introduction of a reserve requirement by the borrowing country will raise welfare in both

        economies.


        Recalling the definition of ω , the first order condition characterizing the optimal borrowing

reserve requirement can be written as 17

and in general yields an interior solution for the borrowing country's optimal reserve requirement.18

This condition has a simple welfare interpretation -- the left hand side is the marginal benefit associated

with policy induced increase in borrowing. It increases with the expected bailout plus the difference
between the impatience of the emerging market (as measured by the subjective time discount factor ρ * ),

and the effective cost of funds borrowed from the high income country, ρ (1− θ) . The right hand side

of (32) is the marginal cost associated with policy induced increase in borrowing, as measured by the

increase in the expected cost of financial intermediation triggered by marginal borrowing. It is the



17One  can show that an interior maximum can be attained under more general conditions than for the
lending country. Specifically, it may obtain for a uniform distribution.
18In the case that ρ (1− θ) > ρ * > ρ , ∂ V * ∂θ * < 0 . Hence, the optimal reserve requirement in the borrowing

economy is to set θ * = 0 .

product of the cost of financial intermediation, µ times the increase in probability of partial defaults

triggered by the borrowing.

             Finally, note that in the absence of any bailout, the optimal level of borrowing is determined by
                                     ρ

In general, the competitive equilibrium is inefficient.                                It can be shown that in this case, optimal

borrowing from the emerging market's perspective calls for taxes on borrowing (or a corresponding

optimal requirement on borrowing). 19 This result is in line with Aizenman (1989), where in a related

context is shown the presence of "congestion externality" associated with country risk -- the marginal

borrower ignores the impact of his borrowing on the interest rate (and indirectly on the prospect of

costly default) affecting all the other borrowers.


4.3          Welfare Effects of a Bailout


             Consider now a more generous bailout as specified above by an increase in ξ . For given reserve

requirements θ,θ * the impact on the welfare of the lending economy is given by

While the direct costs of the higher bailout have an adverse effect on the welfare of the lending country,

the higher lending and the associated higher income from reserves are welfare-improving.

             The impact on welfare in the borrowing country is:

19To      verify this, suppose that the borrowing reserve requirement is zero. It can be shown that (16a)
                           f (ε * )        1 + ρ (1− θ )
implies that µ                      = 1−                       , where 1 + η1+r, B* = d ln(1+ r) d ln B1*   is the interest rate elasticity

Comparing the last two conditions, it is evident that for a given interest rate, the probability of default in
the competitive equilibrium exceeds the socially optimal probability of default. Equivalently, the
competitive equilibrium is associated with overborrowing.

From the borrowing country's perspective, the bailout and the higher borrowing and consumption that it

permits are welfare-enhancing, while the increased default risk and the associated higher monitoring

costs (passed on as higher borrowing costs) have a negative effect.

        Setting θ = 0 in (33a) and θ * = 0 in (33b) we immediately see in the former case, and can

establish in the latter, that

Given that the bailout has opposite effects in the two economies, it is of interest to determine the impact

on world welfare. Combining (33a) and (33b) we can show

Overall world welfare is impacted in two ways. First, to the extent that the discount rate in the

borrowing country exceeds that in the lending country, the benefits of the higher lending rate to the

former exceed the costs to the latter. Second, the higher monitoring costs associated with the increased

risk of default are a net welfare loss. We may thus state:


        Proposition 3b: The net impact of a more generous bailout on world welfare depends

        upon whether the net benefits of the higher lending exceed the higher monitoring costs

        imposed on the borrowing nation.


        The implication that a more generous bailout scheme has adverse effects on the lending economy

in the absence of reserve requirements is important.               It suggests that the introduction of reserve


                                                          23
requirements by reducing default risk and discouraging borrowing, and thus ameliorating some of the

adverse effects of the bailout, may be an integral part of an international bailout scheme. In particular,

we assess the effects of a more generous bailout under the assumptions that countries set their respective

reserve requirements optimally. We begin first with the lender.

       In this case see that the equilibrium conditions (16d), (16f) and the optimality condition (29)

jointly determine the equilibrium contractual lending rate, rˆ , interest rate in the emerging market, rˆ *

and the threshold break-even productivity shock, εˆ * , in terms of the given reserve requirement of the

borrowing country, θ * . The key observation from these relationships is that rˆ , rˆ * , and εˆ * are all
independent of the bailout costs, and are independent of ξ . Given εˆ * and rˆ , (16b) implies that the
                                                                            [          ]
reserve is adjusted so as to leave the net borrowing constant, i.e. ∂ (1− θˆ ) Bˆ1 ∂ξ = 0. The equilibrium

relationships (16a) and (16b) then in turn imply:

                                ∂ θˆ 1− θˆ ε *
                                    = ˆ ∫− ε bφf (ε)dε                                         (35a)

       Equation (35a) asserts that a given increase in the generosity of the bailout will increase the

lender's optimal reserve requirement. The resultant increase is higher, the higher is the expected bailout.

On the lender's side, there is a trade-off between the optimal reserve requirement and the ability to pre-

commit for a no bailout policy. The greater the credibility of such a policy, the lower is the needed

reserve requirement.

       The effect of the more generous bailout on the respective welfare in the two countries, after

allowing for the optimal adjustment of the reserve requirement is given by:

Using the fact that εˆ * , and Bˆ1 (1− θˆ ) are independent of ξ and substituting (35a) and (35b) we find

Thus we see that the increase in the optimal reserve requirement and the increase in gross lending both

raise welfare in the lending country and reduce welfare in the borrowing country, doing so by amounts

that exactly offset the direct welfare effects of the more generous bailouts, leaving net welfare in each

economy unchanged. We may summarize these important results with


        Proposition 4:         A more generous bailout increases the lender's optimal reserve

        requirement. Given this optimal response, the direct welfare effects of the more generous

        bailout are exactly neutralized, with welfare in both countries, and therefore world

        welfare, remaining unchanged.


        The results differ significantly if the optimal reserve requirement is set by the borrowing country.

The procedures are analogous and our results can be summarized. In this case, the value of εˆ * that

corresponds to the optimal reserve requirement set by the borrowing country is determined by the

borrower's optimality condition (32).            Given εˆ * , (16d) and (16f), then determine rˆ and rˆ* .            It is

straightforward to show from (32) that more generous bailouts will raise εˆ * and thereby increase the

incidence of defaults, as they will increase the marginal benefits associated with borrowing and

stimulate borrowing. 20 The rationale for this outcome is simple -- the higher borrowing is a mechanism

                                                                  ε*

to induce greater income transfer in the form of bailouts, accomplished via more frequent defaults. It

can be verified that the ultimate effect of more generous bailout on the optimal reserve requirement θ * is

ambiguous, as the increase in borrowing increases also the incidence of costly defaults with the payoff

of higher income transfer.

Bailout costs improve welfare in the borrowing country, but reduce it in the lending country. By

encouraging borrowing, to the extent that the lending country has reserve requirements, this is welfare

improving. Higher lending abroad improves foreign welfare, though the associated higher default risk

and higher monitoring costs offset that. Furthermore, summing (38a) and (38b) the qualitative effect of

a higher bailout on world welfare, when the borrower sets his reserve requirement optimally satisfies

(34). We can summarize our results with:


        Proposition 5: More generous bailouts financed by the high income block encourage

        borrowing and increase the probability of default. The effect of more generous bailouts

        on the borrower's optimal reserve requirement is ambiguous. In general, the welfare

        effects in both economies and in the world economy are ambiguous. However, welfare in

        the lending country is adversely affected in the absence of a reserve requirement in that

        economy.

5.      Global Optimal Reserve Policy


        Suppose now that an international agency is charged with determining the optimal reserve
requirements for the two nations that will maximize world welfare, W ≡ V + V * . Setting ∂W ∂θ

= ∂W ∂θ * = 0 , yields the common optimality condition:21

                        ρ* − ρ ε               µf (ε * )
                        1 + ρ * ∫ε *
                                     f (ε)dε =                                                    (39)
                                                χY*


This condition asserts that the reserve requirement should be set such that the expected marginal benefits

of transferring the funds from the high income country to the low income country just equal the

expected cost of financial intermediation triggered by the borrowing. This defines the globally optimal
degree of default risk, εˆs , say. The fact that the optimal choice of θ and θ * both lead to (39) implies

that one can be set arbitrarily (zero), while the other must be set to ensure that (39) is met.

        The similarity between (39) and (32), the optimal reserve requirement chosen by the borrowing

country, acting non-cooperatively, is quite striking. The borrowing economy adjusts the cost of funds

by the reserve requirements in the lending country, and in addition takes into account the benefits it

receives from the bailout. Assuming (i) θ = 0 , and (ii) that the probability density function is unimodal,
with the risk ε * being relatively small, so that f ′(ε * ) > 0,(32) implies that the optimal degree of default
risk chosen by the borrower exceeds the globally optimal level of risk, εˆs .

        The comparison with (29') the optimality condition for the lender acting non-cooperatively in the

absence of a borrower's reserve requirement is also interesting. The lender too has an incentive to set
the degree of default risk that exceeds the socially optimal level, εˆs , since by doing so he raises the

mean return on his loan.

        The optimality condition (39) suggests another interesting parallel between the globally optimal

reserve requirement and that obtained when the lender optimizes non-cooperatively. Equation (39)
implies that the globally optimal degree of default risk is independent of the generosity of the bailout, ξ .

It thus follows that the globally optimal reserve requirement and the corresponding degree of gross

21We   can show that (39) always ensures an interior maximum.


                                                           27
lending satisfies (35). As a consequence these adjustments neutralize the direct effects of the bailout in

accordance with (37) and Proposition 4 applies to the socially optimal reserve requirement. We may

summarize these results with


       Proposition 6: The impact of a more generous bailout on the equilibrium default risk ε *

       is critically dependent upon the existence and determination of reserve requirements. In

       the absence of reserve requirements, or if they are set optimally by the borrowing nation,

       acting non-cooperatively, more generous bailout will increase the equilibrium default

       risk. In contrast, if reserve requirements are set at their global optimum, or they are set

       by the lending nation, acting non-cooperatively, more generous bailout will leave them

       unchanged.




6.     Reserve requirements and transparency of exposure


       The rationale for imposing reserve regulations goes well beyond the arguments described thus

far. One of the surprises of the crisis in the Far East has been the large information gap between the real

exposure of several countries to short term debt and the international bank's perception about this

exposure. For example, the Economist commented on 11-Apr-98

       "Thailand's secret sales of foreign-exchange reserves in the forward markets made a
       mockery of its official reserve levels. No one had any idea how enormous South Korea's
       short-term debt burden was. This opacity worsened the crisis, suggesting global markets
       would work better if there were more information, of better quality, on a broader range of
       economic items."


       A chief achievement of a comprehensive reserve requirement may be improving the information

about the real exposure of the various countries. To understand the desirability of such a system, we

turn now to evaluate the operation of the global financial market when there is uncertainty regarding the

emerging market's aggregate debt. This will be the case if several lending banks compete without




                                                    28
sharing the information about their exposure. 22 To simplify exposition, we consider now the simplest

form of exposure uncertainty. Suppose that actual debt is

                             B1 (1− δ) with probability 0.5
                             B1 (1+ δ) with probability 0.5


where δ ≥ 0. Market participants have information only about the distribution and the expected value of
the debt, B1 The risk neutral market will price the debt such that on average, it breaks even. Hence,

         funds facing the emerging market leftwards.


         This may be established as follows. Note that the right hand side of (40') is the average value of

the expected enforcement cost plus banks revenue losses due to partial default, for different values of the

total debt. Under reasonable circumstances, this value is a concave function of the actual debt.23 The

concavity of this term implies that greater volatility of the actual debt (as is the case if δ goes up), will

reduce the right hand side of (40'), implying a drop in the value of expected debt supported by a given

interest rate. Figure 1 provides a vivid illustrating of this argument by plotting a simulation of the

dependency of the supply of credit on the exposure uncertainty. The effect of uncertainty regarding the

aggregate debt is to shift the supply of credit inwards, reducing the elasticity of the supply of credit

facing the borrower. In fact, it may dry up the market, as will be the case if we start with a significant

initial debt. In these circumstances, the imposition of reserve requirement, and the public dissemination

of the total debt exposure of the emerging market economies will shift the supply of credit outwards,

increasing the elasticity of the supply of credit facing the borrower, and may even prevent the drying up

of the market.

        These informational benefits are quite independent from the actual size of the reserve

requirement, as long as it is diligently recorded and disseminated to market participants. Note, however,

that the compliance incentives of creditors may differ from those of the debtors, and one may argue that

due to time inconsistency considerations it may be preferable to impose such a requirement on the lender

side. A side effect of improving the information about the aggregate exposure is to lower the optimal

reserve requirement -- the improve information would reduce the interest rate on a given debt level, and

would increase the credit supply responsiveness to the interest rate. Both effects would reduce the

expected default, and tend to reduce the lender's optimal reserve requirements.

7.      Concluding remarks


        Global financial markets have witnessed major instability in the 1990s. As one possible means

to overcoming this problem, Chairman Alan Greenspan recently proposed the imposition of reserve

requirements on lenders and/or borrowers. The rationale for the reserve requirements is provided by the

presence of various externalities.     On the lender side, the anticipation of bailouts introduces an

externality, where marginal lending impacts adversely the tax payer. On the borrower side, as long as

partial defaults are costly, marginal borrowing affects all agents by increasing the probability of costly

default that would impact all.

        This paper has conducted a rigorous analysis of reserve requirements on international financial

loans, analyzing their impact through the externalities on the respective welfare of the borrowing and

lending nations in the world economy. Our analysis has suggested that the introduction of reserve

requirements by either borrowers or lenders will indeed impose the kind of discipline on the

international financial market envisaged by Chairman Greenspan. Borrowing will decline, and so will

default risk, reducing the necessity for continuing bailouts.

        The introduction of reserve requirements will improve welfare in both the lending and borrowing

economies. But the design of the optimal reserve requirement in a decentralized world is a delicate

matter and both the optimal lender's reserve requirement and the optimal borrower's requirement have

both attractive and unattractive features. The choice of an optimal reserve requirement from a lender's

standpoint may or may not yield an interior optimum, depending upon the nature of the probability

distribution determining the risk in the borrowing economy. However, if an interior optimum exists, it

has the characteristic that the corresponding degree of default risk is independent of the generosity of the

bailout, just as is the case for the globally optimal reserve requirements. On the other hand, while the

attainment of an interior optimal reserve requirement for the borrower is almost always ensured, it has

the undesirable characteristic that more generous bailouts are associated with higher degrees of default

risk.   The ultimate assessment of the desirability of the reserve requirement scheme rests on the

assessment of the credibility of "no bailout" policy. As the record of the nineties suggests, we are far

away from resolving these time inconsistency difficulties, suggesting that reserve requirement should be

considered seriously as a valuable policy option.
