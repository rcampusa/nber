                                              ABSTRACT

Economic theory predicts that employer-provided retiree health insurance benefits crowd-out household
wealth accumulation. Nevertheless, there is little research on the impacts of retiree health insurance
on wealth accruals, so this paper utilizes a unique data file on three baseline cohorts from the Health
and Retirement Study to explore how employer-provided retiree health insurance may influence net
household wealth among public sector employees, where retiree healthcare benefits are still quite prevalent.
We find that most full-time public sector employees who anticipate receiving employer-provided health
insurance coverage in retirement save less than their private sector uncovered counterparts.

                         How Does Retiree Health Insurance
                      Influence Public Sector Employee Saving?

       In the United States, the cost of health care insurance for retirees can be very steep

indeed. For retirees too young for Medicare, estimated annual health insurance premiums easily

amount to $14,000 per year for a couple.1 Even for those age 65 and older who are covered by

Medicare, out-of-pocket costs for a median couple can be $5,300 per year, and at the 90th

percentile, annual expenses can total $110,000 for a couple.2 Accordingly, as workers plan for

and look ahead to retirement, they increasingly must recognize that health insurance costs may

profoundly affect both their health and their ability to consume other goods and services during

their golden years.

       Employees who expect that they will be included in employer-provided group retiree

health insurance coverage will most likely need to save less during their working careers due to

the generosity of this benefit. For this reason, economic theory would predict that employer-

provided retiree health insurance (RHI) benefits would be hypothesized to have a crowding-out

effect on private household wealth accumulation, not dissimilar to that reported elsewhere for

employer pensions, Social Security, and Medicare. 3 An interesting theoretical question is

online calculators for a hypothetical couple both age 60 for PPO coverage with no deductible and
$20/$30         co-payments        in       the       State      of      Pennsylvania;       c.f.

  This assumes each spouse incurs the median out of pocket spending of $2,500/year in 2008, for
a total of $5,335 for a couple in 2012. At the 90th percentile, annual expenses would total
$110,000 for the same couple. See Hoffman and Jackson (2012).

  For instance, Gruber and Yelowitz (1999) find a strong negative effect of Medicaid eligibility
on wealth. Focusing on elderly households, Levin (1995) reported some evidence for
precautionary saving by those having little health insurance, while Starr-McCluer (1996) found
only mixed evidence that U.S. households facing greater health risks accumulated more wealth
(the latter study did not differentiate active worker coverage from prospective retiree health
insurance, however). Guariglia and Rossi (2004) use UK data and discern some crowding-out of
                                                                                               2


whether this crowding-out should be dollar for dollar or somewhat less. The magnitude of any

reductions in retirement saving would be influenced by the extent of the employer subsidy (the

proportion of the premium paid by the employer), the expected value of the promised health

insurance, whether individual expects to achieve the required years of service to qualify for the

benefit, whether the individual expects the employer will honor the promise to provide the

insurance, and whether spouses/partners and dependents can be included in the plan.

       While numerous studies have previously estimated the impacts of pension and Social

Security benefits on household retirement asset accumulation,4 we are unaware of any similar

research on the impacts of retiree health insurance per se. Accordingly, the present paper

explores how employer-provided retiree health insurance may influence net household wealth

among public sector employees, where RHI benefits are still quite prevalent.

       In the U.S., most private sector U.S. firms no longer offer post-retirement healthcare

benefits (Fronstin 2010). By contrast, most public sector employers do continue to offer job-

based health insurance to retired employees (Clark and Morrill 2010). Still, the rising cost of

RHI is beginning to challenge state and local governments’ ability to continue providing this

benefit over time (GAO 2007; Moran 2010). In fact, of late, some public employers have begun

to implement RHI plan constraints by, for instance, limiting coverage to workers with long

tenure and shifting an increasing proportion of the plan premiums to retirees. Some public

employers have also imposed cost-shifting on active and retired workers (Coggburn 2010).

These changes are all taking place against the backdrop of national changes in the healthcare


private saving when publicly provided health coverage is of poor quality. Yet none of these
studies explicitly focuses on retiree health insurance among public versus private sector
employees, as we do here.
4
  For instance Hurd, Michaud, and Rohwedder (2012: 107) use cross-national micro datasets to
conclude that “extra dollar of pension wealth depresses accumulated financial assets around
the time of retirement by 22 cents.”
                                                                                                3


environment, particularly with the 2010 passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The law’s

impacts, as we argue below, will be felt by public sector employers who offer health plans for

active as well as retired employees.5

       Economists and policy analysts have devoted considerable attention to examining the

impact of pension plans on individual saving and retirement decisions. Nevertheless, only a

handful of studies asks how RHI shapes key lifetime choices influencing retiree wellbeing, to

date. The present paper offers the first comprehensive empirical analysis of the impact of retiree

health plans of wealth accumulation of public employees. In what follows, we begin with a

review of retiree health plans in the public sector. Next, we evaluate how the promise of

subsidized retiree health insurance affects the need to save for retirement. As noted, theory

suggests that workers covered by retiree health insurance would be likely to save less and retire

earlier than comparable workers not covered by this type of retirement plan. Here we focus on

the first hypothesis; Shoven and Slavov (2013) have a recent paper addressing the second.

       To conduct the empirical analysis, we utilize a unique datafile on three baseline cohorts

surveyed in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Our general strategy is to first generate

household wealth values using the HRS, and then we compare these wealth values across

workers covered by retiree health insurance plans versus those of their non-insured counterparts.

We control for whether the workers held jobs with Federal, state, or local government

employers, or whether they worked for the private sector. A variety of controls is also taken into

account as will be detailed below, so as to make the attributes of the employees as similar as

possible.

       Our key findings may be summarized as follows:

5
 For instance Segal (2013:7) states that “[s]ponsors of state employee plans will be able to
compare the cost and value of those plan offerings to what the public Exchanges are offering.”
                                                                                                  4


   -   Most full-time public employees anticipate having health plan retiree coverage, unlike

       many private sector workers;

   -   Public sector employees covered by retiree health plans had substantially less wealth than

       similar private sector employees without retiree health insurance. In our data, Federal

       workers had about $91,000 (20%) less net wealth and $97,000 (31%) less financial

       wealth than private sector employees lacking RHI; state/local workers with RHI

       accumulated about $72,000 (or 16%) less net wealth, and $77,000 (or 24%) less in

       financial wealth than their uninsured private sector counterparts.

   -   After controlling on socioeconomic status and differences in pension coverage, net

       wealth for Federal employees was $107,000 less than for workers without RHI, and the

       state/local difference in net wealth was $73,000.

In a final section, we consider how state and local government RHI benefits might respond to the

implementation of the Affordable Care Act taking effect January of 2014. We suggest that the

introduction of state insurance exchanges and Federal subsidies for low-income retirees may

alter the labor market for public sector employees in important ways.



I. Retiree Health Plans in the Public Sector

       To clarify the role of retiree health insurance in retirement planning, we begin by

examining how these plans vary across state, local, and Federal government employers, and over

time. Specific plan impacts would be anticipated to depend on plan generosity and the extent of

the RHI subsidy provided by the employer.

       Most full-time U.S. public sector employees today are covered by health plans that

extend benefits to retirees. Yet these plans differ in their generosity and eligibility requirements
                                                                                                   5


across governmental units (Clark and Morrill 2010). Also in the public sector, the nature of the

benefit and its cost may depend on individual worker characteristics. For instance, state or local

governments often pay a higher percentage of the RHI premium for longer tenured workers.

        In what follows, we briefly review key provisions of retiree health insurance plans for

each of the main groups of public sector workers: state employees and teachers, local

government workers, and Federal employees.6

A. Retiree Health Plans for State Employees and Teachers.

        All states provide health insurance for their full-time active employees, and they also

usually offer retired employees the opportunity to participate in some form of state-run health

plan for retirees. In some cases, the health plans for general state employees also cover teachers;

in other states, there are separate health plans for teachers; and in yet other states, health

insurance for teachers is the responsibility of local school districts.7

        Naturally, how much the RHI plans are worth to retirees depends, in part, on the share of

the premiums that employers pick up. An important way in which states differ has to do with

how much the RHI plans cost versus the share of the insurance premium paid by the employer on

behalf of the retiree. The GAO (2007) reported that, in 2006, 14 states paid the entire RHI

premium for retirees who met specific age and service criteria. At the same time, 14 other states

offered access only to the state health plans, so retirees had to pay all of the insurance premiums.

        Of course, even without an employer subsidy, allowing access only still provides value to

retired state employees as they need not be underwritten to gain access to the pool. Additionally,

  Various reports have highlighted the differences in retiree health plans across the states and the
unfunded liabilities associated with these plans (Clark and Morrill, 2010; Franzel and Brown
2012, Pew Center on the States, 2010, 2011, 2013).
                                                                                                     6


premiums for public retiree health plans are often determined by blending active workers and

retirees in the same risk pool, thereby also offering retirees a subsidy. The remainder of the states

pays some portion of the premium, often as a function of years of service and date of

employment.

          Another key issue is that in recent years, retiree health plan coverage and benefit

provisions have been altered, often in response to rising health care costs. In particular, eligibility

requirements for coverage and subsidies have changed, along with deductibles, co-payments,

plan provisions, and plan premiums. Over time, eligibility requirements for state subsidized RHI

have become increasingly restrictive. For example, in 2007, the State of California OPEB

Valuation Report noted several changes for retiree health benefits as follows:8 retirees with only

five years of service and first hired prior to January 1, 1985 were eligible to receive 100 percent

of the state’s contribution toward the member’s health premium upon retirement, but those first

hired January 1, 1985 - January 1, 1989 with 10 years of service were eligible for 100 percent of

the state’s contribution to their premiums. Workers with fewer than 10 years of service received

a subsidy equal to years of service times 10 percent. Finally, retirees first hired after January 1,

1989 with fewer than 10 years of service received no subsidy; for those with 10+ years of

service, the state paid 50 percent of the premium and each year over 10 boosted the employer’s

portion of the premium by an additional five percent of the premium. The State paid 100 percent

of the premium for workers with 20 or more years of service. In this way, a California public

employee hired prior to 1985 could be eligible for a 100 percent premium subsidy after five

years of service, whereas someone hired more recently might be required to have 10 years of




8
    State of California (2011).
                                                                                                  7


service to receive a 50 percent premium subsidy, and only those with 20 or more years of service

would receive the 100 percent subsidy.

       Whether workers believe that employers’ RHI promises will be kept is intimately linked

to the point that few public sector employers have established substantial trust funds dedicated to

pay for retiree health costs (Franzel and Brown 2012, Pew Center on the States 2010, 2011,

2013). Accordingly, some might see these RHI promises as involving a lower level of security

than offered by public pension promises, since the latter are somewhat better funded.9 Such a

concern may be reinforced by the fact that retiree health plans have changed frequently with cost

increases sometimes imposed retroactively on retirees. For instance, Clark and Morrill (2010)

surveyed several state administrators responsible for retiree health plans who suggested that plan

modifications would curtail the fraction of future state retirees eligible to receive retiree health

insurance. They also anticipated limiting future state subsidies for RHI premiums. The large

unfunded accrued liabilities associated with RHI plans at all levels of government, combined

with recent changes in these plans, have no doubt affected public sector workers’ views of the

likelihood they will recent promised health care benefits. To the extent that benefit security is

eroded, this could reduce workers’ expectations of promised future health insurance and decrease

the effect of coverage on retirement and saving decisions. For all these reasons, the value of

retiree health insurance for retirees from the same state with similar years of service can vary

depending on employees’ dates of hire.

B. Local Government Retiree Health Plans.

       Little systematic information is available regarding the retiree health insurance plans

offered by local governments across the country. The Pew Center on the States (2013) recently

9
 Nevertheless, public sector pensions overall are far from fully funded; see for instance Novy-
Marx and Rauh (2011).
                                                                                                       8


conducted an analysis of 61 cities ranging in population size from New York City to Burlington,

Vermont. Collectively, these cities represented 45 percent of all municipal employees, and the

study covered 100 local government retiree health plans. The authors found that all cities studied

offered retiree health plans, but only a few had accumulated significant assets in a trust fund to

prepare for promised future expenditures. Thus, the retiree health plans they examined faced

liabilities totaling $126 billion for the 61 cities, but the cities had assets of only $8 billion

backing these promises.

          Access to retiree health plans also varies considerably across the local employee

workforce: some cities provide access only, while New York City pays 100 percent of the

premium for eligible retirees younger than age 65. By contrast, Denver provides a dollar amount

subsidy that varies with years of service. The Pew Center on the States (2013) has noted,

however, that cities have been modifying retiree health plans rather rapidly of late, in an effort to

reduce the growing cost of this benefit.10

C. Health Insurance for Retired Federal Employees.

          The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program has several different plans

from which workers and retirees can choose including a Fee-for-Service plan, Preferred Provider

Organization, Health Maintenance Organizations, Point of Service, High Deductible Health Plan,

and Consumer Driven Health Plan. Accordingly, Federal workers’ retiree health insurance will

differ from one to another retiree, depending on the health plan elected. Most crucially, benefits

do not change as individuals move from active to retired status (U.S. Office of Personnel

Management 2013). Federal retirees pay the same premiums and receive the same benefits as




10
     Clark and Morrill (2011) provide a detailed report on the retiree health plans of three cities.
                                                                                                9


active Federal employees. Federal retirees are eligible to continue health benefits coverage if

they meet the following requirements:

         They are entitled to an immediate annuity under a Federal retirement system for
        civilian employees; and

         They have been continuously enrolled (or covered as a family member) in any FEHB
        plan(s) for the five years of service immediately before the date the annuity starts.

        Premiums are generally the same for active and retired Federal workers; that is, most

retirees share the cost of health insurance premiums with the government in the same way that

they did while actively employed. Across the board, government contributions equal the lesser of

72 percent of the overall weighted average, or 75 percent of the total RHI plan premium.

Temporary employees do not receive a government contribution toward the cost of their health

insurance (U.S. Office of Personnel Management 2013).

 D. Measuring the Value of Retiree Health Insurance.

        It is very difficult to determine an actual value of employer provided health insurance to

individual workers. There are several potential methods of assessing the value of such coverage.

First, we can look to the market and observe the cost to retirees of various ages of purchasing an

individual policy with comparable health insurance. Second, we could attempt to determine the

amount of money individuals without employer provided RHI actually spend on health insurance

before and after becoming eligible for Medicare. Third, we might assign the per person cost paid

by the employer as a value to the employee. While each of these have some merit, we limit our

analysis to the first method in an effort to determine a dollar value to the insurance provided to

retirees.

        Earlier we reported statistics indicating that annual premium for health insurance for a

retired individual averaged approximately $7,000 per year for a retired individual (see footnotes
                                                                                                  10


1 and 2). Assuming that a public employee retires at age 58 and purchases health insurance for

seven years prior to becoming Medicare-eligible, the present value of fully subsidized insurance,

using a 3% discount rate would be approximately $43,600. If the retiree survived for another 20

years after age 65 and if the post-Medicare value of the insurance was $2,650 per year, then the

present value of this Medigap insurance at age 58 would be an additional $32,000. Hence the

total value of a lifetime of fully subsidized RHI would be approximately $75,000. Obviously,

this value depends on the individual’s retirement age and life expectancy, as well as the

proportion of the premium paid by the employer versus the retiree. The value of RHI to the

worker is even greater if retirees are allowed to cover their spouses/partners and dependents. We

now examine how the extent of the subsidy varies across public employees.

       Our earlier description of public sector retiree health insurance plans in the United States

illustrates that it is difficult to accurately measure the value of this benefit to individual public

sector employees and retirees. The problem is particularly acute in the state and local public

sectors, as plan rules vary considerably across states and local governmental units. In addition,

substantial changes have been made to these plans over time, so the value of a RHI promise

varies with years of service, age, qualification for a pension benefit, and date of hire. These

factors imply that the generosity of RHI to employees of the same governmental unit can be

substantially different. Finally, the large unfunded liabilities of state and local RHI plans may

raise doubts that these employers will honor these commitments in the long term. Each of these

issues indicates the existence of measurement error in the RHI valuation, a point to which we

shall return later. For all of these reasons, we concluded that it is impossible using the HRS data

to determine the value of RHI to respondents who are nearing retirement and the extent of any

employer subsidy to state and local employees. Because of the changing eligibility conditions of
                                                                                              11


state plans and general lack of information on the coverage of local employees, the only possible

measure of RHI for state and local employees is their own self-reported RHI coverage. It is

important to note that the HRS does not include information that would allow us to distinguish

state from local employees.

       Somewhat less of a measurement problem arises for Federal employees, as all are

covered by the same plan which has undergone relatively few changes over time. Accordingly,

in the analysis to follow, it is anticipated that the estimated impact of RHI on wealth

accumulation will be estimated with more precision for Federal workers, compared to results for

employees in the state and local sectors. The two basic requirements for eligibility for Federal

RHI are receiving a Federal pension and having five years of coverage in the Federal health plan.

Following a similar method used by HRS in valuing pension coverage, we assume that all

Federal employees meeting these two eligibility conditions can reasonably expect to be covered

by RHI coverage when they retire from Federal employment.            Our sample includes only

respondents who were employed in the first year they were included in the HRS and who had

five years of service with their current employers. It seems reasonable to assume that all full-

time Federal employees are covered by the Federal health plan. Thus, we assign RHI coverage

to all full-time Federal employees in our sample who also reported that they were covered by

pensions on their current jobs.



II. How Retiree Health Insurance Can Shape Saving and Retirement Decisions

       A life cycle model of economic behavior predicts that people will strive to smooth utility

across time, saving while working so as to enjoy a reasonable lifestyle in retirement. Since

higher retiree consumption must be financed by reduced work life consumption, if people behave

rationally, their retirement saving plans would be anticipated to take into account anticipated
                                                                                                 12


retirement income sources. For instance, expected Social Security benefits have been shown to

partly offset household retirement saving needs.11

       Early research12 generated a wide range of estimates on the extent of saving reduction per

dollar of pension or Social Security wealth using aggregate data. Subsequent analyses using

individual survey data did not narrow the estimated effect of retirement benefits on wealth

accumulation very much. Thus, Hubbard (1986) found very small offsets ($0.16 per dollar of

pension wealth), while Gale (1998) reported very large offsets ($0.82 per dollar of pension

wealth). Gustman and Steinmeier’s (1999) estimates were around the midpoint ($0.50 per dollar

of pension wealth). There is a related debate over whether tax-favored employer pensions and

IRAs increased total national saving or not (c.f., Venti and Wise, 1996; Engen, Gale, and Scholz,

1996), with the bulk of the evidence suggesting that they do have a positive net effect, albeit with

some crowd-out.

       Similarly, employer pensions and retiree health plans would be thought to directly reduce

worker saving needs, given that people anticipate a flow of income or a specified level of health

insurance in retirement. Of course, some measurement and statistical complexities arise in the

case of RHI that must be explicitly noted. First, and as noted above, the value of retiree health

insurance coverage itself is difficult to measure and uncertain over time since employers

regularly amend plans via changes in deductibles, co-payments, co-insurance, and premiums.

Second, promised benefits from health insurance are less secure than are expected pension

benefits due to the lack of pre-funding of RHI benefits. Third, existing datasets have little

information on the current value of these benefits, and retiree health values will differ (even for

the same employer) depending on when employees are hired and their length of tenure at

retirement. Indeed, most of these factors will not actually be measured until employees retire.

       When determining the impact of retiree health insurance on saving for retirement, another

factor worth noting is the impact that retiree health plans can have on workers’ retirement ages.

If the existence of the RHI induces workers to retire younger than they would have otherwise,

they will then need to save more to finance their retirement consumption over longer periods of

time. The jointness of the decision of retirement saving and age of retirement adds complexity to

determining how individuals covered by retiree health insurance will adjust their retirement

saving.13

       It is also of note that employers who provide RHI almost always also offer some type of

pension plan as well. These pension and health insurance benefits are similar in that they both

incorporate incentives affecting firms’ ability to attract, retain, and ultimately retire a high-

quality workforce (Lumsdaine and Mitchell 1999). From the employee’s viewpoint, these two

benefits would thus jointly affect their private saving patterns and ultimate retirement ages. This

means that, when estimating the impact of retiree health coverage on individual retirement

saving and retirement, it is important to control for the retirement effects of pension plans as

well. Moreover, as French and Jones (2011) note, people having stronger preferences for leisure

may select into jobs offering retiree health coverage, and these jobs are also those providing

more generous pension coverage. Failure to account for these factors could bias the estimated

impact of retiree health coverage on retirement.



13
   Shoven and Slavov (2013) examine whether retiree health insurance influences the age of
retirement for public employees. Recent studies on impacts of retiree health insurance include
Blau and Gilleskie (2001, 2008), Gustman and Steinmeier (1994), French and Jones (2011),
Karoly and Rogowski (1994), Robinson and Clark (2010), Madrian (1994), and Nyce et al.
(2013).
                                                                                               14


       A final issue worth noting is that uncertainty around medical costs can also influence

precautionary saving per se. Kotlikoff’s (1988) work suggested that uncertain health expenses

had a large positive impact on aggregate saving, whereas actuarially fair health insurance

reduced saving. More recently, several authors have argued that uncertain medical expenses play

a potentially large role in explaining the saving behavior of older Americans;14 French and Jones

(2011) concluded that individuals who can self-insure through saving will value retiree health

coverage less. Accordingly, RHI can depress personal wealth accrual not only because these

benefits represent a source of wealth, but because they reduce older households’ exposure to

uncertainty and hence curtail the need for precautionary saving.

       Based on this analysis, how might workers adjust their retirement saving behavior when

their employers offer RHI? First, let us assume that employees believe with certainty that they

will reach their expected retirement ages and qualify for RHI, that their employers will honor the

promise to provide health insurance in retirement, and that employees value the RHI benefit at

least as much as the cost of a comparable privately-purchased health insurance policy. Second,

assume that in the absence of the employer-provided RHI, comparable workers would be saving

enough to purchase a similar policy in retirement. In such an environment, we could anticipate

that workers would reduce their retirement saving approximately dollar-for-dollar, reflecting the

value of RHI. Nevertheless, we know from the empirical studies of offsets associated with

coverage by defined benefit pension (DB) plans and Social Security that the tradeoff is unlikely

to be exact. Moreover, in the HRS dataset, we have no measure of how much employees value

the RHI provided, since the survey does not report the degree of employer subsidy for those with

this insurance. Accordingly, in what follows, we measure the empirical magnitude of the average

tradeoff in the data between RHI and wealth accumulations, but we cannot determine whether

employees value the insurance as much as what the private market premium would be.



III. Dataset Construction

       To analyze how retiree health insurance is associated with the key outcomes of interest

here, we employ three baseline waves from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS).

Specifically, we extracted working individuals in the original HRS group (interviewed in 1992),

the War Babies (WB) group (2004), and the Early Baby Boomer (EBB) group (2010). We

required that all respondents had information on job tenure and their state of residence at

baseline, as well as responses to the questions on whether they expected retiree health insurance.

Our analysis, below, focuses exclusively on employees with at least five years of employment

with their current employer to ensure that these individuals were likely to be eligible for retiree

health coverage if such was offered. The size of our analysis sample is 6,650.

A. HRS Variables

       Several HRS datasets were used to generate the variables used in our analysis. Where

possible, we relied on Core HRS variables from the RAND files (St. Clair et al. 2011)

supplemented with the relevant raw HRS data files for additional variables. We also obtained

permission to use the restricted occupation detail (HRS 2010) identifying which individuals were

teachers and local employees at baseline, since most teachers are covered by state-wide retiree

pension and medical plans.15




15
  We also received permission to use the restricted geographic detail records (HRS 2009) for
respondents’ state of residence at baseline, which we used to infer the portion of premium paid
by the employer for state retiree health insurance coverage (from GAO 2007). However we do
not report results from this analysis here because the subsidy within a state varies by hire date
                                                                                                  16


       Our analytic sample thus included all respondents self-reported as working full or part

time at baseline, having job tenure over five years, and for whom we had state of residence

information and a response to whether the individual expected to receive retiree health insurance.

Only non-proxy interviews are used; the Appendix provides further details on our data

construction process.

B. Wealth Variables

       Table 1 summarizes the key variables used in the empirical analysis. Focusing first on

the wealth measures of greatest interest here, we incorporate defined contribution (DC) wealth in

our measures of total and financial wealth, while we control on DB wealth in the estimating

equations. This is because workers tend to have to choose to participate in their DC plans, decide

how much to contribute, and how to invest the funds. Accordingly, we incorporate DC balances

in the dependent variables measuring net total wealth and net financial wealth. By contrast,

employees have little if any direct input into their employers’ DB plans (other than taking a job

at a firm with such a plan), and few employees have much understanding of DB benefits (Chan

and Stevens 2008). For this reason, the analysis to follow includes employees’ defined benefit

pension wealth values (if any) in the set of factors accounting for financial and total saving.

Table 1 here

       The specific values of DB and DC wealth used in the present analysis are drawn from

Gustman et al. (2010),16 and all other asset and debt values are taken from the RAND-cleaned




and tenure, and we could not control for these variables; additionally not all state employees are
covered by the same state plan.
16
   The HRS provides, under restricted conditions, data on DC and DB pension wealth generated
by and reported in the Gustman et al. (2010) volume. Those authors also explain how the pension
wealth data elements were constructed.
                                                                                                17


version of the HRS. 17 Average total net wealth in our sample is approximately $436,000 and net

financial wealth is $302,000 (in 2010$), values reflective of the relatively older age group under

study. Total net wealth includes values reported for checking/saving/money market accounts,

stock/bond/mutual fund/investment trusts, as well as the net values of primary/secondary

residences, vehicles, business, and IRA/Keogh/DC plan values, minus debt. Total net financial

wealth subtracts from net wealth the net values of residences.18

       Table 2 arrays these two wealth measures according to whether the respondent had retiree

health insurance, and whether the respondent was a Federal, state/local, military, private sector,

or private (but formerly public sector) employee. Results indicate that, overall, workers with no

retiree health insurance accumulated more net wealth and financial wealth than their counterparts

without RHI. For instance, Federal workers reported an average net wealth of $363,400

compared to $454,536 of respondents without RHI implying that Federal employees had about

$91,000 (20%) less net wealth and $97,000 (31%) less financial wealth than private sector

employees without any retiree health insurance. State/local workers with RHI accumulated about

$72,000 (or 16%) less net wealth, and $77,000 (or 24%) less in financial wealth, than their

uninsured private sector counterparts.

       Private sector workers anticipating RHI also saved less, on the order of $64,000 (14%)

less in net wealth, and $53,000 (17%) less in financial wealth. At least in the aggregate, then, it

appears that our hypothesis is supported: workers anticipating receiving RHI did accumulate less

wealth than those without such promises.       We also tested whether these four groups had

are winsorized at the top and bottom 0.5%.
18
   Due to the fact that Social Security wealth has not been computed in a systematic and coherent
way for all the HRS waves analyzed here, net and financial wealth includes expected pensions
but not Social Security wealth.
                                                                                               18


significantly different mean accumulated wealth depending on coverage by RHI. Interestingly,

mean wealth for those covered by RHI for Federal, state and local, and private sector employees

was significantly lower than mean wealth held by those lacking the promise of employer-

provided retiree health insurance. In addition, mean wealth levels for those with RHI across the

three public sector employee groups were not significantly different from each other.

Table 2 here

C. Employment Sector Variables

       To establish whether each worker was employed by a public or private employer, we use

HRS questions on employment sector. These questions, however, provided less detail prior to

2006 than afterwards. Before 2006, the HRS asked “Have you ever been employed by a unit of a

state, county, or local government?” and “Aside from military service, have you ever been

employed by the Federal government?” If the respondent said no to both questions, he was

classified as working in the private sector. If the respondent said yes to the first question, a

follow-up question was asked: “During what years were you employed?” in that sector. If the

individual’s years of employment in a state/county/local government included the baseline year,

we classified him as working in the state and local sector. If his public sector employment was in

the past, we classified him as currently employed in the private sector but having had a past

public sector job. From 2006 forward, the HRS asked: “Are you employed by the government at

the Federal, state, or local level?” If the respondent answered in the negative, we classified him

as a private sector worker. If he answered in the affirmative, a follow-up question was used to

distinguish employment sector further “Would that be the Federal, state, or local government?”
                                                                                               19


Accordingly we classified individuals as Federal, versus state and local, based on this follow-up

question.19

       In this way, we were able to identify approximately 5% of our sample as employed by the

Federal government, 15% by state and local governments, 50% by private sector employers, and

30% which had worked in the public sector in the past but were currently private sector

employees (see Table 1).

D. Retiree Health Insurance Variable

       The variation in benefit values within and across RHI plans and employees described

above makes it difficult to impute a single dollar value to the benefit for respondents in a

national survey such as the Health and Retirement Study. Accordingly, we assessed whether a

respondent anticipated retiree health insurance (RHI) by relying on the HRS Core questions

asked at baseline for state and local employees and our imputation of coverage for Federal

employees as described above. Table 1 indicates that 47% of the sample indicated it anticipated

or was receiving employer-provided retiree health insurance.

E. Socioeconomic Controls

       To be able to compare wealth patterns more comprehensively, we hold constant several

socioeconomic characteristic controls including the employee’s age, marital status,

race/ethnicity, sex, educational status, number of children, health status, years on the job, and

years worked. Table 1 shows that, in our sample, the average age was about 54, about half were

male, 80% White, and 8% Hispanic. Around one-fifth had less than a high school education, just

under half had completed high school, and almost 30% had at least some college. The majority,

81%, was married and averaged about three children; some 13% declared themselves in poor or


19
  If the respondent said he was in the military currently, or his years of active service included
the baseline year, he was classified as working in the military and excluded from the sample.
                                                                                               20


fair health, and on average they had worked for 32 years (with 18 years on the current job).

Approximately two-thirds of the sample came from the first round HRS, with the remainder

representing the War Babies, and Early Baby Boomer cohorts. The empirical specification also

includes the respondent’s expected retirement age and a cognition measure. 20 In general,

individuals expecting to retire earlier would need to save more for a longer retirement.



IV. Multivariate Regression Results

       Next, we summarize our multivariate results from OLS regression analysis of the two key

wealth measures of special interest here. These outcomes are related to the retiree health

insurance variables described above, holding constant differences in demographic, income, and

pension factors. Our wealth equations control on measures of current annual earnings, years of

tenure on the job, and education, all of which are strong proxies for lifetime earnings. We also

present results for the entire sample as a whole, and separately for married couples only.

A. Entire Sample

       The first column of coefficient estimates in Table 3 reports on the factors associated with

net wealth, whereas the second focuses on financial wealth, for the entire sample.

Table 3 here

       The first four rows of the table indicate the differential impact of being a worker with

retiree health insurance coverage in each of the sectors, compared to not having RHI, and

controlling on other differences across the employee population. The RHI terms remain



20
  The respondent’s planned retirement age from the RAND file is derived from a variable which
asks the respondent about retirement plans, along with another variable asking when the
respondent thinks he/she will stop work or retire. The cognition variable we use is also taken
from the RAND file, and it refers to the sum of total recall and mental status indices. See St.
Claire et al. (2011) and RAND (2011).
                                                                                                  21


economically large and statistically significant for both Federal and state and local employees in

both equations. As hypothesized above, the coefficient for Federal government employees is

measured quite precisely. The result implies that this group accumulated $107,408 less net

wealth and $92,360 less financial wealth compared to employees without RHI, after controlling

for other factors. These effects are 118% and 95% as large as the differences in means shown in

Table 2.

       Also, as hypothesized, RHI coverage coefficients for state and local employees are

estimated less precisely although still significant at the 10 percent level. These estimates indicate

that comparable state and local employees with RHI accumulated about $72,534 less net wealth.

And finally, private sector workers with a RHI promise (including those who held public sector

jobs in the past) also are estimated to have saved less but the estimated coefficient is not

significantly different from zero.

       An interesting additional finding of our analysis is the estimate that higher expected

wealth from defined benefit plans is consistent with lower household wealth accumulation. We

find that each additional $1,000 of DB pension wealth resulted in a reduction of $178 in

accumulated net wealth and $164 of financial wealth. Both coefficients are statistically

significant at the 1% confidence level. These estimates seem sensible in view of the fact that

many DB plans are substantially underfunded at present, and so their benefit stream would likely

be discounted by participants both due to this risk and due to the fact that they will be paid in

years hence.

       The other control variables behave as expected, with saving levels significantly higher for

Whites (lower for Hispanics), higher for the better paid, better educated, and married, lower for

those having many children, and lower for those in poor health. The results also indicate that
                                                                                                  22


workers planning on retiring later saved significantly less than those anticipating quitting earlier.

On average, a respondent expecting to retire one year earlier held additional wealth of $10,863.

And finally, a respondent having a higher cognition score by a standard deviation above average

(i.e., two points above the average of 25) would be expected to have saved about $10,800 more.

        In sum, we find evidence supportive of the hypothesis that workers covered by retiree

health insurance saved less than comparable workers not covered by RHI. Moreover, the group

anticipating what is likely the most secure RHI promise - Federal benefits – saved the least.

B. Results for Married Couples

        To investigate the importance of spousal characteristics on household saving, we next

restrict the sample to include only respondents who reported being currently married. This is

because we cannot allocate jointly-owned assets to one partner or the other. Our analysis sample

here now includes the 5,393 married respondents who reported information on their spouses’

educational attainment, current working status, RHI coverage, and years of service on current job

(if any).

        Table 4 reports models for net wealth and net financial wealth for the married sample

using a specification that includes all variables used in Table 3 plus the spousal variables

described above. Results show that the estimated effects of the respondent’s RHI coverage are

very similar to those reported previously. Interestingly, the estimated coefficient on the spouse

having RHI also indicates that spousal RHI coverage further depresses household wealth

accumulation. Estimates of the other variables in the two tables are very similar.

Table 4 here
                                                                                               23


       In other words, controlling for marital status, spousal human capital, retiree health

coverage, work status, and other factors, supports our main conclusion that public sector

employees have saved less due to having generous retiree health insurance.



V. Thoughts on How the ACA Might Affect Our Results

       The recently passed Affordable Care Act is anticipated to change the way many

employers think about health insurance benefits. In particular, from January 2014, the ACA will

de-link what has long been the primary connection between employment and health insurance

for many Americans. While there is considerable controversy about what exactly might happen

as a consequence, here we offer some preliminary thoughts focusing particularly on RHI offered

to retiring public sector workers.

       How employers respond to the ACA in the context of RHI will depend on how job-linked

benefits compare to those that might be offered through the Health Exchanges established under

the act (Pauly and Duggan 2013). The exchanges will surely make health insurance more

accessible to those currently lacking insurance, some of whom are retirees. Moreover, premiums

for many workers and retirees will be subsidized on a sliding scale for those with incomes below

400 percent of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). It has been estimated that the subsidies will

cover many individuals, especially those retiring in their 50s and 60s.21

       Accordingly, to the extent that it will become less expensive for some employees to elect

ACA-based health insurance than to take up employer-provided RHI, this reduction in the price



21
  Premiums for health insurance purchased through the exchanges is to cost no more than two
percent of income for incomes up to 133% of the FPL, and up to 9.5% of income for those
earning 3-400% of the FPL. These premiums refer to the second lowest-cost offering in the
“Silver Plan” category; it is estimated that these plans will cover approximately 70% of the total
cost of medical care.
                                                                                                  24


of retiree health insurance is likely to make some employees and retirees better off. It is also

worth noting that wages could rise at firms that drop their RHI benefit offerings (Burtless and

Milusheva 2013), passing on cost-savings that employers might experience.

       The existence of the exchanges and the Federal subsidy could have implications for our

results presented earlier, particularly for workers who retire prior to eligibility for Medicare at

age 65. Retirees who were not covered by retiree health on their jobs will now need less wealth

in retirement, so the difference in wealth accumulation between those with and without

employer-provided RHI would be predicted to decline. Moreover, market-driven wage

differentials between those with and without employer-provided RHI would also be predicted to

diminish, as a result of the ACA.22



VI. Conclusions

       Economic theory predicts that employer-provided group retiree health insurance coverage

can reduce employee incentives to save during their working careers. The literature has devoted

much attention to measuring crowding-out by pensions, Social Security, Medicare, and national

health insurance, little research to date has considered whether rather generous employer-

provided retiree health insurance benefits could have the same effect. Our paper offers the first

comprehensive empirical analysis of the impact of retiree health plans of wealth accumulation of

public employees.

       Using HRS data, we show that public sector employees covered by retiree health plans

had substantially less wealth than otherwise similar private sector employees lacking retiree

22
   It has been suggested that some public sector employers will curtail employees’ work hours to
avoid having to provide them with benefits (Merline 2013). Unless earnings are raised to
compensate for the loss in benefits, this could make it difficult for employers to attract, hire, and
retain.

health insurance. In particular, Federal workers had about $91,000 (20%) less net wealth and

$97,000 (31%) less financial wealth than private sector employees lacking RHI. We also find

that state/local workers with RHI accumulated about $72,000 (or 16%) less net wealth, and

$77,000 (or 24%) less in financial wealth than their uninsured private sector counterparts. After

controlling on socioeconomic and pension coverage differences, the Federal employee gap in net

wealth was still 118% as large, and the difference is measured with reasonable statistical

precision. For reasons we enumerate above, the state/local workforce wealth differences are

measured less robustly, but, after adding controls, it still appears they save 30% less.
