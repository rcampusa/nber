Why Don’t More Puerto Rican Men Work? The Rich Uncle (Sam) Hypothesis

                                          ABSTRACT

Puerto Rico has an extraordinarily low employment rate for men. We document the low employment
rate using Census of Population and labor force survey data and offer “the rich uncle (Sam)
hypothesis” that the connection of the relatively poor economy of Puerto Rico to the wealthier US
has created conditions that generate low employment. In support of the hypothesis, we show: 1) that
GNP and GDP have diverged on the island, distorting the relationship between GDP and
employment, due potentially to federal tax benefits to companies operating in Puerto Rico; 2)
transfers to Puerto Rican families funded mainly by the federal government, which account for about
22 percent of personal income; 3) open borders to the U.S. that give men with high desire for work
incentive to migrate to the US, and potentially creates a lower bound to wages on the island; (4) a
wage structure with relatively higher earnings in low paid jobs; and (5) employment in the informal
sector, which is unmeasured in official statistics. We note that other regional economies with rich
“uncles”, such as East Germany with West Germany, Southern Italy with Northern Italy, have
comparable employment problems.

I. Introduction

       One of the biggest economic problems facing Puerto Rico is the low employment rate of

its adult population. In 2000, only 31 percent of the overall population was employed, giving the

island the lowest employment to population ratio in the Americas and Caribbean, if not in the

world. By way of comparison in 2000, 44% of the population in the Dominican Republic was

employed, 40% of the Mexican population was employed, and 50% of the US population was

employed. The low employment rate compromises the island’s development by diverting

resources that could go to investment to public assistance and services to the large non-working

population.

       Low participation of women in the work force contributes to the overall low employment

rate, but it is the low employment rate for men that is “off the map” compared to other countries.

Moreover, the male participation rate has been falling while the female participation has been

increasing. Even in the late 1990s economic boom, when the Puerto Rican economy was growing

and the rate of unemployment fell, the labor force participation of men dropped by 3 percentage

points, while the labor participation rate of women increased.

       The paper begins by laying out the dimensions of the male employment problem in Puerto

Rico, using both the Census and labor force surveys, which give somewhat different figures on

the participation rate of Puerto Ricans. Despite differences between the Census and labor force

survey, however, both data sets show that the employment rate among men on the island is

exceptionally low and declining. The remainder of the paper analyzes factors that could explain

the low employment of Puerto Rican men, such as the rising divergence between the national

product of the Island and the national income accruing to Puerto Ricans and the industrial

distribution of output and employment, in social security disability insurance and related welfare
                                                                                               4
payments, migration to the US, opportunities for working in the informal economy, and relatively

high wages in low skilled occupations. We organize our discussion around a new hypothesis,

which we call the “rich uncle (Sam) hypothesis”. A rich uncle is a wealthy relative who provides

resources to poorer relatives for consumption while employing other resources for production.

The rich uncle reduces incentives for relatives to supply labor and lowers the demand for their

services as well. We argue that the connection of the relatively poor economy of Puerto Rico to

the advanced and rich economy of the United States have created conditions that generate low

employment.

       In support of this hypothesis, we present data that shows: 1) an increasing divergence

between GNP and GDP on the island, which has distorted the relationship between GDP and

employment, due potentially to federal tax benefits to companies operating in Puerto Rico; 2)

transfers accruing to Puerto Rican families funded mainly by the federal government, which

account for about 22 percent of personal income; 3) open borders to the U.S. give unemployed

individuals with high desire for work incentive to migrate readily to the US, and potentially

creates a lower bound to wages on the island; (4) a wage structure in which low paid jobs have

relatively higher earnings than in low income US states, possibly related to the federally imposed

minimum wage, free mobility of labor between U.S. and Puerto Rico and to high reservation

wages determined from the amount of transfers obtained in case of non-work; and (5)

employment in the informal sector, which is unmeasured in official statistics. We argue that the

“rich uncle” contributes to the sizeable informal sector because it allows workers who earn

means-tested government transfers to supplement those earnings by generating “unreported”

income; and by reducing labor supply pressures for lower wages in the formal sector.

                                                               1
        From the vantage of the rich uncle hypothesis , Puerto Rico’s seemingly unique

experience is comparable to that of other economies connected to rich “uncles”, such as East

Germany after unification with West Germany, or of Southern Italy with Northern Italy. 2 These

areas have also experienced high unemployment while attached to a much richer economy. The

rich uncle analysis also links Puerto Rican economic problems to those faced by low income

indigenous groups in wealthier societies, such as American Indians, Maori in New Zealand,

aborigines in Australia. All of these groups also receive great social support from the wealthier

society, live in particular geographic areas, and have employment problems. The details vary, but

in all case attachment to the wealthier “uncle” produces economic problems ranging from low

employment and high dependency on social benefits to migration from the poorer area to

wealthier areas and potentially higher reservation wages than are consistent with full employment

for the lower income group, that resemble the employment problems in Puerto Rico.



II. The male labor participation and employment problem

         Figure 1 displays the labor participation rates of men and women of working age in

Puerto Rico, the US, 19 Latin American or Caribbean countries, and 11 other countries from

around the world. The horizontal axis gives male participation rates, while the vertical axis gives

  Our rich uncle analysis has links to Santiago’s (1992) study of Puerto Rico employment.
Spilimbergo (1999) has developed a general equilibrium model in which workers finance a
transfer to the unemployed in the South to limit migration, but this does not fit the Puerto Rican
case.
2
   German experience is particularly insightful for analyzing how linking a poorer economy to a wealthier economy
can adversely affect employment in the former. This is because the timing of the “rich uncle” linkage can be dated
fairly precisely. Prior to unification, East Germany had essentially full employment. Following monetary union with
the West in June 1990 and adoption of West German wage levels and social benefits, the employment rate for east
Germans aged 18-54 years old fell from 89% to 73% in six years, and unemployment rose to as high as 20% (Hunt,
2000). Firms made different capital investments in the East than had made been before unification. West German
firms dominated the East’s economy, with few locating headquarters in the East, so that profits were “repatriated” to
                                                                                                      6
female rates. Each point represents a country. Puerto Rico is at the far left of the figure, with a

male participation rate of 57.7 percent that is the lowest among the countries, and a female

participation rate of 35.0 that is low but comparable to that in some other countries, such as Italy,

Chile and Argentina.

        Over time, moreover, the participation rate of men in Puerto Rico has fallen while female

participation has increased. Even in the late 1990s economic boom, when the Puerto Rican

economy was growing and the rate of unemployment fell, male labor force participation dropped

by 3 percentage points. Figure 2 displays the labor force participation rates for men and women

aged 16 and over in Puerto Rico from 1971 to 2003, using labor force household survey data. It

also gives comparable rates for men and women in the US. Over this period, the male

participation rate in Puerto Rico fell by 11.5 percentage points, from 70.8 to 59.3, with most of

the decline occurring between 1971 and the early 1980s. Figure 2 also shows that the US male

participation rate also fell, but by half as much as in Puerto Rico, by 5.7 percentage points, from

79.4 to 73.7. Over the same period, the labor participation rate of Puerto Rican women rose by 9

percentage points, while US females increased theirs by 13.4 percentage points. As a result, the

US-Puerto Rico gap in labor force participation increased twice as much for men (67 percent)

than for women (33 percent). These trends also meant that by 2003, the US female participation

rate stood close to the Puerto Rican male participation rate.

        Data on participation by age group given in appendix table A1 show that participation

among Puerto Rican men fell more among older men than among younger men. Between 1970

and 1999, participation fell by 4.3 points for men aged 25-34, by 5.8 points among men aged 35-

44, by 11.1 points among men aged 45-54 and by a huge 24.3 points among men aged 55-64. As


the West.
                                                                                                      7
in Puerto Rico, the decline of male participation in the US was larger at older age groups, but the

declines were considerably less for each group than the declines in Puerto Rico: a 2.4 point drop

for men aged 25-34, a 3.6 point drop for men aged 35-44, a 5.2 point drop for men aged 45-54

and 14.6 point drop among men aged 55-64.

       To see how male participation and employment varies by education in Puerto Rico, we

examined data from the Census of Population of Puerto Rico. The Census shows a lower rate of

male employment in 2000 than does the household survey for the same year, for reasons that

statisticians have not resolved. The Census has the virtue of large sample sizes, which allows for

analysis of the rates for detailed groups, and is the natural comparison for data from the US

Census of Population. We use both the household survey and the Census data sets, to make sure

that any conclusions we reach are not dependent on the particular source of data.

       Table 1 records participation and employment rates by education for Puerto Rican men

from the 2000 Puerto Rican Census, and for comparison, participation rates for US men from the

2000 US Census. At all education levels, the labor participation rate of men in Puerto Rico lies

below that of men in the US. The magnitude of the Puerto-Rican US difference is lowest among

men with a bachelor’s degree or higher education (a 15 point difference) and is largest among

those with a high school education but without a bachelor degree (20 points). The employment

population ratio shows a similar but more pronounced set of differences due to the higher rate of

unemployment in Puerto Rico than in the US. The Puerto Rico-US employment gap is highest

among high school graduates and lowest among bachelor degree holders. Given the sizeable

increase in educational attainment among Puerto Rican men since World War II, the pattern of

rising participation and employment rise with education should have raised male labor force
                                                                                                     8
activity. Instead, participation and employment fell. This shows the unreliability of using

analyses based on cross-section patterns of labor participation to investigate patterns of change.

       Another way of examining the low participation of Puerto Rican men in the work force is

to follow the labor force behavior of a given cohort as it ages over time. Since we do not have

longitudinal data that follows the same person over time, we use synthetic cohort data that

compare the behavior of increasingly older age groups over time– i.e. we use the participation of

persons aged 25-34 in 1970, aged 35-44 in 1980, 45-54 in 1990, and so on, to reflect the

participation of the 25-34 year old 1970 cohort.

       The top panel of Table 2 records the trajectory of labor force participation by Puerto Rican

men in synthetic age cohorts that were 25-34 years old in 1970, 1980, and 1990 every ten years

from 1970 to 2000. The bottom panel gives the trajectory of labor participation for Puerto Rican

women. Column 1 records the participation of persons aged 25-34 in the appropriate year.

Column 2 gives the participation of persons in the same cohort aged 35-44 ten years later.

Column 3 gives the participation of persons in the same cohort aged 45-54 twenty years late.

Column 4 gives the participation of the cohort aged 25-34 in 1970 when it reached 55-64 years

old in 2000.

       The labor force attachment of the male group aged 25-34 in 1970 fell by 12.9 percentage

points as they aged twenty years from 1970 to 1990 and then fell another 30.7 points in the next

decade. The 1980 cohort also shows a sharp drop in participation when it enters the 45-54 age

group. By contrast, the data for women show modest drops in participation as a cohort ages, with

no major decline in participation as the cohorts enter the 45-54 year old age bracket. Finally,

comparing the participation of younger persons, the youngest female cohort shows a rise in
                                                                                                       9
participation of 7 points between 1990 and 2000. This contrasts with a decline in participation of

3.6 points from men in the same cohort from 1990 to 2000.

        We consider next the annual work activity of employed men and the past work activity of

men out of the labor force. A low annual participation or employment rate could reflect low

levels of weeks worked by most of the population or it could reflect a sharp division between

persons who work full year and persons who work little if at all. The upper panel of Table 3 gives

the weeks and hours worked of employed men in Puerto Rico and in the US in 1999, as reported

in the 2000 Census of Population for the Island and for the US. The lower panel of the Table

gives the proportion of non-working men who worked in the past five years. The weeks worked

data show that relatively fewer men worked 50-52 weeks over the year in Puerto Rico than in the

US, with the bulk of the difference occurring among those reporting 48-49 weeks a year. The

difference is modest3 and possibly spuriously due to differences in how some workers report

weeks worked with vacations on the Island relative to the mainland. Additional tabulations of

weeks worked in Puerto Rico for earlier Censuses shows little change over time. The hours data

in the table also show only a modest difference between the proportion of Puerto Rican men

working 35 hours or more per week and the proportion of US men working 35 hours or more per

week.

        The big difference in the table is in the proportion of non-working men who worked in the

past 5 years. Whereas just 35 percent of Puerto Rican men out of the labor force report having

worked in the past five years, 68 percent of men out of the labor force in the US reported having

worked in the last 5 years. This is not the result of any huge difference in the age distribution of
                                                                                                     10
Puerto Rican and American men, but rather reflects the relatively permanent detachment of a

large number of Puerto Rican men from the work force – another measure of the employment

problem for men on the island.

       Figure 3 shows the principal activities of persons in Puerto Rico who are out of the labor

force for men and women from the limited data on non-work activities in the Puerto Rican labor

force household survey for 1970 through 2002. The two principal non work activities are

working at home and reporting one self as disabled. A sizeable and rising proportion of men

report themselves as out of the labor force and disabled. Between 1990 and 2000, the proportion

of men reporting themselves as disabled jumped from 16.4% to 25.6%. By contrast, most women

out of the labor force are engaged in household work; less than 3% report themselves as disabled.

       In sum, diverse measures of labor force activity from the Census and household surveys

show that Puerto Rican men had an exceptionally low involvement in the labor market at the turn

of the 21st century – the result of a downward trend in participation in the 1970s that produced a

permanent detachment of many men from the work force and a rising proportion who reported

themselves disabled in the 1990s. This pattern motivates our paper: Why don’t more Puerto Rican

men work?



III. The distorted relationship between aggregate demand and employment

       Since the implementation of the 936 code of the Federal Internal Revenue system in

Puerto Rico in the late 1970s a divergence has grown between gross national production and gross

domestic production. The ratio of GNP to GDP in Puerto Rico fell from 0.93 in 1970 to 0.74 in

3
  Since a 2 week difference in weeks worked over the year would be associated with almost a 4
percentage point difference in employment in a given period (= 2 weeks /52 weeks), the
                                                                                                  11
                      4
1985 to 0.67 in 1997 , which means that GDP grew much more rapidly than did GNP. By

contrast, the ratio of GNP to GDP in the US and most other countries shows little or no trend over

this period. The reasons are two-fold. First, GDP includes profits of foreign companies,

particularly in the highly productive manufacturing sector, which then leave the island. The

second reason is that Puerto Rico'
                                 s favorable tax structure creates incentives for companies to

shift profits to Puerto Rico, by under-reporting imported inputs such as R&D and thereby

overstating value-added (Bosworth and Collins, 2005). As a consequence, Puerto Rico seems to

have generated a type of growth based on production of highly productive manufacturing firms

which does not translate into large enough gains in employment.

       To the extent that GDP does not accurately measure production on the island, employment

should be more closely related to the slower growing GNP than to the faster growing GDP. To

assess this possibility, we regressed ln employment separately on ln real GNP and ln real GDP

(allowing for first order serial correlation) and also regressed the first difference of ln

employment on the first difference of the ln GNP and ln GDP. In addition, we also regressed the

first difference in the absolute change in employment on the first difference in the absolute

change in GDP. As our counterfactual or norm for assessing the coefficients, we estimated the

same regressions for the US over the same period.

       Table 4 summarizes the results of these regressions, for Puerto Rico and the US. Line 1

shows that ln GNP has a higher estimated impact on ln employment than does ln GDP for Puerto

Rico in all specifications. By contrast, line 2 shows no such difference in regression coefficients

of ln employment on ln GDP and ln GNP in the U.S. The ln forms show that the impact of GNP

on employment is modestly larger for Puerto Rico than for U.S., which presumably reflects the


difference in weeks worked is associated with some of the difference in employment rates.
                                                                                                   12
lower productivity on the island, though the absolute form shows a higher impact of changes in

output on changes in employment for Puerto Rico in the GNP analysis but a lower impact in the

GDP analysis.

          These estimates and the slower growth of GNP per capita than GDP per capita indicate

that aggregate economic growth in Puerto Rico was less favorable to employment than first

appears to be the case because it took the form of GDP growth that is not part of GNP. The

divergence between GNP and GDP is largely due to the 936 code companies operating in Puerto

Rico. This tax benefit given by the federal government to Puerto Rico to attract foreign capital

has produced a highly capital intensive and nominally highly productive manufacturing sector, in

which the extra GDP has a smaller impact on employment than would be the case if

manufacturing firms made a different set of investments, not distorted by the tax breaks.

          Table 5 shows the extent to which the pattern of GDP and employment in Puerto Rico

may have been distorted by the close relation to the US and the tax incentives given to investing

in capital-intensive activities. In 2003, 42.1% of Puerto Rican GDP was in the manufacturing

whereas just 11% of Puerto Rican employment was in manufacturing. The ratio of the share of

output to the share of employment in manufacturing was nearly 4 to 1. This contrasts with a ratio

of the share of output to the share of employment in manufacturing in the US of about 1.1 to 1.5

Firms invest in capital-intensive manufacturing and declare large profits from those activities.

Within manufacturing, one-quarter of Puerto Rican employment is in the highly capital-intensive

chemicals sector, whereas just 5% of US manufacturing employment is in chemicals.

IV. Transfer programs

       Puerto Rico benefits from transfer programs from the US. In 2003, island residents

received $14.3 billion in transfers, according to the Economic Report to the Governor of Puerto

Rico, with most of these transfers coming from the federal government. By contrast, residents

paid out $4.4 billion, largely as employee contribution to social security and contribution to

Medicare.6 The $9.9 billion net transfer was 22 percent of personal income and 26 percent of net

income on the island. This has to be one of the greatest proportionate transfer payments from one

economy to another, with potentially large impacts on labor supply.

       Disability Insurance: The major federally funded transfer program in Puerto Rico is Old

Age, Disability and Survivors Insurance (OASDI). A larger proportion of OASDI spending in

Puerto Rico consists of disability payments than in the US. Administrative data from the Social

Security Administration shows that 19% of Puerto Rican Social Security beneficiaries were on

disability payments, in comparison to 12% of U.S. social security beneficiaries.7

       Census data also provides information about disability. In 2000, 17% of the Puerto Rican

male population aged 18-64 in Puerto Rico said that they had an employment disability, defined

as a disability ”that affects their ability to work at a job or business” compared to 13% in the US

(Table 6). 8 The table shows that a much smaller proportion of persons who report a work

disability are employed in Puerto Rico than are employed in the US. In 2000 38% of men with a

work disability in Puerto Rico were working. By contrast, 63 percent of US men with some work

   These numbers are from the Economic Report of the Governor 2003. They differ from those
 reported by the US Social Security Administration as given in US Statistical Abstract, 2004.
 The Statistical Abstract reports 10.4 billion in transfers and residents paid out $2.9 billion, giving
 a $7.3 billion net transfer.

   On the mainland, West Virginia is the outlier with 17 percent

   Mississippi had the 2nd highest percentage with an employment disability in the US at 14.4%.
                                                                                             14
disability were working. The employment ratio in Puerto Rico relative to the employment ratio in

the US among those with a work disability is 0.60 (38/63), which is slightly lower than the ratio

of the overall male employment rate in Puerto to the male employment rate in the US of 0.62

(47/67). Among men without a high school diploma the differences between Puerto Rico and the

US are even larger: only 26 percent of men in Puerto Rico with a work disability are employed,

while 52 percent of those men in the U.S. are employed.

        Using the Census data, we can infer whether or not men younger than 65 years of age

receive social security disability insurance from whether or not they receive social security.

Almost one in every ten adult men in Puerto Rico under the age of 65 receive social security

income. The comparable figure for US is one in every twenty. Social security income is quite

common among men 46 to 64, of which 22 percent receive this type of income. The Census data

in Table 6 show that a much larger proportion of Puerto Rican men aged 18 to 64 are on social

security disability insurance than are US men aged 18-64 – 9.8% vs 4.4%. The absolute

difference in the rates reporting that they are on social security disability is larger for older than

for younger workers and larger for the less educated workers, while the relative difference varies

in a less clear pattern.

        Across time, however, the Census data show a small decrease for the rate of recipiency in

Puerto Rico and a small increase for the US. The implication is that while differences between

Puerto Rico and the US in receipt of disability insurance contribute to differences in employment

rates, they cannot account for trends or differences in trends between Puerto Rico and the US.

On the other hand, the Puerto Rican labor force survey, which allows for a self-reported category

of “disabled” in labor force status, shows a steady rise in the proportion of men reporting that they

are disabled, reaching 25 percent in 2000.
                                                                                                   15
       Finally, administrative data also show that the ratio of disabled workers to the overall

workforce is higher in Puerto Rico than in the U.S. In 2002, 131,340 persons claimed disability

insurance in Puerto Rico according to administrative data, which compared to 1.157 million

employees, giving a ratio of disabled workers to employees of 0.11 and ratio of disability

insurance recipients to the population of working age of 0.06. By contrast, the comparable ratios

for U.S. are .04 and .03, respectively.9

       The potential for disability insurance to discourage work in Puerto Rico is enormous,

considering the low earnings of Puerto Rican workers and the high levels of unemployment. In

2002 support for disabled workers in Puerto Rico was $713 per month – 80% of the $891 monthly

support for disabled workers in the US. This compares to retirement benefits that are 66% those

in the US and wages that are also about 2/3rds those in the US. Given monthly earnings of male

workers in Puerto Rico of $1,032 as reported by the Department of Labor, the ratio of disability

income to wages is 69 percent. By contrast, the ratio of disability income to wages is about 56

percent in the United States, where monthly earnings of workers are on the order of $1,600.

Hence availability of disability income creates stronger incentives not to work in Puerto Rico than

in the U.S. Given that studies of the effect of disability insurance for the US indicate that it

affected male labor force behavior (Autor and Duggan, 2003), it is likely to have done the same in

Puerto Rico.10 High unemployment levels may also be pushing Puerto Rican men into claiming

disability insurance, since studies have pointed that disability insurance participation responds to

aggregate demand shocks (Autor and Duggan, 2003).



 9
  The US had 5.4 million workers with disability insurance in a 137 million person work force.
 10
   There remain debates over the magnitude of the effect and over how men who said they were
 disabled might have behaved absent disability insurance (Bound and Weidmann, 1992,
 Haveman, DeJong and Wolfe, 1991)
                                                                                                 16
        In sum, these figures suggest that social security disability insurance may be encouraging

Puerto Rican men, particularly those with low levels of education, to drop from the labor force.

        Nutritional Assistance Program: Another component of federal transfers to Puerto

Rico is the Nutritional Assistance Program (NAP), which is the most widespread government

assistance program on the Island. This program was initially created as a Food Stamp Program,

but was cashed-out in 1985, so that benefits were given electronically, with 75 percent nominally

allocated to food and 25 percent to cash. The Puerto Rican NAP benefits differ from the US Food

Stamp Program. NAP has high implicit tax rates and covers a huge proportion of the work force,

in contrast to the low implicit marginal tax rates on the US Food Stamp program and its limited

coverage of the population. NAP, rather than Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, is the

main government assistance program in Puerto Rico. The Department of the Family reports about

half a million “units” on NAP. While NAP units are not exactly families as measured by the

Census, the half a million compares to approximately 1 million families in the 2000 Census,

which suggests that on the order of half of the families receive government assistance. A family

of four with no income may receive about $300.00 monthly on NAP.

       Although single mothers are the most likely demographic group to be on assistance

because they are poorer, the NAP covers married couples as well. We have not estimated the

effect of this program on the low labor participation rate of Puerto Rican men, but the sheer

volume of participation in this program suggests that negative labor supply effects on men are

present. Taken together, the social security disability program and the NAP program combined

could have large effects on male employment. However, there are no data rich enough in Puerto

Rico to sort out these effects. The only household data collected regularly are the labor force

surveys which do not have questions on annual income and nor its sources. Decennial Census
                                                                                                                 17
data are also limited in the information they contain as to address these issues rigorously. Still,

we can draw some inferences about the potential effect of non-work income on labor supply from

data on the work patterns of married couples. If we assume that any couple in which neither the

husband nor wife work must be earning income from some other source, of which transfer

payments are a likely part, particularly from the NAP program, the proportion of families that are

without work give some notion of the proportion of husbands for whom the non-work income

reduces the pressure to obtain a job.

Work Patterns of Married Couples

        To determine the work patterns of married couples, we matched wife and husband records

for persons aged 18-64 from the 2000 Puerto Rican Census and tabulated the employment status

of both spouses. Table 7 shows the proportion of couples that fall within four work arrangement:

husband jobless; wife jobless; husband employed, wife jobless; husband jobless, wife employed;

and both husband and wife employed. In 36 percent of the cases both the wife and husband were

without work. This is the largest group in the table, giving Puerto Rico an extraordinarily high

proportion of “jobless families” in an economy (Gregg and Wadsworth, 2001). In 31% of the

cases, the husband works and the wife does not; in 8% of the cases the wife works and the

husband does not work. In just 25% of the cases both spouses work.11

        While it is not possible given the data at hand to estimate how many of the husbands in the

“jobless families” are not working because their family can obtain income from transfers, the

huge proportion of couples falling into that category suggest that effects of transfers on male

employment could be quite large. The families with no earners are making money in some

11
  Analyzing the pattern in table 7 further, we estimated a logit model where the dependent variable took the value of
1 of the husband is employed and 0 otherwise, with the education and age of the husband, and whether or not the wife
was employed as right hand side variable. The regression shows that husbands with a non-employed wife had a 63%
                                                                                             18
fashion. With about half the families obtaining NAP support and many men obtaining disability

insurance, we would expect that many of the 40% of jobless families would be recipients of either

or both of these forms of income, depressing their incentive to work, at least in the formal sector.



V. Migration: selectivity and wage

         Puerto Ricans are US citizens with the right to a US passport and the freedom to travel and

reside on the mainland at their discretion. For half a century, tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans

have migrated to the US each year, and many return to the Island. The legal right to move back

and forth between the US and Puerto Rico distinguishes Puerto Ricans from persons in other

developing economies with close ties to the US, such as Mexico or the Dominican Republic. It

leads to a potentially different pattern of migration with some workers going back and forth

within relatively short time periods.12 In 2000 37 percent of all persons aged 18 and over and

born in Puerto Rico were living on the mainland (see column 1 of Table 7).

         Migration can affect the employment-population and labor participation ratios on Puerto

Rico in three ways. First, if unemployed persons leave the island to seek work in the US, it would

reduce the number of unemployed persons and raise the employment rate by reducing the number

of persons of working age. Thus, migration can serve as a way to export the unemployed. In fact,

time series data shows a positive correlation between the rate of unemployment and net migration

(Pol, 2004a). But when unemployed persons leave the island, their movement lowers the labor

participation rate. This is because it reduces the number of persons in the labor force by




lower likelihood of employment than a husband with an employed wife.
  12
     Godoy, et al (2001) report that 13.5% of persons in Puerto Rico in 1990 had lived on the mainland at various
  times in the preceding decade.
                                                                                                                   19
                                                                                 13
proportionately more than it reduces the population of working age.                   Second, migration could

reduce the labor participation rate through selective migration if persons with strong attachment to

the labor market migrated to the US. The migration of those who want to work but do not have

jobs would lower the labor force proportionately more than it would lower the population.

Consistent with this, Enchautegui (2005a) found that the labor force participation rates of recent

migrants and prior migrants to the US are higher than those of persons who remain on the island,

even within the same age and educational groups. Third, migration could affect employment and

participation indirectly by raising reservation wages of persons on the Island. Since migration

gives Puerto Ricans access to higher wage US jobs, some persons might set their reservation

wages on the basis of what they could get working in the US, producing a lower bound on wages

that could be too high to accommodate excess labor. This could reduce the labor participation rate

if persons with high reservation wages dropped out of the work force. For migration to help

explain the low rate of employment, the second and third factors must dominate. But even if

migration is only an outlet for the unemployed, it would contribute to the low participation rate.

         We use Census data on the employment of Puerto Rican born men residing in Puerto Rico

and residing as migrants to the US to assess the maximum contribution that selective migration

could make to the low employment rate in Puerto Rico. We make the strong assumption that

migrants to the US have higher rates of employment than comparable persons in Puerto Rico

solely because the migrants have positively selected themselves according to their desire for or

ability to get a job and that if migrants returned to Puerto Rico, they would obtain work at the

same rate as in the US. By attributing all of the difference in employment rates to selective

13
   A numeric example demonstrates this. Assume 10 people of working age, 5 in the labor force, of whom 2 are
unemployed. The migration of one unemployed worker reduces the working age population to 9 persons and the
labor force to 4 persons. The labor participation rate falls from 5/10 to 4/9 while the employment rate rises from 3/10
                                                                                             20
migration, we obtain the maximum possible contribution that selective migration could make to

the low level of employment on the island.

          Table 8 shows the result of our calculation for men aged 16 and over. Line 1 gives the

proportion of men aged 16 and above born in Puerto Rico who are living in the US, for all men

and for men by education group. The proportion living in the US is much higher for persons with

less education than it is for those with greater education – a pattern of migration that has long

characterized the Island. Lines 2 and 3 record the employment rates for men living in Puerto Rico

and for men who have migrated to the US, while line 4 records the difference in the two rates. For

all men, 46% of those living in Puerto Rico were employed whereas 55% of those migrating to

the US were employed – a 9 point differential. Within educational groups, the difference in

employment rates is even greater. Line 5 gives our counterfactual estimate of what the male

employment rate on the Island would be if all migrants returned to Puerto Rico and had the same

employment rate in the US. If the 37% living in the US moved back to Puerto Rico and were

employed at the 55% rate of employment in the US, the rate of employment would have risen to

49% – a three point increase over the 46% rate for Island residents. Within the four education

groups, the increase in the rate of employment if immigrants returned to the Island but had the

same employment rate as in the US ranges from 3 to 5 percentage points. This suggests that

selective migration is a modest factor in the low employment rate on the Island. If migration is a

major contributor to the low employment rate, it must also be operating by placing a lower bound

on the structure of wages.



VI. The Structure of Wages


to 3/9.
                                                                                               21
           From the perspective of labor demand analysis, low employment suggests an imbalance in

the level and pattern of wages. Are wages too high relative to the level of economic development

of Puerto Rico? Is the structure of wages by skill inconsistent with the supply of skills? If so,

part of the Island’s employment problem could be associated with wage levels and patterns

inconsistent with the levels necessary to clear the labor market.

           Table 9 compares earnings in Puerto Rico with earnings in the US and in the state with the

lowest per capita income, Mississippi. The upper panel of the table records data on earnings in

Puerto Rico from establishment surveys for 2003. It shows that in manufacturing the hourly pay

or labor costs (which includes fringe benefits) for production workers is about 2/3rds of the

hourly pay/labor costs in the US. Compared with Mississippi, Puerto Rican production workers

in manufacturing earn 81%-85% of the hourly pay or labor costs of production workers in

manufacturing. Since living expenses are comparable between the island and the mainland, these

figures are indicative of differences in real earnings.14

           The data for the hourly earnings of all workers show a bigger gap between Puerto Rico

and the US and Mississippi. Puerto Ricans earn 59% of the earnings of workers on the mainland

and 74% to 79% the earnings of workers in Mississippi, depending on whether earnings are given

as medians or means. The larger gap in earnings among all workers than among manufacturing

workers reflects that fact that the manufacturing sector in Puerto Rico diverges more from the rest

of the economy than does the manufacturing sector in the US, consistent with the huge

productivity difference on the Island between manufacturing and the rest of the economy shown

in Table 5.




14
     Bosworth and Collins (2005) show that Puerto Rico cost of living is similar to that of the District of Columbia.
                                                                                                 22
       The lower panel of Table 9 gives annual earnings by gender and years of schooling for

men and women separately from the 2000 Census of Population for the US and the 2000 Census

of Population for Puerto Rico. They show that men’s annual earnings in Puerto are 52% of male

annual earnings in the US. This ratio is lower than in hourly pay because workers in Puerto Rico

work fewer weeks and less hours than those on the mainland. Compared to men in Mississippi,

those in Puerto Rico earn 65% as much. Women’s annual earnings in Puerto Rico are closer to

those of women in the US. For all women annual earnings in Puerto Rico are 64% those in the

US and are 82% those in Mississippi. The data by education show that compared to the US

relative earnings for both and women on the Island are highest among the most educated and

among the least educated. Compared to earnings in Mississippi, the relative earnings of men in

the Island are highest for the most educated. For women the relative earnings are highest for the

least educated.

       The normal pattern in earnings differences among countries with different levels of

income is that earnings in a lower income economy are closer to earnings in a higher income

economy among the most educated or skilled. The reason is that lower income economies have

fewer highly skilled workers than advanced economies and thus pay relatively high wages in the

top occupations (Freeman and Oostendorp, 2002). However, in three of the four comparisons in

Table 9, the highest relative earnings are for less educated workers.

       Relative Earnings by Occupation: To see whether the pattern of relatively high

earnings among low paid workers holds across occupations, we compare next earnings by

occupation in Puerto Rico and in Mississippi, our low income mainland comparison area, from
                                                                                                    23
                                                                                                   15
the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ establishment-based Occupational Employment Survey (OES).

This survey obtains earnings and employment data at the three digit occupation level for detailed

geographic areas of the US and outlying areas. Since the data come from establishment records,

they offer a more accurate measure of rates of pay than self reported earnings in the decennial

Census. The OES contains data on the relative earnings of persons in Puerto Rico in 538 detailed

occupations from the May 2003 survey and in 643 detailed occupations from the comparison

state, Mississippi. Do these data show high relative pay for Puerto Ricans with limited skills?16

        Table 10 summarizes the OES data for a selection of high wage, middle wage, and low

wage occupations. It shows that earnings in Puerto Rico are higher than in Mississippi in the

selected occupations at the top of the earnings distribution; are markedly lower for the

occupations in the middle of the distribution; but are relatively close for occupations with low

earnings. The wages for maids and housekeeping cleaners are higher in Puerto Rico than in

Mississippi, possibly reflecting the Island’s comparative advantage in tourism and demand for

these workers.

       To see if the pattern of relatively high wages at both the top and bottom of the earnings

distribution holds over the entire spectrum of occupations, we performed two additional

calculations. First, we ranked earnings in all of the occupations reported for Puerto Rico and in

all the occupations reported in Mississippi. We divided the distribution of earnings by decile and

calculated the average earnings for occupations in each decile of the Puerto Rican distribution,

and for occupations in each decile of the Mississippi distribution. For example, for occupations in

 15
   The OES survey samples approximately 400,000 establishments each year and, over a 3-year
 period, contacts approximately 1.2 million establishments. It provides wage and employment
 estimates for detailed geographic areas, including Puerto Rico and its main metropolitan areas.
 See www.bls.gov/oes/current/oessrcst.htm
                                                                                                   24
the lowest 10% of earnings in Puerto Rico, we averaged the earnings in that decile; while for

occupations in the 2nd lowest decile, we averaged the earnings in that decile, and so forth. We

made the same calculations for the occupations in Mississippi, ranked by the Mississippi

distribution. This contrast uses the data on all occupations in both areas and places occupations in

its area-specific distribution. Dividing the average earnings in each decile in Puerto Rico by the

average earnings in each decile in Mississippi, we estimated the pattern of earnings differences

from low wage to high wage occupations. The line labeled all occupations in figure 4 gives the

results of these calculations. It shows that the ratio of wages among occupations by decile fits a

U-shaped curve: the PR/Mississippi wage rate is high for low wage occupations, falls for middle

wage occupations, and then rises for high wage occupations.

          Second, we examined the distribution of earnings in the 513 occupations that were the

same in both locations. This eliminates occupations found in one area but not in the other. The

correlation coefficient between the wages by occupation in this case was 0.82, indicating some

difference in the ranking of occupations by wages in Puerto Rico and Mississippi. We computed

the mean wage of the occupations in each decile for Puerto Rico and Mississippi taken separately

and took the ratio of those wages as our measure of the pattern of earnings differences from low

wage to high wage occupations. The line labeled same occupations in figure 4 gives the results of

these calculations. Again, we obtain a U-shaped curve that shows that the PR/Mississippi wage

rate is high for low wage occupations, falls for middle wage occupations, and then rises for high

wage occupations.

          As a final check on this pattern, we categorized the 513 occupations for which we had

earnings in both localities by the average of their ranking in the Puerto Rican and Mississippi

 16

                                                                                                   25
                      17
earnings distributions ; computed the decile in which each occupation fell by the average rank

and regressed the ln of the ratio of earning in Puerto Rico to those in Mississippi on ten dummy

variables for the decile in which the occupation fit. Table 11 gives our regression results. Again,

we obtain the inverse-U relation. Puerto Rican wages were 0.15 ln points below wages in

Mississippi for occupations in the lowest decile, fell to 0.31 ln points below wages in Mississippi

in the fifth decile and then rose to 0.15 ln point below wages in Mississippi in the highest decile.

       Given that Puerto Rico has relatively high wages at the bottom of the earnings distribution

and high joblessness, the natural question to ask is why the high joblessness on Puerto Rico has

not driven wages down at the bottom of the wage distribution to create more jobs. The rich uncle

hypothesis directs attention at three possible answers.

       On the demand side, it is possible that Puerto Rico’s adoption of US level minimum

wages limited downward wage adjustments (Castillo-Freeman and Freeman, 1992). Since 1977,

employers in Puerto Rico covered by the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) are subject to

the federal minimum while those not covered by the Act must pay at least 70 percent of the

Federal minimum wage or the applicable mandatory decree rate set by the Department of Labor,

whichever is higher. Since Puerto Rico has lower productivity and average wages than the US,

this means that the minimum affects a larger proportion of the work force than in the US.

However, Puerto Rican minimum wage law allows the Secretary of Labor and Human Resources

to authorize a lower rate to any employer who can show that implementation of the 70 percent

rate would substantially curtail employment in that business. Debate over the impact of the

minimum wage law on the island on employment has focused on the period when the island



 17
   That is if an occupation was ranked 6th in Puerto Rico and 14th in Mississippi, we gave it an
 average rank of 10.
                                                                                                   26
adopted the federal minimum (Krueger, 1995). As the federal minimum rate was constant at

$5.15 per hour from 1997 through 2004, it would bound annual earnings of full-time workers on

the Island at about $10,700 per year. This level is below the earnings for low wage occupations

shown in table 10 and indeed falls below the mean earnings in the lowest decile of the Puerto

Rican earnings distribution: $13,399 for the sample of 538 occupations. The minimum wage may

affect the lower part of the wage distribution but given this large gap we suspect that other factors

are more important.

       A second possible reason for the relatively high level of wages for low-paying occupations

in Puerto Rico is that income transfers have created a reservation wage considerably above the

minimum and above the full employment wage rates. Our survey of men in communities along

El Caño Martín Peña in San Juan, to be described shortly, asked them for their reservation wage.

The reservation wage of the non-employed men was 7 dollars per hour. Virtually no one said they

would take a job for less than 7 dollars per hour. Seven dollars per hour would produce a lower

bound on earnings for men around $14,500, consistent with earnings at the bottom of the

occupational wage structure and considerably above the minimum wage.

       The third possible reason for a high reservation wage on the Island is that potential

migration to the US creates a floor for wages above the minimum. Given an annualized cost of

mobility to the mainland of C and mainland earnings of W, annual earnings on the Island could be

bounded by W-C, with workers migrating when unemployment develops at the wage. Arguably,

if migrants returned to Puerto Rico, they would increase the labor supply and drive down the

wage, which would raise employment. However, this would not necessarily raise the rate of

employment, which would change depending on how much wages fell and the elasticity of

demand to labor. The rich uncle impact of migration on the wage structure reverses the Harris-
                                                                                                     27
Todaro migration mechanism in which people from rural areas migrate to urban areas with

institutionally determined wages until urban unemployment equates the expected earnings in the

two areas. In our model the potential of migration to the higher wage mainland sets a lower

bound on wages in Puerto Rico, which depresses employment there. What makes the lower

employment tolerable is the existence of diverse social benefits for persons on the island, paid by

the mainland, the option to migrate to the US to earn higher wages, and the potential to make

money outside of the formal sector.



VII. The role of the informal economy

       There is a widespread belief that many jobless Puerto Rican men work in the informal

sector, which standard labor force surveys fail to measure. Employment in the informal sector

grew in many Latin American countries in the 1980s and 1990s – part and parcel of poor

economic growth and the de-industrialization of Latin American economies, which has made

informalization of work a major issue in understanding the economic circumstances of workers in

those economies. In Puerto Rico, the informal labor market could provide job opportunities for

men who cannot find work in the formal labor market while allowing them to receive government

benefits like NAP, disability insurance, which are work- tested or means-tested, that they would

lose if they took formal sector jobs. The low measured employment of Puerto Rican men would

be a measurement problem due to the failure of official statistics to capture work in this sector.

       For the informal sector to explain the low level of labor participation in Puerto Rico, it

must be a large share of the economy. Some studies estimate that it accounts for upwards of 23

to explain the declining participation and employment population rate in Puerto Rico, however, it

would have to have grown since the 1970s, or which the evidence is not as clear.

       Standard labor force data provide indirect evidence on the possible size and development

of informal sector work. One natural indicator of the informal sector is the proportion of workers

who are self-employed. Since 1980 the proportion self-employed reported by the Department of

Labor in Puerto Rico has fluctuated between 11 and 12 percent or about 5 points above the 6-7

percent self-employed in the US. Since the self-employed are counted as workers, these figures

do not measure non-labor force participants who work in the informal sector. Still, if many

workers worked in the informal sector, one would expect some to report that they are self-

employed, so that a high level of self-employment is consistent with a large number working in

the informal sector. The constancy of the self-employment rate in Puerto Rico suggests that the

proportion of men in the informal economy has not grown in comparison to 20 years ago.

        Another indicator of the potential level and growth of the informal sector is the proportion

of men who are out of the labor force, not disabled, not going to school, and not doing

housework. These men may be idle, but they could just as readily be informal sector workers

since they have no other reported activity and have no reported physical or other impediments to

work. Figure 5 shows that the proportion of men in this category declined from 1970 to 2000.

       Based on self-employment rates and the proportion of non-working men who are idle, it

does not seem that the informal sector has grown significantly in the last two decades, although it

still may be a significant constant in the Puerto Rican labor market structure and a sector that

needs close examination.

       A pilot survey: Despite the appeal of the informal sector hypothesis as a contributor to the

low participation rate of Puerto Rican men, there has been no direct study of workers involved in
                                                                                                29
the sector. To fill this gap, we undertook a pilot survey in summer 2004 to find out what men in

communities with potentially low employment were doing. We randomly selected men in

households from low-to-medium income communities along El Caño Martín Peña in the capital

city of San Juan. The Department of Transportation and Public Works was undertaking a massive

infrastructure project in the area related to the cleaning of the water route of el Caño and had

commissioned a Census of the eight communities that composed the Caño. This Census provided

us with a sampling frame to draw participants for the survey. We selected households in three

communities: Marina, Bella Vista Hato Rey and Bella Vista Santurce, which were in the middle

of income distribution for the eight communities. We drew samples from households containing

men aged 18 to 64, not attending school. We interviewed 133 men. While our sample has some

drawback for analyzing the informal sector,18 it offers new insight into informal sector work on

the Island and illuminates how informal sector workers report that work on the household survey.

        The first question we asked on our survey was the question about employment that the

Labor Department in Puerto Rico uses in its monthly survey: “Can you tell me what were you

doing last week?”19. The possible answers are: (1) Working, (2) Looking for work; (3) With

employment but not at work; (4) Domestic chores; (5) Going to school: (6) Disabled; (7) Retired;

(8) Other. These responses are problematic for describing workers with contingent informal labor

market arrangements. Men in sporadic or in contingent employment of short duration may not

see themselves as working and not report that activity. To capture these types of work activities,

18
   One drawback is that employment opportunities in the metro area of San Juan tend to be better than elsewhere on
the Island, which would lead to an underestimate of Island-wide informal work. Another drawback is that the area has
a sizable number of foreign-born men, mainly Dominican, whose behavior may differ from that of the Puerto Rican
born.
 19
   The US Current Population Survey and Census ask the question “did this person do any work
 for pay last week”. This question is more specific since any work no matter how small for which
                                                                                           30
we showed men a flash card that asked “Which of the following best describes your employment

situation?” with answers such as: occasional or casual worker without a fixed job, occasional

worker, contract worker, worker on call, worker on daily contract, worker through the duration of

project, and handyman. These are the type of non-traditional employment situations associated

with the informal labor market and likely to be missed in standard surveys. We classified men

who answered yes to any of these employment situations as non-traditional workers.

       Table 12 summarizes the results to the standard DOL question and to our question that

probed about informal sector work in terms of the number of people whose responses put them

into particular categories and the proportion of men with specified characteristics who fit into

those groups. Lines 1 to 3 show the work activity on the basis of the household survey question:

94 men or 71% of the sample reported that they worked; 11 or 10.5% of those in the labor force

reported that they were seeking work; while 105 or 79% of the sample reported being in the labor

force. Lines 4-9 give the results from our non-traditional work question. Line 4 shows that the

question identified 29 workers in non-traditional employment situations – 22% of the sample.

Most of these men reported activities in construction, with the most common type of work being

“chivero” (a person that get occasional jobs on construction or other related tasks, and works for

the duration of the project).20 Line 5 shows that the household survey question would have

classified 15 of those workers (11% of the sample) as not working, which implies that the

household survey would have missed the work activity of approximately half of those in informal

sector work. Line 6 shows that 5 men who reported that they were doing non-traditional work had



 pay was received is expected to be reported, though people may still interpret it to refer to formal
 jobs.
 20
    The amount of work reported varied from 6 to 30 hours weekly. Men in these activities
 reported incomes of 550 dollars monthly.
                                                                                                  31
responded that they were neither employed nor looking for work on the household survey

question – 4% of the sample. . Counting the 15 men engaged in some kind of informal work but

who said they were not employed on the household survey question from lin5 to the employed,

we obtain an estimated employment in the sample of 109 or 82% (line 7). Adding those 15 men

in informal work to the number counted in the labor force (lines 1 and 2) gives a total in the labor

force, including nontraditional workers, of 110 – or 83% of the sample (line 8).

       If these magnitudes are reasonably correct, how much of low male employment and

participation might be due to informal sector work? Our survey has one problem in answering

this question. The problem is that the employment level in the survey was higher than on the

household survey and on the Census of Population, which makes it hard to generalize magnitudes.

Still, the estimated proportion working in our sample increased from 71 percent under the

traditional question to 82 percent under the wider definition of working – an 11 point or 15%

increase (line 7).21 If we assume that this 15% greater employment holds in comparisons with the

lower reported rate of employment in the household and Census, our calculations suggest that a

better counting of informal workers would increase the employment rate for men aged 18-64

not attending school on the household survey from 48% to55 %.

       But this adjustment would not produce as large an effect on the labor participation rate

found in both the Census and household survey. The reason is that most of the men in non-

traditional employment situations reported themselves as looking for work on the household

survey question. Line 8 shows that only 5 of the 29 men working in non-traditional employment

in our survey said that they were neither working nor looking on the household survey question.



 21
   The 71 percent rate of employment using the DOL-question exceeds the 55 percent labor
 participation rate for Puerto Rican in the household survey!
                                                                                                 32
They are just 4% of the total sample and would raise the labor force participation rate to 83% or

by 5%. If this increase is applied to the overall male population 18-64 years old not attending

school, it would raise the male labor force rate from 58% in the household survey to 61%.

       In sum, our pilot survey suggests that the official DOL question understates employment

considerably but understates labor force participation only modestly. Since, as noted, our survey

covered a group of men that had a relatively high rate of employment and participation even by

the DOL question, it is possible that the understatement, particularly of labor participation, may

be larger in a more representative sample. Taking our results as valid, informal sector work helps

explain a significant part of the low employment rate of Puerto Rican men but can explain only 3

or so percentage points of their low participation rate.



VIII. Conclusion and implications

       Our analysis shows that a variety of factors contributed to the low employment rate of

Puerto Rican men: the pattern of economic growth, with GNP increasing much less rapidly than

GDP, and GDP heavily weighted to capital intensive manufacturing; the emigration of men with

potentially high attachment to the work force to the US; the attractiveness of disability insurance

and NAP transfers funded in large part by the US; relatively high wages in low paid occupations;

opportunity to work in the informal sector. The common thread behind all these separate factors

which we have termed the “rich uncle” hypothesis: that the primary reason for the low

employment is that Puerto Rico’s unique relationship with the United States has produced an

economic environment which discourages work on both the supply and demand sides of the

market. The rich uncle hypothesis suggests that the close tie between the island and the mainland

has been a double-edged relation, offering Puerto Ricans many of the benefits of living in a highly
                                                                                                   33
advanced economy but also contributing to the employment problem. There are advantages to

having a rich uncle but as anyone with rich relatives knows, it is a mixed blessing.

       The analysis points to the difficulties facing Puerto Rico in solving the employment

problem of its male population. Factors that affect employment such as the level of benefits of

social security and eligibility into this program, the minimum wage, federal tax incentives, the

amount of transfer to the poor, and border control are not controlled by Puerto Rico but by the

federal government. Puerto Rico needs to work with the US government to redesign these

programs, which help reduce poverty on the Island, to be more work-friendly. Government

transfers to the poor need to reward work effort in various ways. The Nutritional Assistance

Program could adopt work incentives and time limits similar to those mandated by the US 1996

welfare reform, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act. Puerto

Rico could seek ways to make support of low income persons more compatible with employment,

for instance through Earned Income Tax Credit type arrangements or tax credits to firms on the

basis of the number of jobs created. Although the 936 federal tax benefits program has ended,

Puerto Rico should seek ways to encourage the high-technology industries that it engendered to

expand employment in the future, and to shift some of their purchases of intermediate services

and goods to the Island. For instance, pharmaceutical companies could set up distribution centers

and costumer service centers in Puerto Rico and use Puerto Rican agencies for some of their

marketing campaigns. Non-governmental organizations could try to combine their services to the

low income population with employment. Work activities common to the informal labor market

such as construction and reparation work could be organized through cooperatives of community

workers or through community organizations, bringing these workers out of the shadows of

informality. Since much of the low participation of men occurs among older men, perhaps a shift
                                                                                                 34
in compensation toward deferred benefits such as pensions or health insurance could reduce the

rate of withdrawal from the work force. The goal should be to link benefits to work rather than to

non-work, to induce adult men from out of the work force or informal work into regular jobs, and

raise Puerto Rico from its current position at the bottom of country or area tables of male

employment and labor participation rates.
