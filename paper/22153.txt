                                          ABSTRACT

Are firms more resilient to systemic banking crises in economies with higher levels of social
trust? Using firm-level data in 34 countries from 1990 through 2011, we find that
liquidity-dependent firms in high-trust countries obtain more trade credit and suffer smaller drops
in profits and employment during banking crises than similar firms in low-trust economies. The
results are consistent with the view that when banking crises block the normal banking-
lending channel, greater social trust facilitates access to informal finance, cushioning the effects
of these crises on corporate profits and employment.

1. Introduction

       Systemic banking crises are costly, common, and heavily researched. Boyd, Kwak, and

Smith (2005), Kroszner, Laeven, and Klingebiel (2007), Claessens, Tong, and Wei (2012), and

others show that banking crises shrink output and employment. Reinhardt and Rogoff (2009)

document the ubiquitousness of financial crises throughout history, and Laeven and Valencia

(2012) find that most countries experienced a systemic banking crisis between 1970 and 2011.

Unsurprisingly, therefore, an enormous literature examines the causes of banking crises (e.g., see,

recent reviews by Allen and Gale, 2009 and Laeven, 2011).

       What has received less attention is the resilience of firms—and hence economies—to

systemic banking crises. While many countries experience crises, not all experience similar

reductions in output and employment. Levine, Lin, and Xie (2016) show that well-developed

stock markets mitigate the adverse effects of banking crises by providing an alternative source of

financing when crises curtail the flow of bank credit to firms. But, other factors might also shape

the ability of firms to obtain financing during systemic banking crises.

       In this paper, we examine whether social trust affects (a) the ability of firms to obtain

financing through informal channels when crises reduce the flow of bank loans to firms and (b)

the resilience of corporate profits and employment to systemic banking crises. As defined by

Fukuyama (1995, p. 27) and Putnam (2000, p. 19), social trust means the expectations within a

community that people will behave in honest and cooperative ways and the extent to which

human interactions are governed by the norms of reciprocity and trustworthiness. By informal

finance, we mean credit provision that occurs beyond the scope of a country’s formal financial

and regulatory institutions. For example, firms often receive trade credit that does not involve

collateral or promissory notes subject to formal judicial enforcement mechanisms (Ayyagari,

Demirgüç-Kunt, and Maksimovic, 2010). Trade credit represents a large proportion of debt

financing, accounting for 25% of the average firm’s total debt liabilities in our sample of over

3500 firms across 34 countries from 1990 to 2011.



                                                                                                 1
       Existing research suggests how social trust could enhance corporate resilience to

systemic banking crises. First, when a systemic banking crisis impedes the normal bank-lending

channel, access to trade credit could partially offset the reduction in bank loans and ameliorate

the impact of the crisis on corporate profits and employment. Indeed, Garcia-Appendini and

Montoriol-Garriga (2013) show that the 2007-2008 banking crisis triggered a surge in between-

firm liquidity provision. Second, social trust could facilitate access to trade credit during a

banking crisis. Karlan (2005) shows that people who view their communities as more

trustworthy are more likely to lend money and payback loans even when there are no formal

enforcement mechanisms in place. While firms might prefer bank loans (Ayyagari, Demirgüç-

Kunt, and Maksimovic, 2010), high social trust can increase firms’ access to trade credit when

bank loans are unavailable (Allen, Qian, and Qian, 2005).

       Using a difference-in-differences methodology, we first assess the relation between social

trust and firms’ use of trade credit, profitability, and employment during systemic banking crises.

We use a sample of about 3,600 manufacturing firms across 34 countries over the years from

1990 through 2011. Data on trade credit received, profitability, employment, and other firm-level

information come from Worldscope. Our key explanatory variable is the interaction term

between a measure of social trust (Trust) and a crisis dummy that equals one in the start-year of a

systemic banking crisis and remains one for the three years after the crisis (Crisis). To date

systemic banking crises, we rely on Laeven and Valencia (2012). To measure social trust, we

follow previous studies (e.g., La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, and Vishny, 1997a; Guiso,

Sapienza and Zingales, 2008) and compute the percentage of survey respondents who answer

“most people can be trusted” in response to the question in World Values Survey (WVS),

“Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted, or that you can’t be too

careful in dealing with people?”. We measure Trust three years before the start of a country’s

systemic banking crisis. We interpret greater values of the trust measure as suggesting that

suppliers of trade credit are more confident about the trustworthiness of the demanders of such

credit. If the key interaction term—Trust*Crisis—enters positively, this suggests that, on average,

                                                                                                 2
social trust mitigates the fall in trade credit financing, firm profitability, and firm employment

during systemic banking crises.

        We then explore whether the relation between social trust and firm trade credit, profits,

and employment differs across industries in a theoretically predictable manner. In particular,

since trade credit is a closer substitute for a firm’s short-run liquidity needs than it is for long-

term capital investments (Klapper, Laeven, and Rajan, 2012), the resilience-enhancing effects of

social trust should be greatest among firms that depend heavily on liquid funds. Thus, we not

only assess whether corporations are more resilient to banking crises in higher-trust countries, we

examine differences in the cross-industry resilience to such crises. To measure an industry’s

short-run liquidity needs, we follow Raddatz (2006) and use the proportion of working capital

financed by ongoing sales, so that higher values indicate greater dependence on short-run

liquidity.

        The empirical findings are consistent with the predictions that (1) social trust facilitates

access to trade credit during systemic banking crises, (2) social trust dampens the harmful effects

of the crisis on firm profits and employment, and (3) the resilience-enhancing effects of social

trust are largest among firms that rely heavily on liquidity funds. The analyses control for both

firm fixed effects to condition out all time-invariant, firm-specific features that might account for

a firm’s resilience to a banking crisis and year effects to control for the evolution of corporate

performance, access to trade credit, and resilience to shocks. The regressions also control for an

assortment of time-varying and firm characteristics discussed below. We discover that firms in

higher-trust countries receive more trade credit financing and suffer smaller reductions in profits

and employment than firms in lower-trust countries during systemic banking crises. Moreover,

the relation between social trust and trade credit, profitability, and employment is more

pronounced among industries that depend heavily on external liquidity provision. The evidence

is consistent with the view that social trust improves the resiliency of firms to banking crises.

        The connections between social trust and corporate financing, profits, and employment

are economically meaningful. Consider a hypothetical “average” country that has the sample

                                                                                                    3
average value of social trust (0.328), and a “high-trust” country, where its Trust value is one

standard deviation higher than the sample average (0.496), and set the other country

characteristics constant at their sample average values for both hypothetical countries. The

coefficient estimates from our baseline regressions suggest that in liquidity dependent firms,

trade credit financing drops by 43% less in the high-trust country than it falls in the average

country during a systemic banking crisis. In terms of firm performance and employment, the

coefficient estimates indicate that corporate profits drop by 52% less and firm employment drops

by 18% less in the high-trust country than they drop in the average country during a crisis.

       We address several potential challenges to identifying the impact of social trust on

corporate resilience to banking crises. First, if social trust shapes the size of systemic banking

crises, then our findings might reflect differences in the severity of crises, not the resilience of

firms to similarly-sized banking crises. Our analyses, however, suggest that the results do not

simply reflect the impact of social trust on crisis size. In particular, trust does not explain cross-

country differences in the sizes of banking crises, as measured by the reduction of bank credit.

Moreover, all of the results in the paper hold when controlling for the size of the banking crisis,

or other features of the economy that could account for differences in the severity of the crisis,

such as the size of banks, the level of stock market development, and the overall level of legal

and institutional development.
       Second, social trust could be correlated with variables that account for differences in

corporate performance following banking crises. For example, if social trust is highly correlated

with economic development, bank and stock market development, the degree to which the

formal legal system protects creditors and shareholders, the effectiveness of the legal system in

enforcing contracts, and the overall level of institutional development, this could hinder our

ability to draw sharp inferences about social trust. Consequently, our baseline regressions control

for the interaction between the crisis dummy variable and (a) Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per

capita, (b) the size of the financial intermediary sector, (c) stock market capitalization as a share

of GDP, (d) the contraction of bank credit during the crisis, (e) the legal rights of creditors, and (f)

                                                                                                     4
the legal protection of minority shareholders. Furthermore, we extend these analyses and also

control for the interaction between the crisis dummy and (1) a measure of the rule of law that

corresponds to the extent to which agents have confidence in the operation of the formal

mechanisms for enforcing laws and contracts and (2) a measure of overall institutional quality

that equals the first principle component of property rights, voice of accountability, political

stability and absence of violence, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law, and

control of corruption. When controlling for all of these interaction terms, firm and year fixed

effects, and time-varying firm traits, such as firm size, long-term debt, and Tobin’s Q, we

continue to find that social trust has a statistically significant and economically large association

with corporate resilience to banking crises in liquidity dependent industries. This is consistent

with existing research suggesting that trade credit relies more on social trust (e.g., Allen, Qian,

and Qian, 2005, and Ayyagari, Demirgüç-Kunt, and Maksimovic, 2010), whereas formal

financial arrangements rely more on legal institutions (e.g., La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer,

and Vishny, 1997b, 1998).

       A third challenge to identifying the impact of social trust on corporate resilience to

banking crises involves differential trends across countries, industries, and firms. Specifically,

firms in high trust countries might have different trends in performance from those in low trust

countries, firms in high liquidity dependent industries might have different trends in performance

from those in low liquidity dependent industries in the same country, and firms in high (and low)

liquidity dependent industries in high trust countries might have different trends in firm

performance from corresponding firms in low trust countries. We address these concerns by

adding to the explanatory variables described above (a) country-level time trends for 34

countries in our sample to account for potential differences in time trends across countries, (b)

country-industry time trends for 1151 country-industry pairs to account for potential differences

in time trends across industries in different countries, or (c) firm-level time trends for 3603

sample firms to control for potential differences in time trends across individual firms. The core

results hold.

                                                                                                   5
         This study relates to several strands of research. First, it complements a large number of

studies of how social trust, and social capital more generally, influence economic behavior.

Glaeser et al. (2000) discover that an individual’s broad views of trust, as garnered from

attitudinal surveys, predict trustworthy behavior within experimental settings. Karlan (2005)

shows that attitudes towards trust influence an individual’s willingness to lend based on the

trustworthiness of the borrower and to repay loans even when such loans are not enforceable in

court. More broadly, Guiso, Sapienza and Zingales (2004, 2008) find that trust improves the

operation of national financial systems. And, more broadly still, Knack and Keefer (1997) show

that social trust is associated with faster economic growth, while La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes,

Shleifer, and Vishny (1997a) document the link between trust and corporate performance. Our

paper shows that social trust influences corporate resilience to systemic banking crises.

       Second, our study helps reconcile the mixed findings on the relation between trade and

bank credit. In a study of the recent U.S. financial crisis, Garcia-Appendini and Montoriol-

Garriga (2013) show that nonfinancial firms extend substantial trade credit to their customers

when bank credit is scarce. However, in a study of six emerging economies that experienced

banking crises, Love, Preve, and Sarria-Allende (2007) find that trade credit does not

compensate much for the contraction in bank credit due to crises. Focusing on the financing

patterns of 48 countries in 1999, Beck, Demirgüç-Kunt, and Maksimovic (2008) show that while

firms that are financially constrained can partially substitute trade for bank finance, the

availability of trade credit is more limited in developing economies. Our findings suggest that

cross-country differences in social trust shape cross-country differences in the degree to which

firms substitute trade credit for bank credit during banking crises.

       Third, our findings add to a growing literature on finance and employment. By allocating

resources efficiently, well-developed financial markets can improve labor markets (Pagano and

Volpin, 2008; Beck, Levine, and Levkov, 2010). Our findings suggest that social trust helps

mitigate the impact of banking crises on unemployment by making it easier for firms to access

alternative, informal sources of financing.

                                                                                                 6
        The rest of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 defines the data, Section 3 describes

the empirical methodology, Section 4 presents the empirical results on social trust and financing

during systemic banking crises, Section 5 gives the results on trust and firm profits and

employment during crises, and Section 6 concludes.



2. Data

2.1 Sample

        Our initial sample begins with the 65 countries that both have data on social trust in the

World Values Survey and experienced at least one systemic banking crisis during the period from

1990 through 2011 according to Laeven and Valencia (2012). For this initial sample, we obtain

firm-level data from the Worldscope database by Thomson Reuters. We then further restrict the

sample of countries and firms based on the following criteria. First, we focus on publicly listed

firms in manufacturing industries (U.S. Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code between

2000 – 3999). Second, a firm needs to have complete financial information in the Worldscope

database over the seven-year crisis window, [t-3, t+3], where t equals the start year of a systemic

crisis as defined by Laeven and Valencia (2012). Third, we eliminate observations with negative

assets, negative book equity, or negative cost of goods sold. Fourth, a country needs to have at
least three firms with complete information. Fifth, a country must be covered in (a) Djankov, La

Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer (2008), so that we have information on shareholder

protection laws, and in (b) Djankov, McLiesh, and Shleifer (2007), so that we have information

on the creditor protection laws. Finally, we exclude firms in the U.S. from our analyses because

we rely on the U.S. firms to benchmark industries.

        These selection criteria yield a sample of over 3500 firms across 34 countries over the

period from 1990 through 2011. In total, the sample contains over 22,500 firm-year observations.

The average firm in our sample has six years of data. Appendix Table A1 describes all of

variables in detail.



                                                                                                 7
2.2 Social trust measure

       The World Values Survey (WVS) aims to measure the “beliefs, values, and motivations

of people” across countries and has been widely used in prior studies to capture cross-country

variations in trust (e.g., Knack and Keefer, 1997; La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, and

Vishny, 1997a). From the WVS, we use the answer to the following to measure trust.

       “Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted, or that you

       can’t be too careful in dealing with people?”

The WVS offers three possible responses: (1) most people can be trusted; (2) you can’t be too

careful in dealing with other people; and (3) I don’t know. Following La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes,

Shleifer, and Vishny (1997a) and Guiso, Sapienza, and Zingales (2008), we calculate Trust

within a country as the percentage of respondents who reply that most people can be trusted.

       We use the pre-crisis measure of trust in each country. Given that WVS was conducted

close to every other year since 1990, we use Trust in period t-3, where t represents the start year

of a banking crisis in the country, or in closest, previous period to t-3 based on data availability.

Summary statistics in Table 1 show that the average level of trust in our sample is 0.328 with a

standard deviation of 0.168. Denmark has the highest level of trust, 0.665, while Philippines and

Turkey have the lowest, 0.055 (see Table A2 in the Appendix).



2.3 Systemic banking crises

       We use the database complied by Laeven and Valencia (2012) to determine the start year

of each crisis in a country. It is a comprehensive database of banking crisis episodes during the

period from 1970 through 2011 across more than 100 countries. They define the start year of a

systemic banking crisis as the first year when the overall banking system exhibits significant

symptoms of financial distress, including bank runs and bank liquidations, and when the

government intervenes in the banking sector in response to significant losses in the banking

sector. Importantly, the crises episodes based on Laeven and Valencia (2012) identify periods

with financial distress in the entire banking sector, as opposed to problems with individual banks.

                                                                                                   8
        For each crisis event, we focus on a seven-year window, [t-3, t+3], centered on the start

year of the crisis t, during which [t-3, t-1] is defined as the pre-crisis period and [t, t+3] is defined

as the crisis period. We define Crisis as a dummy variable that equals one if a country is in a

crisis period and zero during the pre-crisis period. Appendix Table A2 lists the start years of

systemic banking crises for the 34 countries. As shown, 18 countries suffered systemic crises

during the recent global financial crisis, and six had crises during the East Asian financial crisis.

Over the years from 1990 through 2011, all of the countries in our sample had one systemic

crisis except Argentina, which had two. In dating the two Argentine crises, we follow Kroszner,

Laeven, and Klingebiel (2007). The start years of the first and second banking crisis in Argentina

are 1995 and 2001 respectively. We define the pre-crisis period for both crises as [1992, 1994].

The crisis period for the first crisis is [1995, 1998], while it is [2001, 2004] for the second crisis.

The paper’s conclusions hold when excluding Argentina. Furthermore, we also conducted all of

the paper’s analyses using a narrower window [t-1, t+1]. All of the results hold.



2.4 Firm-level variables

        Using data from Worldscope, we construct measures of trade credit. We begin with the

balance sheet item, Account payable, which equals the amount of good and services that a

purchasing firm receives from suppliers before paying for them. Account payable is not a formal

legal instrument, and the purchasing firm does not sign a promissory note. While Account

payable is a stock entry on the firm’s balance sheet, Trade credit financing equals the change in

Account payable during a particular time period. Trade credit financing is positive if the firm

receives more goods and services than it pays. Trade credit financing will be negative if the firm

not only pays for the goods and services that it receives but it also pays down at least some of the

stock of accounts payable.

        Based on these components, we construct and examine two measures of trade credit: (1)

Trade credit financing/CoGS equals Trade credit financing divided by the cost of goods sold

(CoGS), during the period and (2) Trade credit financing/total assets equals Trade credit

                                                                                                       9
financing divided by the book value of total assets at the beginning of period t. Table 1 provides

summary statistics for these variables. Trade credit financing/CoGS has a sample mean of 0.007

and a standard deviation of 0.076, meaning that the average increase in trade credit obtained

from the suppliers equals 0.7 percentage points of a firm’s cost of goods sold, with a

corresponding standard deviation of 7.6 percentage points.

       Besides these informal financing measures, we also examine two measures of formal

financing. Following Baker, Stein, and Wurgler (2003), we infer the amount of new equity

issuance from a firm’s balance sheet items, and define Equity issuance as the change in the book

value of common equity plus the change in the deferred taxes minus the change in the retained

earnings during year t, scaled by the book value of total asset at the beginning of period t. Debt

issuance equals the change in the Total debt during a particular year t, scaled by total assets at

the beginning of year t. Total debt is the sum of short-term debt and long-term debt excluding

capitalized leases. Table 1 shows that Equity issuance ranges from -0.289 to 1.305 with a sample

mean of 0.031, and Debt issuance ranges from -0.232 to 0.618 with a sample mean of 0.021.

       To assess firm performance, we consider both measures of operating profitability and

employment. EBIT equals the ratio of earnings before interest and tax during a period to the book

value of total assets at the start of the period. In robustness tests reported in Appendix Table A7,

we use two additional profitability indicators. Net income equals the ratio of earnings after

interest and taxes to the book value of total assets at the start of the period. We use Net income to

account for variations in interest and tax expenses across countries. The other measure of

profitability is Cash flow, which equals the ratio of net earnings plus depreciation and

amortization to the book value of assets at the start of the period. Cash flow helps address

concerns that differences in earnings management account for differences in the firm profitability

measures. Finally, Firm employment equals the natural logarithm of the total number of

employees in a firm. Since Worldscope provides employment data in units of 1,000, Firm

employment equals zero when a firm has 1,000 or fewer employees.



                                                                                                  10
       Table 1 shows that there is considerable variation in firm performance during banking

crises. The values of EBIT range from -0.527 to 0.493, with a sample mean of 0.057 and a

standard deviation of 0.12. The values of Firm employment range from 0 to 13 with a standard

deviation of 1.8, suggesting that the number of workers in our sample of firms ranges from one

thousand to over 500,000.

       We use data on several other time-varying, firm-level characteristics in our analyses,

including firm size, long-term debt, and Tobin’s Q. Table A1 provides the definitions of these

variables, which we discuss when we present the analyses below. We winsorize all firm-level

financial variables at the 1% and 99% levels to reduce the impact of outliers.

       Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the changes in trade credit financing, profits, and employment

during banking crises. The figures suggest that Trade credit financing/CoGS, EBIT, and Firm

employment drop less in countries with higher levels of Trust. First, for each firm, we calculate

the difference between (a) the outcome variable averaged over the crisis period, [t, t+3] and (b)

the outcome variable averaged over the pre-crisis period, [t-3, t-1], where t denotes the start year

of the country’s banking crisis. Then we average the differences across all of the firms within the

same country. Finally, we plot each country-level change against its pre-crisis level of trust. The

fitted line in Figure 1 is upward-sloping, suggesting that while the amount of new trade credit

that purchasers receive during banking crises falls in most countries (as the country averages for

the change in Trade credit financing/CoGS are mostly below zero), it falls less in countries with

higher levels of Trust, which, as defined above, is measured before the crisis. Similarly, Figure 2

exhibits an upward-sloping relationship between Trust and firm performance over banking crisis.

In particular, firm profits and firm employment tend to fall less during banking crises in

countries with higher Trust.



2.5 Industry-level liquidity needs measures

       In most of our analyses, we seek to differentiate industries by the degree to which

technology shapes their reliance on external liquidity, such as trade credit. Industries that require

                                                                                                  11
large amounts of working capital to finance their operations for technological reasons, such as

the length of the production process, the mode of production (batch vs. continuous), the

importance of smoothing investments over long periods, and the structure of the adjustment costs

associated with altering investment plans, tend to rely more heavily on the provision of external

liquidity. As argued by Raddatz (2006), among the different components of working capital,

inventories are a particularly suitable proxy for the technological demand for liquid funds.

        Thus, our proxy for an industry’s technological reliance on trade credit, or more broadly

short-term liquidity, equals the ratio of inventories to sales and is calculated across U.S.

companies at the three-digit SIC industry level (Liquidity needs). 1 It measures the extent to
which inventories cannot be financed by current revenue, such that higher values of Liquidity

needs indicate a greater reliance on external liquidity. In using data from the United States to

create this proxy of the technological reliance of industries on external liquidity, we follow Rajan

and Zingales (1998) in assuming that U.S. financial markets and institutions are relatively

developed, so that the cross-industry differences in the external liquidity needs of U.S. industries

primarily reflect technological differences across industries in the demand for such funds.

Furthermore, using one country to benchmark the technological liquidity needs of industries is

advantageous because the liquidity needs of an industry may vary across countries due to

differences in capital market development. We thus use U.S. Liquidity needs as a proxy for the

technology-driven demand for trade credit across industries around the world.

        For a country c that experienced a crisis starting in year t, we construct its Liquidity needs

using U.S. industry data over the period from t-10 through t-1. For instance, given that a

systemic banking crisis occurred in Japan in 1997, we use the U.S. data over the period of 1987 –

1996 to calculate the Liquidity needs of each industry in Japan. More specifically, for each U.S.

firm i within the ten-year window corresponding to crisis year t, we use Compustat to compute

the ratio of inventories to sales in each year and we then take the median value of this ratio over

1
 We use Compustat to obtain financial data of the U.S. companies, and CRSP to collect information on the U.S.
Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) because CRSP provides time-varying data on the SIC of firms.

                                                                                                          12
the ten-year window and call it Li. Next, we calculate the median value of Li across U.S. firms

with the same three-digit SIC code and call this value the Liquidity needs of that industry in

crisis country c. Thus, Liquidity needs (a) is time-invariant for each crisis country and (b) differs

across countries that experience systemic crises in different years.

       In robustness tests reported in the Appendix, we consider two alternative proxies for an

industry’s technological dependence on external liquidity. First, we examine Inventories/CoGS,

which equals inventories divided by the cost of goods sold. Dividing inventories by the cost of

sales, as opposed to the revenue of sales, is a common indicator of inventory turnover. A higher

value of Inventories/CoGS suggests a lower speed of inventory turnover. With greater

inventories and slower turnover, companies typically need more liquid funds for working capital.

Second, we calculate for each industry the extent to which it uses trade credit. Ng, Smith, and

Smith (1999) show that trade credit tends to exhibit considerable variation across industries, but

little intertemporal variation within an industry, and Fisman and Love (2003) find a strong

industry-specific element to accessing trade credit. Thus, we construct Trade credit reliance as

the ratio of Accounts payable to Total debt. We calculate both Inventories/CoGS and Trade

credit reliance for industries in the crisis countries using the same procedure as in the

construction of Liquidity needs. Appendix Table A1 provides detailed descriptions on how we

construct these measures. We show that the results hold when using each of the three proxies for

an industry’s technological dependence on liquidity provision. We focus on Liquidity needs, i.e.,

Inventories/Sales, because it is the most direct proxy for firms’ dependence on liquid funds, as it

is defined as the proportion of inventories (or working capital more broadly) that are financed by

current sales.

       Table 1 shows that there is considerable cross-industry variation in the three proxies for

an industry’s technological dependence on liquidity provision. The values of Liquidity needs

vary from 0.012 to 0.364. This range is similar to that reported in Raddatz (2006), where the

measure of liquidity needs is calculated using U.S. data over the 1980s. The other measure,

Inventories/CoGS, exhibits a similar magnitude of variation. Trade credit reliance has a

                                                                                                  13
minimum value of 0.055 and a maximum value of 2.717. This means that the ratio of trade

payable to total debt ranges from 5.5% to 271.7%.

       Figures 3 and 4 indicate that trade credit financing, firm profits, and firm employment fall

less during banking crises in high-trust countries than they fall in low-trust countries and this

difference is larger among industries with higher Liquidity needs. The figures plot the simple

changes in firm outcome variables while differentiating between countries with high and low

trust and between industries with high and low liquidity needs. For each firm, we calculate the

difference between the outcome variables (trade credit financing, earnings before interest and tax,

and employment, all scaled by the book value of total assets) averaged over the crisis period, [t,

t+3], and the corresponding pre-crisis period, [t-3, t-1]. We then average the differences across

firms in four groups: high (low) liquidity needs industries in countries with high trust, and high

(low) liquidity needs industries in countries with low trust. We classify a country into the high

(low) trust group if its level of trust lies above (below) the median value of the sample countries.

We classify an industry into the high (low) liquidity needs group if its measure of Liquidity needs

lies above (below) the median of the sample of industries. Figure 3 shows that among high

liquidity needs industries, Trade credit financing drops, on average, by 0.85% of total assets

during a banking crisis in high-trust countries and drops by 1.6% in low-trust countries. In

contrast, the difference in the drop in Trade credit financing/Total assets between high- and low-

trust countries is negligible when focusing on low liquidity needs industries. Figure 4 shows that

the changes in firm profits and employment during crises exhibit similar patterns, suggesting that

firm profits and employment among high-liquidity needs industries drop less in high-trust

countries.



2.6 Country controls

       In assessing the association between social trust and firm outcomes, we control for time-

varying country characteristics, such as macroeconomic conditions, financial development, and

investor protection laws and call these Macro controls. In the analyses, we interact each of these

                                                                                                 14
controls with Crisis. First, to control for the possibility that firms in more developed economies

perform relatively better during a crisis, we use GDP per capita, which equals the natural

logarithm of GDP per capita measured three years before a country’s crisis, t-3. Second, we use

two variables to control for the development of financial intermediaries and markets. Financial

institutions development equals the private credit by banks and other financial institutions

divided by GDP. Stock market development equals stock market capitalization divided by GDP.

We use the values measured three years before the crisis. Third, we control for the size of a crisis,

by computing the contraction in the growth rate of credit. Specifically, Private credit contraction

equals the average annual growth rate of bank credit over the pre-crisis period, [t-3, t-1], minus

the minimum annual growth rate of bank credit over the crisis period, [t, t+3], where t is the start

year of a banking crisis. By definition, larger Private credit contraction means a greater

reduction in bank credit growth, and hence a more severe banking crisis. Fourth, we control for

two types of investor protection laws since investor protection laws might affect firm

performance during a banking crisis. Creditor rights is an index constructed by Djankov,

McLiesh, and Shleifer (2007) based on bankruptcy and reorganization laws across countries. It

measures the ability of creditors to voice their opinions, get repaid, and affect the process of

reorganizing delinquent corporations. The overall index ranges from zero to four, with higher

value indicating greater creditor power. Anti-self-dealing is an index constructed by Djankov, La

Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer (2008) to measure the extent to which minority

shareholders are protected by the law from being expropriated by corporate insiders via self-

dealing transactions. The index ranges from zero to one, with larger value indicating that it is

more difficult for large shareholders to engage in self-dealing transactions. Appendix Table A1

provides additional details on these Macro controls, and Table 1 reports summary statistics. 2



2
 In robustness tests, we control for additional country-level measures of the rule of law and institutional quality. We
discuss these below. Appendix Table A1 provides detailed variable definitions, and Table A2 lists these macro
variables by each country.


                                                                                                                    15
3. Empirical Methodology

         To assess whether firms in countries with higher levels of social trust receive more

financing and perform better during a banking crisis than similar firms in other countries, we

begin with the following specification.



                      𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡 = 𝛼𝛼0 + 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 + 𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡 + 𝜷𝜷 ∗ 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑐𝑐 ∗ 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡 + 𝜃𝜃 ∗ 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡 +

                                      𝝋𝝋′ ∗ 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑐𝑐 ∗ 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡 + 𝜸𝜸′ ∗ 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡 ,                    (1)



where 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡 refers to either trade credit received, equity issued, debt issued,
profitability, or employment by firm 𝑖𝑖, in country 𝑐𝑐, during year 𝑡𝑡; 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 and 𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡 are firm and year

fixed effects; and 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−1 represents a set of time-varying firm characteristics (e.g., Firm size,

Long-term debt, and Tobin’s q). The variable of focus is 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑐𝑐 * 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡 , which is the

interaction of the social trust measure for country c and the systemic crisis dummy variable,

𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡 . Recall that 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡 equals one for country 𝑐𝑐 in years t through t+3 and zero otherwise,

where t is the start-year of the systemic banking crisis. The estimated coefficient on the

interaction between 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑐𝑐 and 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡 , 𝛽𝛽, measures the differential outcome during a crisis of

firms operating in countries with different levels of social trust. The error term is denoted as 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡 .

We employ ordinary least squares (OLS) to estimate the coefficients in equation (1).

Heteroskedasticity robust standard errors are clustered at the country level. Our results hold

when using two-way clustering at the country and year levels, as shown in Appendix Table A4.

         In equation (1), we control for several factors to better isolate the independent association

between social trust and firm outcomes. We allow firm outcomes during crises to vary by (a) the

level of economic development, (b) the level of development of financial intermediaries, (c) the

size of national stock exchanges, (d) the size of the banking crisis, (e) the degree to which the

legal system protects small investors from self-dealing by corporate insiders, and (f) the strength

of the legal rights of creditors. Thus, equation (1) includes the interactions between 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡 and

a vector of macro-country variables, which we call 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑐𝑐 , where 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑐𝑐 includes GDP per

                                                                                                                                        16
capita, Financial institutions development, Stock market development, Private credit contraction,

Anti-self-dealing, and Creditor rights. These macro-country variables, except Private credit

contraction and Anti-self-dealing, are measured at t-3.

       We then build on equation (1) to assess additional implications of the view that social

trust increases corporate resilience to systemic banking crises. According to this view, social

trust will exert a disproportionately positive impact on firms that—for technological reasons—

rely comparatively heavily on liquid funds. To test this prediction, we first divide industries into

those that depend heavily on liquidity for technological reasons and those that are less reliant on

liquidity. We then evaluate whether firms in industries that depend heavily on liquidity perform

comparatively better in countries with high levels of social trust during crises than similar firms

in countries with lower levels of social trust and whether firms in liquidity-dependent industries

perform comparatively better than other firms in the same country. As described in the data

section above, we distinguish industries by their natural degree of dependence on short-term

liquidity (or trade credit) using three measures that all use the U.S. to benchmark industries.

Specifically, we use (a) Liquidity needs, which equals the ratio of inventories to sales among U.S.

firms in each industry, (b) Inventories/CoGS, which equals the ratio of inventories to cost of

goods sold among U.S. firms in each industry, and (c) Trade credit reliance, which equals the

ratio of accounts payable to total debt among U.S. firms in each industry.

       We address several challenges to identifying the impact of social trust on corporate

resilience to systemic banking crises. First, we were concerned that social trust might be

correlated with the size of banking crises. If this were the case, then our analyses might capture

differences in the severity of crises, not the resilience of firms to crises of similar sizes. As

reported in Appendix Table A3, however, there is not a statistically significant relation between

banking crisis size (Private credit contraction) and Trust. Moreover, as noted above, our

analyses control for country fixed effects and the interaction between Private credit contraction

and Crisis to condition out differences in the size of banking crises.



                                                                                                 17
         Second, to address the concern that our findings on corporate resilience to banking crises

reflect other features of economies besides social trust, we do the following. In addition to

controlling for firm and year fixed effects and an assortment of time-varying firm characteristics,

we control for the interaction between social trust and measures of the size of the crisis,

economic development, bank and stock market development, the degree to which the formal

legal system protects creditors and shareholders, the effectiveness of the legal system in

enforcing contracts, and the overall level of institutional development. Additionally, we augment

these analyses and further difference by industry. We assess the differential response of high and

low liquidity needs industries to systemic crises in economies with different levels of social trust.

In this way, we evaluate narrower, industry-specific predictions about the mechanisms through

which social trust shapes corporate resilience to crises.

         A third challenge to our identification strategy is pre-trends. We were concerned that

there might be trends in corporate profits, employment, and trade credit that vary systematically

across high and low trust countries and that even vary systematically across industries in high

and low trust economies. To address this we conduct three additional tests. First, we include

𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑐𝑐 * 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 into Equation (1), where 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑐𝑐 represents a vector of 34 country dummy
variables, and 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 is a time trend indicator that equals one in t-3, two in t-2, … and seven in

t+3. Second, we include 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶_𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑐𝑐,𝑗𝑗 * 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 , where 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶_𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑐𝑐,𝑗𝑗

represents a vector of 1151 country-industry dummies at the three-digit SIC level. These

interaction terms account both for different trends across industries within the same country and

for different trends between industries with the same SIC code across different countries. Third,

we include 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖 * 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇, where 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖 is a set of 3603 individual firm dummies. These

additional terms remove differential trends across individual firms.



4. Trust and Financing during Banking Crises

         Table 2 reports regression results evaluating whether social trust facilitates trade credit

financing when an economy experiences a systemic banking crisis. We use two measures of

                                                                                                                     18
trade credit. In columns (1) – (3), the dependent variable is changes in trade credit received

relative to the cost of goods sold (Trade credit financing/CoGS), while the dependent variable in

columns (4) – (6) is the ratio of changes in trade credit received to total assets (Trade credit

financing/Total assets). For both measures of trade credit, Table 2 provides results on the full

sample firms, on the subsample of firms with above the median value of Liquidity needs (High

Liquidity needs), and on the subsample of firms with below the median value of Liquidity needs

(Low Liquidity needs). The variable of interest is the interaction term, Trust*Crisis, which

captures the extent to which social trust facilitates trade credit when bank credit contracts during

a crisis.

        The results are consistent with the view that social trust improves firms’ access to trade

finance during systemic banking crises. Specifically, columns (2) and (5) of Table 2 show that (a)

the coefficient on Trust*Crisis is positive and statistically significant at the 1% level among

firms in industries that rely heavily on trade credit for technological reasons, i.e., in High

Liquidity needs industries, and (b) this positive association between social trust and trade credit

financing during crises holds when using either measure of trade credit (Trade credit

financing/CoGS and Trade credit financing/Total assets). Furthermore, and consistent with

theory, columns (3) and (6) show that Trust*Crisis enters insignificantly among firms in Low

Liquidity needs industries. Moreover, the difference in the coefficients on Trust*Crisis between

the High- and Low-Liquidity-needs groups is statistically significant at least at the 5% level as

shown at the bottom of the table.

        The economic magnitudes are meaningful. To see this, consider a hypothetical “average”

country with the sample average value of Trust (0.328), and a hypothetical “high-trust” country

with a value of Trust that is one standard deviation higher than the average (0.496=0.328+0.168).

Furthermore, hold everything constant about these countries. The coefficient estimates reported

in column (2) indicate that a banking crisis is associated with a reduction in trade credit financing

among High liquidity needs firms of 1.4% of the firms’ cost of goods sold for the average



                                                                                                  19
country, and a reduction of only 0.8% among comparable firms in high-trust countries. 3 Thus,

among firms in industries that depend heavily on liquid funds, those in the high-trust country

experience a 43% (= (0.8-1.4)/1.4) smaller contraction in trade credit than those in the average

country during a systemic banking crisis. These results are robust to using the alternative

measure of trade credit (Trade credit financing/Total assets). We find that both the statistical

significance and the economic magnitudes of the estimated effects are very similar when using

Trade credit financing/Total assets.

         The results are robust to controlling for other factors. There might be concerns that the

impact of a systemic crisis on the economy, including on the provision of trade credit, could

reflect other features of the economy, such as the level of economic development, the size of

financial institutions, the development stock markets, and the degree to which the legal system

protects creditors and small shareholders. Thus, the regressions control for the interaction

between the Crisis dummy and GDP per capita, Financial institutions development, Stock

market development, Creditor rights index, and Anti-self-dealing index. As shown in Table 2, the

results hold when conditioning on these country characteristics. We were also concerned that

social trust might influence the size of banking crises, which would confound our ability to

assess the impact of social trust on trade credit. Thus, we also include the interaction between

Crisis and Private credit contraction. Again, the results on the response of trade credit to a

systemic crisis are robust to controlling for the contraction in bank credit, further emphasizing

the positive connection between trust and trade credit following systemic banking crises.

         The results are also robust to using two alternative proxies for the liquidity dependence of

industries. The first alternative proxy is Inventories/CoGS, which differs from Liquidity needs in


3
 We calculate this figure using the coefficient estimates from column (2) in Table 2, and the corresponding sample
means in Table 1. For the high liquidity needs industries, the trade credit financing received from suppliers falls by
1.4% of the CoGS in the hypothetical ‘average’ country [-0.01435 = (0.0369*0.328) – 0.0012 – (0.00321*9.211) –
(0.0121*0.807) + (0.00858*0.579) + (0.00111*0.287) + (0.00448*0.440) + (0.00331*2.059)], and by 0.8% of the
CoGS in the ‘high-trust’ country [-0.008157 = (0.0369*0.496) – 0.0012 – (0.00321*9.211) – (0.0121*0.807) +
(0.00858*0.579) + (0.00111*0.287) + (0.00448*0.440) + (0.00331*2.059)]. Thus, firms in the high-trust country
experience a 43% (= (1.4-0.8)/1.4) smaller drop in trade credit financing than those in the average country over a
banking crisis.

                                                                                                                   20
that it scales inventories by the cost of goods sold rather than by sales. The second alternative is

Trade credit reliance, which equals accounts payable divided by total debt. The analyses in

Appendix Table A5 are similar to those in Table 2, except that Table A5 partitions by high and

low values of Inventories/CoGS in columns (1) – (2) and by high and low values of Trade credit

reliance in columns (3) – (4). As shown, we continue to find that firms in liquidity dependent

industries receive considerably more trade credit during banking crises in high-trust countries

than comparable firms in low-trust countries. That is, Trust*Crisis, enters positively and

significantly among liquidity dependent firms, but insignificantly among firms that depend less

on external liquidity for their operations. These results are consistent with the view that social

trust facilitates the provision of trade credit when there is a contraction in bank credit during

systemic crises.

       We were concerned that Trust might be correlated with the quality of formal legal,

regulatory, and political institutions, which might confound our ability to identify the impact of

social trust on corporate resilience. To address this concern, we control for the interaction

between Crisis and the Rule of law and Institutional quality in Table 3. Rule of law measures the

extent to which agents have confidence in and abide by the rules of society, particularly the

enforcement quality of private and official contracts. Institutional quality is an index that

aggregates information on (a) the legal protection of private property, (b) the freedom of speech

and accountability of government officials, (c) political stability, (d) government effectiveness,

(e) the ability of the government to implement regulatory policies, (f) the Rule of law, and (g) the

extent to which institutions control corruption. Similar to Table 2, Table 3 splits the sample

based on the median value of industrial Liquidity needs.

       Table 3 shows that after controlling for the quality of formal institutions, all of the results

hold. The coefficients on Trust*Crisis in the high Liquidity needs industry group remain

statistically significant and economically meaningful after controlling for these additional

interactions, whereas those in the low Liquidity needs industry group remain insignificant.

Moreover, the estimated coefficients for the high Liquidity needs industry group do not fall when

                                                                                                   21
controlling for institutional quality. These results are consistent with our conjecture that it is the

mutual trust between firms, not the rule of law or the quality of institutions, that plays a

significant role in facilitating trade credit as a substitute to bank credit during a crisis. 4

        We were also concerned that (1) firms in high trust countries might have different time

trends in trade credit from those in low trust countries, (2) firms in high liquidity dependent

industries might have different trends in trade credit from those in low liquidity dependent

industries in the same country, and (3) firms in high (and low) liquidity dependent industries in

high trust countries might have different trends in this alternative financing from corresponding

firms in low trust countries. To address these concerns, we include Trends interacted with (a) 34

country dummies, (b) 1151 country-industry dummies, or (c) 3603 individual firm dummies. By

adding these additional trend controls, we explicitly account for the preexisting time trends

across countries, country-industries, and firms.

        As shown in Table 4, the results hold when accounting for these different trends.

Columns (1), (4), and (7) indicate that Trust*Crisis enters positively and statistically in the trade

credit financing regression after controlling for individual country, country-industry, or firm

trends, respectively, and while continuing to control for firm and year fixed effects as well as the

time-varying macro interaction and firm controls. Moreover, when we partition the overall

sample into high and low liquidity needs industries and control for individual country/country-

industry/firm trends, the results indicate that the resilience-enhancing effects of social trust on

trade credit are more profound among industries that depend heavily on short-term liquidity.

These results are fully consistent with the main findings in Table 2. While Table 4 uses Trade

credit financing/CoGS as the dependent variable throughout the columns, all the results hold

when using the other measure, Trade credit financing/Total assets.

        We next explore whether greater social trust is also associated with corporations issuing

more equity and debt during banking crises. As discussed in the Introduction, several existing

 As shown in Appendix Table A6, all of these results hold when using the two alternative metrics for differentiating
between high- and low-liquidity needs industries: Inventories/CoGS and Trade credit reliance.

                                                                                                                 22
studies suggest that social trust exerts a larger impact on informal transactions, such as the

extension of trade credit, than it does on more formal financing channels, such as equity and debt

issuance. From this perspective, trust will primarily affect corporate resilience through the trade

credit channel rather than by influencing equity and debt issuance that rely on formal legal

arrangements.

          The results reported in Table 5 indicate that Trust does not affect a firm’s issuance of

equity and debt during banking crises. As shown, Trust*Crisis enters insignificantly in both the

Equity Issuance and Debt Issuance regressions, whether examining the full sample or when

splitting the sample into high and low Liquidity needs industries. The results suggest that social

trust does not affect corporate resilience by shaping a firm’s access to equity and debt.



5. Trust and Firm Profitability and Employment during Banking Crises

          We now evaluate whether corporate profits and employment are more resilient to banking

crises in economies with greater social trust. To do this, we again employ equation (1), using

corporate profits and employment as dependent variables, and assess whether Trust*Crisis enters

positively when examining firms with high Liquidity needs.

          As shown in Table 6, firms in high Liquidity needs industries in high-trust economies

enjoy a smaller drop in profits (EBIT) than similar firms in low-trust countries. For example,

consider column (2) for high Liquidity needs firms. The crisis dummy itself enters the regression

negatively and significantly, meaning that banking crises on average lead to a reduction in firm

profitability. However, the adverse effects of banking crises on profitability are less pronounced

in high-trust economies, and especially among firms with high liquidity needs, as shown by the

positive and significant coefficient on Trust*Crisis. In conjunction with the findings on social

trust and trade credit, these results are consistent with the view that social trust makes firms more

resilient to the drying up of bank credit during crises by facilitating corporate access to trade

credit.



                                                                                                  23
         The economic magnitude of the estimated impact of trust on firm profitability is

substantial. Consider the coefficient estimates on the sample of firms in high Liquidity needs

industries (column (2) of Table 6). The estimates suggest that a one standard deviation increase

in the measure of trust (0.168) leads to a two-percentage-point (=0.168*0.126) increase in EBIT.

This amount is equivalent to 37% of the sample mean of EBIT (0.057), as shown in Table 1), and

18% of the standard deviation of EBIT (0.12). To further illustrate the economic size, consider (1)

an “average” country that has average values of Trust, GDP per capita, Financial institutions

development, Stock market development, Private credit contraction, Anti-self-dealing, and

Creditor rights, and (2) a “high-trust” country with the same levels of all country characteristics

except that Trust is one-standard deviation higher than the sample average, 0.496

(=0.328+0.168). According to the coefficient estimates in column (2), a banking crisis reduces

EBIT on average by about 4% for the average country, and by 2% for the high-trust country. 5
Thus, EBIT among firms in high Liquidity needs industries in the high-trust country falls by

about 50% less during banking crises than similar firms in countries with average levels of social

trust.

         Besides profits, social trust could also affect employment. If social trust eases a firm’s

access to trade credit when bank credit contracts during a crisis, then this could reduce the

adverse effects of banking crises on firm employment. Thus, we test whether firms in high

Liquidity needs industries in higher social trust economies have a smaller drop in employment

during a banking crisis than similar firms in countries with lower social trust.

         We find that high Liquidity needs firms in high-trust countries experience a smaller drop

in Firm employment during banking crises than similar firms in low-trust countries. As shown in

column (5) of Table 6, the interaction term, Trust*Crisis, enters positively and significantly at


5
  We calculate the average effect of a banking crisis on EBIT by plugging the sample means of the macro variables
and the corresponding coefficient estimates from column (2) of Table 6: -4.09% (= 0.126*0.328 - 0.28 +
0.0208*9.211 - 0.03*0.807 + 0.00000148*0.579 - 0.0275*0.287 + 0.0894*0.44 - 0.000518*2.059). In similar
fashion, we calculate the effect of a banking crisis for the high-trust country using the corresponding coefficients in
column (2): -1.97% (= 0.126*0.496 - 0.28 + 0.0208*9.211 - 0.03*0.807 + 0.00000148*0.579 - 0.0275*0.287 +
0.0894*0.44 - 0.000518*2.059).

                                                                                                                    24
the 5% level in the high Liquidity-needs industries, indicating that trust helps mitigate the

adverse shock of a crisis on Firm employment among industries that rely heavily on liquidity

provisions. In contrast—and consistent with the theory of how social trust influences corporate

resilience by facilitating access to trade credit, column (6) shows that the coefficient estimate on

Trust*Crisis is insignificant in the low Liquidity-needs industries.

         The estimated magnitudes are large. 6 Again, consider an “average” country and a “high-

trust” country with Trust, which is the same as the average country except that it has one-

standard deviation higher Trust. According to the OLS estimates in column (5) of Table 6, a

banking crisis reduces corporate employment among high Liquidity needs firms by 25% in the

average country, but by 20% in the high-trust country. 7 Thus, among high Liquidity needs firms,
employment falls by almost 20% less during a systemic banking crisis in the high-trust country.

         These results on corporate profits and employment are robust to many factors. First, the

Table 6 regressions condition on the Macro interaction controls, i.e., the regressions include the

interactions between Crisis and (a) GDP per capita, (b) Financial institutions development, (c)

Stock market development, (d) Private credit contraction, (e) Anti-self-dealing, and (f) Creditor

rights. Furthermore, the regressions include firm and year fixed effects, as well as time-varying

Firm controls (Firm size, Long-term debt, and Tobin’s Q). Second, Table 7 shows that the results

are robust to controlling for the level of development of formal institutions. As in Table 3, Table

7 controls for the interaction between Crisis and Rule of law and Institutional quality and

demonstrates that all of the results hold. 8 Third, the results are robust to examining alternative

measures of firm performance, such as Net income and corporate Cash flow (Appendix Table

6
  Note that we can interpret the coefficients in percentage changes because Firm employment is defined as the
natural logarithm of the total number of employees in a firm.
7
  We calculate the average effect of a systemic banking crisis by plugging in the sample average values and the
corresponding coefficient estimates using column (5) of Table 6: -24.6% (=0.257*0.328 – 1.574 + 0.126*9.211 +
0.0818*0.807 – 0.0583*0.579 + 0.155*0.287 + 0.191*0.44 – 0.0377*2.059). Similarly, for the high-trust country,
We plug in Trust with a value that is one standard deviation above the sample mean while holding other country
characteristics with their mean values: -20.3% (=0.257*0.496 – 1.574 + 0.126*9.211 + 0.0818*0.807 –
0.0583*0.579 + 0.155*0.287 + 0.191*0.44 – 0.0377*2.059).

  As shown in Appendix Table A9, all of these results hold when using the two alternative metrics for differentiating

                                                                                                                  25
A7), or to using alternative measures of the technological level of liquidity needs, such as

Inventories/CoGS and Trade credit reliance (Appendix Table A8).

       The results are also robust to controlling for differential trends, as shown in Table 8. In a

series of sensitivity analyses, we add to the regressions the interactions between time trends

(Trends) and (1) country effects, (2) country-industry effects, and (3) firm effects. Panel A

provides the results on profits, while Panel B provides the results on firm employment. All of the

results on both profits and employment from Table 6 hold when conditioning on either Country

dummy*Trends or Country-Industry dummy*Trends as shown Table 8. The results on profits also

hold when including for Firm dummy*Trends effects. When examining employment and

controlling for Firm dummy*Trends, as well as the other control variables, we continue to find

that (1) the Trust*Crisis interaction terms enter positively and significantly, inducting that

corporate employment is more resilient to systemic banking crises in high trust economies and (2)

the point estimates for the high Liquidity needs industries are greater than those in low Liquidity

needs industries, but the difference between these high and low Liquidity needs industries in

these employment regressions when controlling for individual firm trends is not statistically

significant. With this caveat, the results on the connection between social trust and corporate

resilience to systemic banking crises are quite robust to controlling for trends.



6. Conclusion

       In this paper, we investigate whether social trust improves corporate resilience to

systemic banking crises. Although there are enormous bodies of research on both financial crises

and social trust, we are unaware of any previous research on the role of social trust in affecting

the response of firms and economies to systemic banking crises.

       The results suggest that (1) social trust facilitates access to trade credit during systemic

banking crises that impede the normal bank-lending channel, (2) social trust makes corporate

profits and employment more resilient to banking crises, and (3) the impact of social trust on

trade credit financing and corporate performance is more pronounced among firms that for

                                                                                                 26
technological reasons rely heavily on short-term liquidity. The findings are not explained by

other country characteristics including (a) the severity of a banking crisis, (b) the development of

financial institutions and stock markets, (c) the legal protections pertaining to creditors and

shareholders, (d) the overall economic conditions, (e) the general legal rules and institutional

quality. The results emphasize the heterogeneous response of firms and economies to systemic

banking crises. Along with Levine, Lin, and Xie (2016), this paper shows that economies and

firms that facilitate nonbank forms of finance increase resiliency to failures in the banking

system.

Figure 1. Trade credit financing during a banking crisis, by country

Each dot in the figure represents the average change in the ratio of Trade credit financing/CoGS
for firms in a country, against the level of social trust in the country. Specifically, we first
calculate for each firm the difference between Trade credit financing/CoGS during a crisis, [t,
t+3], and before the crisis, [t-3, t-1]. We then average this difference across all of the firms
within each individual country, and plot the averaged difference in a country against its level of
social trust.

Figure 2. Firm performance during a banking crisis, by country

Each dot in the figure represents the average change in the ratio of earnings before interest and
taxes (EBIT) to total assets (EBIT/Total assets) in the left panel, and the average change in the
number of employees (Ln(Employees)) in the right panel, for firms in a country, against the level
of social trust in the country. Specifically, we first calculate for each firm the difference between
EBIT/Total assets (Ln(Employees)) during a crisis, [t, t+3], and before the crisis, [t-3, t-1]. We
then average this difference across all of the firms within each individual country, and plot the
averaged difference in a country against its level of social trust.

Each bar in the figure represents the average change in the ratio of trade credit financing to total
assets (Trade credit financing/Total assets). Specifically, we first calculate for each firm the
difference between Trade credit financing/ Total assets during a crisis, [t, t+3], and before the
crisis, [t-3, t-1]. We then average this difference across firms for four groups: high-liquidity-
needs industries among high- vs. low-trust countries, and low-liquidity-needs industries among
high- vs. low-trust countries.

Table 2 Social trust and trade credit over banking crises, [t-3, t+3]
This table reports regression results of the relation between social trust and firms’ trade credit received during
banking crisis episodes [t-3, t+3], where t is the start-year of a systemic banking crisis defined in Laeven and
Valencia (2012). The dependent variables are the net increase in trade credit financing as a share the cost of goods
sold (Trade credit financing/CoGS) in columns (1)-(3) and the net increase in trade credit financing as share of total
assets (Trade credit financing/Total assets) in columns (4)-(6). For each dependent variable, there are three columns
corresponding, in turn, to overall sample, high liquidity needs industries, and low liquidity needs industries, where
we partition industries by the median value of Liquidity needs, which is defined as the ratio of inventories to total
sales calculated at the three-digit SIC level (Raddatz, 2006). Crisis equals one in the start-year of a crisis and for the
three years afterward, [t, t+3], and zero otherwise, [t-3, t-1]. GDP per capita equals the natural logarithm of real
gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, measured three years before the start-year of the banking crisis. Financial
institutions development equals the ratio of private credit by deposit money banks and other financial institutions to
GDP, measured three years before the start-year of the banking crisis. Stock market capitalization equals the ratio of
stock market capitalization to GDP, measured three years before the start-year of the banking crisis. Private credit
contraction equals the average annual growth rate in bank credit to private firms between t-3 and t-1, where t is the
start-year of the crisis, minus the minimum annual growth rate of bank credit to private firms during the period
between t and t+3. Anti-self-dealing is an index of the extent to which minority shareholders are protected by the
laws from being expropriated by the insiders through self-dealing transactions. Creditor rights is an index of the
laws provide creditors the legal ability to voice their opinions, get repaid, and affect the reorganization process. Firm
size (lag) equals the logarithm of total assets lagged one year. Long-term debt (lag) equals long-term debt divided by
total assets lagged one year. Tobin’s q (lag) equals Ln [(Market value of equity + Book value of assets - Book value
of equity) / Book value of assets] lagged one year. Regression coefficients are estimated using ordinary least squares
(OLS). T-statistics are reported in parenthesis and calculated using robust standard errors clustered at the country
level. *, **, and *** represent significant levels at 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively.

measures of legal and institutional development. The dependent variables are the net increase in trade credit financing as a share the cost of goods sold (Trade
credit financing/CoGS) in columns (1)-(4) and the net increase in trade credit financing as share of total assets (Trade credit financing/Total assets) in columns
(5)-(8). For each dependent variable, results are provided for both high and low liquidity needs industries, where we partition industries by the median value of
Liquidity needs, which equals the ratio of inventories to total sales calculated at the three-digit SIC level (Raddatz, 2006). Crisis equals one in the start-year of a
crisis and for the three years afterward, [t, t+3], and zero otherwise, [t-3, t-1]. Columns (1)-(2) and (5)-(6) control for the interaction between Crisis and the Rule
of law, which measures the quality of contract enforcement, property rights, and control over crime and violence. Columns (3)-(4) and (7)-(8) control for the
interaction between Crisis and Institutional quality, which is a broad index of institutional quality. The Macroeconomic interaction controls include Crisis
interacted with: GDP per capita, Financial institutions development, Stock market capitalization, Private credit contraction, Anti-self-dealing, and Creditor
rights. The Firm controls include: Firm size (lag), Long-term debt (lag), and Tobin’s q (lag). Table A1 provides variable definitions. Regression coefficients are
estimated using ordinary least squares (OLS). T-statistics are reported in parenthesis and calculated using robust standard errors clustered at the country level. *,
**, and *** represent significant levels at 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively.

Table 4 Social trust and trade credit over banking crises, controlling for time trends
This table reports regression results of the relation between social trust and firms’ newly obtained trade credit during banking crisis episodes, while controlling
for different trends within country, country-industry, and individual firms. The dependent variables are the net increase in trade credit financing as a share the
cost of goods sold (Trade credit financing/CoGS) throughout the columns. For each set of time trends there are three columns corresponding to the overall
sample, high liquidity needs industries, and low liquidity needs industries, where we partition industries by the median value of Liquidity needs, which equals the
ratio of inventories to total sales calculated at the three-digit SIC level (Raddatz, 2006). Crisis equals one in the start-year of a crisis and for the three years
afterward, [t, t+3], and zero otherwise, [t-3, t-1]. Columns (1)-(3) control for the interaction between country dummy and the time trends variable, Trends,
indicating one of the years over [t-3, t+3]. In particular, Trends is set to one for t-3, two for t-2, three for t-3, four for t, five for t+1, six for t+2, and seven for t+3.
Columns (4)-(6) control for the interaction between country-industry (at the three-digit SIC level) dummy and Trends. Columns (7)-(9) control for the interaction
between individual firm dummy and Trends. The Macroeconomic interaction controls include Crisis interacted with: GDP per capita, Financial institutions
development, Stock market capitalization, Private credit contraction, Anti-self-dealing, and Creditor rights. The Firm controls include: Firm size (lag), Long-
term debt (lag), and Tobin’s q (lag). Table A1 provides variable definitions. Regression coefficients are estimated using ordinary least squares (OLS). T-statistics
are reported in parenthesis and calculated using robust standard errors clustered at the country level. *, **, and *** represent significant levels at 10%, 5%, and
1%, respectively.

Table 5 Social trust and formal finance over banking crises
This table reports regression results of the relation between social trust and firms’ issuances of equity and debt
during banking crises. The dependent variables are Equity issuance in columns (1)-(3) and Debt issuance in columns
(4)-(6). For each dependent variable, there are three columns corresponding, in turn, to overall sample, high liquidity
needs industries, and low liquidity needs industries, where we partition industries by the median value of Liquidity
needs. Crisis equals one in the start-year of a crisis and for the three years afterward, [t, t+3], and zero otherwise, [t-
3, t-1]. The Macroeconomic interaction controls include Crisis interacted with: GDP per capita, Financial
institutions development, Stock market capitalization, Private credit contraction, Anti-self-dealing, and Creditor
rights. The Firm controls include: Firm size (lag), Long-term debt (lag), Tobin’s q (lag), and Cash flow. Table A1
provides variable definitions. Regression coefficients are estimated using ordinary least squares (OLS). T-statistics
are reported in parenthesis and calculated using robust standard errors clustered at the country level. *, **, and ***
represent significant levels at 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively.

Table 6 Social trust and firm performance over banking crises
This table reports regression results of the relation between social trust and firms’ profits and employment. The
dependent variables are earnings before income and taxes (EBIT) in columns (1)-(3) and the natural logarithm of the
number of one thousand employees (Firm employment). For each dependent variable, there are three columns
corresponding, in turn, to overall sample, high liquidity needs industries, and low liquidity needs industries, where
we partition industries by the median value of Liquidity needs. Crisis equals one in the start-year of a crisis and for
the three years afterward, [t, t+3], and zero otherwise, [t-3, t-1]. The Macroeconomic interaction controls include
Crisis interacted with: GDP per capita, Financial institutions development, Stock market capitalization, Private
credit contraction, Anti-self-dealing, and Creditor rights. The Firm controls include: Firm size (lag), Long-term
debt (lag), and Tobin’s q (lag). Table A1 provides variable definitions. Regression coefficients are estimated using
ordinary least squares (OLS). T-statistics are reported in parenthesis and calculated using robust standard errors
clustered at the country level. *, **, and *** represent significant levels at 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively.

Table 7 Horserace tests on firm performance: social trust vs. rule of law and institutional quality
This table reports regression results of the relation between social trust and profits and employment during banking crises episodes, while controlling for
measures of legal and institutional development. The dependent variables are earnings before income and taxes (EBIT) in columns (1)-(4) and the natural
logarithm of the number of one thousand employees (Firm employment) in columns (5)-(8). For each dependent variable, results are provided for both high and
low liquidity needs industries, where we partition industries by the median value of Liquidity needs, which equals the ratio of inventories to total sales calculated
at the three-digit SIC level (Raddatz, 2006). Crisis equals one in the start-year of a crisis and for the three years afterward, [t, t+3], and zero otherwise, [t-3, t-1].
Columns (1)-(2) and (5)-(6) control for the interaction between Crisis and the Rule of law, which measures the quality of contract enforcement, property rights,
and control over crime and violence. Columns (3)-(4) and (7)-(8) control for the interaction between Crisis and Institutional quality, which is a broad index of
institutional quality. The Macroeconomic interaction controls include Crisis interacted with: GDP per capita, Financial institutions development, Stock market
capitalization, Private credit contraction, Anti-self-dealing, and Creditor rights. The Firm controls include: Firm size (lag), Long-term debt (lag), and Tobin’s q
(lag). Table A1 provides variable definitions. Regression coefficients are estimated using ordinary least squares (OLS). T-statistics are reported in parenthesis

Table 8 Social trust and firm performance over banking crises, controlling for time trends
This table reports regression results of the relation between social trust and firms’ profits and employment during banking crisis episodes, while controlling for
differential trends within country, country-industry, and individual firms. The dependent variables are the earnings before income and taxes (EBIT) in Panel A
and the natural logarithm of the number of one thousand employees (Firm employment) in Panel B. For each set of time trends control, there are three columns
corresponding to the overall sample, high liquidity needs industries, and low liquidity needs industries, where we partition industries by the median value of
Liquidity needs, which equals the ratio of inventories to total sales calculated at the three-digit SIC level (Raddatz, 2006). Crisis equals one in the start-year of a
crisis and for the three years afterward, [t, t+3], and zero otherwise, [t-3, t-1]. For both Panels, Columns (1)-(3) control for the interaction between country
dummy and the time trends variable, Trends, indicating one of the years over [t-3, t+3]. In particular, Trends is set to one for t-3, two for t-2, three for t-3, four for
t, five for t+1, six for t+2, and seven for t+3. Columns (4)-(6) control for the interaction between country-industry (at the three-digit SIC level) dummy and
Trends. Columns (7)-(9) control for the interaction between individual firm dummy and Trends. The Macroeconomic interaction controls include Crisis
interacted with: GDP per capita, Financial institutions development, Stock market capitalization, Private credit contraction, Anti-self-dealing, and Creditor
rights. The Firm controls include: Firm size (lag), Long-term debt (lag), and Tobin’s q (lag). Table A1 provides variable definitions. Regression coefficients are
estimated using ordinary least squares (OLS). T-statistics are reported in parenthesis and calculated using robust standard errors clustered at the country level. *,
**, and *** represent significant levels at 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively.

Table A3 Social trust and the size of banking crises
This table shows the association between trust and the size of banking crises. In particular, we regress Private credit
contraction against Trust and other country traits. Private credit contraction equals the average annual growth rate
of bank credit over the pre-crisis period, [t-3, t-1], minus the minimum annual growth rate of bank credit over the
crisis period, [t, t+3], where t is the start year of a banking crisis. Trust equals the fraction of people who believe that
most people can be trusted. GDP per capita equals the natural logarithm of real GDP per capita. Financial
institutions development is the ratio of private credit by deposit money banks and other financial institutions to GDP,
Stock market development is the ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP, Creditor rights measures the power of
creditors in the events of bankruptcy, and Anti-self-dealing measures the extent to which the law protects minority
shareholders from being expropriated by the insiders through self-dealing transactions. All these country variables
are measured three years before the start of a banking crisis. Rule of law measures the quality of contract
enforcement, property rights, and control over crime and violence. Institutional quality is a comprehensive index of
institutional quality. Regression coefficients are estimated using ordinary least squares (OLS). T-statistics are
reported in parenthesis and calculated using heteroscedasticity robust standard errors. *, **, and *** represent
significant level at 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively.

Table A4 Social trust and firm outcomes over banking crises, two-way cluster by country
and year
This table reports robustness tests on the relation between social trust and firms’ newly obtained trade credit during
banking crisis episodes in columns (1) – (2), firm profitability in columns (3) – (4), and firm employment in
columns (5) – (6) using two-way cluster at the country and year levels. Similar to Table 2 in the main text, we split
the sample by the median value of industry liquidity needs, defined as the ratio of inventories to total sales
calculated at the three-digit SIC level (Raddatz, 2006). The Macroeconomic interaction controls include Crisis
interacted with: GDP per capita, Financial institutions development, Stock market capitalization, Private credit
contraction, Anti-self-dealing, and Creditor rights. The Firm controls include: Firm size (lag), Long-term debt (lag),
and Tobin’s q (lag). Table A1 provides variable definitions. Regression coefficients are estimated using ordinary
least squares (OLS). T-statistics are reported in parenthesis and calculated using robust standard errors clustered at
the country and year levels. *, **, and *** represent significant level at 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively.

Table A5 Social trust and trade credit over banking crises: alternative measures of liquidity needs
This table reports the similar analyses results to Table 2 using alternative liquidity measures. Specifically, Columns (1) – (2) split the sample by the ratio of
inventories to the cost of goods sold calculated at the industry (three-digit SIC) level, while columns (3) – (4) split the sample by the median value of Trade
credit reliance, defined as the ratio of trade payable to total debt calculated at the industry (three-digit SIC) level. The dependent variable is the amount of trade
payable newly obtained, scaled by the cost of goods sold. The Macroeconomic interaction controls include Crisis interacted with: GDP per capita, Financial
institutions development, Stock market capitalization, Private credit contraction, Anti-self-dealing, and Creditor rights. The Firm controls include: Firm size
(lag), Long-term debt (lag), and Tobin’s q (lag). Table A1 provides variable definitions. Regression coefficients are estimated using ordinary least squares
(OLS). T-statistics are reported in parenthesis and calculated using robust standard errors clustered at country level. *, **, and *** represent significant level at
10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively.

Table A6 Horserace tests on trade credit: Alternative measures of liquidity needs
This table reports the similar analyses results to Table 3 using alternative liquidity needs measures. Columns (1) – (4) split the sample by the ratio of inventories
to the cost of goods sold calculated at the industry (three-digit SIC) level, while columns (5) – (8) split the sample by the median value of Trade credit reliance,
defined as the ratio of trade payable to total debt calculated at the industry (three-digit SIC) level. The Macroeconomic interaction controls include Crisis
interacted with: GDP per capita, Financial institutions development, Stock market capitalization, Private credit contraction, Anti-self-dealing, and Creditor
rights. The Firm controls include: Firm size (lag), Long-term debt (lag), and Tobin’s q (lag). Table A1 provides variable definitions. Regression coefficients are
estimated using ordinary least squares (OLS). T-statistics are reported in parenthesis and calculated using robust standard errors clustered at country level. *, **,
and *** represent significant level at 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively.

Table A7 Social trust and firm performance over banking crises: Alternative performance
measures
This table reports the relation between social trust and firm profits during banking crises using alternative measures
of profitability. The dependent variables are Net income across all the columns in Panel A, and Cash flow across all
the columns in Panel B. Column (1) shows the results using all firms in the sample, while columns (2) – (7) are the
split-sample results. Specifically, we partition the overall sample based on the median values of Liquidity needs in
columns (2) and (3), Inventories/CoGS in columns (4) and (5), and Trade credit reliance in columns (6) and (7),
respectively. The Macroeconomic interaction controls include Crisis interacted with: GDP per capita, Financial
institutions development, Stock market capitalization, Private credit contraction, Anti-self-dealing, and Creditor
rights. The Firm controls include: Firm size (lag), Long-term debt (lag), and Tobin’s q (lag). Table A1 provides
variable definitions. Regression coefficients are estimated using ordinary least squares (OLS). T-statistics are
reported in parenthesis and calculated using robust standard errors clustered at country level. *, **, and ***
represent significant level at 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively.

Table A8 Trust and firm performance over banking crises: Alternative measures of liquidity needs
This table reports the similar analyses results to Table 6 using alternative liquidity measures. Specifically, Columns (1) – (4) split the sample by the ratio of
inventories to the cost of goods sold calculated at the industry (three-digit SIC) level, while columns (5) – (8) split the sample by the median value of Trade
credit reliance, defined as the ratio of trade payable to total debt calculated at the industry (three-digit SIC) level. The dependent variables are EBIT, and Firm
employment in columns (1) – (2), (5) – (6), and (3) – (4), (7) – (8), respectively. The Macroeconomic interaction controls include Crisis interacted with: GDP per
capita, Financial institutions development, Stock market capitalization, Private credit contraction, Anti-self-dealing, and Creditor rights. The Firm controls
include: Firm size (lag), Long-term debt (lag), and Tobin’s q (lag). Table A1 provides variable definitions. Regression coefficients are estimated using ordinary
least squares (OLS). T-statistics are reported in parenthesis and calculated using robust standard errors clustered at country level. *, **, and *** represent
significant level at 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively.
