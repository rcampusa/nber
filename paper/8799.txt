                                             ABSTRACT

        Historically, most attention in public programs has been given to the resources devoted to the
activity, and resources have been used to index both commitment and quality. Education differs from
other areas of public expenditure because direct measures of outcomes are available, making it is possible
to consider results and, by implication, to consider the efficiency of provision. Early interpretations of
the evidence, emanating from popular interpretations of the Coleman Report that “schools do not make
a difference,” are incorrect, but the basic evidence behind the statement suggests serious performance
problems of government supply, because purchased inputs to schools are not closely related to outcomes.
This paper reviews that evidence along with providing an evaluation of the various controversial aspects
including issues of causality, consumer behavior, and estimation approaches. Two detailed policy areas
are discussed in terms of the evidence on performance: public versus private provision and the financing
of schools.

        The provision of education is a major public sector activity around the world, and both developed

and developing nations frequently act as if ensuring an appropriate education ranks close in priority to

providing for the safety and security of their citizens. And, much like these other fundamental areas,

governments not only provide a majority of the funding for schools but also typically operate the schools.

The objectives of this essay include not only a consideration of the purposes and rationale for governmental

involvement in schooling but also an evaluation of performance in addressing the underlying goals.

        Even though government’s presence in education is commonly accepted without much question, the

degree and form of involvement warrants attention. The amount and quality of education is known to

contribute to the income and well-being of individuals. Recent analyses also suggest that education has a

powerful effect on the strength and growth of national economies. These factors do not, however,

necessarily justify the extent or manner of governmental involvement.

        Regardless of one’s opinion about the involvement of government, it is valuable to assess how well

government does at providing education. Historically, most attention in public programs has been given to

the resources devoted to the activity, and resources have been used to index both commitment and quality.

Such a perspective, while forced on many areas of governmental activity by lack of good measures of

outcomes, is obviously quite limited. Importantly, education increasingly differs from other areas of public

expenditure because direct measures of outcomes are becoming more readily available. Thus, instead of

measuring governmental human capital investments just by expenditure, it is possible to consider results

and, by implication, to consider the efficiency of provision. Such consideration reveals a complicated

picture of expenditure patterns that are not matched by performance, although the conclusions and policy

implications to be derived from this general finding are not straightforward. Because of the ability to

consider performance directly, the study of publicly provided educational services also provides a possible

window on one of the critical policy questions that continuously arises in mixed economies: how well does

government do in directing society’s resources to meet its public goals? Nonetheless, given our current



                                                      1
state of knowledge, considerable uncertainty necessarily remains about whether or not any inefficiencies of

the educational system are typical of governmentally provided services.

        The distribution of educational outcomes is also an element of any evaluation of educational

performance. Education is not a pure public good, available without diminution to all. Instead, it is a

complicated intermediate good that is partially produced by government through provision that varies across

local jurisdictions and that that interacts with the endowments and actions of students and families.

Substantial portions of the rewards of more schooling accrue directly to the individual. Thus, education has

more of the character of a publicly provided private good. As such, the distribution of outcomes is not only

an important concern in judging the performance of government provision but also an object of policy.

        Education clearly encompasses a wider variety of things than can be readily covered here. The

central issues analyzed are the organization, financing, and production of educational services. This

discussion is placed within the context of the role of government in intervening in the market for education.

The following section more fully delineates the scope of this investigation and provides a roadmap through

the subsequent discussions.

                               Scope and Roadmap for Discussion
        This essay comes in the midst of a rapidly expanding analytical base on the economics of education.

The importance attached to human capital in many areas of economic research plus the intense policy

concerns about schooling have heightened interest in scholarly exploration of the education sector per se. A

primary purpose of this overall discussion is to highlight the most promising lines of research and to project

future areas of productive research. In doing this, some limits on the scope of this endeavor are necessary.

        Much of the discussion centers on experiences in the United States with the provision of primary

and secondary education. This focus permits a clear development of the issues of service delivery that can

be based on a very extensive analytical base. It is, nonetheless, a somewhat arbitrary delineation of the

overall set of potential topics. Although the provision of formal schooling by government includes

extensive interventions in tertiary education, higher education involves quite different institutional

                                                       2
structures. More importantly, little progress has been made in the measurement of outcomes of higher

education, thus precluding direct analysis of the financing and production issues that are central to this

analysis.1

         The restriction to formal schooling situations excludes important aspects of human capital

investment. Most countries have governmental involvement in various aspects of job training, including

both formal vocational training and work with private employers. This involvement ranges from

governmentally provided training programs to interventions in apprentice programs arranged directly with

firms. The institutional structure of such programs differs widely across countries, but it is frequently more

closely linked to the labor ministries of government than to the education ministries. This separation of

function, while perhaps unfortunate from an overall policy perspective, implies that the issues and analyses

of training programs have developed very differently from those related to formal schooling.2 This analysis

also generally follows the American custom of separating preschool programs from formal schooling.

Again, however, a full treatment of human capital investment policies should span this period, because there

is some indication that investments early have high pay-offs, and some discussion is provided below.3

         The restriction generally to U.S. experience is an unfortunate limitation forced by the availability of

comparable studies from other countries and other institutional experiences. The wide international

variation in governmental institutions should be and is an advantage for some analyses. While the



         1
          As developed below, the largest issues in primary and secondary education are whether or not various
structures and financing schemes lead to qualitative differences in the performance of schools. For primary and
secondary education, a variety of readily available measures of student outcomes, including test scores and differential
labor market performance, permits direct analyses. But, no similar measures of higher education outcomes – beyond
pure quantity differences – are available and accepted. A few attempts to look at labor market outcomes of higher
educational quality are available (e.g., Solmon (1973); Sewell and Hauser (1975); James and Alsalam (1993);
Behrman, Rosenzweig, and Taubman (1996); Behrman et al. (1998); Eide, Brewer, and Ehrenberg (1998); Dale and
Krueger (1999)), but the field remains largely undeveloped.

          A review of materials on job training can be found in Heckman, LaLonde, and Smith (1999). For a general
consideration of optimal human capital investment across the life cycle, see Heckman, Lochner, and Taber (2000).

limitation is rapidly disappearing with significant data development and analytic efforts around the world,

the more limited range of analyses that are currently available makes in-depth consideration of the

international similarities and differences impossible to develop in depth. To the extent possible,

comparisons with both developed and developing countries are made throughout this discussion, but they

generally cannot be summarized and organized as clearly as the United States experiences.

        The discussion begins with an overview of stylized facts about schooling and with a discussion of

how human capital enters into overall economic output and performance. A consideration of the conceptual

basis for governmental involvement in education follows this.

        The performance of government in providing education is a central element to the entire

interpretation of both research and policy in this area. Beginning with a general conceptual model of the

educational production process, detailed attention is given to what research has said about the effectiveness

of inputs to education. This summary of analytical studies leads naturally to discussion of potential

analytical issues that arise in the area and to how one might interpret the range of results.

        The study of school performance is related to a variety of organizational issues that are key

elements of governmental intervention and participation in education. Two of the most significant

organizational aspects are the relationship between public schools and private schools and the form and

means of financing education. The substantial literatures on each provide insights into these significant

policy choices.

        Finally, even though there is rapid expansion of research in this area, a number of areas remain

underexplored. The last section identifies a series of issues that appear to be productive areas for the

continual development of the area.

                                      Overview of Schooling Issues
        Economists generally view schooling as an investment both by students and by the society at large.

Each incurs costs, and each reap rewards. For a student, the costs of education include the direct costs of

tuition, books, and other school-related expenditures as well as the income that the student forgoes when

attending school instead of taking a paying job. Similarly society incurs direct costs in subsidizing a school

system that provides free or heavily subsidized education to its citizens. It also forgoes the opportunity to

devote the skills, people and resources that are engaged in education to other projects. This viewpoint –

regarding education as an investment – dates back to the 17th century with the writings of Sir William Petty

and includes work by Adam Smith and other influential economists (see Kiker (1968)). It was brought into

mainstream economics, however, by Schultz (1961, 1963), Becker (1993), and Mincer (1970, 1974) and

has become the basis of a steady stream of subsequent theoretical and empirical analyses.


Quantity of Schooling

        A look at the history of the twentieth century suggests that schooling has generally been a good

investment, buoyed by steady increases in the demand for skilled workers. Individuals have dramatically

increased their own investments in education.

        In the United States, at the beginning of the twentieth century, only six percent of the adult

population had finished high school. After the first world war, high school graduation rates began to

increase rapidly. But changes in education work their way only slowly through the overall population. By

1940, only half of Americans aged 25 or older had completed more than eight years of school, that is, had

had any high-school education at all. Not until 1967 did attainment of the median adult aged 25 or over

exceed high school.4 Since 1967, however, the increase in the number of years of schooling completed by

Americans has slowed. The young adult population, aged 25 to 29, has had stable completion rates for




        4
            See U.S. Bureau of the Census (1975, 2000) and Goldin (1998).
                                                          5
almost two decades. At the turn of the 21st century, over 80 percent of Americans over 25 had completed

high school or more.

         The changes in other nations have been even more dramatic. Table 1 shows the percentages of

different age groups completing upper secondary schools for a sample of more developed countries.5 The

different age groups effectively trace the normal schooling in different decades in the past, so that the

changes with age show the rate of increase in schooling. While the United States has been stable since the

1960s, most of the other countries have undergone massive increases in high school completion – mirroring

the historical developments in the U.S. before and immediately after World War II (Goldin (1998)).

         The benefits of education to individuals are also clear. The average incomes of workers with a high

school education remain significantly above those of the less educated, and the average income of workers

with a college education now dwarf those of the high-school educated. In the U.S., the rapidly increasing

earnings of college-educated workers during the past two decades currently provides them with a premium

of more than 70 percent higher earnings than a high school graduate with similar job experience.6

         The earnings patterns elsewhere in the world appear quantitatively more varied, but there is a strong

similarity in the earnings effects associated with more schooling. Table 2 shows earnings distributions by

level of schooling and by gender across the adult labor force, again for a sample of developed countries.

While the earning distribution is more compressed in some countries than others – probably reflecting

characteristics of labor markets – invariably there are obvious gains in earnings to more schooling. Not only

are wages higher for the better educated, but they also tend to enjoy greater job opportunities and suffer less

unemployment (U.S. Department of Education (1996a); Organisation for Economic Co-operation and

Development (2001)).


         5
             A comprehensive comparison of schooling across nations can be found in Barro and Lee (2001).
         6
           More detail on the patterns of earnings can be found in Murphy and Welch (1989, 1992), Kosters (1991),
Pierce and Welch (1996), and Deere (2001). McMahon (1991) reports slightly lower private rates of return for high
school completion than for college completion, although they remain substantial. These calculations all rely on just
salary differentials, and greater equality in the provision of fringe benefits may act to compress the differences for
total compensation. However, no analysis of schooling returns in terms of total compensation is available.
                                                              6
         For individuals the increased relative incomes of more educated people have been sufficient to

offset the costs. An individual can expect significant financial benefit from extended schooling, even after

appropriately considering costs.7 Individuals also gain non-financial benefits from education. For example,

there is evidence that more educated people make better choices concerning health, so they tend to live

longer and to have healthier lives. There is also evidence that the children of more educated parents get

more out of school. They attend longer and learn more. Such benefits of schooling simply reinforce those

from the labor market.8

         The common interpretation of the overall returns is that high technology economies produce large

demands for skilled workers, workers who can adapt to new technologies and manage complicated

production processes effectively. Formal models with this character are developed in Nelson and Phelps

(1966) and Welch (1970) and summarized in the ideas of dealing with disequilibrium in Schultz (1975).

         Society as a whole also benefits from education. National income rises directly with earnings from

workers with more and better skills. The more educated are more prone to be civically involved, to vote in




         7
           While most economists think of schooling as involving the production of human capital in individuals, the
screening or signaling perspective is a clear alternative (e.g., Spence (1973), Wolpin (1977), Weiss (1995)). The
screening model in the extreme suggests that individuals begin schooling with differing abilities and that schooling
merely allows employers to identify those with more ability. From the individual’s viewpoint, it does not matter what
the source of earnings enhancement is, be it production by schools or screening. The individual will be equally
induced to make schooling investments based on the comparison of returns and costs. The two may, however, yield
quite different incentives to governments to invest, because signaling may lead to different social and private returns
to schooling. As a general matter, these models are not identified with just labor market outcome data. A variety of
specialized tests under different maintained assumptions about individual motivations and firm behavior have been
conducted but have not provided clear support for screening. These tests include looking for “sheepskin effects,”
particularly high returns to completing given institutional levels, as in Layard and Psacharopoulos (1974). Some
support of screening does come from analysis of incentives to complete high school when there are fewer college
graduates Bedard (2001). See Riley (2001) for a review of general theoretical and empirical work. The key difficulty
with these tests, however, remains that they focus on labor market outcomes, where the private returns to schooling
are generally expected to exist independent of the underlying causal mechanism. The analysis below concentrates
importantly on outcomes that relate directly to the schooling process (the point where the two models are
hypothesized to differ significantly).
         8
         See, for example, Michael (1982); Haveman and Wolfe (1984); Wolfe and Zuvekas (1995); and Leibowitz
(1974). Many factors are unclear, however, because of questions of causality; see, for example, Farrell and Fuchs
(1982).
                                                           7
local and national elections, and to be a better informed and more responsible electorate.9 Increases in the

level of education are associated with reductions in crime (e.g., Ehrlich (1975), Lochner and Moretti

(2001)).

           Recent economic studies argue that education may provide economic benefits to society greater

than the sum of its benefits to individuals – by providing a rich environment for innovation, scientific

discovery, education can accelerate the growth rate of the economy; see, for example, the analyses of

growth by Lucas (1988), Romer (1990a), Barro (1991), Jorgenson and Fraumeni (1992), and Barro and

Sala-I-Martin (1995). The growth effects depending on the aggregate level of education in the economy

enter as an externality to the individual. (Estimation by Acemoglu and Angrist (2000), however, questions

this effect, at least at the state level).

           Education appears also to have helped to achieve both greater social equality and greater equity in

the distribution of economic resources. Schooling was a centerpiece of the U.S. War on Poverty in the

1960s, and the benefits of improved schooling are demonstrated in comparisons of the earnings of different

social and ethnic groups. Earnings by blacks and whites have converged noticeably since the Second World

War, and much of this convergence is attributable to improved educational opportunities for

African-Americans (see Smith and Welch (1989); Jaynes and Williams (1989)). However, as discussed

below, that convergence slowed down noticeably in the 1980s with skill differences being cited as a prime

determinant (Juhn, Murphy, and Pierce (1993)).

           Nonetheless, while there are many well-documented associations between amount of schooling –

either individually or in the aggregate – and desirable economic outcomes, significant questions remain

about the magnitude and interpretation of these relationships. First, the association may misstate the causal




           9
           The pattern of U.S. voting over time can be found inStanley and Niemi (2000). An analysis of the partial
effects of educational attainment (which are positive in the face of overall declines in voter turnout over time) is
presented in Teixeira (1992).

impact of changes in schooling for individuals and the aggregate.10 Second, the average effects may not

correspond to the marginal effects. Third, in general externalities have been notoriously elusive and

difficult to estimate convincingly, and education proves to be no exception. Finally, the measurement

issues, as highlighted in the next section, are significant. Each of these topics (with the possible exception

of the last) has received surprisingly limited research and is a fertile area for future work. In many contexts,

they are key to both analytical and policy concerns.


Quality Considerations

        For most of the 20th century, the U.S. debate over the economic consequences of schooling

concentrated on the amount of school attained or, simply, the quantity of schooling of the population. Policy

deliberations focused on school completion rates, on the proportion of the population attending

postsecondary schooling, and the like. And analyses of the benefits of schooling were most concerned with

the effects of quantity of schooling—whether benefits are seen in terms of individual incomes or social

benefits like improved voting behavior of citizens.

        Most policy and analytical attention has now switched to quality dimensions of schooling. In the

United States, with the slowing of individual income growth11 and of income convergence by race,12

improving the quality of schooling, or how much is learned for each year, has been seen as the natural

policy focus. Similar concerns, albeit generally with a lag, have diffused to other developed and developing

countries.


        10
          For example, Bils and Klenow (2000) question the importance of education as a cause of growth, as
opposed to the relationship going the other way around. See also the perspectives in Mankiw, Romer, and Weil
(1992) and Benhabib and Spiegel (1994). At the individual level, see Card (1999).
        11
          See, for example, Levy and Murnane (1992) for a review of U.S. earnings patterns. See also Welch (1999)
for an update and interpretation of distributional patterns.
        12
           Discussion of distributional issues including earnings differences by race can be found in Smith and Welch
(1989), O'Neill (1990), Card and Krueger (1992b), Levy and Murnane (1992), Bound and Freeman (1992), Boozer,
Krueger, and Wolkon (1992),Juhn, Murphy, and Pierce (1993), Hauser (1993), Kane (1994), Grogger (1996), Welch
(1999), and Deere (2001).
                                                          9
        The economic effects of differences in the quality of graduates of our elementary and secondary

schools are much less understood than the effects of quantity, particularly with regard to the performance of

the aggregate economy. The incomplete understanding of the effects of educational quality clearly reflects

difficulties in measurement. Although quality of education is hard to define precisely, it is natural to use the

term quality to refer to the knowledge base and analytical skills that are the focal point of schools.

Moreover, to add concreteness to this discussion, much of the discussion will rely on information provided

by standardized tests of academic achievement and ability.

        Relying on standardized tests to provide measures of quality is controversial—in part because of

gaps in available evidence and in part because of the conclusions that tend to follow (as discussed below).

The contrasting view emphasizes measuring "quality" by the resources (i.e., inputs) going into schooling.

Early investigations include Wachtel (1975), Akin and Garfinkel (1977), and Rizzuto and Wachtel (1980).

Most recent along this line is Card and Krueger (1992a); see also the reviews of the discussion in Burtless

(1996b) and Betts (1996). In the context of developing countries, where these issues might be more

important, see Behrman and Birdsall (1983). A substantial part of the controversy relates to the adequacy or

effectiveness of expenditure or resource measures as a proxy for worker skills (as discussed below). In the

end, cognitive skill measures appear to be the best available indicators of quality and do relate to outcomes

that we care about, where resource measures are quite inadequate.

        A variety of studies of the labor market have been concerned about how individual differences in

cognitive ability affect earnings and specifically modify the estimated returns to quantity. The early work

was subsumed under the general topic of "ability bias" in the returns to schooling. In that, the simple

question was whether the tendency of more able individuals to continue in school led to an upward bias in

the estimated returns to school (because of a straightforward omitted variables problem).13 These studies

          See, for example, Griliches (1974). More recently, see Taber (2001). Discussions of alternative
approaches to dealing with ability bias can be found in Card (1999). That discussion in general does not consider
school quality, although some of the formulations could be recast in that way.

have focused on the estimated returns to years of schooling, although that seems to be a badly formulated

question. The correction most commonly employed was the inclusion of a cognitive ability or cognitive

achievement measure in the earnings function estimates. In interpreting that work, one must believe that

quantity of schooling is uncorrelated with quality as measured by tests of cognitive ability and achievement.

         These studies, nonetheless, provide insight into quality measurement issues through their common

control for cognitive effects on earnings. The results of the early work generally indicated relatively modest

impacts of variations in cognitive ability after holding constant quantity of schooling.14 In this work, there

was no real discussion of what led to any observed cognitive differences, although much of the work

implicitly treated it as innate, and not very related to variations in schooling.15 Further, all of the early work

relied on generally small and nonrepresentative samples of the population.

         The most recent direct investigations of cognitive achievement, however, have generally suggested

larger labor market returns to measured differences in cognitive achievement. For example, Bishop (1989,

1991), O'Neill (1990), Grogger and Eide (1993), Murnane, Willett, and Levy (1995), Neal and Johnson

(1996), Currie and Thomas (2000), Murnane et al. (2000), and Murnane et al. (2001) each find that the

earnings advantages to higher achievement on standardized tests are quite substantial.16 These results are

derived from quite different approaches. Bishop (1989) considers the measurement errors that are inherent

in most testing situation and demonstrates that careful treatment of that problem has a dramatic effect on the


         14
           This limited impact of cognitive achievement was also central to a variety of direct analyses of schooling
that reformulated the earnings determination process such as Jencks et al. (1972) and Bowles and Gintis (1976) and
Bowles, Gintis, and Osborne (2001).
         15
            Manski (1993a) represents one strand more recent work with this same general thrust. He recasts the issue
as a selection problem and considers how ability or quality interacts with earnings expectations to determine
continuation in schooling. Currently, however, no empirical work along these lines identifies the quantitative
importance of selection or the interaction of school quality and earnings in such models.
         16
           Outside of the United States, few studies are available. One exception for developing countries that finds
significant effects of cognitive skills on income is Boissiere, Knight, and Sabot (1985). The NAS/NRC study on
employment tests Hartigan and Wigdor (1989) also supports the view of a significant relationship of tests and
employment outcomes, although the strength of the relationship appears somewhat less strong than that in the direct
earnings investigations. Nonetheless, it seems likely that, for the purposes here, the GATB may not be a good
measure of the cognitive outcomes of schools and may not correspond well to standard measures of cognitive

estimated importance of test differences. O'Neill (1990), Bishop (1991), Grogger and Eide (1993), and

Neal and Johnson (1996) on the other hand, simply rely upon more recent labor market data along with

more representative sampling and suggest that the earnings advantage to measured skill differences is larger

than that found in earlier time periods and in earlier studies (even without correcting for test reliability).

Currie and Thomas (2000) provide evidence for a sample of British youth and rely on a long panel of

representative data. Murnane et al. (2001), considering a comparison over time, demonstrate that the results

of increased returns to measured skills hold regardless of the methodology (i.e., whether simple analysis or

error-corrected estimation). Murnane et al. (2000) and Murnane et al. (2001) provide further evidence of

the effects of cognitive skills (although offering some caution in the interpretation of strength of cognitive

effects versus other traits). Ultimately, the difficulty of separating cognitive skills from pure schooling has

made this estimation very difficult (Cawley et al. (2000), Heckman and Vytlacil (2001)) and leaves

ambiguity about the exact magnitude of effects.

        An additional part of the return to school quality comes through continuation in school. There is

substantial evidence that students who do better in school, either through grades or scores on standardized

achievement tests, tend to go farther in school (see, for example, Dugan (1976); Manski and Wise (1983).

Rivkin (1995) finds that variations in test scores capture a considerable proportion of the systematic

variation in high school completion and in college continuation. Indeed, Rivkin (1995) finds that test score

differences fully explain black-white differences in schooling. Bishop (1991) and Hanushek, Rivkin, and

Taylor (1996)find that individual achievement scores are highly correlated with school attendance.

Behrman et al. (1998) find strong achievement effects on both continuation into college and quality of

college; moreover, the effects are larger when proper account is taken of the endogeneity of achievement.

Hanushek and Pace (1995), using the High School and Beyond data, find that college completion is

significantly related to higher test scores at the end of high school.

        This work, while less complete than might be desired, leads to a conclusion that variations in


achievement.
                                                        12
cognitive ability, as measured by standardized tests, are important in career success. Variation in measured

cognitive ability is far from everything that is important, but it is significant in a statistical and quantitative

sense.

         The linkage of individual cognitive skills to aggregate productivity growth is more difficult to

establish. There is no clear consensus on the underlying causes of improvements in the overall productivity

of the United States economy, nor on how the quality of workers interacts with economic growth.17 The

analysis of the impact of schooling quality on cross-country differences in growth by Hanushek and Kimko

(2000), however, suggests that quality may be very important and could even dominate effects of the

quantity of schooling differences across countries. They develop measures of labor force quality based on

several different international mathematics and science tests and then find these to be highly correlated with

international differences in growth rates. The concern in such work is the direction of causality. While a

series of specification tests in Hanushek and Kimko (2000) indicates that there is a causal relationship

between quality and growth, the exact magnitude of the effect is open to question.

         Parallel to the work on individual wage determination, a number of studies have also pursued how

school resource differences correlate with economic growth. These differences, however, have not shown a

close relationship with international growth (see Barro and Sala-I-Martin (1995), Hanushek and Kimko

(2000), and Barro and Lee (2001).




         17
           One observation is useful, however. When looking at the history of productivity increase in the United
States economy, several distinct time periods stand out. Productivity growth continued at some two percent per year
through the 1960s, but fell off subsequently - first to one percent in the 1970s and then to virtually zero in the 1980s.
It subsequently rebounded in the 1990s. Noting that productivity changes in these time periods through the 1980s
mirror the aggregate pattern of the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores, which fell dramatically from 1964 through
1980 before partially recovering, some have gone on to presume that the test scores are driving the productivity
changes. Such could not, however, be the case -- since, as Bishop (1989) makes clear, the test takers with lower scores
remained a small proportion of the total labor force through the 1980s. Lower test scores in the 1980s may signal
forthcoming problems, but they cannot be an explanation for past changes in the economy.
                                                           13
Aggregate Resources and School Outcomes

         School policy in the United States and elsewhere has focused attention on quality issues and desires

to improve student outcomes. It is useful in this light then to consider briefly how this policy attention has

shown up and what the results have been. The simplest picture comes from the aggregate data.

         The concern in the United States about the quality of schooling has undoubtedly contributed to the

growth in spending on schools. The U.S. has increased the resources devoted to students dramatically over

the entire 20th century, with per pupil spending rising at 3½ percent per year in real terms for a 100-year

period (Hanushek and Rivkin (1997)). Importantly, between 1960 and 1995 when performance become

available, real spending per pupil tripled.18 Clearly some of this recent expenditure was required simply to

compete with other sectors for highly educated women and does not represent an expansion of school

activities, but, even allowing for this, expenditure shows a strong trend.19

         While U.S. spending on education has increased significantly during the last quarter of century,

quality of student performance measured by test performance has remained roughly constant. Beginning in

1970, the United States embarked on an extensive testing program for students, the National Assessment of

Educational Progress (NAEP), that was designed to track performance over time. It appears that the

performance of U.S. 17-year-olds has remained roughly constant over the thirty-year period of observation.



         18
            The measurement of real increases in resources has been the subject of some controversy and is difficult to
do with precision. The preceding calculations deflate nominal spending by the Consumer Price Index (CPI). This is
an output price index and is likely to diverge from an appropriate input price indices. Education is a labor intensive
industry, which historically has shown little productivity improvement. The consumer price, or alternatively the GDP
deflator, indicate how much of society’s resources are being devoted to schooling. But, because of real wage
increases in the economy, input costs in the education sector are likely to rise more rapidly than the CPI, so that the
CPI-adjusted increases will overstate the increases in real inputs to education (e.g., Scitovsky and Scitovsky (1959) or
Baumol (1967)). Rothstein and Miles (1995) suggest an alternative approach of using a modified service-sector CPI.
 This approach– based on a different measure of output prices emphasizing the service sector–cannot, however, solve
the problem of obtaining more accurate measures of input prices, although it can provide a means of developing
comparisons of productivity change across labor-intensive sectors (Hanushek (1997b)). While development of
accurate input price indices is difficult because of issues of quality measurement for teachers, the difference between
CPI-adjusted and input-adjusted measures is important to keep in mind. Use of a simple wage index or of a measure
of increases in salaries for college graduates nonetheless still shows large real resource increases.
         19
              See Flyer and Rosen (1997) for a discussion of the competing forces on teacher labor markets.
                                                           14
The simple comparison of NAEP scores from the early 1970s through the 1990s, shows lower science

scores, roughly the same reading scores, and higher math scores.20 Obviously, a variety of factors could

influence the aggregate pattern of performance and costs, including for example changes in the student

population or the structure of schools–topics discussed below. Nonetheless, the aggregate comparison of

resources and performance creates a prima facie case that performance of public schools warrants careful

consideration.

         While the United States remains near the top of all nations in terms of spending per pupil, a number

of other countries now spend similar amounts or even greater amounts. Table 3 displays estimates of both

the absolute levels of spending and the proportion of GDP per capita devoted to primary and secondary

schooling.21 The comparison of spending patterns across countries shows considerable variation, part of

which might be accounted for by higher proportions of private spending for schooling.22

         Interestingly, the amount of spending internationally does not have a very close relationship to the

performance of students. Table 4 displays national scores of eighth graders and twelfth graders on the Third

International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), conducted in 1995. Countries are rank ordered

from highest to lowest in each and compared to performance in the United States. (Bold indicates


         20
           The earliest NAEP test date differs by subject area with the first science test in 1969, first reading test in
1971, and first math test in 1973. Tests have been given approximately every four years and also involve earlier ages.
Each of the subject areas has exhibited some change over the entire time period, and, while only endpoints are
reported, it is also true that each of the tests has been roughly flat during the 1990s. See U.S. Department of
Education (2000).
         21
           Such comparisons across countries are clearly difficult to do with any precision. The absolute spending
patterns require an international exchange rate, but even then are prone to inaccuracies because of differences in
teacher labor markets. Further, countries differ in what is included in statistics for spending on schools. The GDP
comparisons get around the exchange rate issues but suffer from lack of any models of how spending should change
with national income. See U.S. Department of Education (1996b) and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (2001).
         22
            Data on private expenditures are difficult to find on a consistent and complete basis. The Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (2001) tabulations for developed countries display private spending in the
form of tuition and other expenditures on private schools. But they leave out private tutoring which appears to
represent a significant investment in a variety of countries – mostly notably the East Asian countries. Moreover,
countries use different definitions of what is included in school expenditures, of the age period for schooling, and the
like. The OECD analysis attempts to standardize data collection, but this is obviously difficult to do completely.

significantly above the U.S., and italics indicates significantly below the U.S.). Clearly, national scores are

not closely related to the spending rankings in the previous table. More systematic investigation reveals the

same results: Performance on the international tests is not closely related to resources of the school systems

in these countries.23

        The overview of education attainment, spending, and performance demonstrates the importance of

schooling to individuals along with the commitments of governments to the provision of schooling. This

provides a backdrop for consideration of government’s involvement.



                                           Role of Government
        As is well-known, the existence of large returns to quantity or quality of schooling does not by itself

warrant large scale governmental involvement. Large returns imply that individuals have strong incentives

to obtain schooling, without the intervention of government. There are several primary justifications

generally given for the level of governmental involvement in education: externalities, economies of scale,

market failures in general, and redistributive motives. In the presence of these, purely private decisions are

unlikely to lead to optimal social decisions.

        Externalities are frequently proposed as central to government’s interest in education. In general,

activities that are perceived to have significant externalities are prime candidates for increased governmental

support. With positive externalities, Pigouvian subsidies can be used so that individuals make decisions in

line with the appropriate social calculus. Or other governmental interventions might be used to move

toward a social optimum. But, as is also well recognized, externalities are noticeably elusive, and, while

optimal tax and subsidy policies in the face of externalities are well understood conceptually, few estimates

of the magnitude of externalities exist anywhere. Nevertheless, economists and citizens, if polled on




        23
          See Hanushek and Kimko (2000) for analysis of results on international mathematics and science tests
through 1990; see Woessman (2000, 2001)) for consideration of the TIMSS scores across nations.
                                                        16
externalities in education, would probably support the view that education involves extensive externalities

(Cohn and Geske (1990)).

         Leading candidates for areas of external benefits involve citizen involvement in the community and

government, crime reduction, family decision making and child upbringing, and economic growth. There is

evidence that more schooling does have a positive impact in each of these areas.

         In each area, a significant portion of the beneficial effect of education appears to come from

comparing very low levels of school attainment with significantly higher levels. Thus, extensive

discussions of the social benefits of schooling in developing countries would seem both warranted and

correct.24 It is difficult to have, for example, a well-informed citizenry when most of the population is

illiterate. It may also be difficult to introduce advanced production technologies, at least in a timely manner,

if workers cannot be expected to read the accompanying technical manuals.

         On the other hand, even if accepting the importance of externalities at minimal levels of schooling,

there is little reason to believe that there are constant marginal externalities when expanded on both the

extensive and intensive margins.25 Specifically, arguments about the social benefits of expanded education

seem much stronger in the case of developing countries of Africa than in the case of the United States

during the 21st century. Where half of the population has attended some postsecondary schooling, another

year of average schooling seems unlikely to change dramatically the political awareness of the U.S.

population. Similarly, if the average high school student scores somewhat higher on the National




         24
            Interestingly, policy discussions of education in developing countries tend to concentrate most on private
rates of return and the market outcomes of added schooling, even if they make some reference to other social benefits
such as political participation and lower fertility. See, for example, Heyneman and White (1986), Psacharopoulos,
Tan, and Jimenez (1986), and Lockheed and Verspoor (1991).
         25
           This issue is raised by Friedman (1962) and remains for the most part in the discussions of college
education in Hartman (1973) and Mundel (1973). None of these, however, provides empirical evidence on the
existence or magnitude of any externalities. The early primer on externalities in education (Weisbrod (1964))
concentrates chiefly on geographic spillovers and fiscal effects and downplays the issues raised here. A discussion of
the magnitude of externalities that is similar to the one here is found in Poterba (1996).
                                                          17
Assessment of Educational progress, it is doubtful that many would expect noticeable changes in the

identified extra social benefits of education.

        Although education may be associated with a variety of social outcomes, a particularly relevant

question is whether there is a causal relationship or not. With very little done on even assessing the

magnitude of effects – largely because of poor measurement, progress on understanding the underlying

causal structure has been even more limited. For example, one of the few direct investigations of causation

indeed opens serious questions about common interpretations. Behrman and Rosenzweig (2002) present

evidence on the role of mother’s education in the intergenerational transmission of skills. In this, they pay

particular attention to identifying the causal impact of mother’s education through use of identical twins and

conclude that it is not only much smaller than believed but possibly negative.26

        A leading candidate for potential externalities of education in the United States and other developed

countries, however, would revolve around economic growth. If a highly skilled workforce permits entirely

different kinds of technologies to be introduced, or to be introduced earlier in a development cycle,

expanded education of an individual may indeed affect other workers in the economy. Or, if improved

abilities of the best students lead to more rapid invention and development of new technologies, spillovers

of educational investments may result. Nevertheless, little evidence exists that distinguishes externalities in

economic growth from simply the impact of better workers and more human capital.27

        Beyond externalities, government also has a natural role when there are other market failures. The

most obvious possibility comes through capital market imperfections. If individuals cannot borrow against

their human capital – because human capital is embodied in the individual – there may be underinvestment

in education (cf. Becker (1993)). This possibility, only observable in postsecondary education when


        26
             For an early study of family effects, see Leibowitz (1974).
        27
             A recent consideration employs cross-sectional wage information to look at productivity spillovers and
finds little evidence after considering endogeneity of schooling (Acemoglu and Angrist (2000)). These issues can also
be found in discussions of endogenous growth models such as Nelson and Phelps (1966), Romer (1990b), Mankiw,
Romer, and Weil (1992), Benhabib and Spiegel (1994), and Hanushek and Kimko (2000).
                                                            18
government freely provides lower education, has not received strong empirical support (Cameron and

Heckman (1999)), but the current interventions in the market make it difficult to assess completely the

importance of this. Further, if there are economies of scale, say, from some fixed components of school

operations, governmental intervention may provide for efficient operations. Nonetheless, while the

empirical analysis is thin, little support for pervasive economies of scale exists.

         An additional imperfection that deserves mention, and that enters into the discussion later, involves

information. Student achievement involves a complex mixture of educational inputs including the student’s

own abilities, the influence of parents and friends, and the impact of schools. These factors are not easily

separated, so that individuals themselves may have trouble assessing the independent influence of schools.

If such is the case, informational problems may impede the decision making of individuals in terms of

human capital investments. It may be that government can produce superior information about the quality

of school inputs than the individual – although, if this is the rationale for governmental involvement, the

form of intervention is important. In particular, government would not need to operate schools in order to

provide information about their performance.28

         The second major category of justification for governmental intervention is a redistributive motive.

If society has certain goals for the distribution of income and well-being in society, normal market

operations are unlikely to achieve those goals. The precise form of societal goals and the relationship to

schooling has not been given much attention.29 (Note also that redistributive goals may also interact with



         28
            As mentioned before, a different aspect of information failures would relate to signaling and screening
models. A common interpretation of these models is that schooling does not increase productivity, it only identifies
more able people through their use of school attendance to convey their ability. In such a case, the social returns to
schooling may be considerably less than the private returns – indicating that government should work to lessen the
amount of costly schooling. Or, government may also not what to pursue programs designed to reduce school
dropouts if it lessens the information on individuals that is available.
         29
            Fair (1971) considers optimal policies for income distribution when it is an explicit component of the
social welfare function. Becker and Tomes (1976, 1979) concentrate on intergenerational aspects of income
transmission and distribution. Behrman, Taubman, and Pollak (1982) pursue intergenerational distribution issues from
an alternative model of parental behavior. Hanushek, Leung, and Yilmaz (2001) evaluate using education as a
redistributive device compared to the other mechanisms of negative income taxes and wage subsidies.
                                                           19
concerns about capital market constraints, where the desire is to break any linkages of poverty that exist

because parents cannot provide appropriate schooling opportunities to their children).

         An alternative redistributive motive actually appears to guide much policy and to interact with a

range of policy initiatives discussed below.30 Because housing in the United States and in many other

places tends to lead to concentrations of poor people, minorities, and others who traditionally have not

faired as well in schools, schools tend also to reinforce these concentrations.31 To the extent that

concentrations of poverty have added effects on schooling over and above individual poverty per se, there is

an externality that interacts with any redistribution objectives, government may again have a clear role for

correcting a market failure.

         Without pursuing the details of any mandate for public action, however, two conclusions are

important. First, while various market interventions are frequently employed to justify governmental

intervention into education, very little explicit research or consideration has been given to the exact nature

of these. For example, are the externalities related to the quality of schooling or just the minimal quantity?

Second, as underscored by Poterba (1996), even less attention has been given to the appropriate mechanism

for any governmental intervention. For example, if government wished to deal with capital market

imperfections, should it provide free or reduced priced schools, make loans to students, operate the schools

directly, or give grants to students to attend schools? A simple comparison is useful. The organization of

the educational sector has moved toward government financing and government provision, similar issues in

the health sector have led to very different institutional structures (at least in the United States). With few


         30
           These issues arise most significantly when talking about policies that affect peer groups (e.g.,
desegregation policies) and policies that affect the financing of schools across local educational districts or agencies.
         31
             Much of the past work on concentrations of poverty has involved crime, health, and welfare outcomes. As
discussed below, the analytical complications of this work are serious. As Brock and Durlauf (forthcoming), Manski
(1993b) and Moffitt (2001) point out, the empirical analysis of peer influences has been inhibited by both conceptual
and data problems – problems that raise serious questions about interpretation of many existing studies. These
critiques, in part precipitated by analyses of neighborhood poverty (e.g. Mayer and Jencks (1989), O'Regan and
Quigley (1999), Rosenbaum and Popkin (1991)), point to a number of potentially severe empirical problems that are
at least partially present in the recent set of randomized housing experiments aimed at understanding neighborhood
effects (e.g., Rosenbaum (1995); Katz, Kling, and Liebman (2001); Ludwig, Duncan, and Hirschfield (2001)).
                                                             20
exceptions, little policy attention is given to any underlying consideration of the scope and form of

governmental intervention.

         The summary from considering the role of government is that the arguments for the currently large

intervention – one quite generally including both financing and provision of services – remains not well

analyzed. Thus, the remainder of this essay addresses a more limited issue: how well does government do

at what it is trying to do.



                                          Efficiency of Production
         Because of the heavy involvement of the public sector in the actual provision of schooling,

understanding the efficiency of production becomes an important issue. With competitive, private

provision, little attention is given to economic or technical efficiency. Barring obvious market

imperfections, there is general faith that market forces will push firms toward efficient use of resources.

Even with market imperfections, there is generally little attention given to issues of technical efficiency,

because firms are presumed to produce the highest possible levels of output given the chosen inputs–even if

the firms are producing at the wrong level or not using the economically best set of inputs. But, the

involvement of government in production, frequently in near-monopoly situations, alters the focus

considerably. The possibility of inefficient production becomes a much more serious concern.

         The attention to performance and efficiency in education began chiefly with Equality of

Educational Opportunity (the “Coleman Report”), a U.S. government publication that appeared in 1966

(Coleman et al. (1966)). The specific focus of the Coleman Report, mandated by the Civil Rights Act of

1964, was the extent of racial discrimination in U.S. public schools. Two aspects led to the broad attention

given to it and contributed to the controversy that has followed. First, it took the position that the central

issue was not so much governmental inputs to schooling as it was student outcomes. Second, it is widely

interpreted to imply that “schools are not important.”32



         32
              The Coleman Report was heavily criticized on methodological grounds (Bowles and Levin (1968); Cain
                                                          21
        Public programs are frequently measured by the magnitude of public spending on them or the array

of specific real resources (personnel of various types, capital in buildings or laboratories, etc.) going into a

program. An extension of this is that variations in spending or resources indicate varying amounts of public

involvement. The presumption behind employing spending measures is that funds are used effectively,

implying spending is a simple index of the outcomes. The presumption behind the use of real resource

measures is that the specific resources are important components indicating differences in quality, even if

input prices vary across schools. The Coleman Report, which was required to look at the extent of racial

discrimination in the public provision of schooling, needed a measure of the importance of various inputs to

the schooling process. This requirement led the researchers to turn to measuring student outcomes and to

relating various inputs directly to outcomes. This focus, which had not been applied very broadly in

education or in other areas of government-provided services, dramatically changed the basic form of

analysis.

        Much discussion of schools tends to use the terms “quality” and “resources” interchangeably, but

this usage presumes efficient operations of schools. A central part of the analysis discussed here looks

directly at aspects of how effectively public schools use resources – and concludes that considerable

inefficiency in resource usage exists. At a minimum, school quality should not be simply measured by

expenditure patterns or by specific resources. More importantly, policy should logically reflect this reality.

        The attention to the Coleman Report reflected the popular interpretation of the analysis that

“schools do not make a difference.” That interpretation, as discussed below, is incorrect, but the basic

evidence behind the statement suggests serious performance problems of government, because purchased

inputs to schools are not closely related to outcomes. Evaluation of the alternative interpretations,

nonetheless, requires more general treatment of the educational production process and the empirical results

that are available.


and Watts (1970); Hanushek and Kain (1972)). The most serious issue was the use of an analysis of variance
procedure that biased the findings against any school factors being important and toward family factors. As discussed

                                                         22
General structure

           The framework of analysis of educational performance considers a general production function

such as:



(1)        Oit = f(Fi(t), Pi(t), Si(t), Ai) + υit




where Oit =performance of student i at time t, Fi(t)=family inputs cumulative to time t, Pi(t)=cumulative peer

inputs, Si(t)=cumulative school inputs, Ai =innate ability, and a stochastic term, υit.

           This general structure has motivated an extensive series of empirical studies. The typical empirical

study collects information about student performance and about the various educational inputs and then

attempts to estimate the characteristics of the production function using econometric techniques.

           Two aspects of this formulation are important to point out. First, a variety of influences outside of

schools enter into the production of achievement. Second, the production process for achievement is

cumulative, building on a series of inputs over time. Both of these are important in the specification and

interpretation of educational production functions.

           The relevance of many factors outside schools highlights the necessity of going beyond simple

comparisons of student performance across schools. Most of the attention in analytical studies has focused

on the measurement of school attributes. This focus seems natural from a policy point of view. It also

reflects the common use of administrative data in estimating production functions, because administrative

data are frequently short of many measures of family background. Nonetheless, this lack of attention is

unfortunate. First, increasing attention has been given to potential policies related to families – such as

preschool and daycare programs, after school programs, parent education and the like. Second, because


below, this study also confused measurability of inputs with the importance of teachers and schools.
                                                          23
families frequently exert preferences on the schools that their children will attend, incomplete measurement

of external influences on performance raise intense issues of selection bias and preclude simple statements

about causal influences of schools. Such an observation of course does not seem very profound, but, as

discussed below, many empirical studies give little attention to nonschool influences in addressing the

impact of school factors. Moreover, public policy debates surprisingly frequently rely on simple accounting

of performance across schools. For example, much of the current movement toward increased school

accountability often relies on just aggregate student scores for a school.33 Just the level of student

performance is not a reliable indicator of the quality of schools students are attending.

          The cumulative nature of achievement, where the learning in any time period builds on prior

learning, implies that any analysis must take into account the time path of inputs. This places heavy

demands on measurement and data collection, because historical information is frequently difficult to

obtain.

          The cumulative nature of the production process has been a prime motivation for considering a

value-added formulation. At least in a linear version of (1), it is possible to look at the growth in

contemporaneous performance over some period of time, instead of the level of performance, and relate that

to the flow of specific inputs. The general value-added formulation can be written as:



(2)       Oit - Oit*= f*(Fi(t-t*), Pi(t-t*), Si(t-t*)) + υit - υit*




          33
            With the increasing popularity of publishing average performance of students in different schools, the
interpretation of scores becomes more important. In fact, without consideration of the various inputs that go beyond
just schools, alternative accountability systems can have perverse effects (cf. Hanushek and Raymond (2001)). The
integration of the underlying theoretical and empirical analysis of the determination of achievement with
accountability and incentive systems is an important but underdeveloped area of investigation.
                                                                      24
where outcome changes over the period (t-t*) are related to inputs over the same period. Note that this

formulation dramatically lessens the data requirements and eliminates anything that appears as a fixed effect

in the level of achievement (eq. 1).34

         A final key issue is how student performance is measured. A prime justification for the attention to

education, as described previously, is its hypothesized effects on labor market outcomes. The question

remains about how best to measure educational output for understanding production relationships and

policy options. With few exceptions (e.g., Betts (1995), Grogger (1996)), accurate measures of school

inputs have not been related to subsequent earnings, making direct analysis impossible.35 Thus, most

analyses have conceptualized this as a two-stage problem: school resources and other things are related to

test scores, school completion, or other intermediate outcomes, and these outcomes are related to subsequent

success.36


Effects of teacher and schools

         The most obvious complication of estimating models such as equation 1 is the necessity to specify

precisely the various inputs into the production of student achievement. A logical starting place is

estimation of the magnitude of differences across teachers and schools.

         Consider


         34
            This formulation presumes that innate abilities are constant and thus fall out of achievement growth. With
more information on variations over time, it is also possible to allow for ability differences in growth (Rivkin,
Hanushek, and Kain (2001)). Alternative formulations have prior achievement, Oit*, on the right hand side, allowing
for coefficient different than one (Hanushek (1979)). This latter approach has the advantages of allowing for different
scales of measurement in achievement during different years and introducing the possibility that growth in
performance differs by starting point. It has the disadvantages of introducing measurement error on the right hand
side and of complicating the error structure, particularly in models relying on more than a single year of an
individual’s achievement growth.
         35
           Another class of studies, those aggregated to high levels such as the state level, have also considered labor
market outcomes (e.g., Akin and Garfinkel (1977), Card and Krueger (1992a)). These studies, which introduce a
wider set of analytical concerns, are discussed below.
         36
           In more pragmatic terms, if interested in understanding policy influences on student outcomes, one would
not want to wait decades until the ultimate impact in the labor market is observed.
                                                           25
(3)      Oit - Oit*= f*(Fi(t-t*), Pi(t-t*)) + ∑ tj Tij + (υit - υit* )



where Tij is an indicator variable if student has teacher j during the period t-t*. This general covariance, or

fixed-effect, formulation identifies teacher and school effects by systematic differences in achievement

gains by students. In this formulation, teacher quality is measured implicitly by the average gain in

achievement for the students of each teacher (adjusted for other factors influencing achievement).

         Such analyses consistently show large and significant differences among teachers (e.g., Hanushek

(1971, 1992); Murnane (1975); Murnane and Phillips (1981); Armor et al. (1976); Rivkin, Hanushek, and

Kain (2001)). In the general formulation of equation 3, however, identification and interpretation of teacher

and school effects is nonetheless complicated, since any factors that are constant across the period t-t* and

across the students with teacher j are incorporated in the estimated effect, tj. Thus, for example, teacher

effects, school effects and classroom peer effects are not separately identified if the estimates come from a

single cross section of teachers. Hanushek (1992), however, demonstrates the consistency of teacher effects

across grades and school years, thus indicating that the estimated differences relate directly to teacher

quality and not the specific mix of students and the interaction of teacher and students. Rivkin, Hanushek,

and Kain (2001) remove separate school and grade fixed effects and observe the consistency of teacher

effects across different cohorts – thus isolating the impact of teachers as opposed to just some combined

teacher and classroom effects.37

         The magnitude of differences in teacher quality is noteworthy. The estimated difference between a

"good" and a "bad" teacher in poverty schools of Gary, Indiana, was approximately one grade level per



         37
             The approach in Rivkin, Hanushek, and Kain (2001), however, relies on just variations within schools
(having removed any fixed school and grade effects on achievement). Therefore, it cannot identify either the
magnitude of between school differences in teacher quality or the importance of overall school differences such as
that reflecting school leadership, quality of facilities, or the like. Even though for many purposes understanding the
magnitude of between school quality differences is also important, an important objective of this paper is eliminating
any possibility of selection effects.
                                                                     26
academic year; i.e., a student with a good teacher might progress at 1.5 grade equivalents in a school year,

while those with a bad teacher might progress at 0.5 grade equivalents (Hanushek (1992)). Alternatively,

Rivkin, Hanushek, and Kain (2001) produce lower bounds on estimates of the variance in teacher quality

entirely from heterogeneity of teachers within Texas schools. The estimates indicate that one standard

deviation in teacher quality is equal to one-fifth of the average gap in performance between low income and

higher income students. In other words, contrary to some conclusions emanating from Coleman et al.

(1966), schools have the ability to compensate for educational differences arising from family backgrounds.

A string of five above average teachers can, by the previous estimates, entirely close the average

achievement gap by income level within Texas schools.

        The identification of teacher and school effects also relies on the linearity of effects. If teachers, for

example, have different effects on certain subgroups of students, the estimates of equation (3) do not

separate out pure teacher effects. This problem, which also exists for estimation that relies upon specific

measures of teacher characteristics, can be investigated through straightforward extensions of the model to

allow tj to vary across groups or according to other characteristics.

        While estimation of this general fixed effect model demonstrates the significant impact of variations

in teacher and school quality, it does not pinpoint the underlying characteristics or causes of these

differences. Estimation by Murnane (1975) and by Armor et al. (1976) demonstrates that school principals

are able to identify variations in teacher quality in the value-added sense of tj. Thus, evidence suggests that

quality variations are observable – an important issue in light of the next section that demonstrates that

quality is not captured by measures of common characteristics such as degrees and experience of teachers.


Components of school inputs

        The vast majority of analyses of educational production have pursued a different approach: the

specification and estimation of hypothesized components of the teacher and school effects. This work

returns to the specifications in equations 1 or 2 and attempts to incorporate specific measures of the

                                                       27
components of Sit, the relevant inputs from the school. High on the list of characteristics has been a variety

of measures of the resources going into schools, since budgeting for added expenditures of various sorts

presents a series of obvious hypotheses about which factors influence achievement. This approach has not

been very productive from the viewpoint of empirical description of the educational progress. But that in

itself is significant because, as discussed below, these measured inputs are frequently the object of

governmental decision making and policy.

         Studies of educational performance include a variety of different measures of resources devoted to

schools. Commonly employed measures include (1) the real resources of the classroom (teacher education,

teacher experience, and class size or teacher-pupil ratios); 2) financial aggregates of resources (expenditure

per student and teacher salary); and, 3) measures of other resources in schools (specific teacher

characteristics, administrative inputs, and facilities).

         The real resource category receives the bulk of analytical attention. First, these best summarize

variations in resources at the classroom level. Teacher education and teacher experience are the primary

determinants of teacher salaries. When combined with teachers per pupil, these variables describe the most

significant variations in the instructional resources across classrooms. Second, these measures are readily

available and well-measured.38 Third, they relate to the largest changes in schools over the past three

decades. Table 5 displays the dramatic increases in these school inputs for the U.S., with pupil-teacher

ratios falling steadily, teacher experience increasing, and the percent of teachers with a masters' degree

actually doubling between 1960 and 1990. Similar increases in resources have been well documented in

other countries around the world (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (2001)).

Fourth, studies of growth in performance at the classroom level like equation 2, commonly thought to be the

superior analytical design, frequently have these resource measures available but not the others.



         38
            A majority of existing analyses of student performance has relied upon administrative data from schools.
The real resource variables are commonly collected and reported within such data, and, because they are frequently
the basis of payments or regulations across levels of government, they tend to be reported accurately.
                                                           28
         The analytical design of studies of real resources stands in contrast with that for the other resource

measures. The financial aggregates, particularly expenditure per pupil, are typically not even calculated for

the classroom or the school, but instead are only available for the school district or for entire states or

nations. As a result, studies employing these are typically the most aggregated studies, a source of

analytical problems discussed below. Moreover, studies focusing on spending are not amenable to value-

added specifications, causing the set of specification problems described previously. The study of spending

is directly relevant for many policy discussions,39 but these expenditure studies are noticeably lower quality

than the best, and the typical, study investigating real classroom resources. The measures of other school

resources typically are measured poorly and tend to be available only at the district level.40 Since resources

such as facilities tend to be relatively smaller in terms of overall spending, one would also expect these

factors to be less important in determining student achievement.


Results of Production Function Estimation for the United States

         Existing estimation of educational production functions provides considerable information about

governmentally provided schooling. The intellectual heritage of this is the Coleman Report (Coleman et al.

(1966)). This governmentally sponsored study spawned a large body of subsequent analyses, in large part

because of its conclusions that cast doubts on the productivity on public schools. Perhaps more important,

it set a standard of studying outcomes of schooling. Because of the common approach to studies conducted


         39
           Some studies include expenditure per pupil along with measures of the real classroom resources. In such a
case, since variations in classroom instructional expenditure are held constant, expenditure per student is interpreted
as spending outside of the classroom. If only some of the classroom resources are included, the interpretation is more
ambiguous and depends on the specific specification.
         40
            For example, policy deliberations often consider the relative proportion of resources going to
administration versus instruction. In the United States, the proportion of expenditures at the classroom level has
fallen dramatically over time (Hanushek and Rivkin (1997)), leading some to view this as a measure of waste.
However, without accounting for the uses of these resources and their effects on achievement, it is difficult to make
such efficiency statements. Unfortunately, little work has concentrated on expenditures outside of the classroom.
Data are imprecise, because even the definition of what are administrative expenditures is not settled. When
available, administrative and other expenditure categories are generally not disaggregated at the school level.
Similarly, measures of resources like laboratories or libraries are noted by their existence as opposed to any idea

                                                          29
since the Coleman Report, it is possible to provide a consistent summary of the results of how resources and

other inputs affect student performance.

           Providing a consistent summary is especially important in this area, because the large number of

existing studies, taken individually, appear to support a number of disparate conclusions which do not hold

when put in the context of the entire body of evidence. A tendency to focus selectively on a few studies and

findings is exacerbated by the relationship between the research and serious policy discussions. The results

of this research has been entered into legislative debates, judicial proceedings, and executive proposals –

frequently placing heavy weight on the subset of studies that supports a particular position.

           This discussion begins with tabulation of all studies meeting rudimentary quality standards

(published in a refereed journal or book, including some measure of family background, and presenting

information about the statistical properties of estimates). By including the universe of U.S. studies

(available through 1994), the initial analysis provides an overview that is not affected by selectivity of

results.

           Estimates of key production function parameters come from 376 separate published estimates,

found in 89 separate articles or books.41 The estimated relationships vary in a variety of substantive ways

(by measure of student performance, by grade, by included measures of resources). These studies also vary

widely in quality, as generally captured by methodology and adequacy of data. Subsequent discussion

considers how any results might be affected by key dimensions of focus and quality. In particular, the

following sections delve into both analytical issues (methodology and data) and substantive specification

issues (behavior and organization).


extent or quality.
           41
            A more complete description of the studies can be found in Hanushek (1997a), which updates the analysis
in Hanushek (1986). The tabulations here correct some of the original coding of effects in that publication. They also
omit the estimates from Card and Krueger (1992b). In reviewing all of the studies and estimates, it was discovered
that these estimates were based on models that did not include any measures of family background differences. This
specification requirement is a minimal quality criterion, since omission will almost certainly lead to biased resource
estimates. Family backgrounds have been shown to be quite generally correlated with school resources and have been
shown to have strong effects on student outcomes.

         Basic Results

         Table 6 presents the overall summary of results of estimates of the effects of key resources for U.S.

public schools. The tabulations note the numbers of separate estimates for each parameter along with their

estimated direction of effect and with their statistical significance (5 percent level).

         In terms of real classroom resources, only 9 percent of the estimates for the level of teachers

education and 14 percent of the estimates for teacher-pupil ratios show positive and statistically significant

effects on student performance.42 These relatively small numbers of statistically significant positive results

are balanced by another set finding statistically significant negative results—reaching 14 percent in the case

of teacher-pupil ratios or the same percentage as finding the expected positive effect. Most estimates (72

percent of the teacher-pupil ratio estimates and 86 percent of the teacher education estimates) are

statistically insignificant and those reporting the sign of insignificant estimated coefficients are split fairly

evenly between positive and negative. A higher proportion of estimated effects of teacher experience are

positive and statistically significant: 29 percent. Importantly, however, 71 percent still indicate worsening

performance with experience or less confidence in any positive effect. And, because more experienced

teachers can frequently choose their school and/or students, a portion of the positive effects could actually

reflect reverse causation (Greenberg and McCall (1974); Murnane (1981); Hanushek, Kain, and Rivkin

(2001c)). In sum, the vast number of estimated real resource effects gives little confidence that just adding

more of any of the specific resources to schools will lead to a boost in student achievement. Moreover, this

statement does not even get into whether or not any effects are ‘large’. Given the small confidence in just


         42
           The individual studies tend to measure each of these inputs in different ways. For example, while many
studies include an indicator variable for whether or not the teacher has a master’s degree, some will include measures
of the graduate credits. With teacher-pupil ratio, some measure actual class size, while the majority measure teacher-
pupil ratio. A variety of functional forms have been used, ranging from simple linear relationships to different
nonlinear forms with thresholds, quadratics, and the like. In all cases, estimated signs are reversed if the measure
involves pupil-teacher ratios or class size instead of teacher-pupil ratio. Further, where nonlinearities indicate positive
effects over some range but not others, say with ranges of teacher experience, the most favorable for the hypothesis of
positive effects is recorded.
                                                            31
getting noticeable improvements, it seems somewhat unimportant to investigate the size of any estimated

effects, at least for the aggregation of studies.

         The financial aggregates provide a similar picture. There is very weak support for the notion that

simply providing higher teacher salaries or greater overall spending will lead to improved student

performance. Per pupil expenditure has received the most attention, but only 27 percent of the estimated

coefficients are positive and statistically significant. In fact, seven percent even suggestion some confidence

in the fact that adding resources would harm student achievement. In reality, as discussed below, studies

involving per pupil expenditure tend to be the lowest quality studies, and there is substantial reason to

believe that even these results overstate the true effect of added expenditure.

         Outside of the basic resource factors, a vast number of specific measures of teachers and schools

have been included at one time or another, but few measures have been repeated frequently enough to

permit any sort of tabulation. One set of exceptions involves either administrative inputs or facilities.

While these categories include a wide range of specific measures, the results of such investigation as

tabulated in Table 6 show little consistent effect on student performance.43 An additional exception is

teacher test score, where teachers have been given some sort of achievement or IQ test and their score on

that has been related to their students' performance. Table 6 displays the results of the 41 studies that

include teacher test scores. Of all of the explicit measures that lend themselves to tabulation, stronger

teacher test scores are most consistently related to higher student achievement, even though only 37 percent

provide positive and statistically significant effects.



         Components of results

         The forgoing tabulations combine the available evidence in a variety of ways – across grade levels,


         43
           Administrative inputs are measured with such things as overall spending, the salaries of administrators, or
the qualifications of administrators. Facilities include expenditures and specific measures such as availability of
laboratories, the size and presence of a library, and the property of the school. In all cases, results are tabulated such
that more of the measured characteristic means greater resources.
                                                            32
across measures of outcomes, and across studies of varying quality. While study quality is considered in the

next section, the other issues do not have a strong influence on the overall findings. Real resources tend to

show the same inconsistent pattern with achievement at both elementary and secondary school levels (not

shown). Similarly the results of real or financial resources are not very different for studies focusing on test

scores as the measure of performance and those focusing on other outcome measures. One specific issue has

received extra attention. Do high resource schools encourage students to stay in school longer (which has

obvious impacts on earnings)? Answering this question is, perhaps, more difficult than the straight

achievement question, because labor market opportunities will affect the school completion decision as will

net tuition and parental financial support when contemplating college. That question is a focal point of

Hanushek, Rivkin, and Taylor (1996). In that study of school completion, school resources have no

significant impact on student behavior once individual achievement and school costs are considered.44 The

issue of performance measurement has arisen specifically within the context of results for achievement tests

and results for labor market outcomes (see controversies, below). Nonetheless, except for the differences in

aggregation of the underlying estimation, no significant differences in results are found.

         The role of peers

         Schools are made up of teachers and other personnel but also include other students – peers. In

fact, early sociological discussion of schools emphasized peers, and the Coleman Report (Coleman et al.

(1966)) is commonly interpreted as arguing that peers played a more significant role in student achievement

than did the resources and other formal structure of the schools. The interest in peers and integration of this


          44
             Resource effects on college continuation are emphasized in Card and Krueger (1996). The estimation of
 resource impacts on school continuation is, however, particularly prone to specification problems. One might expect
 state effects to be particularly important in determining school continuation, since the availability and expense of
 public colleges and universities and the opportunity costs implied by different local labor markets vary significantly
 across states. The studies of college attendance in general do not control for interstate differences, leading to serious
 specification errors. (State policies and their impacts on production function estimates are discussed below). Betts
 (1996) reviews a number of these studies of educational attainment and does suggest some positive effects of
 resources. For the studies tabulated here (which differ from those considered by Betts), there tend to be positive
 effects of expenditure on school attainment, but there are only 25 total studies and only five estimated from within
 individual states. Thus, the small samples make it difficult to resolve this issue conclusively.
                                                           33
with Tiebout choices of families are set out in an interesting set of papers emphasizing the general

equilibrium outcomes including de Bartolome (1990), Manski (1992), Benabou (1993, 1996), Epple and

Romano (1998, forthcoming), Nechyba (2000, forthcoming-b), and Caucutt (forthcoming). A central

element running through these papers is how financing mechanisms, particularly vouchers, interact with

demands of families for different peers. While the structure of the vouchers and the mechanisms for

individual behavior affect the solutions, these papers suggest that important peer influences can have direct

ramifications for overall welfare and for the distribution of outcomes. These papers consider the outcomes

of sorting, assuming that peer groups are important. Unfortunately, the development of empirical work has

not kept pace with the theoretical investigations.

        The empirical analysis of peers is very difficult to conduct and the results have been hard to

interpret because they become confused with issues of the underlying estimation. Manski (1993b, 2000),

Moffitt (2001), and Brock and Durlauf (forthcoming) describe a variety of econometric issues surrounding

the topic.

        Perhaps the most significant issue in estimating peer effects is the presence of omitted or

mismeasured variables for schools and peers. Mismeasured individual factors or neglected influences that

are common to the peers lead naturally to further identification issues, because mismeasured individual

factors may be proxied by aggregate measures for the peers. Importantly, omitted variables bias will under

very general circumstances lead to overstating peer influences, so peer effects can appear significant even in

the case where they have no true effect Hanushek et al. (forthcoming). As the previous analysis of measured

school factors indicates, characterizing school quality has been difficult, and thus it is highly likely that

standard estimation of educational production functions with peers will overstate peer influences.

        The theoretical econometric literature has concentrated more on the endogeneity of peer influences.

Peer effects can be thought of as a simultaneous equation system where each student affects the others in

the class and is in turn affected by the others, implying that standard issues of identification arise. These



                                                        34
issues are very difficult to deal with, particularly if the main effect of peers is through contemporaneous

interactions. Specifically, if my behavior affects peer behavior and peer behavior affects me, estimation is

problematic. Normal exclusion conditions, or even random assignment of students to classrooms, offer little

hope in this case. If instead it is the characteristics of peers, such as how prepared they are for the

curriculum or their general motivation and outlook, the development of both econometric estimators and the

use of sample randomization becomes more feasible. In this case, nonetheless, the pure measurement issues

still impinge on the ability to separate individual effects from peer effects.

        Early empirical investigations provide mixed results about the importance of peers (Hanushek

(1972, 1992)), Henderson, Mieszkowski, and Sauvageau (1976), and Summers and Wolfe (1977)). More

recent analysis has taken alternative approaches to identification of peer effects. Hanushek et al.

(forthcoming) consider changes in the peer composition that arise from small changes across grades and

cohorts in demographics and prior achievement. They are able to eliminate any time invariant effects of

schools and grades in schools through a fixed effect strategy and then to identify the effects of peers. They

find small but significant differences of having smarter peers, and they find some effects of racial

composition.

        A separate strand of research, which has generally not been too careful about the structure of peer

estimation, has looked at questions of ability tracking, or streaming, in schools. Conventional wisdom has

suggested that heterogeneous grouping is good because the higher achievers help the lower achievers but

are not affected by having low achieving classmates (Oakes (1985, 1992)). A careful review of this

literature along with new estimation of tracking effects is found in Argys, Rees, and Brewer (1996).

Nonetheless, this important policy issue deserves more attention, particularly in terms of the underlying

methodological difficulties.

        Peer effects have been considered in an international context by Zimmer and Toma (2000). Their

analysis, using data from the second international mathematics and science tests given in 1981, estimated



                                                       35
achievement models across five countries (Belgium, France, New Zealand, Canada, and the United States)

and incorporating public and private schools. They find that peer ability appears important, especially for

low achieving students, and that peer effects may be more important in public than in private schools.

        Because peer effects enter into a wide variety of other economic analyses and because they are the

subject of intense policy deliberation, it remains surprising that there has not been more empirical research

into the topic.

        Racial integration

        Racial integration of schools has been one of the most significant factors in United States public

schools over the past fifty years. Yet, while there has been an enormous amount of legislative and judicial

attention to racial desegregation of schools, the analysis of its effects is quite limited.

        The U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Board of Education (1954) held that separate but equal

was unconstitutional because separate could not be equal.45 This ruling led to dramatic changes in schools

throughout the country. While school integration started slowly, the decade of the 1970s witnessed a

substantial reduction in segregation brought about largely through legal pressure on local school districts

(Welch and Light (1987)).

        Many of the early (post-Brown) analyses, which focused on short run effects of purposefully

moving students to less segregated schools, consider a variety of student outcomes and yield mixed effects

of desegregation (Crain and Mahard (1978), Cook (1984), Armor (1995)). These studies are, however,

plagued by methodological problems – largely related to sample selection issues but also including the

heterogeneity of desegregation circumstances – making it difficult to assess the general impact of

desegregation efforts.

        Another segment of this literature focused on not so much on student outcomes but on the impact of

desegregation efforts on the subsequent racial composition of schools. The large-scale exodus of whites

from many cities and towns clearly dampened the impact of school desegregation on interracial contact, and

beginning with analysis of “white flight” in the face of court ordered desegregation by Coleman, Kelley,

and Moore (1975), much of the analytical focus shifted to outcomes defined in terms of racial contact

(Welch and Light (1987), Clotfelter (2001)).46

         Finally, a related but distinct strand of research focuses on whether peer racial composition, as

opposed to desegregation actions, affects achievement for blacks as well as for other demographic groups.

Coleman et al. (1966)) and its offshoots (U.S. Commission on Civil Rights (1967)) provided empirical

evidence that racial isolation harms academic achievement.47 Subsequent work by Crain (1970), Boozer,

Krueger, and Wolkon (1992), Grogger (1996), and Hoxby (2000c) finds that school racial composition

affected academic, social, or economic outcomes. Hanushek (1972) finds that higher concentrations of

blacks hurts both whites and blacks, but is concerned that the racial composition of the school may simply

be a proxy for heterogeneity in school quality and other omitted factors. Rivkin (2000) finds no evidence

that exposure to whites increases academic attainment or earnings for Black men or women in the high

school class of 1982, and Cook and Evans (2000) indicate that little of the black-white difference in

National Assessment of Educational Progress scores can be attributed to racial concentration. On the other

hand, Hanushek, Kain, and Rivkin (2001b) find that the racial composition of the school has a significant

effect on black students, but not whites or Hispanics. Moreover, the negative effect of being in a school

with higher concentrations of blacks is highly concentrated on blacks in the upper ability groups. The use

of stacked panel data that permits controlling for other inputs in a very general manner suggests that

unmeasured school quality can be ruled out as the primary cause of these findings and that specialized peer


         46
            A related line of inquiry investigates racial composition and private schools (e.g., Clotfelter (1976) or
Fairlie and Resch (forthcoming)). Whether or not private schools tend to be more segregated than public schools has
also been the subject of considerable policy debate since Coleman, Hoffer, and Kilgore (1982). These issues are,
however, beyond the scope of this analysis.
         47
           The Coleman Report data, collected in 1965, largely reflect the legal and behavioral equilibrium before
court ordered desegregation efforts, because most desegregation plans were instituted in subsequent periods (Welch
and Light (1987)).
                                                         37
effects are the most likely explanation.

         Most existing estimates have not paid close attention to the methodological issues surrounding

identification of peer effects.48 Moreover, the research has often failed to even separate out the most

rudimentary differences in school quality.49 Further research into aspects of the racial composition of

schools, similar to peer research, appears to be a challenging but high value line of inquiry.

         Family inputs

         The emphasis of the original Coleman Report on the role of families in education has generated

little subsequent disagreement. Most empirical studies of school performance include some measure of

family background.50 In fact, having some controls for family differences was a requirement for the

previous tabulation of resource results, because ignoring these differences will undoubtedly bias resource

coefficients through the correlation of family background and resources. Nonetheless, this research for the

most part has not considered the details of what aspects of families are most important or of the causal

structure of family effects.

         The general argument has been that changing the important underlying characteristics of the family

would be extraordinarily expensive even if policy makers wished to consider such an approach. Thus, for

example, if mother’s education were known to be important in a child’s achievement, the best short run

policy probably is not to send all mothers back to school. For this reason, researchers have not paid close

attention to the precise measurement and specification of family effects.

         On the other hand, long run policies may nonetheless reasonably relate to family factors. For


         48
          A recent comprehensive review finds the evidence on achievement and psychological differences is very
mixed Schofield (1995) and attributes the inconclusiveness largely to methodological shortcomings.
         49
           See for example the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights (1967), which neglects any consideration of school
factors Hanushek (1972). Of course, an alternative argument for policy purposes might be that only the reduced form
relationship is needed, because the correlates of racial composition may adjust with desegregation. Moreover, much
of the discussion about school segregation goes far beyond the simple discussions of student achievement.
         50
            One large exception to this rule is that many studies of labor market effects or other performance measures
that are collected after completion of schooling often neglect background information. See the review and discussion

                                                          38
example, arguments for improving women’s education in developing countries may reflect the potential

impacts on children’s achievement more than the normal arguments about the return to the mother of human

capital investment, particularly in countries where women do not work much in the formal market.51

         But, if long run policies are directed at family factors, it is important to know the exact nature and

causal impact of families. Is it the education of mothers that is important? Or is it the education of fathers

(which often is not given the same analytical attention)? Or is it some other aspect of the family – wealth,

attitudes, expectations, or other things – that is truly important and that shows up through its correlation

with parental education?

         The little work that has been explicitly related to family factors has opened serious question about

the underlying causal structure. For example, Behrman and Rosenzweig (2002) suggest that mother’s

education may not be as important in children’s schooling as commonly believed, once proper attention is

paid to the possibility of omitted factors.52 Similarly, Mayer (1997) questions whether income per se affects

the kinds of family outcomes that are normally subsumed under the topic of poverty and income. Part of the

issue in understanding families effects may arise from heterogeneous incentives within and across families

(cf., Becker and Tomes (1976), Weinberg (2001)).

         As policy debates venture into policies that are designed to change families, it is important to

understand better the underlying structure. For example, as described previously, a variety of policies for

developing countries point to family factors. But, in developed countries similar policy initiatives such as

those designed to strength the family role or to ameliorate adverse family influences are increasingly

discussed. The general problem has been that existing studies lack a convincing identification strategy that

         51
          These arguments also interrelate with a variety of economic models of fertility that consider trade-offs
between child quantity and quality, although most do not directly consider child achievement; see Becker and Lewis
(1973), Willis (1973), Hanushek (1992)).
         52
           Their analysis relies on a sample of identical twins to separate the effects of mothers from other possible
influences. While their cross-sectional estimates reproduce the common positive effects of mother’s education, their
refinements alter the sign.

distinguishes true structural aspects of families from a variety of correlated proxies.


The importance of study quality



         The conclusions that should be drawn from the prior tabulations of results have been questioned

because no weighting is used to distinguish among the quality of the studies. While the previous discussion

presents the universe of available evidence, the studies of educational performance clearly differ in quality

and the potential for yielding biased results.

         Two elements of quality, both related to model specification and estimation, are particularly

important.53 First, education policy in the United States is made by the 50 separate states, and the variations

in spending, regulations, graduation requirements, testing, labor laws, and teacher certification and hiring

policies are large. These potentially important differences – which are also the locus of most policy debates

in the states – imply that any studies of student performance across states must include descriptions of the

policy environment of schools or else they will be subject to standard omitted variables bias. The

misspecification of models that ignore variations in state education policy (and other potential state

differences) interacts with the estimation approach. As Hanushek, Rivkin, and Taylor (1996) demonstrate,

any bias in the estimated parameters will be exacerbated by aggregation of the estimation sample.54

Nonetheless, the direction of any bias is an empirical issue, because it depends on the correlation of the




         53
             Krueger (2000) introduces a different measure of study quality. His proposed measure is the number of
separate parameter estimates in a given published analysis. So, for example, a publication that included estimates
from a production function for eighth grade reading and one for high school graduation would necessarily be lower
quality than a publication that only reported on third grade mathematics. Because this criterion is not related to
conventional statistical arguments about model misspecification, estimation bias, or the quality of the underlying data
base, it is not pursued here.
         54
            Loeb and Page (2000) argue that in some circumstances, such as their analysis of compensating
differentials in teacher wages, state aggregate data will be superior because it averages over choices across districts
within states. To deal with state policy variations they concentrate on within state differences with a state specific
time trend employing a panel of salaries and school attainment.
                                                           40
omitted state regulatory and finance factors and the included school measures such as class size or spending.



        Second, as noted, education is a cumulative process, but a majority of studies are purely cross-

sectional with only contemporaneous measures of inputs. In other words, when looking at performance at

the end of secondary schooling, many studies measure just the current teachers and school resources and

ignore the dozen or more prior years of inputs. Obviously, current school inputs will tend to be a very

imperfect measure of the resources that went into producing ending achievement. This mismeasurement is

strongest for any children who changed schools over their career (a sizable majority in the U.S.) but,

because of the heterogeneity of teachers within schools, also holds for students who do not move (see

Hanushek, Kain, and Rivkin (2001a)). Even if contemporaneous measures were reasonable proxies for the

stream of cumulative inputs, uncertainty about the interpretation and policy implications would remain. The

coefficients would bear an ambiguous relationship to the underlying structure parameters of interest, making

policy calculations difficult. But there is little reason to believe that they are good proxies.

        While judgments about study quality have a subjective element, it is possible to make a crude cut

based on violations of these two central problems. Table 7 provides insight into the pattern and importance

of the specific omitted variables bias resulting from lack of information about key educational policy

differences across states. This table considers two input measures: teacher-pupil ratio and expenditure per

pupil. These inputs, on top of being important for policy, are included in a sufficient number of analyses at

various levels of aggregation that they can provide direct information of potential misspecification biases.

As discussed previously, the percentage of all estimates of the impact of teacher pupil ratios with significant

positive estimates is evenly balanced by those with significant negative estimates. But this is not true for

estimates relying upon samples drawn entirely within a single state, where the overall policy environment is

constant and thus where any bias from omitting overall state policies is eliminated. For single state studies,

the statistically significant effects are disproportionately negative. Yet, as the samples are drawn across



                                                        41
states, the relative proportion positive and statistically significant rises. For those aggregated to the state

level, almost two-thirds of the estimates are positive and statistically significant. The pattern of results also

holds for estimates of the effects of expenditure differences, which are more likely to come from highly

aggregate studies involving multiple states. (Expenditure studies virtually never direct analysis at

performance across different classrooms or schools, since expenditure data are typically available only at the

district level. Thus, they begin at a more aggregated level than many studies of real resources.)

         This pattern of results is consistent with expectations from considering specification biases when

favorable, but omitted, state policies tend to be positively correlated with resource usage. As noted, while

the direction of any bias depends on the degree of correlation, under quite general circumstances, any bias

will tend to be more severe if estimation is conducted at the state level than if conducted at the classroom

level (Hanushek, Rivkin, and Taylor (1996)).55 The initial assessment of effects from Table 6 indicated

little reason to be confident about overall resource policies. The refinement on quality in Table 7 indicates

that a number of the significant effects may primarily be artifacts of the sampling and methodology.

         The second problem is a different variant of model specification. Because education is a

cumulative process, relating the level of performance at any point in time just to the current resources is

likely to be misleading. The standard approach for dealing with this is the estimation of value-added

models such as equation 2 where attention is restricted to the growth of achievement over a limited period

of time (when the flow of resources is also observed).

         Table 8 displays the results of studies that consider value-added models for individual students.

The top panel shows all such results, while the bottom panel follows the earlier approach of concentrating

just on studies within a state. With the most refined investigation of quality, the number of studies gets

quite small and selective. In these, however, there is no support for systematic improvements through




         55
          The discussion of aggregation is part of a broader debate trying to reconcile the findings of Card and
Krueger (1992a) with those presented here. See discussion below.
                                                         42
increasing teacher-pupil ratios and hiring teachers with more graduate education.56 The effects of teacher

experience are largely unaffected from those for the universe of studies. Again, because of the small and

selective nature of these value-added studies within a single state, uncertainty about the precise effect of

ignoring history remains. They do, however, make a prima facie case that the prior results about the effects

of specific resources were not simply an artifact of study quality.


International Evidence



         Analysis of how schools affect student performance has been conducted considerably more in the

United States than in other countries. Nonetheless, similar investigations have been conducted in other

parts of the world, even though data limitations have tended to be more severe.

         The evidence for countries other than the United States is potentially important for a variety of

reasons. Other countries have varying institutional structures, so different findings could help to identify

the importance of organization and overall incentives. Moreover, other countries frequently have much

different levels and exhibit larger variance in resource usage, offering the prospect of understanding better

the importance of pure resource differences. For example, one explanation of the lack of relationship

between resources and performance in the United States is its schools may be generally operating in an area

of severe diminishing marginal productivity where marginal resource effects are small. By observing

schools at very different levels of resources, however, it would be possible to distinguish between

technological aspects of the production relationship and other possible interpretations of the evidence such

as imprecise incentives for students and teachers.

         Analysis in less developed countries has shown a similar inconsistency of estimated resource effects


         56
            Other possible explanations of the results also exist. For example, as discussed in more detail below,
Rivkin, Hanushek, and Kain (2001) are able to find statistically significant but small effects of class size differences,
and these effects differ by socioeconomic status of the family. This analysis, based on very large samples, suggests
the possibility that other analyses lack sufficient statistical power to detect the small and varying effects of some of the
school factors.
                                                            43
across studies. While these estimates typically come from special purpose analyses and are frequently not

published in refereed journals, they do provide insights into resource use at very different levels of support.

Table 9 provides evidence on resource effects from studies completed by 1990.57 Two facets of these data

compared to the previous United States data stand out: 1. In general, a minority of the available studies

suggests much confidence that the identified resources systematically and positively influence student

performance; and, 2. There is generally somewhat stronger support for these resource policies than that

existing in U.S. studies. Thus, the data hint that the importance of resources may vary with the level of

resources, a natural presumption. Nonetheless, the evidence still does not suggest that pure resource

policies can be expected to have a significant effect on student outcomes.

        There is similar evidence to that in the U.S. that very significant differences exist among teachers

(Harbison and Hanushek (1992)). Their analysis in the very poor region of northeast Brazil finds very large

differences in total teacher effects. Surprisingly these differences are not related to simple measures such as

the amount of teacher education or experience, even though, for example, teacher education can be as little

as four years.

        The evidence on developed countries outside of the United States is more difficult to compile. The

review by Vignoles et al. (2000) points to a small number of studies outside of the U.S. and shows some

variation in them similar to that already reported among estimates elsewhere.

        A set of consistent estimates for recent periods using the data from the Third International

Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) is presented in Hanushek and Luque (forthcoming). They employ

the data on variations in scores within countries. The 36 countries with complete data are weighted toward

more developed countries but do include poor countries. They find little evidence that any of the standard

resource measures for schools are related to differences in mathematics and science scores within




        57
          This compilation of results from Hanushek (1995) incorporates information from Fuller (1985), Harbison
and Hanushek (1992), and a variety of studies during the 1980s.
                                                       44
countries.58 Moreover, there is no evidence in this consistent work that there are different effects of

resources by income level of the country or by level of the resources. Thus, contrary to the conclusions of

Heyneman and Loxley (1983), schools do not appear relatively more important for poorer countries.

         Woessman (2000, 2001) looks at cross national differences in TIMSS math and science scores and

concludes that the institutional structure matters importantly for achievement. By pooling the student test

scores across countries and estimating models that include both school and national characteristics, he finds

suggestive evidence that the amount of competition from private schools and the amount of decentralization

of decision making to schools have significant beneficial impacts, while union strength is detrimental and

standard differences in resources across countries are not clearly related to student performance. The

limited number of national observations for institutions nevertheless leaves some uncertainty about the

estimates and calls for replication in other samples that permit, say, variations within countries in the key

institutional features.

         While the international evidence has been more limited, this situation is likely to be reversed

profitably in the future. A key problem historically has been less available performance data for different

countries, but this lack of information is being corrected. As student outcome data become more plentiful –

allowing investigation of value added by teachers in schools in different environments, international

evidence can be expected to grow in importance.

                    Interpretation of Evidence on School Performance

        The previous work on educational production has provided substantial evidence that there are vast

differences among teachers and schools. At the same time, these differences are not easily described by the

resources employed or by any simple set of programmatic or behavioral descriptions. More importantly,

since policy is often directed at the resource levels, questions about the effectiveness of the public provision

of schooling naturally arise.

        The evidence does not say that money and resources never matter. Nor does it say that money and

resources could not matter. It simply describes the central patterns of results given the current organization

and incentives in schools. Indeed, a plausible interpretation of the evidence is that some schools in fact use

resources effectively but that these schools are counterbalanced by others that do not. At the same time, the

expansion of resource usage unaccompanied by performance gains implies a high level of inefficiency in the

current operations of schools.

        The implications of these results, however, depends fundamentally on how the policy and decision

making process is conceived. At one level, these conclusions clearly imply that educational policy making

is more difficult than many would like. If resources had a consistent and predictable effect on student

performance, policy making would be straightforward. State and national governments could decide how

much money to invest in schools and could trust local districts to apply funds in a productive manner. But,

the fact that local districts do not use funds effectively complicates this picture. The clearest message of

existing research is that uniform resource policies are unlikely to work as intended.

        The considerations of overall spending levels, either in legislatures or the courts, largely rest on the

premise that local districts are best situated and motivated to use funds wisely and productively. The

evidence currently does not support the effectiveness of local decision making in the current environment.

There is ample evidence, moreover, that policy makers do not fully believe that local decision makers will

do a good job. The extensive bodies of rules and regulations at the federal and state level are mainly

                                                       46
designed to ensure that local districts do not do undesirable things in operating their schools and indicate a

considerable distrust of the motivations and/or abilities of local districts. This, of course, runs into similar

information problems. To set regulations appropriately, one would need to know how resources or process

considerations affect student performance—which we do not know in any way sufficient for designing most

regulatory approaches to good schooling.

        An alternative perspective is simply that current incentives, within the public provision of

schooling, do not motivate schools toward improving student performance (Hanushek and others (1994)).

The simple premise is that the unresponsiveness of performance to resources is largely a reflection that very

little rests on student performance. Good and bad teachers or good and bad administrators can expect about

the same career progressions, pay, and other outcomes—making the choice of programs, organization, and

behaviors less dependent on student outcomes than on other things that directly affect the actors in schools.

        Such a description is, however, itself much too simple, because we have limited experience with

alternative incentive schemes (Hanushek and others (1994)). The alternative incentive structures include a

variety of conceptual approaches to providing rewards for improved student performance and range from

merit pay for teachers to privatization and vouchers. Performance incentives recognize that there might be

varying approaches by teachers and schools that are productive. Thus, they avoid the centralized

“command and control” perspective of much current policy. At the same time, they recognize that simply

decentralizing decision making is unlikely to work effectively unless there exist clear objectives and unless

there is direct accountability.59 Nonetheless, while some evidence is provided below, limited information is

available about the design and impact of alternative incentive schemes in schools.

        The existing work does not suggest resources never matter, but it also cannot describe

circumstances where resources are used well. It does clearly indicate that the current organization and

incentives of schools do little to ensure that any added resources will be used effectively.


          59
           While the decentralization considered here really refers to pure resource policies and general funding, the
 evidence supports this conclusion even at the level of school based management; see Summers and Johnson (1996).

Controversies



        The preceding interpretations of the general ineffectiveness of school resource policies have been

challenged on several grounds. The challenges generally suggest that the evidence and its interpretation

may be biased.

        Causality

        A key issue in considering the results of the educational production function studies is whether they

identify causal relationships. Resource allocations are determined by a complicated series of political and

behavioral choices by schools and parents. The character of these choices could influence the estimates of

the effectiveness of resources. Consider, for example, the result of systematically assigning school

resources in a compensatory manner. If low achieving kids are given extra resources – say smaller classes,

special remedial instruction, improved technology, and the like – there is an obvious identification problem.

Low class size could simply mean kids need more help. Issues of this kind suggest both care in

interpretation of results and the possible necessity of alternative approaches.

        At the individual student level, correlations with aggregate district resources through either formula

allocations or community decisions are not a major cause of concern. The classroom allocations may,

however, be a concern. For example, within a school, low achievers may be placed in smaller classes,

suggesting the possibility of simultaneity bias. Any such problems should be largely ameliorated by value-

added models, which consider the student’s prior achievement directly. The only concern then becomes

allocations made on the basis of unmeasured achievement influences that are unrelated to prior

achievement.

        Lazear (2001) develops an optimizing model that provides motivation for the decisions of schools

in setting class size. His theoretical model, based on profit maximizing schools, emphasizes the externality

related to disruptive students. One key issue in the context of the previous empirical results is whether


                                                       48
variations in disruption probabilities should be thought of as exogenous or whether alternatively they

represent components of the teacher’s classroom management ability, i.e., elements of teacher skill. Such a

distinction is obviously very important in interpreting the model and the implications of it. While his model

underscores the ambiguities of estimating reduced form models, the appropriate approach for testing the

overall model or for estimating the behavioral equations is not developed.

        Particularly in the area of class size analysis, a variety of approaches do go further in attempting to

identify causal effects, and the results are quite varied. Hoxby (2000b) used de-trended variations in the

size of birth cohorts to identify exogenous changes in class size in small Connecticut towns. Changes in

cohort sizes, coupled with the lumpiness of classes in small school districts, can provide variations in class

size that are unrelated to other factors. After pursuing her instrument strategy, she finds no significant

impact of class size on achievement. Other studies have used aggregation approaches (by school or state) to

construct instrumental variables estimators for the effects of class size (Akerhielm (1995); Boozer and

Rouse (1995)) and have found more positive effects.

        Several international studies have also pursued instrumental variables strategies that rely upon

specific institutional structure. Angrist and Lavy (1999) note that Maimonides’ Rule requires that Israeli

classes cannot exceed forty students, so that, like in Hoxby’s analysis, the lumpiness of classrooms may lead

to large changes in class size when the numbers of students in a school approaches multiples of forty (and

the preferred class size is greater than forty). They formulate a regression discontinuity approach to identify

the effects of class size, but many of their estimates also use class size variation other than that generated by

the discontinuities. The results provide generally positive but varying support for the effects of class size in

different grades and circumstances. Case and Deaton (1999) rely upon the distinct policy regime of

apartheid in South Africa to identify the effects of changes in resources and class size for black citizens.

They argue that mobility restrictions and white decision making break the possible correlation of resources

and individual errors, allowing them to identify the causal impact of resources. They find a significant



                                                       49
positive relationship between pupil-teacher ratios (interpreted more generally as overall resources) and both

attainment and achievement. Hanushek and Luque (forthcoming), using the TIMSS data, perform a cross-

country analysis restricted just to rural schools where mobility is restricted and schools frequently have a

single classroom in the relevant grade, eliminating the normal concern about compensatory decision

making. They not only find little evidence of consistent benefits from class size reduction but instead tend

to find class size is positively related to achievement.60 A final alternative is Lindahl (2000), who

hypothesizes that differential summer learning across students could mask the importance of differences in

school resources. Employing achievement data on a sample of Swedish students, the effects of resources

are identified by assuming that parental inputs are the same in the summer and in the school year, while

school inputs operate only during the school year. He estimates significant effects of class size

differences.61

         Unfortunately, identification of truly exogenous determinants of class size, or resource allocations

more generally, is sufficiently rare that other compromises in the data and modeling are frequently required.

These coincidental compromises jeopardize the ability to obtain unbiased estimates of resource effects and

may limit the generalizability of any findings. Rivkin, Hanushek, and Kain (2001), employing better data of

multiple cohort panels, make use of exogenous variations in class sizes within Texas schools across grades

and cohorts to identify the impact of class size. The very large samples in that analysis provide estimates of

small but statistically significant effects of class size on performance for earlier grades but not later grades

and that the effects vary with student background.62


         60
            A second approach removes a common achievement difference if the student’s classroom is below the
average for the grade, thus removing an average compensatory effect (if it exists) for each country. This approach
similarly leads to little difference from the basic estimation.
         61
           This analysis follows prior work on summer learning differentials (e.g., Heyns (1978); [Entwisle and
Alexander (1992)), but he also suggests implications for the analysis of school differences. He concludes that the
previous value-added specifications may be tainted by differential summer learning.
         62
           The large samples in that analysis, approaching one million students, permit very precise estimates of the
small effects. Krueger (1999) suggests that one reason many estimates are statistically insignificant is that the
underlying parameter is very small and the typical estimation sample is insufficiently large to discriminate between
small and zero. Of course, the small size of the parameter is relevant for any policy deliberations, because small
                                                          50
          In sum, these alternative approaches yield inconsistent results both in terms of class size effects and

in terms of the effects of alternative methodologies. The results in each of these studies tend to be quite

sensitive to estimation procedures and to model specification. As a group, nonetheless, the results are more

likely to be statistically significant with the expected sign than those presented previously for all studies, but

the typical estimate (for statistically significant estimates) tends to be very small in magnitude. At the same

time, the results of these approaches are inconsistent in terms of statistical significance, grade pattern, and

magnitude of any effects, making it difficult to understand to what circumstances any results might

generalize.

          Consideration of the determination of school inputs has not been undertaken systematically,

although anecdotal evidence suggests that it should be given more attention. For example, many teacher

contracts in the United States allow more experienced teachers to choose the schools where they teach,

leading to the previous concerns about the underlying behavior behind estimated achievement and

experience relationships (Greenberg and McCall (1974); Murnane (1981); Hanushek, Kain, and Rivkin

(2001c)). At the same time, little has been done on overall expenditure determination and its possible

effects.63 Similarly, while various policies and incentives drive much of the education of teachers, the

effects of this have not generally been integrated into the achievement analysis.

          While these topics are reconsidered below, it is clear that further work into the determination of

resource patterns and the relationship to production function analysis is an important area for additional

research. The difficulty of course is finding ways to identify the separate relationships in a convincing

manner.




effects must be compared to the costly nature of the interventions.
          63
           Some work has considered specific expenditures, such as special education (see, for example, Lankford
and Wyckoff (1996); Cullen (forthcoming)). General expenditure determination and its effects on production
function estimation has not, however, received much attention.
                                                          51
        Labor Market Outcomes

        Taken as a group, the production function studies give little indication that variations of resources

have anything to do with present variations in student performance. The overall findings related, for

example, to teacher-pupil ratios are dominated by estimates for test score measures of outcomes (217 out of

276). Test scores are nonetheless not generally the ultimate object of educational policy, but their use

instead reflects growing evidence suggesting variations in test scores have important effects in the labor

market. However, the widely-publicized findings of Card and Krueger (1992a) are taken as contrary

evidence to the general picture given previously by indicating that variations in school resources are related

to earnings differences among workers.64 Some discussion has suggested that the most important difference

between this latter study and the bulk of those reported previously comes from the measurement of

outcomes, i.e., labor market experiences versus (typically) test scores (see Burtless (1996a)).

        On the other hand, the test score-earnings linkage previously discussed provides a prima facie case

that outcome measurement is not the source of difference. Moreover, specific reviews of the larger set of

estimates in the resource-earnings literature suggest no significant differences from the overall results

presented above (Betts (1996); Hanushek (1997a)). Yet, because of frequent citations of the different

findings by Card and Krueger, it is useful to investigate the possible sources of the differences.

        The divergent findings may simply be explained by variations in the level and environment of

schooling across different eras. The Card and Krueger (1992a) analysis begins with samples of adult

workers from the 1970 and 1980 Censuses of Population and fills in information about the schooling

circumstances of individuals from information about their year and state of birth. The workers in their

sample attended schools between the 1920s and the 1970s, implying variations in the level of resources

going far beyond what is found today. If added resources have diminishing effects on student achievement,



         64
            The Card and Krueger (1992a) analysis of school resources and earnings is the most discussed, but it
 follows a larger line of research. See, for example, Welch (1966), Johnson and Stafford (1973), and Wachtel (1976).
 An insightful review of past studies that considers underlying characteristics of the studies is Betts (1996).
                                                         52
current school operations may be largely "on the flat" of the production function, while Card and Krueger

observe ranges from the past where resources had stronger effects.65

         A related possibility might be that the political economy of schools has changed over time. For

example, with the rise of teachers unions and the resulting change in bargaining positions, resources might

be used in different ways and have different student achievement implications now than in the past (e.g.,

Borland and Howsen (1992); Peltzman (1993); Hoxby (1996b)). In other words, it is quite possible that the

enormous changes in educational resources did have an effect on outcomes in the first half of the 20th

century, but that more recent studies are also correct in finding no effect for the sorts of resource changes

discussed in current schools.

         Nonetheless, the most important set of reasons for the different conclusions likely involves

specification issues. To begin with, many of the direct analyses of earnings include just the level of school

resources, but none of the other factors that might influence student achievement and skill development. For

example, it is plausible that students attending schools with a high level of resources also have parents who

contribute more time, energy, and money to their education. If parental inputs are left out of the calculation,

any estimated effects of school resources would tend to overstate the true independent effect of resources.66

Further, as pointed out above, aggregation of school inputs is also likely to exacerbate any biases due to

specification issues (Hanushek, Rivkin, and Taylor (1996)). Most of the earnings analyses observe school

resources measured only at the aggregate state level. The Card-Krueger estimate comes from resource data




          65
            The key element is that at high levels of resources the marginal productivity of added resources may be
 significantly less than at low levels of resources. While not a direct test of this on-the-flat thesis, the lack of
 significantly stronger resource effects in developing countries introduces some question about this hypothesis; see
 Hanushek (1995), or, in a growth context, Hanushek and Kimko (2000).
         66
           For example, Card and Krueger (1992b) do not include any family background factors, so – in addition to
the general aggregations issues of missing state policies – the effects of pupil-teacher ratios will be confounded with
any family factors that are correlated at the state level. They stratify by race but include no measures of family
background variations that might permit identification of a pure effect of pupil-teacher ratios.
                                                          53
aggregated to the state level, but no measures of state policy differences are included, so their estimates are

subject to this bias.67

         As critiques by Speakman and Welch (1995) and Heckman, Layne-Farrar, and Todd (1996a,

1996b) show, the Card and Krueger (1992a) estimates are very sensitive to the specific estimation

procedure. Moreover, the state earnings differences cannot be interpreted in terms of school quality

differences in the way that Card and Krueger interpret them. In order to identify their estimates of school

quality, Card and Krueger (1992a) must assume that the migration of people across states is random and not

based on differential earnings opportunities. Heckman, Layne-Farrar, and Todd (1996a, 1996b) show that

there is selective migration and that this fundamental requirement for their interpretation is untrue.68

         Thus, while some of the discrepancy in results could be attributed to different changes in schools

over time, much of it appears to arise simply from the analytical problems in Card and Krueger (1992a). In

more general consideration going beyond this specific paper, there appears to be little difference in results.

         Meta-Analysis and the Summary of Results

         Alternative procedures exist for summarizing the results of studies. These approaches, more

common to other fields of study, sometimes go under the general title of "meta-analysis." A preferred

approach to assessing disparate results would involve combining the underlying data of the studies directly

to develop statistical inferences and tests of hypotheses across the studies. Unfortunately the original data

are seldom available for reanalysis—and even when they are, combining data from different sources can be

difficult—which forces a variety of compromises in the aggregation of results. The previous data on studies


          67
            If, on the other hand, there are important measurement errors in the school resources, aggregation could be
 beneficial because this would tend to average out any measurement problems. A central concern of Hanushek,
 Rivkin, and Taylor (1996) is distinguishing between the harmful effects of aggregation and model misspecification
 and the beneficial effects of aggregation and measurement error. That analysis rejects the hypothesis that
 measurement error is a primary element in the apparent importance of resources in the more aggregated studies.
         68
           They also show that the results differ significantly across time and that they are very sensitive to the
precise specification of the models. Speakman and Welch (1995) further show that virtually all of the effects of state
school resources work through earnings of college attendees, even though the resource measures relate only to
elementary and secondary schools.
                                                          54
in Tables 6-8 represent one approach to the aggregation of results, an approach which relies on the minimal

set of factors standardly reported. But, instead of simply reporting the distribution of results, others have

attempted to do formal statistical tests.69 An attempt to apply formal statistical tests to education production

function data is found in Hedges, Laine, and Greenwald (1994) and Greenwald, Hedges, and Laine (1996).

They wish to do formal hypothesis testing using the available data from essentially the same set of

published studies employed here.70 The most basic problem with their statistical analysis is that it fails to

address the fundamental problem of whether resources are consistently related to performance. Instead, the

question they pose is whether there is any evidence that resources or expenditure differences ever appear to

affect student performance. They explicitly test the null hypothesis that all parameters indicating the effect

of a specific resource on student performance are simultaneously equal to zero; i.e., Ho: β1=β2=. . .=βn=0,

where the βi are the underlying parameters relating a specific resource to student performance in one of the

n available estimates. If any single underlying parameter (i.e., one βi ) for the combined sample of studies

across varied schooling circumstances is not zero, the null hypothesis is false (that is, someplace there is an

effect on student performance). Their statistical procedures are designed in such a case to reject the null

hypothesis, leading to acceptance of the alternative that at least one study indicated the resource was related

to performance.71 They reject the null, but it does not change the overall interpretation of the econometric

results.


            69
            The primary argument against the simple tabulations, or vote-counting, employed here derives from the
 stylized analysis of combining a series of small experiments employing tests with low power, where more studies can
 actually lead to false conclusions. These examples have little relevance to the statistical tests developed in a
 regression framework with the very large samples frequently available.
           70
            Some of the problems with doing this are immediately evident. Combining testing information is best
motivated from thinking about variations in estimates of a single common parameter, something that hard to define
given the variations in underlying model specifications. More importantly, published articles frequently do not (and
cannot) provide sufficient information. For example, if parameter estimates are correlated across studies, say because
they reflect performance in different grades of one school district, estimation of the combined variance of the
estimator would require knowledge of the covariances--something that is never provided. Problems on
nonindependence enter into the tabulations previously presented, but they are clearly less central to the interpretation
of the results than in the case of combined significance testing.
            71
                 In discussing precisely the issue of how to interpret rejection of this null hypothesis, Hedges and Olkin
                                                                 55
         Experimental Evidence (STAR Experiment)

         In attempting to understand the effects of specific resources on student performance, an appealing

alternative to econometric estimation is the use of random assignment experiments. Such an approach can

overcome a variety of concerns raised above about selection, causation, and the like. In the mid1980s,

because of ambiguity about the effects of class size on student performance, the State of Tennessee

launched a random-assignment experiment in reducing class sizes. The design was heavily influenced by

an early summary of research by Glass and Smith (1979) that suggested student achievement was roughly

constant across class sizes until the class size got down to approximately 15 to 1. After 15 to 1, reductions

in class size appeared to yield gains in student performance. Based on this, a group of kindergarten through

third graders in Tennessee was randomly assigned to either large classes (22-24 students) or small classes

(14-16 students).72 Students were followed over time as they progressed from kindergarten through third

grade.

         The student testing shows that children in smaller classes did better at the end of kindergarten and

that this better performance was maintained through the third grade. This evidence is sometimes taken as

refuting the econometric evidence on teacher-pupil ratios that was presented earlier, but two aspects are

important to consider. First, while the use of experimentation is an important research approach (Hanushek

and others (1994); Mosteller (1995)), the actual implementation of this experiment is open to question.

Second, the findings, which pertain to a very large policy change in very specific circumstances, yielded

small and difficult to interpret results.

         A number of questions arise about the quality of the randomization in the STAR experiment.

Specifically, because of lack of data, it is difficult to assess the randomization of students or teachers into


 (1985), state, “It is doubtful if a researcher would regard such a situation as persuasive evidence of the efficacy of a
 treatment” (p. 45).
          72
            The design was actually more complicated. The large classes were broken into two groups, one with
 teacher aides and one without aides. To be eligible for participating in the experiment, a school also had to be large
 enough so as to ensure that there was at least one small and large class. For a description the experiment and the
 basic results, see Word et al. (1990).
                                                           56
the experiment. There was substantial nonrandom attrition from the experiment; 51 percent of students

initially in the experiment left before the end of the experiment. Substantial numbers (up to 12 percent by

test) did not take annual tests; significant proportions of students changed experimental group (with the

largest numbers going from large to small classes) during the experiment. It is difficult to assess the impact

of any of these with the existing data (see Hanushek (1999); Krueger (1999)).

          The second issue is interpretation of the results. The initial achievement differences found in the

year students entered a small class were maintained but did not become wider through the grades (Word et

al. (1990); Krueger (1999)). Because they continue to get more resources (smaller classes), these resources

should, according to the general hypothesis, keep producing a growing advantage. Figure 1 shows the

difference in reading performance in small classes that was observed across grades in Project STAR. (The

results for math performance are virtually identical in size and pattern). It also shows how the observed

outcomes diverge from what would be expected if the impact in kindergarten were also obtained in later

grades.

          Even if taken at face value, however, a significant issue remains: To what circumstances should the

results be generalized?73 The Tennessee experiment identified performance differences related to very large

changes in class size at the entry into school. No similar experimental evidence looks at schools outside of

Tennessee, at later grades, at smaller reductions, or at different absolute levels of class size. The previous

econometric evidence found that some introductions of lower class appeared effective, even if across the

board results were unlikely. But, like the Tennessee results, there is no indication from the econometric

studies of when class size reduction is likely to work.

          In sum, the potential application of random assignment experiments to schools is a very important

innovation. Indeed, it offers an attractive alternative to the more common event, moving directly to major



          73
            A second significant issue, discussed below, is whether the resulting effects large enough to justify further
policy initiatives? The magnitude of the difference in performance is very small: a 1/3 reduction in class size over
four years produced an average gain of about 0.2 standard deviations of student achievement.
                                                           57
public funding of full-scale programs.74 The existing results from the one major experiment that exists,

however, do not offer any substantial contradiction to the previous econometric findings.




         Consumer behavior

         The concept of increased consumer choice with respect to schools has been high on a variety of

reform agendas. At the same time there is considerable choice of schools that comes through residential

choice that is frequently tied to specific schools. While moving residence is clearly costly and clearly

provides a blunt instrument for school choice, it nonetheless operates on the margin. Each year one-fifth of

American households change location, allowing considerable room for exercising consumer choice of

schools. An issue here is whether this choice by consumers affects the results observed about the operations

of schools.75

         A general conceptual argument against the inefficiency in school provision revolves around

consumers and keys on notions of Tiebout moving behavior (Tiebout (1956)). Consumers appear to desire

higher spending for schools; if wasted, one would expect lessened demand and/or moving of consumers to

districts where there was more efficient production. This in turn would put pressure on districts to become

more efficient.

         The evidence suggests that there is consumer pressure, but that it is insufficient to overcome the

existing variations in efficiency. The one direct investigation of jurisdictional competition is Hoxby


          74
             In 1996, the State of California moved to a statewide program of providing significant additional funds to
 all schools that lowered class sizes in primary grades to state-prescribed levels. This program appears to have been
 the policy implementation of perceived results from the STAR experiment. Having done this on a statewide basis,
 there is also no effective way to evaluate the results of such an initiative, so that neither California nor other states
 can learn from this program. The existing evidence provides little reason to be optimistic about the future
 achievement effects of this policy Stecher and Bohrnstedt (1999).
         75
           A different perspective on Tiebout effects comes from consideration of estimation of expenditure demand
functions, where choice of communities by families will generally lead to overstating the income elasticity of demand
Goldstein and Pauly (1981), Bergstrom, Rubinfeld, and Shapiro (1982), Gramlich and Rubinfeld (1982), and

                                                            58
(2000a) that considers how the numbers of districts in a metropolitan area – a measure of the potential for

Tiebout competition – affects performance of the public schools.76 She finds that more competition

increases outcomes measured by test scores, attainment, and early career earnings. She also suggests that

districts are more efficient when there is more competition among districts.

        Most work has not focused directly on the relationship between school efficiency and consumer

behavior but instead has investigated pieces of consumer choices. First, consumers have been shown to be

willing to pay for schools with higher test performance. In particular, estimation of hedonic price indices

for housing, beginning with Kain and Quigley (1975) and Rosen and Fullerton (1977), demonstrate positive

effects of school achievement levels on housing demand. More recently, Black (1999) refines this approach

by considering houses very close to school district boundaries – where contamination of unmeasured

neighborhood quality is likely to be small – and finds that test scores of local schools have a strong effect on

house prices. Similarly, Weimer and Wolkoff (2001) confirm such within district capitalization of school

performance. Second, consideration of the political economy of school budgeting suggests that budget

maximizing bureaucrats may act to push expenditure above the optimum (Romer and Rosenthal (1979);

Filimon, Romer, and Rosenthal (1982); Romer, Rosenthal, and Munley (1992); Inman (1987); Rothstein

(1992)). By gaming voters in the face of budget reversion levels, bureaucrats are able to push the median

voter above her optimum spending level. Third, investigations of demand for spending – which typically

assumes that expenditure is the same as quantity demanded – have paid no attention to quality of

governmental services (e.g., Borcherding and Deacon (1972); Bergstrom and Goodman (1973); Poterba

(1997)). In short, most existing analyses do not consider either consumer awareness of inefficiencies or

consumer reactions to any inefficiencies.




Rubinfeld, Shapiro, and Roberts (1987).
        76
          The underlying analysis uses instrumental variables (based on local geography) to circumvent endogeneity
problems with district choice. The estimates of Tiebout choice effects disappear when endogeneity is not considered.
An alternative set of estimates of public school choice on outcomes is found in Hanushek and Rivkin (forthcoming).
                                                         59
           An alternative view of the forces behind the inefficiency of schools relates to self-interest of school

personnel. Pritchett and Filmer (1999) consider how the interests of school personnel align with the

decisions that are made and conclude that such self-interest appears important. Because of the special role

of school personnel in setting policy, these forces could distort the preferences and choices of consumers.

           A basic problem with all of these indirect approaches is the failure to distinguish school quality, or

the value-added by schools, from the level of achievement in a school. Indeed, this is almost certainly the

problem facing consumers and offers an explanation for remaining inefficiency. Without information about

the contributions of families and of schools, consumers face a critical information problem. This

information problem, which by all accounts appears to be serious, will in turn lead consumers to make

nonoptimal decisions about location, school spending, and the degree of inefficiency that exists in local

schools.

           The analysis of school changing by Hanushek, Kain, and Rivkin (2001a) does suggest that parents

obtain reasonable (value-added) information about school quality, even though such information is not

directly provided by standard accountability systems. A difficulty in analyzing choice through mobility is

that families move for a wide variety of reasons including changes in jobs and family circumstances. Some

of these underlying causes will directly affect student performance, and the analysis of school choice must

take this into account. The analysis in Hanushek, Kain, and Rivkin (2001a) concentrates on long run

achievement effects of a move, under the presumption that the effects of other factors die out after a move,

and finds that families moving to and within suburban areas tend to increase their children’s achievement.

           Clearly, the role of consumers within the determination of school policies and outcomes is an area

for research, because the role of consumer demand is central to many perspectives on schools. We return to

part of this issue below.

           Inefficiency and estimation approach

           Another approach to estimating production frontiers involves variants of mathematical


                                                         60
programming models or imposition of assumptions about the errors in an econometric formulation to

capture the frontier notion. The underlying production theory calls for estimating the maximum feasible

output from a set of inputs. If inefficiency exists in some schools, estimation should conceptually take it

into account. The approaches follow a variety of estimation strategies with data envelope analysis (DEA)

being one of the more common (see, for example, the early work in Charnes, Cooper, and Rhodes (1978) or

Ruggiero (1996) and the references in it). Related work along more conventional econometric lines

concentrates on the specialized nature of the error term that would be generated in the context of a

production frontier (e.g., Aigner and Chu (1968); Aigner, Lovell, and Schmidt (1977). An extension

combining some features of both can be found in Grosskopf et al. (1997).

        The programming model has been used chiefly to consider both the trade-off between alternative

outcomes (e.g., math and reading or test scores and graduation rates) and to uncover the most efficient way

to produce these outcomes. The basic idea is that an efficient school is one producing the maximum output

for its inputs. The estimation then constrains schools to lie on or below the production frontier. As is typical

of these approaches, the number of “efficient” schools will be the same as the number of separate inputs,

and all other schools will be compared to the efficient ones. Since this approach provides a direct measure

of efficiency, it is conceptually possible to investigate how consumers behave when faced with varying

efficiency. These approaches, however, suffer from the presumption that the small number of inputs fully

captures the relevant production factors and that no measurement error exists.77 For computational reasons,

only a small number of inputs are considered, and these often do not take into account the influence of

family background or other nonschool factors. But to fit the underlying theory, it must be the case that other

firms can reproduce the output of the efficient firm – which would not be really possible if performance

relied on other unmeasured inputs such as managerial skill or missing dimensions of teacher quality.

        The stochastic versions relax these assumptions by explicitly including a one-sided error for


        77
           Because they do not begin with a stochastic formulation, the programming approaches typically do not
yield information about the statistical significance of any parameter estimates.

efficiency (constrained to be less than zero) along with a symmetric error. That is, considering the error in

equation (1).



        υ it = εit + ηjt



where individual i attends school j during year t and school j has a stochastic efficiency term with ηjt≤0. If

η is uncorrelated with the family and school inputs, then ordinary least squares estimation provides

consistent estimation and, with specification of the distributions of ε and η, maximum likelihood provides

efficient estimates. But, of course, the key assumption is that inefficiency is uncorrelated with any of the

observed inputs – an unlikely event unless there is truly nothing systematic about the efficiency of schools.

A variety of approaches expand on these models to incorporate both the notions of production frontiers

involving multiple outputs and stochastic elements (see, for example, Grosskopf et al. (1997)), but these

will be subject to the same underlying issues.

        The investigation of inefficiency by schools is clearly a worthwhile pursuit, especially in light of the

previous evidence about performance of schools. Nevertheless, the current limitations of programming

solutions and other econometric approaches appear overwhelming.

        Multiple outputs

        Much of the analysis of school performance treats the production of achievement in a given area as

independent of that in other areas. Thus, for example, the determination of mathematics performance is

separate from that of reading performance. If, however, schools are actively deciding among outcomes and

they compete for resources (generally denominated in terms of time), differences in performance among

schools when measured in a single dimension may simply reflect different motivation to produce a given

array of outputs. That is, a school emphasizing reading may look inefficient in the production of

mathematics if the performance in mathematics is compared to the total set of inputs to the school. A


                                                      62
number of studies have directly investigated varying student performance in a multiple outcome fashion

through traditional simultaneous equations estimation (e.g., Levin, 1970; Boardman, Davis, and Sanday

1974). The problem in this estimation is the difficulty in identifying the separate equations for each

outcome – because it is generally difficult to find factors that affect one outcome but not the others. One

novel approach, however, is Brown and Saks (1975). In their formulation, school districts are portrayed as

maximizing a welfare function defined over both the level and the variance in achievement. They then

estimate reduced form equations for each. They demonstrate that, while school resources are not

systematically related to the level of achievement in a majority of the estimates, their apparent strength is

increased by also considering the variance in performance. One difficulty with this approach is that it rests

upon a presumed common objective function that is not observable. Thus, much like the problems of

basing estimates of consumer demand functions on the researcher’s presumption of the utility function, this

analysis gets it power from specifying the elements of the common preferences of school districts. But,

again, the largest problem is that identification of the underlying structural parameters is not possible,

making the application of this less useful for any policy purposes.

        The common solution for maximizing multiproduct production functions requires some source of

the relative weights for each output – making prices particularly attractive in the analysis of general firm

behavior. Such prices are not readily available for school outputs.

        The previously discussed data envelope analysis (DEA) lists as one of its virtues the ability to

handle multiple outputs. Contrary to the normal production theory optimization, outputs are not aggregated

according to any simple value maximization process. A discussion of the criteria employed can be found in

Grosskopf et al. (1997). A key element in this aggregation is that any inefficiency is found in the

transformation of inputs into aggregate output, as opposed to finding the output combination that maximizes

any social welfare function.78


        78
            An alternative statistical approach to dealing with multiple outputs is the estimation of canonical
correlation models (e.g., Gyimah-Brempong and Byapong (1991)). These methods use statistical criteria to maximize
                                                            63
         Finally, by going to the dual of the production problem it is possible to frame the estimation in

terms of cost functions (e.g., Downes and Pogue (1994) or Duncombe, Ruggiero, and Yinger (1996)).79

With maximization, this approach provides an alternative estimation approach that can characterize directly

the relationships among various outputs. But the estimation relies not only on maximization of outcomes

but also on having accurate measures of input prices. Input prices are particularly problematic with respect

to the primary input – teachers. As discussed below, the supply function for teachers of varying quality is

unknown, making it difficult to integrate into the production analysis.

         Many policy discussions relate directly to consideration of varying outcomes of the educational

process, yet little is known either about the trade-offs that are present or about differential consumer demand

for outcomes. As data on multiple outcomes increasingly become available, the possibilities of inferring

consumer demand from behavior and choices expand.


Cost Considerations



         One remarkable aspect of most considerations of educational performance and school decisions is a

general lack of attention to the costs of alternatives. Perhaps because the evidence about systematic effects

of different programs, of different attributes of schools, or of various other inputs has been so inconsistent,

most attention has focused on whether or not a particular input has a positive and statistically significant

effect on achievement. But knowing that something might be expected to improve student performance is

insufficient to make it the object of public policy. One would clearly want to know whether there were

alternative uses of funds that produced higher achievement, or even higher value outside of schools.


the correlation of aggregate outputs and inputs, but the criteria in general is not clearly related to underlying structural
models or optimization on the part of schools.
         79
            These dual approaches also yield qualitatively the same results as the direct expenditure studies except that
the impacts are inverted. An expenditure parameter in a production function estimate that is close to zero translates
into a very large cost of obtaining any given student outcome. Thus, for example, Duncombe, Ruggiero, and Yinger
(1996) suggest implausibly that it costs two and half times as much to achieve a gain in achievement in some

                                                            64
         The policy problem is easy to see in the case of discussions of policies to reduce class size. Most of

the debate has centered on whether one can expect any achievement gain from a simple policy of reducing

class sizes. But even if one takes the results of the Tennessee STAR experiment as accurate, they suggest a

very small magnitude of effect on performance: a 1/3 reduction in class size over four years produced an

average gain of about 0.2 standard deviations of student achievement (Krueger (1999)).80 Any

consideration of class size reductions should clearly be put in terms of the cost of the program and

alternative uses of funds.

         An important part of the problem, however, is that the cost of alternative inputs is not well

understood. In order to assess the relative benefits of employing alternative inputs, it would be appropriate

to weight by the cost of each input. Yet, particularly when the inputs reflect different attributes of teachers

(e.g., experience) or inputs (e.g., science laboratory quality), little information is available about costs of the

inputs.81

         Teachers are perhaps the best example. It is possible to identify how effective different salaries are

in attracting a pool of teachers without regard to their characteristics (Murnane et al. (1991)). It is also

possible to make some assessment about the relationship between salaries and specific characteristics of

teachers (e.g., Hanushek and Pace (1995); Ballou (1996); Ballou and Podgursky (1997)) or labor markets

(Toder (1972); Antos and Rosen (1975); Chambers (1977); Levinson (1988)). More generally,

compensating differentials for teachers may lead to nominal salary differentials that are misleading in terms

of individual decision making (e.g. Loeb and Page (2000)). Finally, by looking across time, one can see

how teacher salaries cut the distribution of all college graduates, as a possible indication of the overall


downstate New York districts as compared to the average school district in New York State.
         80
            These estimates are roughly similar to those for disadvantaged fourth grade students found in Rivkin,
Hanushek, and Kain (2001), but considerably larger than those for more advantaged students. Putting these results
into cost terms reinforces the small magnitude of the estimates.
         81
           Levin and McEwan (2001) describe cost analysis based on adding the average cost of components of
programs. This approach moves in the right direction of introducing costs into educational decisions, but it cannot
deal with quality concerns and other reasons why the average and marginal cost might differ.
                                                          65
quality of teachers (Hanushek and Rivkin (1997); Flyer and Rosen (1997)). However, even suspending

concerns about the value of separate teacher attributes, the existing studies do not give sufficient

information to integrate any potential benefits with costs. Little progress has been on characterizing the

supply function for quality.

        The analysis of teachers has been more detailed than analyses of other school inputs. Even such

apparently straightforward calculations as the costs of altering class size have been generally neglected.

When attempted, the difficulties become apparent, because the specification of precisely how the policy is

implemented along with other complementary changes that would be required has received little attention

(see, for example, Stecher and Bohrnstedt (1999)).

        In many ways it is surprising that the discussion of costs is so short. Programmatic costs do not

seem to enter systematically in much educational decision making, suggesting a clear reason for observed

inefficiencies in resource use. It also suggests that investigation of costs, particularly for quality aspects of

school inputs, is a fertile area of study.


Institutional Structure and Incentives

        The existing evidence is conditioned by the organization and structure of existing schools.

Specifically, the prevailing incentives in schools may not create very strong pressures for improving student

performance (Hanushek and others (1994)). Altered incentives, on the other hand, could potentially lead to

very different outcomes.

        At the outset, however, it is important to note that a variety of incentives currently exist and that

school personnel respond to them. Traditionally few incentives have existed with respect to improved

student performance, but instead have pointed in other directions. For example, financial incentives from

state payments to schools for children in special education have distorted classification rates into special

education (Cullen (forthcoming). Or, unionization has influenced the efficiency of school and the patterns

of their resource usage (Hoxby (1996b)). Public schools also appear to react to consumer choices, perhaps

                                                        66
because of the relationship to property values discussed previously. In any event, schools facing wider

competition from other districts show improved performance and efficiency (Hoxby (2000a)). The issue is

not the existence of incentives but the direction, force, and focus of incentives. While consideration of

incentives derived from competition with public schools is considered next, some altered incentives have

been attempted within the public schools, and they are the focus of this section.

        Perhaps the most discussed incentive topic is merit pay – providing differential pay for teachers

based on judgments of performance. Most people think this is a natural kind of policy, mimicking pay

systems found in other industries. The common evaluation of those policies attempted is that they fail

(Cohen and Murnane (1986); Hatry, Greiner, and Ashford (1994)). The generalizations are that these

systems tend to evolve into systems of relatively uniform pay and that they often tend to end up being extra

pay for extra work instead of extra pay for good performance. The lessons from existing attempts at merit

pay, however, remain unclear. Because performance contracts exist broadly outside of schools, it seems

necessary to describe why education is different from other sectors. For example, other areas, similar to

education, have difficulty in measuring the contributions of each individual in the firm and need

cooperation among workers – yet they maintain differentiated pay. Indeed, even closely related activities

like business schools use substantial merit systems and find considerable success (Brickley and Zimmerman

(2001)). Private nonsectarian schools appear to use merit pay more extensively than public schools (Ballou

(2001)) and also rely more frequent judgments about teachers and to let go teachers who are not performing

well (Ballou and Podgursky (1997)).

        Part of the issue in assessing merit pay plans revolves around expectations for the incentives. Most

merit pay plans have been evaluated in terms of the performance of the existing teachers. This assessment

assumes that the most significant issue is whether or not teachers are trying hard to do well. If they are not,

merit pay may induce more and better efforts, leading to improved student performance. An alternative

view is that the most significant aspect of merit pay proposals revolves around changes in the stock of



                                                      67
teachers, or the selection issue. Merit pay schemes might provide incentives for better teachers to stay and

for poorer teachers to leave and thus may have little to do with variations in effort. Existing evaluations

have not focused on the employment aspects.

         Schools have not made much use of personnel incentive systems developed in other industries. Nor

have they considered the theoretical literature developed for other organizations. A key element of parts of

this has to do with partial measurement performance and the potential incentives set up by this within

organizations (e.g., Baker (1992, forthcoming)).

         A key element in any individual-specific accountability system is accurate and reliable

measurement of performance. On this score, a variety of approaches have related student performance

directly to teachers. Most notable is the Tennessee Value-Added Assessment System (TVAAS) that is

mandated by state law but does not include rewards or sanctions for individual teachers (Sanders and Horn

(1994, 1995)). Alternative approaches have been developed in Dallas, Texas (Mendro et al. (1998)) and

would include the previously discussed statistical models for estimating teacher effects. A variety of

concerns have been raised about relying specifically on student test performance, including undue focus on

tests that partially measure performance, but importantly there is evidence that principal ratings are highly

correlated with estimates of value-added by teachers (Murnane (1975), Armor et al. (1976)). Nonetheless,

analysis of methodology for evaluating teachers on the basis of performance and of incentive systems that

utilize such information remains limited.

         States have, however, moved away from developing teacher-specific incentive systems and toward

group ratings and accountability. A currently popular reform approach – standards based reform and school

accountability – can be thought of as providing different incentives, although some incentives in these

reform efforts are quite confused (Hanushek and Raymond (2001)).82 The clearest expression of this is the


         82
           The evaluation of behavior under different accountability systems is currently limited, although it is likely
to expand rapidly as increased testing and use of varying accountability systems expands. For example, Deere and
Strayer (2001) suggest that individuals react to public accountability systems but that some of the reaction may not be
desirable. An initial evaluation of the Florida program for using vouchers to deal with failing schools has led to
considerable controversy over the interpretation of the incentives; see Greene (2001a, 2001b) and Carnoy (2001).
                                                           68
develop of accountability systems that report the scores of students in a school and that may condition

rewards on student performance. The approach highlights student performance, often calling for explicit

measurement of outcomes along with mechanisms for aiding school to perform better. For example, a

number of states have moved to substantial rewards to schools that perform highly on the state standards.83

On the other hand, little existing evaluation has been conducted.84 Much of the discussion has concentrated

on the explicit evaluation of outcomes (e.g., Koretz (1996)).

         Some innovative theoretical modeling has begun to describe some of the competing forces

generated by many of the common accountability systems that have emerged with standards based reform

(Betts and Costrell (2001)). They demonstrate some surprising outcomes when accountability systems have

multiple roles.

         The movement of policy toward accountability system and standards based reform has some

important antecedents in the work of John Bishop. In a series of papers he hypothesizes that centralized

testing systems have powerful incentive effects on students (for example, Bishop (1996); Bishop et al.

(2001)). He argues that the strength of incentives for students differ dramatically when there is a

consequential central examination as compared with, say, relative grading by classroom teachers. While

evaluating this proposition is difficult since testing regimes tend to coincide with state or national

jurisdictions that make isolation of test effects difficult, the line of research highlights the importance of

students in the educational process. Most of the other analyses of achievement has stressed the role of

schools and has brought in students largely to the extent that they have fixed, but this line of inquiry

emphasizes the role of student behavior in affecting achievement and therefore brings in the necessity of


         83
            The idea of rewarding schools instead of teachers relates to arguments used against merit pay. Because
teachers must work with each other in a variety of ways, an incentive system that led to “hoarding” of information by
teachers or general lack of cooperation would be unfortunate. There has been little analysis of such approaches.
         84
            Conducting evaluations of existing state plans for accountability is very difficult. Because many plans
cover entire states, it is necessary to do comparative studies across states. But, many other state policies are
simultaneously affecting schools in each state. As discussed previously, problems of misspecification and aggregation
to state levels can severely distort any such analysis.
                                                          69
incentives for students as well as school personnel.

        The general consideration of incentives provides the contrast between the traditional regulatory

approach to running schools and the value of identifying outcomes without detailing the approaches to

achieving them. The incentive approach has the advantage of not requiring detailed knowledge about the

production process in various local situations. Incentives, however, are not without their own

complications. Specifically, little experience indicates how to devise the best incentive structures, and the

details within the complex organization of schools are almost certainly very important. Some early

experimental work into incentive contracts provides a simple example. The U.S. Office of Economic

Opportunity, as part of the War on Poverty in the late 1960s and early 1970s, experimented with

performance contracting, i.e., providing firms direct payments based on the achievement of students to

whom they offered remedial instruction. In the end, virtually nothing was learned from the experiment

because the flawed contract led firms to react in ways that limited what could be learned about basic

approaches to remedial instruction (Gramlich and Koshel (1975)). The conclusion from this experiment

and other incentive designs is that considerably more research is necessary to understand the best approach

to designing incentives. The possibility of such research is likely to increase noticeably as education policy

increasingly recognizes the importance of incentives.



                                  Public versus Private Provision

        If one distinguishes between the financing and the provision of education, it is possible to consider

whether private schools, which perhaps have different incentive structures, perform better than public

schools. The importance of competition for public schools was emphasized early by Friedman (1962) and

has been discussed and implemented in a wide variety of forms. The investigation of this has nonetheless

proved to be difficult and controversial.



                                                        70
        Since 1970, about 11 percent of the U.S. student population has attended private schools. The

private schools are overwhelmingly schools with a religious affiliation, but the religious affiliation has

changed dramatically over time. In 1997, 50 percent are Catholic, 35 percent were other religious schools,

and the remaining 15 percent are nonsectarian, but in 1970 three-quarters were Catholic (see Sander

(2001)). The private schools are restricted from receiving public funding, so those students attending

private schools pay tuition. Additionally, since the taxes to support the public schools – most of which are

property taxes at the local level – are paid regardless of attendance, students attending private schools in

essence pay for both public and private schooling.

        The fundamental analytical question that has dominated the literature is whether or not performance

in private schools exceeds that in public schools ceteris paribus. In particular, if private school performance

exceeds that in the public schools, is it good schools or good kids?


Unsubsidized choice

        Uncovering the relative advantage of public and private provision of education is confounded by

the underlying choice of schools. Consider the following stylized choice problem where attention is

concentrated just on public and Catholic schools for now.



(4)     Op = ƒp(F, P, S, A) + υp



(5)     Oc = ƒc(F, P, S, A) + υc



(6)     Prob(c) = g(F, P, S, A, X) + ε




                                                       71
Equations 4 and 5 (which follow directly from equation 1) describe production in the public (p) sector and

Catholic (c) sector. Equation 6 describes the selection equation governing choice of Catholic schools based

on the production characteristics and other factors, X, such as religious preferences.

        The fundamental difficulty in uncovering the differences between public and private provision

comes from the selection equation. It is clear from the beginning that families that send their children to

private schools are different, because they could have attended the public schools but instead paid tuition to

attend the private school. Specifically, if parents with the largest interest in schooling tend simultaneously

to pick Catholic schooling and to provide more motivation or a better learning environment for their

children, υ and ε will be correlated. As is well known, the estimated effect of schools will be biased if the

production functions are estimated without taking into account the selection of parents.

        The estimation of these relationships takes a variety of forms. The simplest forms of estimation

pursue two similar strategies. First, assuming the impact of families, peers, and school factors is the same

except for a level difference in performance, a pooled production function combining Equations 4 and 5 is

estimated with the addition of an indicator variable for attendance at a Catholic school (Neal (1997)).

Second, separate production functions are estimated within the public and Catholic school populations and

then the difference in performance is calculated by evaluating the production functions at common levels of

all of the inputs and comparing the predicted performance (e.g., Coleman, Hoffer, and Kilgore (1982)).

Both of these approaches, however, require attention to selection.85

        Perhaps the most common approach to selection correction is to consider how own religious

preference affects choice of public or Catholic schools. The argument is that a Catholic background will

increase the chance that a student attends Catholic schools but will not affect the school outcome. But this


        85
            The investigation of relative performance of Catholic schools started intensively with Coleman and Hoffer
(1987). That analysis estimated separate public and Catholic school production functions and then standardized for
differing levels of inputs (F, P, and S) in deriving the differences in performance of the two types of schools. This
analysis started a heated controversy (see, for example, Noell (1982); Murnane, Newstead, and Olsen (1985)) over the
importance of selection in Catholic schools. Selection could also be dealt with through estimation of the choice
equation (Eq. 6), although it is difficult to do this in a way that also can realistically identify achievement
                                                         72
instrument would not be valid if, for example, Catholics on average had higher or lower abilities or were

more supportive of their children than nonCatholics. A better choice, however, is the density of Catholic

households or schools in an area (e.g., Neal (1997)). In any event, some variant of religious affiliation is

commonly employed, though the validity and usefulness of these instruments remains a matter of concern.

The stringent requirements for a valid instrument are generally difficult to meet. An alternative approach is

to consider value-added models where variations in early achievement are considered. This approach,

found in Coleman and Hoffer (1987), implicitly controls for selection if the outside factors entering into

achievement are summarized in the initial levels of achievement. Again, while this estimation strategy has

appeal, assessing whether any further selection effects remain is difficult.

        The common result from estimation is that Catholic schools tend to achieve higher graduation rates

after making selection corrections and holding other input factors constant (see Evans and Schwab (1995);

Neal (1997); Grogger and Neal (2000)). At the same time, the estimation of effects on measured test scores

is not as clear. Estimation yields varying views of the effects of Catholic schools, and the results are

frequently not statistically different from zero (see the summary in Neal (1998)).

        A key element of evaluation of relative performance is defining the relevant comparison. As Neal

(1997) demonstrates, comparisons of public and private schools differ significantly by the group considered.

While suburban public and private schools appear roughly comparable, urban Catholic schools, especially

those serving minority populations, appear noticeably superior on average to urban public schools. The

reasons for this difference in results have not been fully analyzed, but it is consistent with differential

abilities to move and to select schools. If poor and minority populations have limited ability to change

residences, and thus to select school districts, opening up choice through Catholic schools offers more

potential gain. It is also consistent with the possibility that urban schools are on average inferior to

suburban schools (cf. Hanushek, Kain, and Rivkin (2001a)). Sander (1996), however, suggests that



relationships. See, on choice, Lankford and Wyckoff (1992).
                                                        73
heterogeneity of the population attending Catholic schools is important, with positive effects isolated in the

non-Catholic school population and no gains for Catholic students.

        The variation in results by the measure of outcomes, if not a statistical artifact in the small number

of available studies, is difficult to interpret. Student achievement and graduation are closely related

according to past estimation, so it seems surprising that the influence of Catholic quality shows up in one

dimension but not the other. Yet, the differences in school completion continue through college graduation,

suggesting that these are significant differences. One possibility is that the statistical problems with the

achievement estimation are greater, but more attention is needed to the variations in performance across the

different outcomes.86

        A larger problem with this line of research is that it provides no information on the distribution of

results. As discussed above, the bulk of research about educational production is aimed at understanding

the wide variation in performance of public schools. It seems natural to believe that Catholic schools also

exhibit wide variation in performance, although none of the existing analyses document either the

magnitude of differences or the potential causes of such differences. For example, assume that there is a

difference in the mean performance of Catholic schools compared to public schools. It is important to

understand whether this comes from a simple shifting of the entire quality distribution or from a truncation

in the bottom of the quality distribution or from a narrowing of the entire distribution with a loss at both the

top and bottom of the quality distribution. With the character of underlying changes in quality for Catholic

schools being unknown, there is an ambiguity about the exact lessons to be drawn for any policy purposes.

        The comparison of Catholic and public schools is based entirely on performance, but a more

complete analysis would also incorporate the costs of production. Many observe that Catholic schools




        86
             The High School and Beyond survey, which is used in the Coleman work and others, employed a short test
that is likely to be noisy. Further, the sampling design behind the National Educational Longitudinal Survey (NELS)
employed in Grogger and Neal (2000) makes selection on test taking important but difficult to deal with.
                                                        74
appear to be run with significantly lower expenditure levels, but accurate cost accounting is not readily

available.

        One final area deserves attention. The focus on Catholic schools, or private schools more generally,

is motivated by the idea that more choice will lead to competition among schools that will then lead to

improve either in overall performance or in the effectiveness of resource usage. The competition for

students argument is the commonly held explanation for any difference in public-Catholic performance.

But, if that competition affects the Catholic schools, it should also affect the public schools. This effect on

public schools is in fact the primary interest in private school competition, because even a general widening

in the availability and access to private schools would leave a large public sector. Pursuing this theme,

Hoxby (1994) suggests that public schools located in areas where there is more competition from Catholic

schools perform better than comparable public schools facing less competition. This competition is

estimated to affect the level of output measured by educational attainment and graduate rates. Sander

(1999), on the other hand, does not find such spillovers, leaving the question of competitive impacts open.

        Note, however, that if public schools react to the existence of private schools, the evaluation

problem becomes difficult. Any estimate of the performance difference of Catholic schools would

understate the true impact.

        Much of the attention to choice and its impact on results emanates from early arguments by

Friedman (1962) about governmental provision of schools. He argued that, even if government had a role

in the financing of schools, it did not have to provide the service. Instead, by providing vouchers given to

parents, citizens would be able to choose among potential schools – both securing an education that suited

them and opening up competitive forces to improve the provision of schooling.



                                                       75
         In the United States, with a few exceptions there has historically been limited general, publicly

supported choice. A number of states and districts have supported some kind of choice among public

schools. Part of this reflects efforts both to accommodate and to subvert the racial desegregation of U.S.

schools (Armor (1995)). Another part reflects efforts to provide more options and, implicitly, to broaden

competition. The latter efforts have included intradistrict and interdistrict school choice (Nathan (1989);

Hanushek and others (1994)) along with new efforts to free individual “charter” schools (Nathan (1996)).

In recent years, charter schools have dramatically expanded. 87 Hoxby (forthcoming)Subsidized choice

plans are to date considerably more limited: publicly provided vouchers in Milwaukee and Cleveland and

privately subsidized vouchers in Dayton, New York City, and Washington.88

         The wide variety of choice options implies that the incentives under each can be quite different.

For example, the impact of a plan permitting students to choose any public school in the district would have

very different incentives depending on how any excess demand for a school is dealt with, what happens to

teachers and administrators in schools with large number of vacancies, how transportation of students is

handled, and the like. Similarly, when students are permitted to attend public schools outside of the district,

issues about fiscal transfers, the handling of excess demand, and transportation become critical. For

voucher plans, the size of the voucher, the eligibility of potential schools, the treatment of excess demand,

the range of programs that are permissible, the legitimate grounds that schools can use to select students,

and more will determine the character and results of the program. A variety of underlying theoretical

models have identified specific elements of importance. For example, Manski (1992) concentrates on the


         87
            Charter schools provide provisions for individual schools to opt out of district regulations and to provide
an alternative program. The rules governing these schools vary widely by state, but the common element is that they
are supported by public funds and remain officially part of the public school system. These schools must attract
students who choose them over the regular public schools. While most states have less than one percent of their
students in charter schools in 2000, some such as Arizona (3.7 percent) and Michigan (2.8 percent) have developed
substantial competitive public sector. The District of Columbia has over 8 percent in charters. The start of this
expansion along with a description of the kinds of schools in the charter sector is described in Finn, Manno, and
Vanourek (2000)).
         88
            Note that privately provided scholarship plans for attending private schools are actually much more
extensive, but the individual plans generally have been small and have not been evaluated.

role of peers under different choice plans, while Chubb and Moe (1990) emphasize school decision making.

Little empirical work has been done on identifying or assessing the key elements of choice plans.

        The existing public school choice plans have not received thorough analysis in terms of student

outcomes. A primary deterrent to analysis is disentangling selection from program effects. The issues are

identical to those sketch for understanding the impact of Catholic schools, but the development of suitable

instruments for the selection equation is much more problematic. One exception is an analysis of open

enrollment plans in Chicago public schools that suggests most observed better performance by choice

students comes from selection (Cullen, Jacob, and Levitt (2000)).

        The voucher programs are different. The most thorough analysis of the voucher programs has

occurred in Milwaukee. This publicly supported voucher, while not an experiment but instead an on-going

program, had an evaluation plan set up at the outset (Witte (1999)). Subsequently, a number of studies,

taking different approaches and reaching somewhat different conclusions, have looked at the same impact

of vouchers in Milwaukee (Peterson, Greene, and Noyes (1996); Greene, Peterson, and Du (1998); Rouse

(1998); Witte (1999)).

        Three issues are important in the analysis: how to define outcomes, how long to wait to observe

results, and what the comparison group of students should be. In terms of the outcomes of choice, the

available analyses from the Milwaukee program suggest that parents choosing voucher schools are happier

with them than with the public schools and that the choice schools generally spend noticeably less than the

public schools. Thus, from a simple consumer viewpoint, the vouchers seem useful. Nonetheless, the

majority of attention has focused on measured student achievement. The analyses of student achievement

show no real gains in vouchers schools during the first years, but by the fourth year of operation voucher

schools are doing as well as or better than the Milwaukee public schools, depending upon the precise

performance measure. The findings on achievement also depend upon the precise comparison groups.

Comparisons to people applying but not enrolling in the voucher program or to the low income eligible



                                                     77
population show the voucher schools on the whole as doing better, while comparisons to the entire public

student population in Milwaukee show less gain.

         The Milwaukee program is one specific set of rules and institutions. It is not a general test of

vouchers versus public schools. At its inception in 1990, participating schools had to be already existing

nonsectarian schools that also served a substantial unsubsidized population (Witte (1999)). Participating

students had to come from low income families.89 The number of participants was initially restricted to less

than 1 percent of the public school population but grew to 15 percent by 1995. Therefore, this experiment

does not represent a general test of vouchers, but instead a very specific kind of application of the ideas.

For example, an important element of the original Friedman (1962) proposals is the induced supply

response which engages markets in innovating in ways that appeal to consumers – something that is really

not a part of the Milwaukee experience.

         The voluntary, privately-funded voucher programs offer a separate view of the impact of vouchers.

While these have only been operating for short periods of time, some preliminary results are available.

Peterson et al. (forthcoming) suggest that these programs have had positive effects for some minority

students but not for others. The variations in effectiveness thus leave open many questions that are central

to many of the policy discussions.

         The short run evaluations of performance in voucher programs, while interesting and useful,

necessarily provide a limited picture. The primary arguments for introducing competition involve

incentives for new private schools to develop and incentives for the public schools to improve. These are,

however, long run effects, making the evaluation problems and perspectives on these programs analogous to

evaluating merit pay plans for teachers.90




         89
            Family incomes had to be less than 175 percent of the federal poverty level. The official poverty line for a
family of four was approximately $17,500 in 1990.
         90
          Note, however, that Hoxby (forthcoming) provides early results that suggest public schools respond
quickly when they face direct competitive pressures.
                                                      78
        Throughout most of the discussion, very little mention is made of costs. As operated, the existing

voucher programs, including that in Milwaukee, appear to be running at noticeably lower expenditure than

the comparable Milwaukee public school system. Part of this is easily explicable by the public schools’

responsibility for taking all students, including high needs students such as those with handicapping

conditions. But part also seems to be simple differences in cost structures. It is important to know f the

voucher programs are truly operating at lower costs while producing the same (or better results).


International evidence

        Other countries have of course operated much broader choice systems than found in the United

States. While it is possible to find descriptive information and information about the flows of students, little

is available about the relative performance of private schools under different institutional structures (see, for

example, James (1987, 1993); Glenn (1989); West (1996); Cohn (1997), and the case studies in it; Fiske

and Ladd (2000); and Jimenez and Sawada (2001)). Again, as with the analysis of production functions,

developing information about the performance has been hindered by measures of student outcomes.

Nonetheless, evidence on choice is beginning to develop, including McEwan and Carnoy (2000) and

McEwan (forthcoming) on the Chilean experience, and Angrist et al. (2001) on Columbia.

        International evidence currently offers the best chances for understanding the impacts of voucher

systems, particularly the longer run implications. Not only is choice better established in many countries

than in the U.S. but also the institutional structure for choice shows much more variation.



                                         Financing of Schools

        State governments in the United States have had the primary responsibility of the provision of

schooling. The federal government has provided between 5-7 percent of the total funding for schools, and

this funding has been focused on special populations – with economically disadvantaged and handicapped


                                                       79
students receiving the bulk of the funding.91 The federal government has also promulgated laws with major

effect on schools. The most important are Constitutional prohibitions against segregation of schools and

federal legislation about service requirements and standards for handicapped students (so called “special

education”). Because of the limited role of the federal government, however, this discussion will

concentrate on state and local spending.

        State constitutions invariably identify the role of the state government in establishing and running a

public school system that is free to all students. While the exact arrangements differ, state governments

have historically set the general operating structure for schools in terms of regulations and laws governing

the schools and then given local jurisdictions the responsibility for running the schools. Although there is

wide variation across states, local governments typically share funding responsibilities with the states. The

determination of funding levels is the complicated outcome of local decisions, voter and political outcomes,

and state rules and regulations.

        Perhaps the principal policy lever of the states has been the funding level for local education. States

have provided grants to local school districts to cover special purpose, or categorical, items, but most

spending goes for general operating expenditure. The decisions facing state legislatures concern both the

level and the distribution of spending. All states use their funding mechanisms to offset different abilities of

school districts to raise funds locally. Particularly as the value of high quality education has become more

apparent, states have turned their funding toward the goal of improving student achievement. The problem

facing the legislatures has been an inability to turn funding into student achievement with any assurance –

the general issue discussed earlier. One result has been an increasing tendency to add further regulations on

activities along with further funding. This discussion, however, concentrates on the funding aspect and the

implications of state fiscal federalism.


        91
            Funding for primary and secondary schooling (and higher education) comes through the U.S. Department
of Education. Funding for Head Start, another large education-related program for disadvantaged 4-5 year olds, has
come through the Department of Health and Human Services and generally is not included in the usual accounting of
total spending for education.
                                                        80
         The discussion of state funding is heavily influenced by legal cases. School finance in the United

 States was relatively stable through much of the 20th century. Early developments emphasized the role of

 states in ameliorating the largest differences in local wealth (Strayer and Haig (1923)). In the late 1960s,

 the case of Serrano v. Priest was entered into California state courts and changed the stability in financing.92

 This case alleged that the state funding of schools violated the 14th amendment of the U.S. constitution that

 requires equal treatment of individuals under the law. The state funding provided a portion of the funds

 needed by local districts, and districts were expected to raise the remainder. California like a majority of

 other states permitted local jurisdictions to use the property tax as its major revenue source. The Serrano

 suit argued that, because local property tax bases differ, this funding arrangement discriminated against

 students in poor districts by making the funding dependent upon the wealth of others in the community

 (Coons, Clune, and Sugarman (1970)). While the U.S. Supreme Court ultimately ruled in 1973 that the

 state funding formula did not violate the federal constitution,93 the Serrano case and similar subsequent

 ones in a majority of the states were argued on the grounds that the method of funding violated the

 individual state constitutions. While court cases in states continue, few general conclusions can be drawn

 about the legal decisions that have variously upheld and struck down existing state funding formulae.

        Similar policy dilemmas face the courts in school finance cases as face the state legislatures that are

formally charged with funding decisions. The courts have entered into education decision making in

deciding on suits brought by people who argue that their districts are receiving insufficient state funding.

While frequently motivated by concerns about student achievement, in reality both the judicial statement of

the issue and the proposed remedies invariably revolve around the level and distribution of resources.

        An important issue in these discussions is the effect of financing on student outcomes. While

explicitly considered below, the prior discussions on the limited evidence about any consistent relationship

between resources and student performance should provide an early note of caution about the potential

results of resource based policy decisions.


 Alternative funding schemes

             With a few exceptions, states and local school districts share the financing of local schools. This

 sharing, however, varies in several important dimensions. State financing is frequently characterized in

 terms of a formula of identifying state funding per pupil in relationship to local capacity, local effort, and

 characteristics of the local student body. The details, the methods of describing the allocation mechanisms,

 and even the nomenclature differ across states. Nonetheless, three basic funding mechanisms characterize

 the options – and most states use a combination of them. Categorical aid funds districts based upon specific

 identified needs; foundation aid compensates for different tax capacity of the local district; and variable

 matching aid adjusts state support for both different tax capacity and the taxing decisions of the local

 district.

             To understand the funds available to a district, it is easiest to ignore federal subsidies and to

 concentrate on the state and local funding. For simplicity the funding formulae are written in terms of a

 property tax base, reflecting the fact that tax on real property is the most frequently employed local revenue

 raising instrument. With number of students Nj, tax base per student Bj , and local tax rate r, school district

 j can raise Lj in local funds:



 (7)         Lj = Nj × rBj



             Districts with larger tax bases clearly can raise funds more easily if they choose to increase

 revenues. Note, however, that the tax base is actually endogenous. Because the tax base includes not only

 residential property but also commercial and industrial property, local residents in districts with a smaller



                                                            82
proportion of the tax base from residential property pay less of the total local tax bill. In other words, the

“tax price” of raising an extra dollar of local revenue is less than one dollar for the residents (Ladd (1975)).

Other things being equal, then, districts with a low tax price are more attractive, and demand for housing in

them will be high – leading to housing prices being bid up and to the tax base being larger (Oates (1969)).

This endogeneity obviously also enters into policy actions. For example, if the state prohibited local

districts from taxing certain kinds of commercial property, some districts would lose two ways: B, the tax

base, would fall with the loss of the commercial property from its tax base and the district would likely

become relatively less attractive so that housing values fell, bringing B down further.

         State governments routinely act to ameliorate the largest disparities in revenue abilities of districts

and to even out cost differences across districts. The simplest kinds of state subsidy formulae provide fixed

payments for categorical purposes such as:



(8)      Cj=c × Nj



Where the subsidy from the central authority (state) to district j is a flat amount, c, times the number of

eligible students (N). Thus, for example, the state might provide a flat amount for each student classified as

gifted or talented. Categorical aid is identified with specific purposes and often requires specific

expenditures.94 Categorical aid flows for a variety of purposes including student transportation, books and

supplies, special education, and bilingual education programs. Districts, however, cannot be assumed to be

impervious of incentives. As described below, there is evidence that the number of “categorical” students is

endogenous, related to the fiscal incentives that are presented.95



         94
           Of course, as is generally true, funds are fungible – implying that requirements to spend categorical funds
would not be binding unless the local education authority wished to spend less than c per eligiblestudent. Some
evidence, however, suggests that this is not the case. Evidence of the “flypaper effect” suggests that funds tend to
stick where they are provided (e.g., see Gramlich (1977)and the discussion in Oates (1994)).
         95
              Another element of categorical programs is identifying and adjusting for program costs. For example,
                                                            83
         Most attention, however, has focused on alternative ways of providing general revenue – revenue

with few specific use restrictions. By far the most common aid formula is foundation aid where the state

subsidy varies inversely with the local property tax base per student such as:



(9)      Cj = Nj × (F – roBj)



F is the “foundation,” or the amount the district would get per student if it had no ability to tax itself, ro is

the fixed tax rate used to calculate what the local district might be expected to raise itself. Because local

revenue capacity rises with the taxable base (equation 7), states typically reduce their subsidy for districts

with higher B.

         Several aspects of foundation aid are important, although to varying degrees across different states.

First, the foundation aid formula can clearly lead to negative subsidies for districts with large tax bases, i.e.,

when roBj>F. States have generally had mixed reactions to whether or not they should recapture any excess

funds that a district may be able to raise. Without recapture, districts with large amounts of property wealth

continue to have more revenue raising opportunities than those with lower tax bases.

         Second, if a district chooses a tax rate, rj, that is greater than ro, state subsidies are unaffected and

jurisdictions with larger tax bases can capture the full benefit of their tax base.96 Total education spending

(Ej) under a foundation plan combines local and state funding as in:




special education funding is frequently adjusted for different handicapping conditions of students. Existing estimates
of costs that are built into many funding formula begin with the expenditure choices of schools, making them
somewhat problematic. See Chaikind, Danielson, and Brauen (1993)and Lankford and Wyckoff (1996). Other
attempts to deal with local cost differences involve both choices of what costs are important and estimation of the
their magnitude – but this again is difficult when based largely on the choices of districts which also involve varying
preferences about teacher quality (Ballou and Podgursky (1997)).
         96
            Many states require that the district levy some minimum tax rate, often ro, as a way of ensuring that
districts bear a minimum portion of the total taxes for schools. Some states also cap the tax rate that local
jurisdictions can apply (rj) in an effort to limit variations in local spending.
                                                           84
(10)         Ej = Lj + C j

                  = Nj × [(F) + (rj – ro)Bj ]



The incentive to raise the local tax rate of course depends on the desired spending of the community. Thus,

as the foundation level – that “guaranteed” by the state formula – increases, local communities have less

incentive to spend more than F per student and tend to choose tax rates closer to the nominal rate of the

state, ro.

             Third, the number of students is frequently adjusted to take into account special factors. For

example, special education students, instead of being paid simple categorical funds as in (eq. 8), may be

credited as if they are additional effective students. Therefore, for example, a disabled student who has an

identified learning disability may count as, say, 1.6 students. In such a case, the state subsidy for categorical

aid depends upon the local tax capacity. But, of course, this also raises the possibility that Nj is really

endogenous to the extent that districts can vary populations. For example, Cullen (forthcoming) shows that

school districts adjust the numbers identified as requiring special education according to their fiscal

incentive;97 Cullen and Rivkin (forthcoming) also show that further reactions to the provision of special

education services by family choices of residence are possible.

             Finally, a variable matching grant by states takes into account the actual tax choices of the district.

While this formulation comes under many different names (and equivalent ways of writing the formula),

perhaps the simplest is to think of this as a “guaranteed tax base” as in:



(11)         Cj = Nj × rj (Bo - Bj)




where Bo is the tax base that is guaranteed to the district. (Other common descriptions include wealth


             97
            An important feature of the analysis is separating out the causal impact. In this, Cullen develops a series of
plausible instruments that permit identification of the impact on classification.
                                                           85
neutralizing, power equalizing, and percentage equalizing). For any district with an actual tax base less

than the guaranteed base, the state supplements the local tax revenue. Again, a key element is what happens

when Bj>Bo. If recapture is required, the local district sends the excess revenues to the state. In such a

case, the effective revenue schedule for all districts (combining equations 7 and 11) is simply:



(12)    Ej = Nj × rj Bo



and districts differ in spending just to the extent that they choose varying local tax rates. A variant of this

formulation was first popularized by Coons, Clune, and Sugarman (1970) and is the intellectual backdrop to

the original school finance law suits from Serrano v. Priest through recent suits. Again, however, recapture

provisions have generally proved unpopular and are generally only imposed in response to court orders.

        An important aspect of the fiscal consideration is that the formulae provide an indication of the

opportunities that face a district. They do not necessarily foretell the distribution of spending outcomes that

will occur, because these require knowing more about the behavioral responses of individuals. The

behavioral responses occur in two primary ways: the choice of districts by individuals and the expression of

preferences within each district.


Fiscal effects of alternative plans

        While courts and legislatures have significantly changed the fiscal responsibilities for schools since

the early 1970s, surprisingly little is known about the effects of these alterations. Some efforts have been

made to track the spending patterns of these changes, but less attention has gone to consideration of the

overall level.

        Wyckoff (1992) traces the within-state variations in spending over a substantial period of change.

By calculating alternative measures of spending variations, he concludes that state court action has tended to



                                                       86
lead to some narrowing in spending variations, but this is not uniform.98 In a comprehensive study of

existing court and legislative actions, Murray, Evans, and Schwab (1998) estimate models of spending

variation which incorporate information about the timing of court actions. They also conclude that court

action has led to significant narrowing of the spending distribution. However, the state court actions

directly consider just variations within states, while they find that the most significant narrowing of the

spending distribution has been between states.

         The exact nature of the changes in the distribution has been the focus of a number of different

analyses. In an early analysis, Stern (1973) focuses on how changes in the financing formula would affect

equalization of funding within Massachusetts. His simulations indicate that a variable matching subsidy

would reduce disparities due to fiscal capacity differences of states but not those due to socioeconomic

differences. The key element, understanding the underlying preferences of individuals, was extended by

Feldstein (1975). He specifically considered how wealth neutrality approaches might lead to unexpected

spending outcomes where spending was inversely related to local wealth. Craig and Inman (1982, 1986)

consider spending patterns in light of reforms that involve moving spending responsibilities to lower levels

of government. Their work builds upon an explicit model of decision making at different levels of

government and highlights the importance of the fiscal federal system. They find surprisingly strong

reactions to changes in funding patterns.99

         Court rules may have effects on the level of spending in addition to any effects on the distribution.

Most court rulings do not specify how the state should distribute funds, only that an existing funding system

does not meet constitutional requirements. This typically requires that the state legislature alter its approach

to funding. A variety of political economy models could describe the resultant changes. The simplest


         98
            An early predecessor to the systematic consideration of state funding variations along with discussion of
alternative measures of the distribution of spending is Berne and Stiefel (1984).
         99
            While not emphasized here, they also demonstrate the importance of institutional structure including how
grants often have surprising effects. For example, because of the “flypaper effect,” tax reductions exhibit different
effects on spending than unconditional grants (cf. Oates (1994)).
                                                          87
model recognizes that pure distributional changes dictate a large number of losing districts that find their

state funding being decreased. To offset these changes, political incentives push toward increasing the

overall level of spending at the same time that there is a redistribution of spending. Downes and Shah

(1996) provide some evidence for this effect, although it is relatively small.

         One natural interpretation of the results is that there are simply too many different circumstances

and court rulings to imply uniform effects on spending. In fact, Hoxby (2001) pursues exactly the

characterization of alternative plans. By separating the key parameters and assessing how these differ by

states, she is able to estimate the effects of legislative and court actions on overall spending levels.

Following the earlier analyses of behavioral responses to altered incentives, she shows convincingly that the

naïve, no-behavioral-response analysis that accompanies many plan changes is very misleading.


Effect of equalization on equity

        If resource availability is not a good index of educational outcomes or if providing for overall

resource levels does not ensure a desired level of performance, the courts face the same dilemma as

legislatures. Simply providing more funding or a different distribution of funding is unlikely to improve

student achievement (even though it does affect the distribution of tax burdens for school financing across

the citizens of a state).

        A related issue—one highlighted in some recent school finance court cases—centers on whether

funding for schools is “adequate” (cf. Clune (1994)) The idea of adequacy has been to provide sufficient

funds to ensure some chosen level of achievement for all students in a state.100 Such concepts may have

popular appeal, but they have no policy superiority to traditional district equity arguments when translated

into resource requirements. First, what is adequate is a purely political and economic issue that it likely to



         100
             An important aspect of the legal and legislative discussions of adequacy is translation into expenditure.
The situation might be very different if equity and adequacy were truly defined in terms of student outcomes, but in
such a situation there would be little way of ensuring any given distribution of performance – making judicial or
legislative mandates generally impossible.
                                                           88
change both with the demands of the economy and with political views on appropriate levels of government

support of programs. Second, and more important, the previous conclusion that resources are not a good

index of student performance holds no matter what goals are placed for student achievement or how these

goals are arrived at. Thus, there is no objective method of indicating what resources are required for an

‘adequate’ level of student performance.101

       A variation of this general adequacy theme is to argue that, while resources alone may not be

sufficient to guarantee achievement, adequate resources are surely necessary. Undoubtedly, this is an

accurate statement at some level, because a school with no funds would not be expected to add anything to

student achievement. Nonetheless, as shown in Table 5 for the United States, real spending per student rose

dramatically between 1900 and 1995, even though U.S. student performance appears to have been

essentially unchanged. Further, nothing in the previous analytical results about the effects of resources

suggests that there is a level below which resources have clear and powerful effects on achievement—which

would be a demonstration that some schools are below the threshold of ‘necessity.’ Just asserting that there

is some level of necessary expenditure does not make the case for pure resource policies in today’s

schooling environment.

        Analyses considering spending variations do not, for the reasons previously described, give direct

information about any effects on student performance. Perhaps surprisingly given the extent of legal actions

during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, there has been little direct analysis of performance differences related

to funding equalization. Downes (1992) investigates whether the early alterations in California arising from

the Serrano v. Priest case had any impact on variations in student test performance. He finds no significant

impact on performance when he looked at variations before and after equalization of local spending.

Hanushek and Somers (2001) pursue a different tact. They consider whether variations in spending within

a state are ultimately reflected in earnings variations when the students progress into the labor market. This



        101
              See, for example, the difficulty in defining adequacy in Ladd and Hansen (1999).

analysis, a generalization of that in Card and Krueger (1992a), finds little evidence that earnings variations

correspond to earlier spending variations.102 These findings are consistent with the earlier evidence that

suggested no consistent improvement in student performance from changes in funding.

         One of the impacts of court cases has been increased centralization of funding. Particularly during

the 1970s, the average share of funding coming from the state level rose and surpassed the share at the local

level. Centralization of funding itself could have implications for both funding levels and performance. As

funding responsibility moves from the locality to higher levels of government, individuals are more

detached from the taxing and spending decisions and standard free rider problems increase. The arguments

for this position are largely conceptual (e.g., Hoxby (1996a)). The direct empirical analysis typically must

confront the concerns about aggregation bias raised previously when they rely on evidence across states

(e.g., Walberg and Walberg III (1994); Peltzman (1993)). Indirect evidence on reactions to changes over

time, however, provides additional support. Specifically, movements toward more centralization of state

finance have been related to efforts to control overall levels of spending by Fischel (1989), Silva and

Sonstelie (1995), and Courant and Loeb (1997). The argument is that, in reaction to state court decisions to

equalize spending, California voters supported Proposition 13 that placed strict limits on levels of taxes and

spending.103 A similar analysis by Loeb (2001), simulating the effects different financing systems, shows

that the amount of local control of supplementation can have dramatic impacts on the level and distribution

of spending across districts and that these effects are very dependent on the distribution of local

preferences.104



         102
            The Hanushek and Somers analysis concentrates on the within state variance in funding and the
subsequent variations in earnings of people educated in a given state. Thus, it avoids the largest problems associated
with differences in state policy environments, as discussed previously.
         103
             Related work on the causes and consequences of tax limitation initiatives have also had a component of
looking at student performance in addition to the more common study of the effects on spending and its composition.
See Figlio (1997) and the discussion there.
         104
           An innovation in this work is relaxing a common assumption that there is perfect sorting by income,
which allows her to base simulations on the observed wealth distributions of school districts.

Mobility, Distribution, and Equilibrium

        One very significant problem in considering state financing of schools is that the analysis generally

assumes that districts and their residents are fixed. Additionally, it is often assumed that property wealth –

the common basis for local taxation – is an acceptable index of the economic well-being of a jurisdiction’s

population. These assumptions prove to be very problematic but difficult to deal with in any complete

fashion (Hanushek (1991)).

        If the property tax base just incorporated residential property, the tax base would be a reasonable

measure of the economic well-being of the population, but the inclusion of commercial and industrial

property in the tax base breaks this relationship. Thus, for example, some cities have large proportions of

their students in poverty even though they have large tax bases (e.g., New York City) while other cities have

large poverty populations and small tax bases (e.g., Newark, New Jersey). Most of the funding formulae

emphasize the local ability of districts to raise funds, but often incorrectly suggest that this is synonymous

with poverty. Moreover, the tax advantage of having large amounts of commercial and industrial property

in a city will, to the extent that potential tax revenues exceed the costs of providing public services to these

properties, be capitalized into the value of residential properties. Thus, two identical properties located in

jurisdictions with different tax capacities will sell for different amounts.

        Additionally, as discussed previously, communities that have good schools will generally be more

desirable than schools with bad schools, and housing prices will be bid up in places with good schools

(Kain and Quigley (1975), Rosen and Fullerton (1977), Black (1999), Weimer and Wolkoff (2001)).105 In

other words, residents in school districts with larger capitalization of school quality are actually paying more

for their schools than is apparent by a simple comparison of tax rates to support schools. This variation in

capitalization also has apparent feedbacks to the quality of schools, since schools in more competitive areas

tend to have more effective schools (Hoxby (2000a), Hanushek and Rivkin (forthcoming)). The overall


        105
              The capitalization relationships are complicated by variations in the efficiency of schools in producing

                                                            91
endogeneity of the tax base is ignored in most considerations of school finance policy – both legislatively

and judicially.

        Behind the capitalization of aspects of tax base and schools into housing prices is the choice of

communities and mobility of residents. The high level of mobility in school age population underscores the

levels of potential adjustment to school cost and quality that occurs regularly.106 If thought of in terms of

the different possible margins of adjustment, as in the exit and voice of Hirschman (1970), it also highlights

the equilibrium nature of school finance policy and changes in such policy. Thus, for example, a change in

school funding by a state would set in motion a pattern of changed housing values, altered residential and

school choices, and adjusted spending and performance patterns of schools. The resulting equilibrium

outcomes in terms of the distribution of expenditure and performance patterns across the population are not

easy to project.

        Several research programs have addressed various aspects of this general equilibrium problem and

have provide insights into the effects of different fiscal policies. An early and interesting line of work,

although following a different path than here, involves understanding the effects of financing mechanisms

on economic growth (Glomm and Ravikumar (1992, 1998)). This work concentrates on how public and

private schooling interact with economic growth. Their analysis of endogenous growth models suggests a

trade-off between higher per capita incomes with private schools and more equality with public schools. By

explicitly considers voting and public choice mechanisms, they also suggest that voters are likely to choose

public schools.

        Fernandez and Rogerson (1996, 1997, 1998)develop calibrated models of schooling and labor

market outcomes that incorporate different jurisdictions. This apparatus allows investigation of different


any quality of outcomes; see Somers (1998).
        106
             Hanushek, Kain, and Rivkin (2001a) describe school mobility and its effects on achievement.
Interestingly, the detailed consideration of moving causes in the Current Population Survey does not attempt to
investigate whether moving behavior is related to public services or schools; see Schacter (2001a, 2001b). For within
county movers, 26 percent move for family-related reasons, 6 percent for work-related reasons, and 65 percent for
housing-related reasons.

financing schemes, and the complete characterization of individuals in the economy permits welfare

comparisons derived from different financing schemes. While the exact welfare comparisons appear

dependent upon the key parameters of their economy, they develop a structure that identifies how individual

behavior responds to changing in financing schemes. A key insight from their work is that it is difficult to

predict the impact of different financing schemes on the level of educational spending from a partial

equilibrium setting. In their models, however, the schooling sector itself is very simple (efficient provision

of public education depending just on spending), making it impossible to trace out implications of policy for

the schooling sector.

        Epple and Romano (1996, 1998, forthcoming) develop more detailed models of household location

that interact consumer choices and schooling outcomes. A central element of their analyses is variations in

school quality that depend on peers in the school, leading to an externality from high ability students.

Households of different incomes with children of different abilities seek out communities that maximize

utility. The presence of a private sector supported by vouchers permits the private schools to internalize the

externality of high ability students, but the exact solution depends on the size of the voucher. Epple and

Romano (1998) sets out the basic properties of equilibrium including the key predictions that private

schools will trade off income and ability, private tuitions declining in ability, and a strict hierarchy of

schools. Epple and Romano (forthcoming) turn to the alternative of public school choice and traces out

equilibrium models of neighborhood choice, showing that residential stratification is a likely result that

interacts with tax and expenditure policies.

        In a series of papers, Nechyba (1999, 2000, 2001, forthcoming-a, forthcoming-b) develops rich

models of the interplay of residential location, school policies, and segregation. Much of the discussion of

private schools, for example, suggests that segregation of schools is a likely result, but these discussions

ignore the current incentives to segregate in communities. Nechyba (2000) shows that vouchers work in

part to severe the link between residential location and schools. As a result, the pressures to segregate in



                                                        93
residential communities are lessened, and vouchers produce less segregation than a pure public school

system. Nechyba (forthcoming-b) introduces private schools in the absence of vouchers, mirroring the

observed U.S. equilibrium, and – even in the absence of vouchers – a private school alternative is shown to

reduce segregation more than a completely centralized (and equalized) system. Nechyba (forthcoming-a)

further explores the interaction of public school efficiency, private schools, and schooling choice, again

showing that the general equilibrium responses differ markedly from simple partial equilibrium predictions.

         Each of these approaches necessarily concentrates on some specific issues, while highly simplifying

others. At the same time, each demonstrates vividly that the general equilibrium can differ quite

dramatically from the partial equilibrium results. As more experience is gained in these models, they can

enrich their descriptions of behavior and can provide important insights about central issues in the financing

of schools.



                                      Some Underexplored Topics
         While much has been learned about publicly provided education, a variety of important issues

remain underresearched. Most of these are apparent from replaying the prior discussions of what is

currently known. Therefore, this discussion is designed to highlight a few areas rather than to develop the

areas in any depth.

         Perhaps at the top of the list is the behavior of consumers in the face of public provision of schools.

If schools are inefficient in their use of public funds, why is consumer and voter behavior so ineffective?

Attention to consumer behavior and to underlying issues of political economy has focused almost

exclusively on issues of the level of spending, ignoring questions of the results of spending.107

Understanding the elements of citizen behavior is important for both positive theories of spending and for

consideration of the feasibility of alternative policy regimes.


         107
            Exceptions include Somers (1998) and Pritchett and Filmer (1999). Somers considers how school
efficiency and consumer demands interact in determining spending levels and patterns of districts. Pritchett and
Filmer consider how self-interest of school decision makers affects patterns of inefficiency.
                                                         94
        The incentive structure of schools is the keystone to educational policy, but little headway has been

made in understanding this more generally. Many reform proposals – from expanded consumer choice to

heightened accountability systems – involve direct attempts to change incentives. Nonetheless, existing

research, which has generally relied upon the few natural experiments with different incentives, remains

very rudimentary. The empirical analyses typically relate to very specific programs whose generalizability

is not well understood. The conceptual work is even farther behind, failing in general to develop much of a

vocabulary or taxonomy for incentive schemes and thus leaving open a wide range of important

measurement issues. In a larger political view, current participants clearly have preferences over a variety

of the potential incentive schemes and exert influence on both their adoption and their evolution – and

understanding the political aspects of program development is important. Pressures for changes in

incentives currently being contemplated or implemented, however, open large new areas for research.

        As discussed throughout, the analysis has been heavily weighted toward studies of the United States

experience. This slant to research is particularly unfortunate, because international schooling offers a very

wide range of experiences. The variations in organization, funding, and institutions that are found

internationally offer promise for resolving some of the questions that have not been fully addressed within

the more limited U.S. experience.

        The analysis of schooling policies generally pays little attention to the array of policies and

influences outside of school: daycare, preschool, after school programs, extracurricular activities, and the

like. These facets of children’s development are typically treated independent of schools in both analytical

and policy discussions, even though they undoubtedly interact with schools and should be considered in a

larger optimizing framework for governmental programs.
