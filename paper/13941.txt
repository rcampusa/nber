Using the internal March CPS, we create and in this paper distribute to the larger research community
a cell mean series that provides the mean of all income values above the topcode for any income source
of any individual in the public use March CPS that has been topcoded since 1976. We also describe
our construction of this series. When we use this series together with the public use March CPS, we
closely match the yearly mean income levels and income inequalities of the U.S. population found
using the internal March CPS data.

1. Introduction

       The public use version of the March Current Population Survey (CPS) is the primary data

source used by public policy researchers and administrators to investigate yearly trends in

average income and its distribution in the United States. The public use March CPS is a large

nationally representative sample of households collected each March, since 1942, by the U.S.

Census Bureau.1 Its detailed questions on the employment and income sources of household

members make it an extremely valuable resource for tracking long term trends in the economic

well-being of Americans. However, to protect the confidentiality of its respondents, the U.S.

Census Bureau censors the income of individuals above specified topcoded levels in the public

use March CPS data that it makes available to the outside research community. The impact of

U.S. Census Bureau topcoding procedures on measured wage earnings and income inequality for

the population as a whole have been explored by Feng, Burkhauser, and Butler [4] and

Burkhauser, Feng, and Jenkins [2].

       In 2006 we were granted permission by the U.S. Census Bureau to use the internal March

CPS to test the sensitivity of measured income and income inequality in the public use CPS to

alternative methods of providing information on topcoded values. And to then provide

researchers without access to the internal March CPS data with our best method of capturing

information on these topcoded values from the internal data, without unduly risking the

confidentially of CPS respondents. Using the internal March CPS data we create and in this

paper distribute to the larger research community a cell mean series extending back to 1976 that

provides the mean of all income values above the topcode for any income source of any

individual in the public use March CPS that has been topcoded.2 Our cell mean series, which




                                                2
includes years from 1976-2002, can then be used in conjunction with cell means provided by the

Census Bureau for later years to create a complete set of cell means from 1976-2007.

       We show that when we use this extended cell mean series together with the public use

March CPS, we are able to closely match the yearly mean income of the U.S. population found

with the internal March CPS data over the period 1976-2002. We then show that this corrected

public use March CPS does a better job of matching income inequality trends found in the

internal March CPS than those previously available in the literature.

2. Topcoding in the public use March CPS

       In the March CPS, a respondent in each household is asked a series of questions on the

sources of income of the household. Starting in 1976 they reported income from 11 sources and

since 1988 they have done so for income from 24 sources. These income sources are listed in

Appendix Table 1. While this is an effective way of capturing total household income, it

complicates efforts to protect the confidentiality of respondents and their households. Rather

than simply topcoding high total household income values in the public use March CPS, the U.S.

Census Bureau must topcode high values for each source of household income. Otherwise the

income of high-income individuals and their households could be reconstructed by summing

each individual source of income. The full list of topcode values over time in the public use CPS

are reported in Appendix Tables 2 and 3.

       Prior to 1996, the U.S. Census Bureau assigned the topcode value from that source of

income to all topcoded income values, regardless of the total income of the individual or the

individuals’ household. For example, in 1990 the topcode for Social Security income was

$29,999. Individuals reporting Social Security income above that value were assigned that




                                                3
value, even if that relatively low value in the distribution of total household income in the United

States was the only source of their household’s income.

       In 1996, rather than simply assigning the topcode value of that income source to

individuals in the public use March CPS, the U.S. Census Bureau used values from the internal

March CPS to assign a cell mean value for each topcoded labor earnings value in the public use

March CPS. In 1999, the Census Bureau started to provide cell mean values to non-

governmental non-labor earnings income sources in a similar fashion. For income from non-

labor earnings sources, these cell means provide the mean income of all topcoded individuals

from that source. For income from labor earnings sources, the U.S. Census Bureau provides

more detailed information, providing cell means conditional on the topcoded individual’s race,

gender, and employment status.

       Researchers using these cell means in conjunction with the public use March CPS will

obtain mean income values that more closely mirror those in the internal March CPS data.

Hence the U.S. Census Bureau’s cell means series has since 1996 added useful information to

the public use March CPS.

       Obviously, cell means do not provide all the information on the income of the population

topcoded in the public use data available in the internal data, since cell means can’t be used to

capture the actual dispersion of income among those at the highest end of each source of income

in the March CPS data. But cell means not only allow researchers to better track mean income

with the public use data, but also show how much income is being topcoded from each source of

income.

       Because the U.S. Census Bureau cell means series starts in 1996, using the public use

March CPS data without correcting for this major change in the reported income values of those




                                                 4
at the highest end of each of its sources of income results in a significant increase in measured

income in 1996 and beyond simply due to more accurate reporting of their income. Hence while

the use of cell means after 1996 makes the public use March CPS better conform to the internal

March CPS, not taking this improvement in measurement into account will grossly overestimate

how much actual income increased in 1996 among those at the highest income levels. And

because these topcodes occur throughout the income distribution, attempting to account for them

by simply using a 90/10 ratio will not fully control for their impact on measured income

inequality. (See Burkhauser, Feng, and Jenkins [2])

       The major increase in the accuracy of the public use March CPS in 1996 is a specific

example of the more general problem that income topcoding presents researchers interested in

measuring levels and trends in the income and income distribution of the U.S. population—

inconsistent topcode levels lead to artificial increases or decreases in mean incomes as different

fractions of the population are subject to topcoding each year. (See: Levy and Murnane [8] for an

early review of the income distribution literature and a more formal statement of this problem.)

       This is a legitimate concern since topcodes in the public use March CPS have, in general,

non-systematically increased over the past 30 years and some part of the measured increase in

income over this time in the uncorrected data is caused by topcoding capturing a larger portion of

the income distribution. Using cell means substantially alleviates this problem after 1996, since

cell means provide all the information available in the internal data on total income. As a result,

even if public topcodes are inconsistently adjusted in the public use March CPS, mean income

for the entire population in the internal March CPS can be matched with the public use data

using cell means.




                                                 5
       Despite the U.S. Census Bureau’s attempt to alleviate the problem of topcoding, their cell

means have generally been ignored by researchers studying United States long-term income

trends, since to do otherwise exacerbates time-inconsistencies by using unadjusted data before

1996 and cell mean data thereafter. Instead, researchers analyzing data that includes years prior

to 1996 use other methods of controlling for inconsistent topcoding. These methods include

measuring inequality with 90/10 ratios to avoid complications from topcoding at the top of the

distribution, truncating the data by removing the top 2.5% of wage earners (Lerman [7]), or

artificially lowering the topcodes to create a series with a constant percentage of people topcoded

in every year (Burkhauser, Butler, Feng, and Houtenville [1]). While each of these methods is

preferable to using the unadjusted data, they also have drawbacks.

       Burkhauser, Feng, and Jenkins [2] show that using 90/10 ratios may not alleviate the

problem, since individuals are topcoded by income source and not total income and therefore

topcoded individuals may fall below the 90th percentile and impact 90-10 ratios. Additionally,

any analysis of inequality based on just 2 points in the distribution will be less informative than

analyses using a Gini or Theil coefficient that incorporates more of the available data.

       As can be seen by the growing number of people in Tables 1 and 2 who are topcoded in

the public use CPS data for each income source from 1976-2007, using a truncated dataset or

dropping the topcodes to provide a consistent income series is becoming increasingly

problematic. Part of this increase in topcode counts was by design as the U.S. Census Bureau

attempted to ensure that enough people were topcoded in the public data to provide meaningful

cell means, while still protecting respondent confidentiality. The number of individuals

topcoded for secondary wages, farm, and self-employment earnings increased significantly in

1996, the year the U.S. Census Bureau lowered the topcodes for all secondary labor income




                                                 6
sources and began providing cell means. Similarly, in 1999 when cell means were first provided

for non-labor income and the topcode values for those income sources dropped, the number of

individuals topcoded from these sources spiked. However, since 1999 topcode levels have

remained unchanged but increases in income over time have led to further increases in the

number of individuals topcoded. As illustrated in Figure 1, in 2007, almost 6% of individuals in

the public use CPS had at least one income source that was topcoded, the highest rate of

topcoding since 1976. Unless public use CPS topcodes are systematically increased as income

increases, these topcodes will cut deeper into the income distribution. In that case consistent

topcoding methods will do an increasingly poorer job of capturing trends at the top of the income

distribution as they remove larger fractions of the population to maintain their consistency.

       While each of these previously employed methods improve the unadjusted public use

March CPS data, the lack of publicly available data on individuals above the topcode thresholds

prior to 1996 makes it impossible to obtain an accurate picture of long-term income trends across

the population captured in the internal March CPS. Recognizing the benefit of cell means for

replicating internal March CPS, we obtained access to the internal March CPS data and received

permission to extend the cell mean series back to 1976.

3. Procedures for Obtaining and using the Internal March CPS

       To gain access to restricted access U.S. Census Bureau data like the internal March CPS,

a researcher must submit a proposal to one of the nine U.S. Census Bureau Research Data

Centers (RDCs) describing the nature of the proposed research, the required data set and the

expected results. The research must be beneficial to the U.S. Census Bureau by, for example,

improving data quality or methods of collecting, measuring, or tabulating a survey, census, or

estimate. If the proposal is accepted, the researcher and any associates working at the RDC must




                                                 7
obtain Special Sworn Status to do so. All are bound by law to maintain confidentiality, like any

other U.S. Census Bureau employee.

       In 2006, we were granted permission through this process to use the internal March CPS

to test the sensitivity of measured income inequality in the public use CPS to alternative methods

of providing information on topcoded persons and to provide researchers without access to the

internal March CPS data with our best method of capturing information on these topcoded values

from the internal data, without unduly risking the confidentially of CPS respondents.

       We were given access to internal March CPS records from 1976-2005. These data

records include information on income above the public use topcode thresholds for respondents

in the March CPS survey. However, since our research project was limited to how topcoding

impacts measures of inequality in the United States, the files do not contain the responses to all

of the non-income related questions in the March CPS dataset. These omissions occur because

the U.S. Census Bureau limits internal data availability to data within the scope of the project.

Additionally, even the internal March CPS data, which are not subject to top coding, have been

censored to various degrees over time.

       This censoring was initially implemented in the internal March CPS due to data-storage

limitations in the computing systems of the 1970s which necessitated truncating written records

to 5 digits. While these data storage limitations are no longer a concern, the internal censoring of

income values has continued, partially due to concerns about data reliability of individuals who

report an extremely high income value and partially due to continuing concerns over

confidentially. Thus, the U.S. Census Bureau does not maintain any versions of the internal

March CPS data that are not subject to this form of censoring.3 The internal March CPS data we

were provided is identical in this respect to the internal March CPS data the U.S Census Bureau




                                                 8
uses to produce all official United States income statistics. The extent to which censoring exists

in this internal data can be seen in Appendix Tables 4 and 5, which provide the censoring levels

in the internal data for each income source over time. (See Feng, Burkhauser, and Butler [4] for

a discussion of the problem of censorship in the internal March CPS labor earnings series and

Welniak [11] and Burkhauser, Feng, and Jenkins [2] for a similar discussion for all sources of

income.)

       While our data agreement allows us to freely explore the internal March CPS data in our

file within the purview of our project, U.S. Census Bureau data confidentiality requirements limit

the level of detail of our findings that we can release to the broader research community. Our

results, like almost all publicly released data products were reviewed by the U.S. Census Bureau

Disclosure Review Board (DRB) to ensure that they were consistent with its disclosure policies.

Six members of the DRB represent the U.S. Census Bureau’s demographic, decennial, and

economic directorates, and its RDCs. An additional three members represent the research and

policy areas. Although our data went through the standard review procedure and had to be

approved by this board before its release, occasionally exceptions are made to this review policy,

which are outlined in Zayatz [12].

       In order to release data, we were required to send a memo to the chair of the DRB

accompanied by the DRB checklist, the questionnaire from the survey or census, a list of

variables of interest, a record layout (if microdata), table outlines (if tabular data), and on

occasion some cross tabulations of the variables of interest. The DRB checklist asks basic

questions about the content of the data file to be released and also has sections for microdata,

frequency count data, and magnitude data. This procedure helps to ensure consistency in the

DRB’s decision making process.




                                                   9
        Topcoding of the public use March CPS is one of the DRB’s main tools for protecting the

confidentiality of respondents. While the DRB is not responsible for setting the actual topcode

levels in the public use March CPS, they do provide the guidelines that dictate what fraction of

individuals must be topcoded from each income source before confidentiality becomes

compromised. These guidelines state that either 3% of individuals with positive income from an

income source must be topcoded or 0.5% of all individuals including those without income from

the source must be topcoded – whichever results in fewer individuals topcoded. In practice, for

all income sources other than primary labor earnings, topcoding 3% of individuals with positive

income from an income source will result in fewer individuals topcoded – so this is the rule that

is used most often. However for some income sources these guidelines have been waived thus

permitting a smaller fraction of the population to be topcoded.

        Since topcoding is an important element of the U.S. Census Bureau’s confidentiality

policies, in our requests to release cell mean information about topcoded individuals, it was

always necessary to ensure that no personal income information could be identified from the data

we released. The general guideline for releasing information on topcoded individuals is that any

means must be based on at least 3 topcoded responses, and in many cases a minimum threshold

of 5 is used. These means can be released at the national level, state level, or even for a

subgroup of the population with a given geographic level as long as the threshold is met. The

DRB has stated that the mean, median, and standard deviation of the topcoded values may be

released if there are at least 5 topcoded values and in doing so, the mean and median should be

rounded to 2 significant digits. In addition, quantiles of the topcoded values may be released if

there are at least 10 topcoded values in each quantile and if the quantile bounds are rounded to 2

significant digits.




                                                 10
       These guidelines prohibited us from releasing cell means for income sources with less

than 5 individuals. However, in this case, we were permitted to combine such an income source

with another one in order to create a cell mean based on 5 or more individuals.

       Even when our cell means were based on 5 or more observations, the DBR further

limited their release if they could be combined with other previously released cell means to

induce the actual income of a specific person. For example, this could occur if we had

previously released a file including the mean of 6 topcoded values and requested the release of

the mean of 5 of these values. Given those two means, the exact value of the remaining

respondent could be deduced and hence release of the mean of 5 would be prohibited based on

the DRB guidelines.

       Since 1996, the U.S. Census Bureau started to provide cell means for earnings sources in

the public use March CPS. To mitigate potential disclosure concerns associated with our cell

mean series, for these years we use their identical cell definitions, taking particular note of which

cells are combined to achieve groups of 5 or more individuals when less than 5 people are

topcoded from an income source. Prior to 1996, such issues were of less concern since no

comprehensive cell mean information had been released.

4. The Extended Public Use March CPS Cell Mean Series

       Since the U.S. Census Bureau topcodes individuals in the public use March CPS on each

separate income source, we calculated cell means for each source of income separately—11 prior

to 1988 and 24 since then. In addition, mirroring U.S. Census Bureau practices in their cell

means releases since 1996, our cell means are weighted mean incomes of all individuals above

the topcode value for the source for all non-labor earnings income sources. And for all labor

earnings sources, the cell means are the weighted mean incomes of individuals with income




                                                 11
above the topcoded, conditional on the individual’s race, gender, and employment status. The

cell mean values for 1976-1987 are provided in Tables 3 through 6 and for 1988-2002 in Tables

7 through 11. Although we only provide cell means through 2002, a comparison of our cell

means since the U.S. Census Bureau began releasing them in 1996 illustrate that our cell means

series is virtually identical to those they release. Thus, the cell means we provide can be used in

conjunction with cell means produced by the U. S. Census Bureau in years since 2002 to provide

a full set of cell means dating back to 1976.

       While our cell mean creation methods described above closely follow those of the U.S.

Census Bureau there are small differences. In contrast to the U.S. Census Bureau, we adjusted

the treatment of individuals who have income exactly at the topcode level in order to better

conform to the public use March CPS data. In the U.S. Census Bureau cell mean series,

individuals who have income exactly at the topcode level are not considered to have been

topcoded because the topcode is not binding. However, prior to 1996, individuals whose income

is exactly at the topcode level are listed in the public use March CPS data as having the same

level of income as those whose income is above the topcode and hence are bound by it.

       As a result, when using just the public use March CPS income records, it can’t be

determined who among those with income listed at the topcode threshold had income that was

bound by it and whose actual income was exactly at the topcode value. If we had used the

current U.S. Census Bureau method of only including individuals who have income above the

topcode value in their cell means, this would have limited the ability of researchers to use our

extended cell mean series with the public use March CPS data.

       Therefore, for years prior to 1996 we instead treat individuals who have income exactly

at the topcode as topcoded and include their income in the cell means. For many years there is




                                                12
no difference between these two approaches as no individuals have reported incomes exactly at

the topcode value. Hence this distinction is relevant only in years where topcodes are round

numbers so clustering in reported values occurs at the topcode level. The actual number of

individuals whose reported income is the same as the topcode is provided in Appendix Table 6.

       Starting in 1996, when the U.S. Census Bureau introduced cell means, income for

individuals who face a binding topcode constraint are listed with their cell mean income in the

public use data, so they can be distinguished from individuals for whom the topcode does not

bind by users of the public use data. Thus, starting in 1996 we follow the census technique and

only include individuals with income greater than the topcode level in our cell means.

       The second deviation from the method described above occurs when less than 5

individuals are topcoded from a non-labor income source or from a demographic group within

that income source for a labor earnings source. For confidentiality reasons, the U.S. Census

Bureau would not allow us to release cell means for these groups. Instead, we combined 2 or

more cells to achieve a group of at least 5 individuals. We then provide the mean of topcoded

incomes from this combined cell. This is the same procedure for handling small cells used by

the U.S. Census Bureau in the cell means they have released in recent years (2007 CPS Annual

Social and Economic Supplement Technical Documentation).

       For labor earnings sources we used the current U.S. Census Bureau convention of

combining demographic groups with less than 5 topcoded individuals into a single cell for that

income source. If there were still less than 5 individuals, we combined it with the next smallest

cell from the same income source to achieve a cell with more then 5 people.

       For non-labor income sources, it was necessary to combine observations across sources

of income. For these, we first attempted to combine similar sources of income, such as 1st and




                                                13
2nd source disability income. If there was no clear matching income source, we combined the

small cells into a single group, as was done for the labor income sources. In all cases, when we

combine cells due to the small cell size, we note it in the relevant tables.

       There are also several missing values (“N/A”) in the extended cell mean tables we

provide. Before the introduction of U.S. Census Bureau-provided cell means in 1996, missing

values indicate that no one has been topcoded from the specified source of income or fits that

demographic group. After 1996, it indicates either: (1) no one is topcoded from the income

source or (2) that the internal censoring point is equal to the public topcode so no one has income

in the internal dataset that is above the public topcode. In both cases, no new information can be

gained using internal data or the cell means series.4

5. Limitation of using the extended cell mean series

       While the extended cell mean series is useful for studies using income data from the

public use March CPS, it also has limitations. As we will show it matches the mean values in the

internal March CPS quite closely but in doing so, it reflects the same problems with censorship

of those at the highest end of each source of income and their households in the internal March

CPS. However, since this is the same data used to produce official U.S. Census Bureau

statistics, these remaining censorship problems for users of the public use March CPS data are no

worse than those used by the U.S. Census Bureau to produce its official income statistics with

the internal March CPS.

       Because our cell mean series, as well as the U.S. Census Bureau cell mean series, are

based on the internal March CPS data, these internal censoring issues limit the additional

information that the cell means provide. Specifically, one should pay careful attention to

changes in the internal censoring points which introduce trend-breaks in our cell mean series.

Since 1976, there were 3 years where internal censoring points were adjusted substantially and

thus trends at these years should be considered with caution.

       The first is 1986, when the internal censoring points for labor income sources increased

from $99,999 to $250,000. The second is 1988 when the income sources were redefined and

expanded from 11 to 24, redefining censoring points in the process. The third is 1994 when the

internal censoring points were increased from $299,999 for primary labor earnings and $99,999

for secondary labor earnings to $999,999 for all labor earnings sources. A fourth increase

occurred in 1995, when internal censoring points for primary and secondary wage earnings were

increased to $1,099,999. However in terms of consistency, very few individuals fall into this

range, so this increase is much less troublesome than the other three adjustments. (See Appendix

Tables 2-5 for the topcoded value for all sources of income.)

       In addition, because cell means are based on the internal March CPS, which is subject to

some censoring at the very top of the distribution, the cell means series do not reveal the full

scope of the U.S. income distribution. However, while the public use March CPS generally

provides complete information for only around 94-98% of the sample population, the internal

March CPS is able to provide income information for 99.0 to 99.8% of the sample distribution.

       The percentages of the population that are topcoded in the public use March CPS and

censored in the internal March CPS are illustrated in Figure 1. Since the public use March CPS

with our extended cell means series incorporates information about the incomes for all

individuals below the internal March CPS censoring points, results using this series can provide

information to researchers on the 1 to 5% of the sample population that is unobserved in the

public use March CPS without cell means but are not impacted by the internal March CPS

censoring points. Additionally, for the small fraction of individuals who are censored in the




                                                 15
internal March CPS, their cell mean value will be significantly closer to their true income than

their public topcode value.

6. Impact of using the extended cell mean series

        Below we show the added value of using our cell mean series with the public use March

CPS. We do so by first comparing mean income in the United States since 1976 using our cell

mean series with other available topcoding methods. We then do the same comparing Gini

coefficients for each year since 1976 using the other topcoding methods.

        In Table 12 we calculate mean household income using our extended cell mean series

(Cell Mean) and compare it to the public use March CPS data including the U.S. Census Bureau

cell means since 1996 series (Unadjusted), the public use March CPS data removing the U.S.

Census Bureau provided cell means since 1996 series (Adjusted), and the internal March CPS

data series (Internal).

        Thanks to cell means, the mean income of individuals in 2002 captured in the Unadjusted

data is very close to our Cell Mean data and both are very close to the values in the 2002 Internal

data. So for those only interested in evaluating the mean household income of individuals in the

United States in 2002, the current Unadjusted data or our Cell Mean data nicely capture the

means in the Internal data. And this is true for all years since 1996 when cell means were first

provided by the U.S. Census Bureau.

        But for those interested in the trends in these series prior to 1996 the Unadjusted data is

flawed because it does not provide cell means for persons above the topcoded values. Hence its

mean values are significantly smaller than those produced using the Internal data. In 1995, for

example, using the Unadjusted data will understate mean household income in the United States




                                                 16
by 5.8% when compared to mean household income using Internal data. In contrast, our Cell

Mean data provide yearly means very close to those from the Internal data for all years.

       Since topcoding may have drastically different impacts when looking at different income

sources and populations, in addition to examining the change in mean household income, we also

looked at mean labor earnings at the individual level for full-time/full-year workers. These

results are presented in Table 13. The patterns are similar to those discussed in Table 12. When

analyzing only the years after 1996, the Unadjusted and Cell Mean series both do a good job of

capturing the mean labor earnings found in the Internal data. However, prior to 1996 there is

again a significant difference between the results using the Unadjusted series and the Internal

series. In fact, the percentage difference between these series is larger than those for household

income since many of the individuals whose income is significantly over the public topcodes are

topcoded for labor earnings. In 1995, for example, using the Unadjusted data will understate

labor earnings by 7% compared to labor earnings using the Cell Mean or Internal data. In

contrast to these three series, the Adjusted series understates mean household income in every

year since it does not use cell means to adjust for top coding.

       More interesting than looking at the impact of using cell means on mean income is how

the choice of topcoding procedure impacts various measures of inequality. In Burkhauser and

Larrimore [3], we examined the impact of topcoding on one type of cross-group inequality and

find that without correcting for topcoding through the use of cell means you will understate the

drop in the economic well being of individuals with disabilities over the past two decades.

       Using cell means also impacts measures of population level inequality such as the Gini

Coefficient. In Figure 2 we report the levels and trends in size-adjusted household income for

1976-2007 based on Gini values estimated from our Cell Means, Unadjusted, Adjusted, and




                                                 17
Internal data series. As is standard when looking at household income inequality, we controlled

for household size by examining the size-adjusted household income of individuals instead of

simply their household’s total income.5 To adjust for the number of individuals in the

household, we divided the total income in the household by the square root of the number of

household members.

       Because the public use March CPS is topcoded, unless cell means are used, mean

household income and its distribution across the population (Gini values) will be understated

relative to those estimated from the internal March CPS. Since cell means provide more

information about individuals at the top of the income distribution in this topcoded data set,

using the cell mean series with the public use March CPS data will increase measured inequality

and hence increase measured inequality in the public use March CPS data.

       In all years the Adjusted series that reports only the topcode value for all those above the

topcode is below the Internal data. To correct for this difference between inequality measured

using the Adjusted and Internal Gini values, the U.S. Census Bureau introduced topcoding in

1996. The result is reflected in the difference between the Unadjusted and Adjusted values in

Figure 2. Prior to 1996 they are identical. After 1996 the Unadjusted values now equal the

Internal values and are dramatically greater than the Adjusted values. While they now better

represent the values found in the Internal data, anyone uncritically using this series to explain

changes in United States income inequality would greatly exaggerate its increase in 1996.

       Our Cell Mean series corrects this problem by accurately matching the Internal series

Gini values in all years. Hence it provides a consistent way of capturing inequality as measured

using the Internal data. But anyone uncritically using this series to explain changes in United

States income inequality would also slightly exaggerate its increase in 1986 and in 1988 when




                                                 18
there were increases to the internal censoring points and would greatly exaggerate its increase in

1994 when major changes occurred in the way the March CPS was collected including

significant changes in the internal censoring points.. All these issues are discussed in more detail

in Burkhauser, Feng, and Jenkins [2]. Hence while our cell means series provides researchers

without access to the internal March CPS data with a useful way to approximate its means and

distribution, it does not solve the problems created by censoring of the internal March CPS data

itself.

7. Conclusions and Recommendations

          The fraction of individuals who are topcoded is growing in the public use March CPS,

limiting the ability of researchers to examine trends at the top of the income distribution as well

as trends to the income distribution as a whole. While cell means can help alleviate this

problem, because the U.S. Census Bureau-provided cell mean series began in 1996, its

usefulness is restricted to income trend studies since then. Here we not only describe how we

created a cell means series beginning in1976 for the public use March CPS data using internal

March CPS data but provide that series to all researchers. We also demonstrate that this series

can be used in conjunction with the public use March CPS to provide results in a variety of

contexts that closely match those using the internal March CPS data and do so better than other

available methods in the income literature.

          Prior to the introduction of cell means, because the U.S. Census Bureau did not

systematically adjust its topcodes in the public use March CPS to the same percentile in the

income distribution each year, measured mean income and its distribution in the public use

March CPS did not consistently match such measured values using the internal March CPS data

in level or trend. The introduction of cell means has dramatically reduced this problem. All




                                                 19
income that is reported below the internal censoring levels of the internal March CPS data can

now be captured in income statistics using the public use March CPS data, thus mitigating or

eliminating the inconsistencies caused by changing public topcodes, depending on the income

statistics observed.

       However, the full implications of the introduction of cell means on U.S. Census Bureau

policies with respect to where to place topcodes each year, has not been fully considered. Prior to

the provision of cell means, it might have been reasonable to believe that researchers would

prefer that topcodes not be systematically changed each year. But that is no longer the case.

Because systematically updating topcodes each year will provide more accurate data to users of

the public use March CPS, the U.S. Census Bureau should annually update these values. In

doing so rather than maintaining consistency in the nominal value of topcodes from previous

years, new topcodes should be set at the highest possible level that both maintain confidentiality

requirements and keeps enough individuals above the topcode threshold to produce separate cell

means for each non-labor income source.

       The U.S. Census Bureau’s effort to maintain consistency in the nominal values of its

topcodes has resulted in information being censored in the public use March CPS far in excess of

the DRB’s requirements for protecting the confidentiality of respondents. In recent years, over

5% of respondents with positive income in the public use March CPS have been topcoded for

secondary wage, labor, and farm earnings as well as from some non-labor income sources. This

is the case even though the DRB’s confidentiality requirements only require 3% of these

individuals to be topcoded. Given that there is no significant cost to providing full information

about individuals’ incomes up to the 3% threshold set by the DRB, the U.S. Census Bureau

should increase the topcodes for these income sources to this threshold.




                                                20
       A second factor the U.S. Census Bureau should consider in updating its topcodes is the

effect that these changes will have on its ability to provide cell means for each income source.

An increase in topcodes allows researchers to observe the true income of more individuals.

Additionally, as the remaining group who are topcoded shrinks, their cell mean better estimates

each of their reported incomes. However, this gain in information is offset to some degree if the

new topcode reduces the remaining group below 5, since this cell mean must be merged with the

cell mean from another income source to protect data confidentiality.

       For non-labor earnings, adjusting the topcode for one source of income has no effect on

the topcode level for other income sources. Thus, it is relatively easy to lower the topcode for a

single source of income to ensure that at least 5 individuals are topcoded and a separate cell

mean can be produced. Since there are benefits to having source-specific cell means, we urge

the U.S. Census Bureau to consider adjusting the public topcodes for each income source

annually with the topcode set at the highest possible income point for that income source without

lowering the population who are topcoded to below 5, except when this could unduly risk the

confidentially of respondents.

       For labor income sources where demographic sub-cells are provided, avoiding

combinations across sub-cells is still beneficial but the cost of doing so is much greater. While

the topcode for a non-labor income source can be dropped just enough to topcode an additional

one or two individuals and hence produce a separate cell mean for a given non-labor income

source, if the topcode is lowered for a labor income source to provide a separate cell mean for

one demographic group, the topcode must be lowered for all demographic groups from that labor

source. As a result, obtaining this separate cell mean for labor income demographic groups may

come at the cost of topcoding dozens of additional people. Thus, for labor income sources, the




                                                21
U.S. Census Bureau should focus on setting topcodes at the highest possible levels even if it

requires combining additional demographic groups for that labor income source when producing

cell means.

       The U.S. Census Bureau should also make the general public more aware of the problem

of inconsistent censoring in the internal March CPS, now that the public use March CPS is better

able to match internal March CPS income levels and trends. Even using our cell mean series, the

public use March CPS will still reflect time-inconsistencies caused by different levels of

censoring in the internal March CPS data over time. The U.S. Census Bureau should consider

keeping the point where these internal censoring points hit the distribution of income for a given

income source consistent over time. This is especially true since the lack of publicly available

March CPS data around these internal censoring points limits researchers’ ability to self-generate

consistent trends when topcodes increase. Additionally, given their increased importance, it

would be prudent to include the internal censoring levels in the documentation files for the

public use March CPS along with the public topcode levels. Doing so in a more prominent way

would better alert users of the public use March CPS to changes in these levels that could

influence the consistency of these data over time.

       Despite these caveats, the cell means series provided to researchers in this paper through

the cooperation of the U.S. Census Bureau is of great value to the research community. When

used with the public use March CPS it will allow researchers to closely match the mean and the

distribution of income of the internal March CPS data for all March CPS years since 1976. No

other publicly available data set provides such a long term look at trends in income and income

distribution in the United States.

A
  - Indicates that there are not enough observations to report a cell mean for this population group in this year. The reported cell mean is a combined cell mean
with the other footnoted population groups in the same year.
B
  - Indicates that the internal censoring point is identical to the public cell mean so no additional information can be obtained from the internal data.
C
  - Interest income in 1984 does not properly match between the internal and the public data. This cell mean is based on the 25 individuals with interest income
at or above $75,000 topcode threshold in the internal data, not just the 11 people who are listed as topcoded for interest income in the public data.
N/A – Indicates that no individual with these demographic characteristics were topcoded in this year from the specified income source

Note: In parentheses below each variable name is the mnemonic for the income source from the March Current Population Survey Technical Documentation.

Note: In the 1985 March CPS (income year 1984), six values for INCOMP exceeded $29,999 but were not top coded. In the calculations we did for this paper we
corrected this error and top coded these values at $29,999.

ENDNOTES
1
    Each year the U.S. Census Bureau releases its yearly average income and poverty rates from the March CPS using

these data [9]. These official values are based on the internal March CPS data that is not available, except under

certain conditions, to researchers outside of the U.S. Census Bureau.



2
    Each CPS survey captures income from the previous year. In this paper all references are to the survey year, so

when we discuss the year 1976, this refers to income from various sources that members of the household received

in 1975 reported on the March 1976 Current Population Survey.

3
    There are two versions of the March CPS internal data. Both include information on income above the public use

topcode thresholds for respondents. But each is subject to some degree of censoring and thus do not include actual

incomes for the highest income earners. The data records we were provided include actual incomes in the March

CPS survey up to the processing limit in the March CPS data. This is the same version of the internal March CPS

data that the U.S. Census Bureau uses in it official publications (e.g. U.S. Census [9]). However, these processing

limits are lower than the data collection limits for income in the March CPS. That is, the limits on the actual values

collected in the March CPS (See Welniak [11] for a more complete discussion of the processing limits and data

collection limits).

4
    Most of the U.S. Census Bureau procedures for creating cell means for topcoded values in the public use March

CPS data can be found in the 2007 Current Population Survey Annual Demographic File Technical Documentation

[10], but in some cases we learned about them via conversations with various U.S. Census Bureau employees

charged with creating the cell means.



5
    We follow the same procedure for generating size-adjusted household income as discussed in Burkhauser and

Larrimore, 2008. Also see Gottschalk and Smeeding [5] for a review of the general income distribution literature

and Gottschalk and Danziger [6] for a more detailed discussion of these usual assumptions made in this literature.
