                                            ABSTRACT

In this paper we assess the effects of the MFA/ATC using both world trade and US data after its
removal. Previous literature assesses its effects while in operation. The trade data we analyze are
consistent with theoretical predictions of more trade volumes, lower product prices, smaller effect
of RTA on trade, less transshipment and quota hopping investment, and higher country concentration
of exporters. We also find the effects of the MFA on clothing trade were more significant than for
textiles trade. The benefits from freer trade in textiles and clothing shed light on other sectors that
are still under trade protection.

1. Introduction and Background




During its 20 years of operation, and following the earlier Short and Long Term

Agreements on Cotton Textiles, the Multi Fiber Agreement (MFA) was the subject of

study by many trade economists (Evans and Harrigan, 2005; Rotunno, 2013; Dayaratna

and Whalley, 2007; Khandelwal, Schott and Wei, 2013; etc.). Although terminated in

2005 under the WTO Agreement on Textile and Clothing (ATC), its effects lingered for

some years, in part through Transitional Safeguards Arrangements with China (and

others). As a system of quota restrictions on the growth rate of trade its effects as a

global system of trade restrictions bear study given the prevalence of other remaining

quota restrictions worldwide, most notably in agricultural products such as cheese and

sugar.




The list of the effects of the MFA include reduced volumes of trade, higher prices for

restricted products, quality upgrading, trans-shipment to avoid quota, quota hopping

foreign investment, internal quota allocation schemes, and others. In contrast to

analyses of these effects generated from data when the MFA was in operation, here we

attempt to use data after the 2005 termination of the MFA instead to gauge these effects

as they are progressively removed. How clearly identifiable are they in available data?

How strong are the various effects? How long is the adjustment period to a MFA free

world for each of them?




                                           2
In this paper, we use both world and U.S. trade data generated after the termination of

the Multi Fiber Agreement (MFA) to access its effects. Textiles and Clothing was a

special sector in world trade in the age of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade

(GATT), since trade in this sector was governed by the Multi Fiber Agreement (MFA).

From 1974 onwards the MFA allowed for quotas restrictions on growth rates of trade

in cotton, wool and man-made fibers. By the end of the second MFA (1981), most

exports from developing countries to the United States and the EU countries were

covered by bilateral quota agreements restraining the growth rate of trade. These

violated the spirit of the nondiscrimination principle in the GATT multilateral system,

but the MFA was renegotiated four times and finally expired at the end of 1994. Six

developed countries applied quotas during the final year of the MFA (1994): the EU,

Austria, Canada, Finland, Norway and the United States1.




The MFA quota system did not end with the expiration of the MFA. From January 1,

1995 on when the WTO began, there was a ten year transitional period under the

Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC). Four countries continued with MFA quota

restrictions in the ATC: Canada, the EU, Norway and the United States, until January

1, 2005 from when onwards textiles and clothing trade has been under the general rules

of the WTO.




The reason for such special treatment in the WTO is in that the textiles and clothing



1   Austria and Finland joined the EU in January 1, 1995, but in 1994 they were not EU members.
                                                           3
sector is important not only for developing countries, but also for developed countries.

In the European Union, for example, the textiles and clothing sector is dominated by

small and medium-sized enterprises concentrated in a number of regions that are highly

dependent on the sector. (Nordas, 2004) The US textile manufacturers produce yarn,

thread, and fabric for apparel, home furnishings, and various industrial applications. In

2013, the U.S. textile industry generated nearly $57 billion in shipments and directly

employed about 230,700 workers, accounting for approximately 2% of all US factory

jobs 2 . To the developing countries, the textiles and clothing industry offers

industrialization and jobs for unskilled workers, including women who previously have

no other income opportunities. Many emerging economics have taken this sector as

their first step to industrialization, including Korea, China, and Viet Nam.




Now ten years after 2005, we can access both the extent and speed of transition to a

quota free regime in world textiles and clothing trade. Our main findings are: 1) since

2005 the trade volume in clothing and textiles has increased more quickly than the

average for all world trade. This is consistent with expectations following the removal

of quota restrictions. The increase in world clothing trade is greater than that of world

textiles trade. 2) The average price of both clothing and textiles is lower after the quota

system expired, again consistent with expectations to the removal of quotas. 3) The

average quality of exports of clothing has fallen, as consumers were quality upgrading

under the MFA. 4) The concentration by country of world textiles and clothing exports



   2   Platzer (2014), p.1
                                            4
has increased, consistent with the removal of MFA quota hopping foreign investment.

5) The concentration by country of world imports has changed relatively little, as quota

hopping only affects the export side of trade. 6) The concentration indices of clothing

have increased significantly, while those of textiles remains relatively stable. 7) The

regional textiles and clothing trade of RTA members is smaller, since world trade in

textiles and clothing is freer. 8) clothing trade has been affected more by the removal

of the MFA quota system than textiles trade.




2. Literature and theory analysis on the effects of the MFA




Essentially the MFA/ATC is a quota system, based on restrictions on the growth rates

of exports in textiles and clothing sector. It represents a quantity restriction on trade and

from basic economic theory we can hypothesizes the following effects of the MFA.




2a) Reduced Volume of Trade




The first direct effect of MFA quota system is reduced trade volume. Evans and

Harrigan (2005) use the term “fill rate” to indicate the restrictiveness of quota, where

fill rate is defined as the percentage of a quota that is used. Higher fill rates indicate that

the quota keeps imports below what they would otherwise be. A quota with a fill rate

of 90 percent or above is defined by them as a binding quota. Evans and Harrigan (2005)

find that about 40 percent of US apparel imports came in under binding quotas

                                              5
throughout the 1990s.




2b) Higher Price for Restricted Products




With the trade volume reduced, restricted products will have a higher price in import

markets. Such a higher price is caused by two factors. One is the exporters who can get

the quota will send higher priced products to export to make full use of the scarce quota.

The other is the limited supply in the importing country which will also lead to a higher

market price. Evans and Harrigan (2005) find that the effect of quotas on prices is a

step function: for fill rates between zero and 90 percent, the effect is zero, and for fill

rates above 90 the effect is present.




2c) Quality Upgrading




A third effect is quality upgrading. When quotas are set in physical rather than volume

terms, exporters will export higher priced higher quality items. Feenstra (2004)

provides a theoretical frame for measuring quality upgrading due to quotas. There are

two causes for such quality upgrading. One is when facing quota restriction the foreign

firms will export those products that have higher quality. The other is the so called

“Washington apples” effect, which means the highest quality product will have the

smallest relative increase in quality-adjusted price when the quota is binding.




                                            6
2d) Transshipment to Avoid Quota




In order to avoid quota restrictions, some MFA exporters used the strategy of

transshipment, which means export to a third country which is less restricted by quota,

and then re-export to the final destination for import markets. Such pattern changes can

be seen in the experience of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA)

countries, which is clearly analyzed in Rotunno (2013).




2e) Quota hopping Foreign Investment




Another strategy to avoid quota restrictions is quota hopping foreign investment, which

implies investment in a third country less restricted by the quota where production of

the final product takes place and then reexport to the destination market. Dayaratna and

Whalley (2007) argue that there were “China containment agreements” in the post-MFA

regime until 2013, which were trade restrictions primarily targeted at China. The quota

restriction of China’s textile and clothing export which impeded the growth of Chinese

exports, benefited other developing countries such as Viet Nam, and brought quota-

hopping investment by China.




2f) Internal Quota Allocation Schemes




The last effect of quotas we focus on is induced internal quota allocation schemes in

                                           7
the exporting country, which including auction of export licenses, government

assignment of quota, and other rent seeking features. Trela and Whalley (1995) suggest

that schemes used within developing countries to allocate textile export quota among

domestic producers typically have more severe negative effects on developing country

economic performance than the MFA export quotas themselves. Quotas were typically

allocated to established rather than new and more efficient producers. These quota-

allocation schemes amplify the welfare loss caused by the quota. A later paper,

Khandelwal, Schott and Wei (2013) draw similar results by examining Chinese textile

and clothing exports before and after the elimination of externally imposed export

quotas.




3. Assessing the Effects of the MFA from US and World Trade Data




   We use world trade data and US trade data to assess the effects of the MFA. Some

   effects can be found by in world trade data; for example the concentration patterns

   change in exporters, but some other effects cannot easily be seen at such an

   aggregate level. For example if we want to analysis the product quality change, we

   will need the price data, which is not available in UN’s Comtrade Database.

   Therefore we must turn to country level trade data. Although the EU and Canada

   statistics also provide some trade data in textiles and clothing sector, they are not

   detailed enough or too limit in time length to be used here. The only detailed trade

   data available in country level is from US’s Office of Textiles and Apparel

                                           8
   (OTEXA), therefore we use it wherever the world data is not enough for analysis.




   3a) Overall Trends




Since 2001 the world trade volume of textiles and clothing has increased steadily. As

shown in Fig.1, in 2001 the world import value of textiles was 144.8 billion US$, while

in 2013 this has increased to 242.1 billion, with an average increase rate of 4.4%. The

trade of clothing is larger and increase quicker than textiles trade. In 2001 the trade

volume of clothing was 215.9 billion US$, and in 2013 this has nearly doubled to 404.8

billion US$, with an average increase rate of 5.4%. During the same period, the world

total import value of goods and services has increased from 9.82 trillion to 17.6 trillion

(constant 2005 US$), with an average increase rate of 4.9%.

There are two times when trade decreased during this period. The first time is in

2009, when the world economy and trade fell sharply after the global financial crisis.

The world import of textiles decreased 12.2% and import of clothing decreased 19.0%

from 2008. The second time is in 2012, with the economic contraction and Euro

crisis in the EU. This time the decrease is 5.6% in textiles and 7.7% in clothing. The

two series of textiles and clothing trade show similarity in their trends, because they

are in the same industry.




We then analysis the imports of textiles and clothing by the United States, the

biggest import country in the world. The pattern of higher growth of imports after

2005 is connected with the removal of the MFA. From Fig.2 we can see that the

U.S. imports more clothing than textiles, with the former about four to five times

larger than the latter. Clothing imports increase more quickly than textile imports in

the period 2001 to 2013; the rate of clothing import increase is 5%, while the rate

of textiles import increase is 2.5%. This is consistent with the removal of the MFA.

The variation in the rate of increase is larger in the clothing sector than in textiles.

In 2009 when the global financial crisis moved the US economy into recession,

imports of clothing dropped to 72 billion US$ from the previous year’s 82 billion.

After one year clothing imports recovered to 81 billion, and in 2011 increased to 88

billion US$. Imports of textiles were relatively stable, increasing from 19 to 27

billion US$ after 2004.

3b) Higher Prices and Quality Upgrading for Protected Products




From trade theory the average price of United States’ imports would tend to

decrease after the end of the MFA/AFC quota system. This is also in accordance

with the data. We can see in Fig.3 that the average price of US imports kept dropping

after 2001, and the import price from China fell sharply in 2002. As a comparison,

the import price from Viet Nam jumped up at the same period. Facing competition

from China, other exporters move up the price ladder. If price is a good proxy for

quality, one can also say that the average quality of US textile and clothing imports

is lower since the end of MFA/AFC quota system.

Considering the import quantity makes the pattern of change clearer. As Fig.4

shows, the import quantity of the US from China kept increasing between 2001 and

2004, which is an outcome of a higher quota cap. After 2005 the rate of increase is

higher, except during the 2008 global crisis. Viet Nam did not join the WTO system

in this period, therefore its export quantity did not increase much. Facing

competition from China, Viet Nam had to move into the higher ladder of product

quality, and its export price increased significantly. After 2005, the import quantity

from NAFTA dropped quickly.

3c) Transshipment and Quota Hopping Foreign Investment




Another change following the expiration of the MFA quota system is the end of

quota-hopping investment and transshipment in textile and clothing trade. Such

changes can be seen clearly in the experience of the African Growth and

Opportunity Act (AGOA) countries.




Began in 2001, the AGOA enabled some less developed African countries to export

hundreds of apparel products quota-free and duty-free to the United States.

Although the AGOA trade preferences had a positive and significant impact on

African apparel exports to the US, they did not survive the demise of the MFA/ATC

quota system in 2005, and since then China has taken over the US market.




                                                      13
As pointed out by Rotunno (2013), a key feature of the AGOA preference was the

absence of rules of origin (ROOs), which are usually imposed under regional trade

agreements to avoid transshipment. Therefore the easiest way for these

underdeveloped countries to export to the US is to import directly from other

countries and transship them. In Fig.5 we analyze the nine countries which started

AGOA apparel exports before the end of 2002, Botswana, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi,

Mauritius, Namibia, South Africa, Uganda and Tanzania. The increase in their

exports to the US between 2003 and 2005 was accompanied by an increase of

imports from China. After 2005 their exports to the US kept decreasing until 2009,

and so was their import from China. We can speculate that some of their apparel

import from China was transshipped to the US during the last years of MFA/ATC

quota system, when these AGOA countries were free from quota restriction to

export to the US.

                                                               14
Such a pattern change is more significant in individual countries, for example

Botswana, Namibia and Uganda. As in Fig.6, their export to the US jumped

significantly when they entered the AGOA, but fall sharply following the expiration

of the MFA quota system in 2005. Since a country’s industry structure and export

ability cannot fluctuate so dramatically, a reasonable explanation for this pattern

change is that these countries largely transshipped other countries’ exports to the

US.

3d) The Textile and Clothing Trade of RTA Members is Smaller




Before the end of the MFA/AFC quota system in 2005, there were many RTAs

which provide bilateral tariff reduction or quota-free access in the textile and

clothing sector. An example is the NAFTA rules, under which Mexico could access

                                                 15
the US market more easily, while Chinese exporters were restricted by quota. After

the end of the quota system, Mexico has no preferential advantage to China, and its

clothing export to the US dropped quickly.

From Fig.7 we can see that, Mexico’s clothing export to the US decreased rapidly

after 2005, and were only stable after 2009 at a relative low level. In comparison,

Mexico’s clothing exports to Germany, where it did not have a preferential RTA

during the MFA/AFC quota system, do not show such a clear decrease.




The Geographic Patterns of US imports show a similar change. Although a detailed

analysis on the change of the top 20 exporters in the thirteen years will be

illuminating on the geographic patterns, but this will make the table too large to

place here. We only report the change of top 5 exporters in five selected years, as in

                                                          16
            Table 1. We can see clearly that China is the biggest beneficial country, with her

            proportion increased from 13% to about 40% in both sectors. Asian exporters

            moved up, for example in 2013 India was the second largest exporter in textiles,

            and Viet Nam was the second largest in clothing export. Canada and Mexico, which

            are beneficiary from the NAFTA regional trade agreement, are moving down in the

            ladders.

            value of American exporters and Asia exporters respectively, and compute the

the quota expiration in 2005.

3e) Concentration by country of world imports




Now we turn to analysis the concentration pattern of world textiles and clothing

trade. In this and the following section we use the data of the world, instead of the

US trade data, since the US itself is one of the most important traders in the world

and an analysis omitting US will be meaningless.




The top 10 importers of textiles have changed significantly since 2001. As shown

in Fig.9, comparing 2013 and 2001 while the US and China remain the two largest

importers in the world, Viet Nam jumps to the fourth largest importer, Turkey enters

as tenth, while France and Mexico fall out of the top 10.

The top 10 importers in clothing trade have changed relatively little, as shown in

Fig.10. The top 7 does not changed, the United States, Germany, Japan, UK, France,

Hong Kong, and Italia, with only Hong Kong falling from fourth in 2001 to sixth

in 2013. From the eighth to tenth, Belgium is replaced by Canada, Spain moves

forward to eighth, with Netherland remains at ninth. The volume of top 10 importers

accounts for about 70% of world total.

    Importantly, the import concentration of the largest top 10 and top 5 importers keeps

    decreasing. As shown in Fig.11, from 2001 to 2013, the top 10 concentration index4

    of textiles import (textiles10) dropped from 0.56 to 0.50, and the top 10

    concentration index of clothing import (clothing10) dropped more from 0.79 to 0.68.

    The falls of the top 5 concentration indices are larger. From 2001 to 2013, the top 5

    concentration index for textile imports (textiles5) dropped from 0.38 to 0.34, and

    the top 5 concentration index for clothing import (clothing5) dropped more from

    0.64 to 0.52.




4 The top 10 concentration index is computed as the share of top 10 importers as a proportion of world imports

in a particular year, while the top 5 index is the top 5 importers as a share of world.

The fall in world import concentration means that the import pattern of world

textiles and clothing trade had become more diversified by the end of the global

quota regime, which can be the result of the improvement of equity in world GDP

per capita. Most textile and clothing products belong to a product whose share in

consumers’ total spending tend to decrease when their income increases. Therefore,

the increase speed of developing countries will be higher in textile and clothing

imports than the developed countries. Another explanation for such pattern change

is the global value chain. This is clear in the curve of textile imports, where the Viet

Nam and Turkey entered the top 10 importers as the fourth and tenth largest.

Considering their relatively small domestic markets, much of their imports are

intermediate products which are re-exported later.




3f) Concentration by country of world exports

                                                                    21
Top 10 Exporters in textiles and clothing have changed more dramatically since

2001 than the top 10 importers, as shown in Fig.12 and Fig.13. In both sectors China

remains the largest exporter in the world, and its share increased to nearly half of

the top ten exporters’ total value. As a share of world exports, China was 11.1% and

18.4% in textiles and clothing respectively in 2001, and this has increased to 35.9%

and 40.3% respectively in 2013. Despite the China containment agreements before

2013, China has acquired advantage in the world exports of textiles and clothing,

and the advantage in clothing exports is more obvious.

As a comparison, Hong Kong, China has fallen behind in this period. Hong Kong,

China was the second largest exporters in both sectors in 2001, but in 2013 it was

the eighth in textile exporters and the third in clothing exporters. Its share of world
                                                   22
    textiles exports has decreased from 7.8% in 2001 to 3.6% in 2013, while its share

    of world clothing exports has decreased from 12.0% to 4.9% in the same period. A

    natural explanation for such pattern changes is after the expiration of quota, there

    is no more need for Chinese exporters to transship their products to Hong Kong,

    and then export to the final destination of the US, EU and Canada.

    In contrast to the import pattern, the export concentration of top exporters keeps

    increasing. As shown in Fig.14, from 2001 to 2013, the top 10 concentration index5

    of textiles export (textiles10) increased from 0.65 to 0.73, and the top 10

    concentration index of clothing import (clothing10) increased more from 0.61 to

    0.73. The increase of top 5 concentration index are more obvious. From 2001 to

0.40 to 0.55, and the top 5 concentration index of clothing exporters (clothing5)

increased more from 0.46 to 0.59. This means that the export pattern of world

textiles and clothing trade has been concentrated in a few largest exporters.

Such export pattern changes can be the result of the expiration of quota system.

Under the quota system, some potential exporters (e.g. China) cannot obtain enough

quota for their products, and this will induce three outcomes. The first is the export

volume of China is lower than what it could if there were no quota limitation, and

provides market space for other competitive exporters. The second is trans-export

through a third economy, for example Hong Kong, China. The last one is the

emergence of quota-hopping overseas investment by Chinese companies. With the

expiration of quota system, all these three outcomes have changed. China need

                                                                    24
   neither trans-export nor quota-hopping invest through a third country, and she could

   export as much as the importer’s domestic market would accept. As shown in Fig.15,

   China’s share of world export increased steadily in both sectors.

4. Conclusion Remarks




In his An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith

provided a famous example in the production of the tools in textiles and clothing sectors:

the pin-maker. Adam Smith then suggested that the division of labor is limited by the

extent of the market. Two hundred years after that, the obstacles of a global textiles and

clothing market were not in technology, but in trade policies. The notorious quota

system in the MFA and ATC twisted the global trade patterns in textile and clothing

sectors and leaded to the well-being losses of the world as a whole.




                                                                       25
   In this paper we discuss the effect of the MFA/ATC after its removal using world

   trade data and the country data of US. The trade data we analyze are consistent with

   such theory prediction as more trade volumes, lower product price, smaller effect

   of RTA, less occasion of transshipment and quota hopping investment, and higher

   concentration of exporters. We also find the effect on clothing trade is more

   significant than textiles trade.
