                                           ABSTRACT

We consider three questions related to the choice between war in Iraq and a continuation of the pre-
war containment policy. First, in terms of military resources, casualties and expenditures for
humanitarian assistance and reconstruction, is war more or less costly for the United States than
containment? Second, compared to war and forcible regime change, would a continuation of the
containment policy have saved Iraqi lives? Third, is war likely to bring about an improvement or
deterioration in the economic well-being of Iraqis? We address these questions from an ex ante
perspective as of early 2003.

According to our analysis, pre-invasion views about the likely course of the Iraq intervention imply

present value costs for the United States in the range of $100 to $870 billion. Our estimated present

value cost for the containment policy is nearly $300 billion and ranges upward to $700 billion when

we account for several risks stressed by national security analysts. Our analysis also indicates that

war and forcible regime change will yield large improvements in the economic well-being of most

Iraqis relative to their prospects under the containment policy, and that the Iraqi death toll would

likely be greater under containment.

                            Executive Summary
        Prior to the invasion of Iraq in March 2003, the United States, Britain and their
allies pursued a policy of containment authorized by the United Nations Security
Council. Major elements of the policy included economic sanctions on Iraq,
disarmament requirements, weapons inspections, Northern and Southern no-fly zones
within Iraq, and maritime interdiction to enforce trade restrictions. Continued
containment was the leading option to war and forcible regime change. We analyze these
two policy options, war and containment, with attention to three questions:
    • In terms of military resources, casualties and expenditures for humanitarian
        assistance and reconstruction, is war more or less costly for the United States than
        a policy of continued containment?
    • Compared to war and forcible regime change, would a continuation of the
        containment policy have saved Iraqi lives?
    • Is war likely to bring about an improvement or deterioration in the economic
        well-being of Iraqis?

    We address these questions largely from an ex ante perspective. That is, we premise
the analysis on data and facts that were known, or reasonably knowable, as of early 2003.
This perspective is the one that confronts decision makers faced with the question of how
to deal with “tyrants, rogue states and terrorists who threaten not only their own people
but also others.” In this regard, one of our goals is to show how basic economic
principles and a quantitative approach can inform analyses of national security and
humanitarian concerns presented by rogue states.

    We rely on a variety of historical data to estimate the economic cost of U.S. military
inputs – capital, labor and materials. To assess the costliness of the Iraq intervention, we
then apply our cost estimates for military inputs to a wide range of scenarios for the war
in Iraq and the postwar occupation. We factor in additional costs for the economic value
of fatalities and casualties sustained by U.S. military personnel, lifetime medical costs for
the treatment of injuries suffered by U.S. soldiers in Iraq, and U.S. outlays for
humanitarian assistance and reconstruction aid.

     Forcible regime change in Iraq has proved to be a costly undertaking. As of January
2006, it appears likely that the Iraq intervention will ultimately unfold along a path that
implies present value costs for the United States in the range of 410 to 630 billion in 2003
dollars. These figures reflect a 2 percent annual discount rate. They capture the
estimated economic costs of U.S. military resources deployed in the war and postwar
occupation, the value of lost lives and injuries sustained by U.S. soldiers, the lifetime
medical costs of treating injured soldiers, and U.S. outlays for humanitarian assistance
and postwar reconstruction. Pre-invasion views about the likely course of the Iraq
intervention imply present value costs in the range of $100 to $870 billion. Military
resources devoted to postwar occupation account for more than half of the total costs
except in optimistic scenarios that envision a short occupation, little postwar conflict and
a smooth reconstruction effort.


                                              2
     The high cost of the Iraq intervention is sometimes seen as a compelling argument
against the decision to forcibly overthrow the ruling order and install a new regime. This
argument is deficient because it ignores the costs of alternative responses to the national
security and humanitarian concerns presented by the pre-war Iraqi regime. A well-
founded verdict on the Iraq intervention requires, at a minimum, an evaluation of what
these alternatives would cost. We tackle this issue by assessing the costs of sticking with
the pre-war containment policy.

     Containment required the continuous engagement of a potent U.S. military force in
southern Turkey, the Middle East and the Persian Gulf. The United States devoted
roughly 28,000 troops, 30 naval vessels, 200 military aircraft and other equipment to
Iraqi containment efforts prior to the pre-war buildup. We estimate the economic cost of
these military resources to be about $14.5 billion per year. Based on our assessment of
the likely duration of a dangerous regime in Iraq, absent external intervention, this annual
flow translates into an expected present value of nearly $300 billion. Hence, containment
was also a costly option for the United States, even under the favorable assumption that it
would be completely effective in achieving its national security goals.

     Advocates for forcible regime change in Iraq expressed several concerns about the
pre-war containment policy. Some stressed an erosion of political support for the
containment policy that threatened to undermine its effectiveness and lead to a much
costlier conflict with Iraq in the future. Others stressed the difficulty of compelling Iraqi
compliance with a rigorous process of weapons inspections and disarmament, widely
seen as a critical element of containment. And others stressed the potential for Iraqi
collaboration with international terrorist groups. To evaluate these concerns, we model
the possibility that an effective containment policy might require the mounting of costly
threats and might lead to a limited war or a full-scale regime-changing war against Iraq at
a later date. We also consider the possibility that the survival of a hostile Iraqi regime
raises the probability of a major terrorist attack on the United States. We draw on our
empirical analysis to assess the potential costs of these contingencies, but their
probabilities are especially difficult to assess with confidence.

     We show that any one of these contingencies can sharply raise the expected cost of
the containment policy. We also develop an integrated analysis that simultaneously
captures several possible contingencies under a policy of containment. The integrated
analysis focuses on three scenarios chosen to capture a range of views about the
likelihood and cost of the contingencies. Factoring the contingencies into the analysis
yields present value costs for the containment policy in the range of $350 to $700 billion.
These large sums are in the same ballpark as the likely costs of the Iraq intervention seen
from the vantage point of early 2006. Thus, even with the benefit of partial hindsight, it
is difficult to gauge whether the Iraq intervention is more costly than containment.

    We also consider the consequences of the war-versus containment choice in two
other respects: the economic well-being of Iraqis, and the loss of Iraqi lives. Based on our
analysis, we conclude that the war will lead to large improvements in the economic well-
being of most Iraqis relative to their prospects under the policy of containment. This



                                              3
conclusion follows from some basic observations. First, the Iraqi economy was in terrible
condition before the war, and it would have remained in a sorry state under the policy of
containment. Second, the regime of Saddam Hussein was an economic failure of
tremendous proportions. The available evidence suggests that real income per capita fell
by roughly 75 percent as a consequence of Saddam’s misrule. In addition, much of Iraq’s
greatly diminished output was diverted to an oversized military, an apparatus of terror
and repression and the relentless glorification of Saddam. Third, the removal of
sanctions, the expansion of petroleum exports, large-scale reconstruction aid, and the
reintegration of Iraq’s economy into the world economy provide a strong basis for
economic gains – even in a society with serious institutional weaknesses. If, over the
course of a generation, Iraqis recover even half of the economic losses they suffered
under Saddam Hussein, then they will be significantly better off in material terms as a
consequence of forcible regime change.

     The economic failures of the Saddam Hussein regime were not its greatest crimes.
The regime brought torture, repression, displacement and death to huge numbers of Iraqis
and others. We review some of the evidence in this regard, drawing heavily on work by
others. All told, the regime killed or caused the deaths of more than 500,000 Iraqis.
Under the policy of containment after the 1991 Gulf War, a reasonable estimate is that at
least 200,000 Iraqis died prematurely at the hands of the regime or as a direct
consequence of its policies, including its refusal to comply with U.N. Security Council
Resolutions and its diversion of oil revenues and other resources to palaces and
monuments. Had containment remained in effect, the historical record suggests that
premature Iraqi deaths would have continued indefinitely at the rate of 10,000 to 30,000
per year. There is, of course, a great deal of uncertainty about the number of premature
Iraqi deaths under either war or containment, but we think the weight of evidence points
to a greater Iraqi death toll from a continuation of the pre-war containment policy.
Perhaps the strongest reason to question this assessment is the possibility that a post-war
Iraq could devolve into an extended and large-scale civil war. This possibility cannot be
ruled out. What can be ruled out in light of the evidence is that the leading alternative to
war involved little loss of Iraqi lives.

      The question of how to deal with “tyrants, rogue states and terrorists who threaten
not only their own people but also others” is a profoundly difficult one. The stakes,
human and economic, are enormous. The policy options are complex and fraught with
uncertainty. And sound decision-making requires a daunting range of inputs and
analysis. Yet, precisely because the stakes are so high and the decisions are so difficult,
it is essential to systematically evaluate alternatives as an input to decision making and
the formulation of national security policy. Our study is an effort to apply a systematic
approach to the evaluation of the two leading policy options on the table prior to the Iraq
war.

1. Introduction

         Prior to the invasion of Iraq in March 2003, the United States, Britain and their

allies pursued a policy of containment authorized by the United Nations Security

Council. Major elements of the policy included economic sanctions on Iraq,

disarmament requirements, weapons inspections, Northern and Southern no-fly zones

within Iraq, and maritime interdiction to enforce trade restrictions. Continued

containment was the leading option to war and forcible regime change. We analyze these

two policy options, war and containment, with attention to three questions: In terms of

military resources, casualties and expenditures for humanitarian assistance and

reconstruction, is war more or less costly for the United States than a policy of continued

containment? Compared to war and forcible regime change, would a continuation of the

containment policy have saved Iraqi lives? And, is war likely to bring about an

improvement or deterioration in the economic well-being of Iraqis? Our attention to

these questions reflects strong and vocal concerns – before and after March 2003 – about

the costs of war, the loss of life in the event of war, and the longer term effects of war on

Iraqi society.

         Our study is a revised and expanded version of an analytical essay that we

circulated shortly before the March 2003 invasion.1 Although the decision point for the

Iraq invasion is past, we largely retain the ex ante perspective of our earlier essay. That

is, we premise the analysis on data and facts that were known, or reasonably knowable, as

of early 2003. This perspective is the one that confronts decision makers faced with the

question of how to deal with “tyrants, rogue states and terrorists who threaten not only

their own people but also others.” In this regard, one of our goals is to show how basic

economic principles and a quantitative approach can inform analyses of national security

and humanitarian concerns presented by rogue states.

       Several important issues pertaining to the Iraq intervention are beyond the scope

of our study. For example, we do not consider whether the pre-war containment policy

could have been reformulated to achieve its main objectives with less harm to the Iraqi

population. Nor do we evaluate the conduct of the war and ensuing occupation. Other

important issues outside the scope of our analysis include the impact of war on oil prices,

the broader costs and benefits of nation building in Iraq, the effects of military

intervention in Iraq on other rogue states and on weapons proliferation, the war’s effects

on attitudes towards the United States in the rest of the world, and the implications of the

war for U.S. relations with other nations. These issues merit careful attention, but we do

not address them here.

       In making the case for war, the U.S. and U.K. governments stressed threats posed

by Iraqi weapons of mass destruction (WMD), i.e., long-range ballistic missiles and

chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. As it turns out, no large WMD arsenals were

discovered in Iraq after the March 2003 invasion. This development undercut the case

for war in the views of many and diminished the credibility of the U.S. and U.K.

governments and their intelligence agencies. Our analysis, however, does not turn on the

issue of whether Iraq possessed large WMD stockpiles prior to the 2003 invasion.




                                              6
Instead, we initially proceed under the assumption that containment was, and would

remain, fully effective in preventing Iraq from using WMDs against the United States, its

allies and their interests. This assumption serves to focus attention on the relative costs

of the two policy options. We also extend our analysis to consider several costly

contingencies that might arise under a continuation of the containment policy.

       Several other studies assess the economic consequences of the Iraq conflict.

Nordhaus (2002) projects the costs of military spending, occupation, humanitarian

assistance and reconstruction. He also considers the potential effects of war on oil

markets and the U.S. economy. McKibbin and Stoeckel (2003) consider war-induced

effects of potentially higher oil prices and greater uncertainty on macroeconomic

outcomes in the world economy. Wallsten and Kosec (2005) take up some of the same

questions as our study, but from an ex post rather than ex ante perspective. We rely on

their study in assessing the cost of U.S. military casualties resulting from war in Iraq.

Another recent study by Bilmes and Stiglitz (2006) estimates a variety of direct and

indirect costs of the Iraq war. Several reports by the U.S. Congressional Budget Office

and other government agencies address the budgetary consequences of the Iraq war. We

draw heavily on these reports in constructing our projections for the economic costs of

war and containment.2 Our study differs from previous work in many respects, large and

small, but perhaps the most significant difference is our systematic evaluation of the two

leading policy options on the table prior to the Iraq war.

  Broader studies of the economic costs of military conflict include Hess (2003), who
investigates the empirical relationship between consumption growth and military conflict
throughout the world in recent decades; and Collier et al. (2003), who document the
highly detrimental effects of civil war on economic development.

                                              7
       We proceed as follows. Section 2 considers the U.S. military resources required

to carry out a policy of containment, the economic cost of those resources, and the likely

duration of a hostile Iraqi regime under containment. Section 3 considers projected U.S.

costs of war in Iraq including the costs related to postwar occupation, fatalities and

injuries sustained by U.S. military personnel, humanitarian assistance and reconstruction

aid. Section 4 draws on the inputs developed in Sections 2 and 3 to calculate and

compare U.S. costs of war and containment in present value terms. Section 5 extends the

cost analysis to consider concerns related to the sustainability and effectiveness of

containment and the effect of the war on the likelihood of major terrorist attacks on the

United States. Section 6 builds a simple model to gauge the economic welfare of Iraqis

under the containment and war options. We calibrate the model based on the economic

record of the Saddam Hussein regime and assumptions about the duration of the regime

under containment, the impact of war on Iraq’s economy, and the path of economic

development after regime change. Section 7 considers the issue of lost Iraqi lives, and

Section 8 concludes.



2. U.S. Military Resources and Costs under Containment

    The military aspects of the containment policy were undertaken principally by U.S.

and British forces.3 The analysis below restricts attention to the size and cost of the U.S.

participated in the enforcement of Iraqi no-fly zones along with the United States and
Britain. France ceased participation in the Northern no-fly zone in 1996 and in the
Southern no-fly zone in December 1998.

analysis for Britain and other countries.

2.1. Baseline Case

         2.1.1. Military Resources

         In September 2000 General Tommy R. Franks testified before the U.S. Senate

Committee on the Armed Services as follows: “By maintaining a significant forward

presence in the region, the U.S. seeks to deter and, if need be, to defeat Iraqi aggression.

To this end, at any given time, some 30 naval vessels, 175 military aircraft, and between

17,000-25,000 soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines are in the CENTCOM AOR [Area of

Responsibility].”4 In his testimony, Franks makes clear that EUCOM, which

encompasses Turkey in its AOR, also played a key role in containing Iraq, particularly in

the enforcement of the Northern No-Fly Zone. On this basis, we use a figure of 200

military aircraft devoted to Iraqi containment at the time of General Franks’ testimony in

2000. His testimony also refers to a Maritime Interdiction Force, comprised of naval

vessels from the United States and seven other countries, charged with enforcing U.N.

sanctions and restricting Iraqi exports and imports. Franks does not provide figures for

the military resources devoted to Iraqi containment under EUCOM or the Maritime

Interdiction Force, but it is clear that his figures for troops, aircraft and naval vessels in

the CENTCOM AOR comprise only a partial inventory of the full military resources

deployed to contain Iraq.

         A Department of Defense document on Fiscal Year (FY) 2001 budget requests for

U.S. military operations in Bosnia, Kosovo, Southwest Asia and East Timor provides

                                               9
more precise information about the troops devoted to containment.5 For operations in

Southwest Asia directed toward the containment and deterrence of Iraq, the document

lists “troop strength” levels (including Guard and Reserve troops) of 3,550 for Army

Requirements, 15,691 for Navy Requirements, 426 for Marine Corps Requirements,

8,457 for Air Force Requirements and 40 for Defense Health Program Requirements for a

total of 28,164 troops. The document also shows expenditures for Southwest Asia under

Defense-Wide Requirements but does not list troops in this category. Presumably, the

U.S. also undertook other surveillance and intelligence-gathering activities to contain Iraq

(including CIA and State Department activities) that are not reflected in the document.

         These sources make clear that containment required a potent U.S. military

presence in the Southwest Asia region, including many personnel and large amounts of

military hardware. In short, the U.S. devoted roughly 28,000 troops, 30 ships (including

a carrier battle group), and about 200 aircraft and other equipment to containment efforts

prior to the pre-war buildup. The next step in the analysis is to estimate the economic

costs of these military resources. We are not aware of reports by the Department of

Defense or other sources that provide economic cost figures for the full complement of

military resources devoted to the containment of Iraq, so we construct our own cost

estimates. We develop two methods that differ somewhat with respect to data

requirements and underlying assumptions.

         2.1.2. Cost Calculations: Method 1

      Our first method calculates the economic cost of military resources devoted to

containment as the sum of labor costs, capital costs and the cost of expended munitions.

                                             10
Consider labor costs. In September 2002, the U.S. Congressional Budget Office (CBO)

issued a document on the “Estimated Costs of a Potential Conflict with Iraq.”6 Based on

the experience of U.S. Army peacekeepers in Bosnia and Kosovo, the document assigns

costs of $226,000 per person-year for troops deployed in a prospective postwar

occupation of Iraq.7 We adopt this figure in calculating the labor costs of the military

resources deployed in the containment of Iraq. We interpret the figure as capturing costs

for compensation, personnel transport and personnel support. As explained below, we

calculate capital costs and expenditures for munitions separately.

    For our purposes, the CBO figure for labor costs has some problematic aspects.

First, it appears to include certain capital costs such as spare parts for the operation and

maintenance of equipment in theater. Second, and cutting the other way, it omits a large

chunk of personnel costs, because CBO accounting practices do not include the basic pay

of active-duty military personnel engaged in an overseas operation as part of the

operation’s cost.8 This large omission is on the order of 40-50 thousand dollars per

person-year by our estimates.9 The CBO figure also omits the cost of military personnel

  U.S. Congressional Budget Office (2002).
7
  This figure does not include the cost of heavy reconstruction after a prospective war in
Iraq. See page 5 and Tables 3 and 4 in CBO (2002).
8
  See, for example, page 2 of CBO (2002).
9
  To arrive at this estimate, we divide Army personnel costs in FY 2001 by the estimated
number of full-time equivalent Army personnel as of September 2000. Here are the
details. As of September 30, 2000, the Army had 482,170 active-duty personnel (Table
1.1 in DoD, 2000b). The ready-reserve component of the U.S. armed forces numbers
about 1.2 million persons in 2000 and 2001 (Census Bureau, 2005, Table 508). In 2000
and 2001, the annual number of active-duty days per ready reserve member is about 14
(CBO, 2005a, Figure 6). Army reserve units account for the vast majority of all active-
duty days by reserve personnel (CBO, 2005a, page 3). On that basis, we attribute all
active-duty days by reserve personnel to the Army, which implies 14 days times 1.2
million active-duty days by Army reserve units. Assuming that regular Army personnel
work 220 days per year, the full-time equivalent Army military force as of September

                                              11
who support the operation but are stationed outside the theater of operations. Finally, the

CBO figure does not include the costs of compensating, supporting and training the

additional troops who rotate through the theater of operations over time. These costs are

large, because the number of troops required to sustain a long term overseas operation is

at least three times bigger than the force in theater at a point in time.10

        On net, the full economic cost of the personnel resources (including personnel

support and transport) required to carry out the containment policy is probably larger than

$226,000 per person-year. Nevertheless, we adopt this figure in constructing our first

estimate for the cost of containment. To facilitate a consistent cost comparison between

policy options, we use the same figure for personnel-related costs when estimating the

economic cost of a postwar occupation of Iraq. Multiplying $226,000 per person-year by

28,164 military personnel in theater yields annual labor costs of $6.4 billion for the

containment policy.

        To estimate the capital value of the ships, planes and other military equipment

engaged in the containment of Iraq, we rely on another document produced by the U.S.

Congressional Budget Office (CBO), titled “Budgeting for Naval Forces.”11 According

to this document, the CBO estimates that the average shipbuilding rate needed to


2000 amounts to (14/220)(1.2 million) + .482 million =566,000. According to Table 6-
22 in DoD (2000a), Army outlays for FY 2001 include $28.11 billion in personnel costs.
We ignore any special pay for hazardous duty in this figure, because few U.S. military
forces were actively engaged in combat operations or other hazardous duty in 2000 and
2001. Dividing 28.11 billion by the number of full-time equivalent Army personnel in
September 2000 yields an annual per-person figure of $49,670 or 51,223 in 2003 dollars.
If the CBO uses an 80-20 mix of regular and reserve personnel in its cost projections,
then the omitted personnel costs amount to (.80)($51,233) = $40,978.

maintain a 300-ship Navy is 8.5 ships per year at a cost of $10.8 billion, which implies

that the capital value of 30 “average” ships is $38.1 billion. The same document estimates

annual construction costs for 148 aircraft at $10.2 billion, so the capital value of 200

“average” aircraft is about $15.3 billion.12 In the calculations below, we scale up these

figures for ships and aircraft by 6% to express them in 2003 dollars.13 In addition, we

estimate that Army, Marines and Air Force ground units required an additional $1.5

billion in military equipment in theater to carry out the containment policy.14

       The next step is to estimate the annual costs of these capital inputs – depreciation,

maintenance, fuel and other operating expenses, and the government’s opportunity cost

of funds tied up in capital goods. Table 1 provides estimates for the depreciation,

maintenance and operating costs of military equipment. Line (1) reports straight-line

depreciation rates calculated from projected equipment lifetimes. Line (2) reports

estimated operations and maintenance (O&M) spending on military equipment in

peacetime use, expressed as a percentage of capital value. This category captures the

costs of fuel, parts and depot maintenance for military equipment at a peacetime

operations tempo. To derive the estimates in line (2), we rely on the steady-state

assumption that the ratio of O&M spending on military equipment to procurement

spending for new capital goods is constant over time. We also assume that this ratio is the

   We carry out all price-level adjustments using the GDP implicit price deflator for all

14
   Military equipment per Army personnel deployed in Iraq, Kuwait and Afghanistan is
about $189,000 according to data in CBO (2005b). We apply this figure to the number of
Army troops and Marines devoted to the containment policy and half this amount to the
number of Air Force personnel. The result is about $1.5 billion in 2003 dollars.

                                             13
same for all types of military equipment.15 Applying these assumptions to data on

military spending in CBO (2001) yields the O&M spending rates in line (2). Actual

O&M spending rates are higher for military equipment stationed in theater because of a

higher operations tempo. Line (3) draws on CBO (2005b) estimates of the extra

depreciation and maintenance costs incurred by in-theater military equipment in Iraq,

Kuwait and Afghanistan to illustrate the impact of a higher operations tempo. Summing

the entries in lines (1) to (3) yields annual depreciation, maintenance and operating costs

of roughly 4.5 to 5.5 percent of capital value for aircraft and naval vessels and more than

20 percent for ground equipment. These figures, reported in line (4), do not capture the

extra fuel costs associated with a higher operations tempo for equipment in theater.

        Line (5) of Table 1 reports the rate of depreciation, maintenance and operating

costs that we apply to military equipment used in the containment policy. For Army and

Marines equipment (mostly ground equipment), we use a much lower figure than line (3)

based on the view that containment involved a much lower operations tempo for such

equipment than engagements in Iraq, Kuwait and Afghanistan. For naval vessels and

aircraft, we adjust the line (3) entries upwards to account for the missing extra fuel

consumption. To account for the opportunity cost of government funds, line (6) adds two

percentage points, which is consistent with the evidence below that the U.S. government

faces a two percent real interest rate.




15
  The two assumptions underlying the entries in line (2) are strong ones, and we would
prefer to relax them by exploiting detailed data on normal O&M spending for military
equipment. Unfortunately, as noted in CBO (2001, page 2), the Department of Defense
does not produce detailed breakouts for its equipment-related spending on fuel, spare
parts, other consumables and depot maintenance. This lack of data precludes a more
direct estimate of normal O&M costs for military equipment.


                                             14
       We now have in place the required elements for our first method of calculating

the economic cost of the military resources devoted to the containment policy. Table 2

Panel A summarizes the calculations. Applying the real user cost of capital inputs from

line (8) of Table 1 to the capital asset values derived above yields capital costs of $4.7

billion per year. Adding $6.4 billion for labor costs and $0.2 billion per year for

expended munitions yields total containment costs of about $11.3 billion per year.16

       2.1.3. Cost Calculations: Method 2

       As a check on this cost figure, consider a simpler set of calculations that relies on

different inputs and assumptions. First, Table 5 in CBO (2000) provides a figure of $94.7

billion as the annual cost of maintaining a 300-ship navy (excluding $10.3 billion for

research and development). This figure encompasses procurement costs, operating costs,

personnel costs, military construction and other items. The implied all-in cost for an

average 30-ship naval force is about $9.5 billion per year, or $10.0 billion in 2003

dollars. Second, recall that naval forces (including marines) account for 16,117 out of

28,164 military personnel devoted to the containment of Iraq. Multiplying $10 billion by

(28,164/16,117) yields $17.5 billion per year as the implied cost of containing Iraq.

       This calculation does not adjust for differences in labor intensity among the armed

services. Defense budget figures for FY 2001 imply that military personnel account for

24.4% of total costs in the Air Force, 40.4% in the Army and 28.9% in the Navy.17 To

adjust for these differences, think of the Air Force, Army and Navy as three different

16
   We regard the $0.2 billion figure for munitions as a low-end guess. According to
Center for Defense Information (1998), cruise missiles and other smart munitions
expended by U.S. forces during the four-day December 1998 Desert Fox operation cost
$478 million to produce. Desert Fox was one of the largest operations conducted by
allied forces during the containment of Iraq.

technologies for producing “military output,” and assume that the value of military output

per dollar of expenditure is the same across the three services. This condition must hold

on the margin, if Department of Defense funds are allocated efficiently among the

services. Next, divide the all-in cost estimate for the U.S. naval force devoted to the

containment of Iraq ($10 billion) by the number of naval personnel (16,117). This

calculation yields an all-in annual cost per person for U.S. naval forces devoted to

containment of $620,463. Given this figure, and using the data on labor cost shares and

number of military personnel devoted to Iraq by service, we have

$620, 463 ( 28.9 / 24.4 ) 8, 457 + (28.9 / 40.4)3, 590 + 16,117 = $17.8 billion as the

estimated annual cost of containing Iraq.18

       This figure is substantially larger than the $11.3 billion figure calculated above

using Method 1. In the absence of a compelling reason to prefer one estimate over the

other, we adopt the simple average of $14.5 billion 2003 dollars as our baseline figure for

the estimated annual costs of containment. By way of comparison, outlays by the U.S.




18
   This calculation may also lead to a substantial understatement of containment costs.
First, it does not include the costs of compensating, supporting and training the additional
troops who rotate through the theater of operations over time. Second, it does not include
the additional costs of constructing and maintaining naval vessels and other equipment
that rotate through the theater over time. Third, the calculation rests on an implicit
assumption that depreciation, maintenance and operating costs for military equipment is
the same whether or not the equipment is in theater. Fourth, the calculation includes no
adjustment for higher munitions expenditures in theater. Nevertheless, this calculation
may also lead to an overstatement of containment costs, if the naval vessels devoted to
the containment policy are less costly to build or operate than the average U.S. naval
vessel. The calculation may also lead to an overstatement if containment operations
facilitate the training, readiness and development of U.S. military forces, because these
benefits are not netted out of the estimated costs.

Department of Defense were $344 billion in Fiscal Year 2002.19 So $14.5 billion for the

containment of Iraq amounts to about 4.2 percent of the pre-war U.S. defense budget.

2.2. Higher Containment Costs

     One might reasonably argue that the $14.5 billion figure is too small for at least two

reasons. First, containment efforts also drew on U.S. military resources that were

stationed outside the Southwest Asia region, or that were stationed in the region only on

an occasional basis for particular operations. These additional military resources helped

to deter Iraq and to support and execute particular operations, but their costs are not

included in the $14.5 billion figure. A noteworthy example is Operation Desert Fox, a

four-day bombing campaign carried out by U.S. and British forces against Iraqi targets in

December 1998. The execution of Desert Fox relied heavily on out-of-area military

resources and military resources temporarily deployed to the Middle East.20 As we

discuss in Section 5, the United States also undertook large additional force deployments

to the Persian Gulf region in 1994 and 1996 to deter Iraqi aggression against other states.

     Second, containment efforts in 2000 and 2001 involved a level of military pressure

that was insufficient to compel Iraq’s full compliance with U.N. Security Council

resolutions. Prior to the pre-war buildup of U.S. and British forces, Iraq had for several

   During a press briefing shortly after the end of Desert Fox, General Anthony Zinni,
Commander-in-Chief of U.S. Central Command [CENTCOM] stated that “The operation
involved over 30,000 troops, and 10,000 more outside our area of responsibility who
supported and alerted from bases virtually around the world…. Over 300 aircraft were
involved in strike and support roles…. Over 40 ships performed strike and support
roles… Thousands of ground troops deployed to protect Kuwait and to respond to any
counteraction. Hundreds of our Special Operations Forces troops also deployed to carry
out their assigned missions.” A transcript of the press briefing is available at

years refused to admit U.N. weapons inspectors.21 Iraq had a long history of stalling,

evading, undermining and circumventing the U.N. weapons inspection process (Pollack,

2002, chapter 3), an essential element of the containment policy.22 Even on the brink of

war, Iraq continued to resist and impede U.N. weapons inspections, often with

considerable success.23 Given this history of continual resistance to inspection and

limited disarmament by the Saddam Hussein regime, an effective containment policy

apparently required a larger commitment of U.S. military resources and a more

aggressive posture by U.S. forces. That is, a fully effective containment policy would

have cost substantially more than $14.5 billion per year.

     It is not obvious how best to adjust for the incomplete effectiveness of the

containment policy. It is also difficult to quantify the cost of the out-of-area military

resources that contributed to containment efforts and that provided a deterrent to Iraqi



21
   See, for example, the testimony of General Tommy R. Franks before the U.S. Senate
Committee on the Armed Services on 19 September 2000: “Iraq’s WMD capabilities
remain a key concern. It has been more than a year and a half since UN weapons
inspections last occurred in Iraq, and Saddam Hussein has thus far refused new
inspections.” U.N. weapons inspectors did not return to Iraq until November 2002.
22
   In his December 1998 address to the American people, shortly after U.S. and British
forces commenced Operation Desert Fox, President Bill Clinton described the importance
of the weapons inspection program this way: “First, without a strong inspection system,
Iraq would be free to retain and begin to rebuild its chemical, biological and nuclear
weapons programs in months, not years. Second, if Saddam can cripple the weapons
inspection system and get away with it, he would conclude that the international
community – led by the United States – has simply lost its will. He will surmise that he
has free rein to rebuild his arsenal of destruction, and someday – make no mistake – he
will use it again as he has in the past. Third, … If we turn our backs on his defiance, the
credibility of U.S. power as a check against Saddam will be destroyed. We will not only
have allowed Saddam to shatter the inspection system that controls his weapons of mass
destruction program; we also will have fatally undercut the fear of force that stops
Saddam from acting to gain domination in the region.” A transcript of President
Clinton’s full address is available at

aggression. As a crude adjustment for these factors, we consider a higher containment

cost figure of $19.4 billion, which is one-third greater than our baseline figure. Section 5

develops an alternative approach to concerns about the containment policy.

2.3. Dual-Use Military Deployment

     Another criticism of our containment cost calculations cuts the other way. The

military resources that the U.S. devoted to Iraqi containment prior to March 2003

projected U.S. power in the region and functioned as forward bases in a critical and

volatile part of the world. Hence, a friendlier Iraqi regime would only mitigate, not

obviate, the need for the deployment of U.S. military resources to the region. According

to this argument, some portion of the costs calculated above is not fully attributable to the

policy of containing Iraqi.24 This argument is logically sound, but its quantitative force is

unclear. On the one hand, the United States had no major military bases and few ground

forces in the Middle East prior to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.25 This

fact suggests that few U.S. ground forces would be stationed in the Middle East if Iraq

were governed by a stable, unthreatening regime. On the other hand, U.S. military bases

in southern Turkey and a strong naval presence near the Middle East were significant

features of U.S. policy long before the invasion of Kuwait. As a crude adjustment for the

dual-use character of U.S. military resources deployed in the containment of Iraq, we




24
   Another argument is that U.S. forces engaged in containment activities can and will
continue to carry out some of the same general training and readiness preparation that
they would undertake in any event.
25
   See U.S. General Accounting Office (1991) for an overview of U.S. military activities
in the Middle East during the 1980s and their costs. While the U.S. had few grounds in
the Middle East prior to Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in 1990, developments in the broader
Southwest Asia region provided much of the motivation for the creation of a U.S.-based
Rapid Deployment Force in the early 1980s.


                                             19
consider a lower containment cost figure of $9.7 billion, which is one-third smaller than

our baseline figure.

2.4. Spontaneous Regime Change

       Containment is necessary only so long as a dangerous regime, or a like-minded

successor, remains in power. So our calculation of containment costs should account for

the possibility that the pre-war Iraqi regime would peacefully evolve into a far less

dangerous one. It is hard to precisely assess the probable duration of a dangerous Iraqi

regime, absent war, but history offers some guidance.26 The regime of Saddam Hussein

survived a devastating war with Iran in the 1980s, a crushing military defeat in the Gulf

War of 1991, twelve years of draconian sanctions, and a tremendous decline in living

standards during the war with Iran and again in the 1990s under containment. These facts

suggest that the regime was hard to dislodge under a policy of containment. Other highly

repressive regimes, such as Cuba and North Korea, also show much staying power.

       The key issue is not how long Saddam Hussein himself would continue to rule

Iraq, absent external intervention. Rather, the real issue is the expected duration of a

regime that presents a similar threat to the United States and others. The experience of

North Korea provides a case in point. When the North Korean leader Kim Il-sung died in

1994, many doubted the ability of his son and designated successor, Kim Jong-il, to

secure the reins of power. Those doubts turned out to be misplaced, and the regime

continued in essentially the same repressive and hostile form. Moreover, North Korea

26
  See Bueno de Mesquita et al. (2003) for a detailed analysis of the factors that influence
the survival of political leaders and regimes. In their chapter 7, they estimate survival
functions and hazard rates for individual political leaders. The issue at hand for our
analysis, however, is the duration of a dangerous regime in Iraq, not the survival of a
particular leader. We are unaware of econometric studies that speak directly to the
regime survival question.


                                             20
under Kim Jong-il continued to advance its nuclear weapons program and its long-range

missile delivery systems.27 In the case of Iraq, expert accounts suggest that Saddam’s

sons had a firm grip on the apparatus of terror, repression and security prior to the March

2003 invasion. Pollack’s (2002, chapter four) account indicates that Saddam’s sons,

especially Qusay, were well positioned to continue in their father’s place after his death.

Pollack’s account also stresses that much of the regime’s leadership was closely linked to

Saddam by ties of family and clan. In sum, it does not appear that the continuity of the

regime rested on the personal survival of Saddam Hussein.

       In this light, consider an optimistic scenario in which the pre-war Iraqi regime

peacefully morphs from malign to benign at an annual hazard rate of 3 percent. This

assumption implies an expected duration for a hostile regime, absent external

intervention, of 33 years beyond March 2003. If one dates the onset of a dangerous Iraqi

regime to Saddam’s assumption of the presidency in 1979, then the 3 percent hazard rate

implies an expected total duration for the regime of about 57 years.28 In comparison, the



27
   See U.S. Congressional Research Service (2003).
28
   The Iraqi Baath party took power by way of a military coup in 1968. General Ahmed
Hassan al-Bakr became president and, shortly thereafter, prime minister and commander-
in-chief of Iraqi military forces. At the time, Bakr was also secretary-general of the Baath
party and chairman of its powerful Revolutionary Command Council. Saddam Hussein
played a significant role in the coup and held considerable sway over Baath party, and
later Iraqi, security forces. The early stages of Saddam’s rise to power owe much to the
support he received from Bakr. Saddam accumulated power and influence throughout the
1970s, eventually eliminating or overshadowing all rivals, including Bakr. In August
1979, he persuaded Bakr to step aside and to designate Saddam as his successor. See
Coughlin (2005), especially chapters 3 to 5, for an account of these developments.
Although Saddam’s ruthlessness, propensity for violence, and fascination with military
force were evident long before he achieved the presidency and undisputed power within
Iraq, the nightmarish quality of the regime was not easily foretold. For most ordinary
Iraqis who did not directly challenge the regime or the Baath party, the 1970s were a
decade of rising prosperity. Some outside observers saw the early Baathist government
as one of the most progressive regimes in the Middle East.

Soviet Union survived 69 years after its founding in 1922 until its dissolution in 1991,

including more than four decades under a policy of containment by the West. The

containment of North Korea has involved a large U.S. military presence on the Korean

Peninsula for more than 50 years.29 These historical facts are consistent with our

assumption of a 3 percent hazard rate for peaceful regime change in Iraq.30



3. U.S. Military, Reconstruction and Humanitarian Costs under War

3.1. Incremental Appropriations versus Economic Costs

     News reports and commentary on the economic costs of the Iraq war typically focus

on incremental appropriations in government budgets. In September 2002, for example,

the Democratic Caucus of the House Budget Committee (HBC) issued a report that

projected a new war in Iraq would increase U.S. budget costs by $47 to $93 billion for

military operations alone, not counting the costs of an extended occupation. A report

issued by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) in the same month reached similar

conclusions.31 In March 2003, the Bush Administration requested supplemental spending




29
   As of March 2003, there were 37,000 U.S. military personnel stationed in South Korea
and another 45,000 in nearby Japan. See Robert Burns (AP Military Writer), “Rumsfeld:
Move U.S. Troops from Korea DMZ,”AP Online, March 6, 2003, available at
www.austin360.com/aas/news/ap/ap_story.html/Intl/AP.V0317.AP-US-Troops-
Korea.html. The United States also relies on additional military resources to contain and
deter North Korea. For example, Burns writes that “In response to recent North Korean
moves to reactivate its nuclear weapons program, the Pentagon this week is sending 12
B-52 bombers and 12 B-1 bombers from U.S. bases to Guam, within striking distance of
the Korean peninsula.”
30
   A more sophisticated treatment of regime change would allow the hazard rate to be
nonstationary and to depend on the precise character of the containment policy. We
would welcome such an analysis, but it is beyond the scope of this study.
31
   See U.S. HBC (2002) and U.S. CBO (2002). The HBC and CBO have also issued
several additional reports on the costs of the Iraq war since September 2002.

                                            22
authority of $62.6 billion, mostly to fund U.S. war efforts in Iraq.32 These and other

budget projections and budget requests are heavily reported by the news media and

widely interpreted as measuring the actual or projected economic costs of the U.S

resources devoted to the Iraq war. This interpretation is incorrect.

     The economic costs of military resources are appropriately measured in terms of

what they cost to produce (production cost) or the value they provide in their next-best

use (opportunity cost). In contrast, CBO (2002) captures only “the incremental costs of

deploying a force to the Persian Gulf (the costs that would be incurred above those

budgeted for routine operations)…”33 Likewise, “All of the costs described in the [HBC

(2002)] report represent incremental costs – those that would not have occurred but for

the military operation.”34 These incremental budget effects fail to capture the full cost of

producing the military resources deployed in the Iraq war. For example, CBO “estimates

reflect only the costs of aircraft flying hours and ship steaming days above those

normally provided in DoD’s regular appropriations.”35 Depreciation costs and normal

maintenance costs for military hardware devoted to the Iraq war are also omitted from the

CBO and HBC projections, as are the costs of training U.S. military forces. The

32
   See Executive Office of the President (2003). It was widely understood at the time that
additional requests for spending authority related to the Iraq war would be forthcoming.
See, for example, “What Price War? It’s Too Soon to Tell, But Expect Final Tab to Be
High” by David Firestone in the 7 April 2003 edition of the New York Times.
33
   See the cover letter from the CBO Director to the ranking members of the House and
Senate Budget Committees that accompanies the September 2002 CBO report. Similarly,
the body of the report states on page 2 that “CBO’s estimates represent the incremental
costs that DoD [Department of Defense] could incur above the budgeted costs of routine
operations. As a result, the estimate excludes items such as the basic pay of active-duty
military personnel but includes the monthly pay for reservists recalled to full-time duty.
Similarly, the estimates reflect only the costs of aircraft flying hours and ship steaming
days above those normally provided in DoD’s regular appropriations.”

                                             23
“incremental costs” in budget documents also fail to reflect opportunity costs, except

under the extreme view that U.S. military resources have zero value in their next-best

use. These same points apply to the incremental appropriations that the Bush

administration sought and obtained from Congress in connection with the Iraq war. In

short, cost measures based on budget requests and budget projections fail to capture the

full economic costs of the military resources devoted to the war.

    A focus on “incremental costs” also results in misleading cost comparisons across

deployment scenarios. For example, the CBO and HBC reports exclude the basic pay of

active-duty military personnel in their cost projections but include pay for reservists

called to full-time duty. As a result, deployment scenarios that involve greater reliance

on reserve troops appear costlier than otherwise identical scenarios that rely more heavily

on active-duty personnel. Table 3 illustrates the point in starker fashion, drawing on

CBO (2003a) cost projections for alternative options to deploy additional forces in Iraq.

The CBO assigns zero “incremental costs” to option (d), which involves a withdrawal of

forces from the Sinai Peninsula, Bosnia, Kosovo and Okinawa, “because the savings that

would accrue from withdrawing forces from those other commitments would largely

offset the costs of sustaining additional forces in Iraq.” Such “savings” are true savings

only if those forces generate zero benefits in their current deployment or any other

alternative deployment. Put differently, it would be unwise to conclude from Table 3 that

(d) is the least costly, or most desirable, option simply because it triggers the lowest

incremental budgetary costs. A focus on “incremental costs” may be useful for

government budgeting and planning purposes, but it does not deliver sensible measures

for the economic costs of the military resources devoted to the Iraq war. By the same




                                             24
logic, these “incremental costs” do not provide a sensible basis for comparing the

economic costs of the military resources required under war and containment.

3.2. Measuring the Direct Economic Costs of War

    We seek to measure the full production costs of the projected military resources

devoted to the Iraq war and postwar occupation; any additional transport, munitions and

supply costs required to prosecute the war and carry out the occupation; the projected

cost of casualties incurred by U.S. military forces; and projected costs for humanitarian

assistance and reconstruction aid. Our cost calculations consider the military scenarios

sketched out in CBO (2002). Because this document focuses on war and its near-term

aftermath, we provide additional economic cost figures for longer term occupation and

peacekeeping roles by U.S. forces. We consider costs for the United States only.

    With respect to military resources, we focus on production costs rather than

opportunity costs for two reasons. First, a production cost approach parallels our

treatment of containment costs and thereby facilitates an apples-to-apples cost

comparison between the two policy options. Second, direct measurement of (historical)

production costs is more straightforward and less reliant on subjective judgments than

efforts to measure the opportunity costs of military resources. Nevertheless, there are

potential problems with a production cost approach. For example, if a country

accumulates an oversized military relative to its national security goals, then historical

production costs are likely to exceed the opportunity cost of ready military resources. In

this case, a production cost approach to a particular military operation would overstate its

true economic cost (i.e., opportunity cost). We do not think this case applies to the

United States in the wake of 9/11 and an expanding set of U.S. security concerns. More




                                             25
plausibly, the U.S. military is at least temporarily undersized relative to its national

security goals, in part because of the Iraq war.36 In this situation, historical production

costs may understate opportunity costs.

3.3. Initial Deployment, Major Combat, and Redeployment

     Table 4 summarizes military force requirements in the major combat phase of a war

in Iraq, as projected in the two war scenarios considered by CBO (2002). Both scenarios

envision a much larger, more ground-intensive force than the one deployed under

containment. The Heavy Air Option involves 253 thousand troops deployed in theater

and 2,500 aircraft; the Heavy Ground Option involves 367 thousand troops and 1,500

aircraft. Both options involve sixty Navy battle force ships, including five carrier battle

groups.

     Based partly on these CBO projections, Table 5 provides estimates for the capital

value of deployed military equipment during the combat phase of an Iraq war. Capital

values for Naval Vessels and (fixed-wing) Aircraft are estimated by the same method as

in Table 2. Capital values for ground equipment (including helicopters) reflect the recent

experience of Army troops and Marines engaged in Afghanistan, Kuwait and Iraq, as

detailed in notes to the table. Our estimated capital value for the military equipment

required during the combat phase of a war in Iraq is $263 billion under the Heavy Ground

Option and $291 billion under the Heavy Air Option.




36
   This view is consistent with news reports that U.S. Army and Marine forces have been
stretched thin by an extended engagement of ground forces in the Iraq theater. Concerns
about the ability of the U.S. Army to meet the force requirements of an extended
occupation of Iraq also arose prior to the March 2003 invasion. For example, CBO
(2002, page 5) states that “Army forces would be unable to support [normal] rotations for
a prolonged 200,000-person occupation.”


                                              26
     Table 6 reports data on the projected cost of an Iraq war by phase of engagement and

type of costs. The cost figures in Table 6 reflect upward adjustments to the figures in

CBO (2002) to account for basic pay of active-duty military personnel and the additional

user costs of capital not captured in the CBO figures. Based on our calculations, the

projected costs of the U.S. military resources devoted to an Iraq war – initial deployment,

major combat, and redeployment – range from $46 to $80 billion depending on force

option and duration of major combat. As also indicated in the table, our projected costs

are 56 to 67 percent greater than the CBO projections for the same scenarios. Thus, our

adjustments to capital and labor costs have a major impact on projected costs relative to

the CBO figures.37

3.4. Postwar Occupation, Reconstruction Aid and Humanitarian Assistance

     Table 7 summarizes several other projected costs associated with war and forcible

regime change in Iraq. Panel A shows projected costs for the deployment and use of

ground troops, naval forces and air forces during a postwar occupation. We construct

these projections using the same approach (Method 1) as in Section 2.1.2 for containment

costs. Relative to containment, however, we apply a much higher value for the user cost



37
  Despite these adjustments, the figures in Table 6 are lower than the costs implied by
the methods of Section 2.1. To see this point, consider the Heavy Air Option with two
months of major combat. The sum of Personnel and Personnel Support Costs, Operations
Support Including Munitions, and Transport to and from Theater is $34.3 billion in this
scenario according to Table 6. Applying the Method 1 cost per person-year of $226,000
– which covers personnel and their support, some operations support, and the rotation of
personnel into and out of theater – yields a cost of $38.1 billion for an eight-month
engagement (initial deployment, major combat, redeployment). The reasons for this
discrepancy are unclear to us. Perhaps large engagements involve significant scale
economies not present under containment. Or, perhaps we have overstated the costs of
containment relative to those of initial deployment, major combat and redeployment. If
so, and because we rely on Method 1 to compute the costs of occupation, we also
overstate the cost of postwar occupation relative to the initial war phase.

                                            27
of capital on ground equipment, and we allow user costs to vary with operations tempo.

These assumptions capture the fact that depreciation, maintenance and operating costs are

sensitive to operations tempo, as detailed in CBO (2005b). A “high” operations tempo in

Table 7 is intended to reflect a postwar situation that involves a significant insurgency,

whereas a “low” operations tempo is intended to reflect one that primarily involves

peacekeeping operations and the maintenance of stability. Occupation scenarios with a

high operations tempo also entail extra munitions costs.38

     Table 7 does not impose any particular assumption about the level of U.S. military

forces engaged during a postwar occupation of Iraq. Rather, the entries in Panels A and

B provide information about projected annual costs for a given level of military resources

– such as 100,000 armed forces in theater and their equipment, supplies, munitions, and

so on. For example, the last row of Panel A implies that the U.S. cost is $62.8 billion per

year for an occupation force of 200,000 military personnel operating at a high tempo.39

In the analysis below, we scale the figures for occupation costs up or down in proportion

to the size of the armed forces engaged, while maintaining fixed ratios of ground troops

to other personnel. The figures for “Occupation costs per 100,000 armed forces in

theater” in Table 7 involve a ratio of ground troops to Navy and Air Force personnel that

is twice as high as in the Heavy Air Option.40



38
   Panel B shows projected occupation costs based on Method 2 and using the All-in
Costs per Person-Year reported in Table 2. Method 2 yields much larger costs than
Method 1, as before.
39
   Relative to the projection in CBO (2002), our per-person cost figure during occupation
is 39 percent greater at a high operations tempo and 26 percent greater at a low tempo.
40
   Relative to containment, the ratio of ground troops to naval personnel is more than
seventy times higher in an occupation according to our calculations and projections. The
ratio of ground troops to Air Force personnel is about nineteen times higher in an
occupation.

                                             28
       The projected costs for humanitarian assistance and postwar reconstruction aid are

drawn from three sources. Nordhaus (2002) projects U.S. costs for humanitarian

assistance to the Iraqi people in the range of 1 to 10 billion dollars over a period of two to

four years. HBC (2002) projects U.S. costs for reconstruction aid in the range of 9.2 to

18.4 billion dollars over a period of ten years. An update in HBC (2003), issued six

months after the Iraq invasion, projects much higher U.S. reconstruction costs in the

range of $28.3 to $73.3 billion. As of July 5, 2005, actual U.S. budget allocations for the

Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund total about $18.4 billion, which includes more than

$5 billion in allocations for security and law enforcement activities such as training and

equipping Iraqi security forces. Cumulative Fund outlays amount to $6.3 billion as of

June 28, 2005, largely for security services and law enforcement.41

3.5. U.S. Casualties

       To project the cost of casualties sustained by U.S. military personnel in an Iraq war,

we rely on the estimates in Wallsten and Kosec (2005). Their estimates are designed to

capture the economic value of lost lives, the welfare losses suffered by injured soldiers,

and the lifetime medical costs of treating injuries sustained in Iraq. In Panel D of Table 7,

we report a projected cost of $6.9 billion per 1,000 U.S. fatalities. This figure, drawn

from Wallsten and Kosec, reflects the midpoint estimate for the value of a statistical life

in the literature reviewed by Viscusi and Aldy (2003). Based on the experience of U.S.

forces through August 25, 2005, the Iraq engagement has involved 7.153 injuries per

fatality. Wallsten and Kosec classify these injuries by severity and assign welfare costs

based on estimates of the willingness to pay to avoid injury. They add lifetime medical

                                               29
costs for injury treatment to obtain the economic cost of injuries. Their estimates imply a

cost of $9.0 billion per 7,153 injuries.

3.6. War Scenarios

     Table 8 describes several scenarios for an Iraq war that we consider in the present

value cost analysis. The scenarios differ in key respects: length of major combat phase;

duration, size and operations tempo of a postwar U.S. occupation force; fatalities and

injuries sustained by U.S. forces; and U.S. outlays for humanitarian assistance and

postwar reconstruction aid. For all scenarios, initial deployment commences in

December 2002, major combat commences in March 2003, and redeployment of the

invasion force takes three months from the end of major combat and is followed

immediately by occupation. Fatalities occur at a rate proportional to troop levels during

occupation, and injuries occur at the rate of 7.153 per fatality.

     These scenarios capture a broad range of pre-invasion views about the likely

outcome of a military intervention in Iraq.42 Scenario 1, the most hopeful, entails a two-

month major combat phase, a small-scale occupation that ends by December 2005, one

thousand U.S. fatalities, and relatively modest outlays for humanitarian assistance and

reconstruction aid. This scenario is consistent with the view that the Iraqi people would

welcome a U.S.-led invasion force as liberators – initially and after euphoria over

Saddam’s overthrow wanes – and that regime change and reconstruction would proceed

smoothly with little interference from terrorists, insurgents or outside powers. Scenarios

2 through 6 entail a progressively longer occupation, bigger occupation force, higher

operations tempo during occupation, greater casualties, and larger outlays for

42
  See Packer (2005), especially Chapter 4, for an account of influential pre-invasion
views about the likely course of a postwar occupation in Iraq.

                                              30
humanitarian assistance and reconstruction. The length of the major combat phase also

increases. Two variants each of Scenarios 4 and 5 differ in postwar reconstruction costs.

   Scenarios 1 to 3 describe considerably more favorable outcomes than Scenarios 4 and

5, which are in turn much more favorable than Scenario 6. In particular, Scenario 6

envisions an occupation force of 200,000 U.S. military personnel in theater through

September 2007 and a smaller force level through 2013, with forces engaged at a high

operations tempo throughout. Scenario 6 also entails 7,000 U.S. fatalities, about 50,000

U.S. injuries, and $60 billion in undiscounted costs for humanitarian assistance and

reconstruction aid. Scenario 7 describes an even worse outcome: a dangerous new

regime emerges in Iraq after a long and costly occupation, and the U.S. reverts to its pre-

war containment policy.



4. War Versus Containment: Direct U.S. Costs

4.1. Valuing the Policy Options

    War and containment are two strategies for responding to the threats posed by a

dangerous regime in Iraq. Under each strategy, the United States (and other intervening

powers) incurs a stream of costs over time to produce benefits in the form of lowered

threats to national security. In this respect, war and containment can be seen as

alternative costly investments intended to produce a flow of future benefits. We initially

assume that the two policies are equally effective in dealing with the threats posed by a

dangerous regime. We also assume that at least one policy has a positive net present

value. Given these assumptions, the choice between policy options reduces to present

value cost comparisons. We seek to estimate the cost of establishing a stable regime in




                                            31
Iraq that does not threaten the national security interests of the United States and that

does not engage in large-scale oppression of its own people or others.

     We calculate the present value cost of containment as

                                   (Annual Containment Cost) (1 − λ ) R(i ),
                            ∞                                           i
                            i =0
                                                                                            (1)

where λ is the annual hazard rate for spontaneous regime change, and R (i ) is the

discount factor applied to containment costs incurred i periods hence. We use the annual

flow costs of containment reported in Table 2, and we assume that containment remains

in effect until Iraq undergoes a spontaneous regime change. Similarly, we calculate the

present value cost of the war scenarios in Table 8 as

                                           ∞
                                           i =0
                                                  (War Costs)i R(i ).                       (2)

To obtain the cost of occupation and casualties for the war scenarios, we rescale the flow

costs reported in Tables 6 and 7 based on force size, operations tempo and casualties.

     In selecting a discount rate for the present value calculations, a sensible approach is

to use the real time cost of funds facing the U.S. government. As of early 2003, the real

annual yield on ten-year inflation-indexed U.S. Treasury bonds was about 2 percent.43

We use this figure as our baseline discount rate. An alternative approach relies on expert

opinions regarding the appropriate social discount rate for public policy decisions with

long-lived consequences. Weitzman (2001) surveys about 2,000 professional economists

on this issue and finds a mean discount rate of 4 percent. To accommodate the

heterogeneity in expert opinion, he also fits a model to the survey responses and obtains a

43
   Sack and Elsasser (2004) provide evidence on the yields implied by inflation-indexed
U.S. Treasury securities. It is clear from their study that the difference between yields on
nominal U.S. Treasury securities and survey measures of inflationary expectations
implies a lower real cost of funds and, hence, a lower discount rate than the 2 percent
figure.

                                                      32
schedule for certainty-equivalent discount rates that declines with the time horizon – from

about 4 percent for 1 to 5 years hence to 3 percent for 6 to 25 years hence and 2 percent

for 26 to 75 years hence.44

     The appropriate discount rate also depends on whether the costs incurred under a

given policy are correlated with the opportunity cost of government funds in future states

of the world. This opportunity cost is likely to be higher when economic growth is lower.

We see no obvious reason for future costs under containment or war to be correlated with

future growth in an important way, but some readers may hold a different view. Hence,

we also consider higher discount rates in the calculations below, in line with the view that

the costs associated with a given policy are concentrated in states of the world with a

relatively high opportunity cost of government funds.

4.2. Present Value Cost Results

     Table 9 reports results for the containment policy. At a 2 percent discount rate on

future costs and a 3 percent annual hazard rate for regime change, the present value cost

of containment is $297 billion in our baseline scenario. If effective containment requires

extra military forces per the discussion in Section 2.2, the cost rises to nearly $400

billion. The precise cost also depends on the discount rate, the likelihood of spontaneous

regime change, and other details. Thus our analysis does not establish a precise value for

the economic cost of sticking with the containment policy. It does show that the

containment policy was an expensive option for the United States under a broad range of

reasonable assumptions. This conclusion holds even under the assumption, which we




44
  The recent economics literature develops several rationales for declining discount rate
schedules. See Groom et al. (2004) for a review.

                                             33
have maintained thus far, that containment would remain completely effective in

protecting U.S. national security interests.

     Table 10 reports results for the war scenarios. At a 2 percent discount rate, the cost

of war ranges from $106 billion in Scenario 1 to $872 billion in Scenario 7.45 The

present value cost is $320 billion for Scenario 4(b), which involves an occupation force

that declines from 200,000 troops in September 2003 to zero in October 2008, $56 billion

in undiscounted costs for postwar aid, 4,000 fatalities and nearly 30,000 injuries. More

generally, Table 10 shows that the duration and size of the postwar occupation have a

profound effect on the overall cost of the war option. For example, the cost of Military

Resources Engaged in Occupation ranges from $35 billion in Scenario 1 to $153 billion

in Scenario 4 and $410 billion in Scenario 6. The intensity of postwar conflict also has a

large impact on U.S. costs related to casualties and reconstruction aid.

     In sum, our analysis shows that both containment and war were costly policy options

for the United States. The analysis also identifies key factors that influence the cost of

each policy option. For example, the expected duration of a hostile regime in Iraq, absent

war, has a dramatic effect on the cost of containment. To see this point, consider our

baseline containment scenario with a 2 percent discount rate and a 3 percent hazard rate

for peaceful regime change. Raising the hazard rate to 5 percent lowers the cost of

containment from $297 billion to $212 billion. Lowering the hazard rate to 2 percent

raises the cost of containment to $371 billion. Hence, under the containment option,




45
  Table 10 is based on the Heavy Air Option in CBO (2002). The Heavy Ground Option
involves an extra $11 billion to $16 billion in present value costs, depending on the
length of the major combat phase.

                                               34
policies or developments that promote peaceful regime change generate large economic

benefits for the United States.

    How costly will the Iraq intervention ultimately become for the United States, both

in absolute terms and relative to containment? As of January 2006, it appears quite

possible that the Iraq intervention will ultimately unfold along lines similar to Scenario

5(a), though perhaps with fewer U.S. casualties. At a 2 percent annual discount rate, the

projected cost of this scenario is $414 billion (in 2003 dollars) according to our analysis.

In comparison, the projected cost of containment in our baseline case is $297 billion. A

somewhat more pessimistic view about the cost of effective containment and the

likelihood of peaceful regime change yields containment costs similar to the $414 billion

figure. Thus, despite the undeniably high cost of the Iraq intervention, our analysis

indicates that containment may well have been equally costly for the United States.

    It also appears possible (as of January 2006) that the Iraq intervention will unfold

along lines not too different from Scenario 6, though with fewer U.S. casualties. The

projected cost of Scenario 6 is $633 billion. It is hard to argue that continued containment

would have involved comparable or greater expected economic costs for the United

States than an intervention experience similar to Scenario 6, unless one dispenses with

the assumption that containment would be fully effective in protecting U.S. national

security interests. We take up that issue in Section 5.

4.3. Departures from Constant Supply Costs

   In the cost calculations above, we assume constant supply costs within the relevant

range for all military inputs. This assumption is less appealing when war involves an

extended, intense engagement that leads to shortages of critical equipment, higher costs




                                             35
of recruiting and retention, reductions in the combat effectiveness of U.S. troops, or an

impaired ability to meet other national security threats. News reports of body armor

shortages, under-armored transport vehicles, missed recruiting targets and large re-

enlistment bonuses suggest that the Iraq engagement has been big enough and long

enough to move the United States up the supply schedule for its ground forces. Cutting

the other direction are static scale economies achieved by large-scale operations and

dynamic scale economies that arise from learning by doing on the battle field. News

accounts suggest that U.S. military experience in the Gulf War of 1991 and later in

Bosnia, Kosovo and Afghanistan led to improvements in the combat effectiveness of U.S.

forces. The Iraq intervention is also likely to be a source of lessons, albeit hard-won, that

will improve the effectiveness of the U.S. military in potential future conflicts. Of

course, opponents can also draw lessons from battle field experience. On balance, it is

unclear whether these departures from constant supply costs are quantitatively

significant, and which way they cut. This is a ripe area for careful research.

4.4. Nation Building and Post-Occupation Deployments

       Our analysis of the war scenarios in Table 8 is designed to assess the cost of

establishing a stable regime in Iraq that does not threaten the national security interests of

the United States and that does not engage in large-scale oppression of its own people or

others. Some advocates of the Iraq war have appealed to and argued for more ambitious

goals, e.g., transforming Iraq into a beacon of liberty in the Middle East and an exemplar

of market-based capitalism. These are worthy goals, but a serious effort to attain them

would probably involve significant additional costs for reconstruction aid and other

nation-building efforts. Achieving these goals would also yield benefits not factored into




                                             36
our analysis. For these reasons, our analysis does not deliver an assessment of the more

ambitious nation-building goals in connection with the Iraq intervention.

        A similar point applies to the longer term costs and benefits of a U.S. strategic

alliance with a new Iraqi regime. An analogy may be helpful in this regard. The United

States has maintained a significant military presence in Japan for more than sixty years

after the allied victory in World War II. It would be inappropriate to treat U.S. military

forces stationed in Japan decades after victory as part of the cost of victory. Instead, the

cost of these military forces should be weighed against their strategic benefits. Likewise,

if the United States maintains a military presence in Iraq after the defeat of insurgents and

the establishment of a stable, peaceful regime, it would be inappropriate to count those

forces as part of the cost of war in Iraq without also factoring in their benefits.



5. Concerns about Containment and Implications for the Cost Calculus

5.1. Concerns about Containment

    Many war advocates argued that the Iraqi regime posed an unacceptable security risk

in a post-9/11 world. Shawcross (2004) stresses Saddam’s obsession with WMDs, his

demonstrated willingness to use them, and the dangers of his potential collaboration with

terrorists:

          Now, in the early twenty-first century, threats have changed, and so must
     the responses to them. The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and of
     terrorists who stalk from the shadows and are susceptible to no kind of
     deterrence, alter the concept of imminent danger.
          … [T]here was no doubt that Saddam, alone among the dictators, had long
     shown an absolute obsession with obtaining such weapons [WMDs] and had
     actually used them. He had also refused to accede to more than a decade of
     international demands that he desist. There was ample reason to believe that he
     already possessed biological and chemical weapons capacity and that he would




                                              37
     seek to restart his nuclear weapons program if he were able. He had the
     knowledge and the intent – he lacked only the fissile material.
          … [W]hether or not [Al Qaeda and Saddam] collaborated directly, the very
     existence of a new global terrorist network made Iraq’s presumptive possession
     of WMD much more threatening. Theoretically it offered Saddam (and others)
     a way to attack the United States by proxy and perhaps without identification.
     Prudent policymakers could not ignore the fact that Saddam and Osama bin
     Laden shared a hatred of the United States. (Pages 69-70)

In fact, Saddam Hussein had a long history of harboring and supporting international

terrorists when it suited his purposes.46

     Pollack (2002, p. xxiv) stresses doubts about whether it was feasible to sustain an

effective containment policy: “Perhaps the single most important reason why the United

States must act soon to adopt a new policy toward Iraq is that our old policy, the policy of

containment, is eroding.” In support of this conclusion, Pollack points to Iraq’s eviction

of U.N. weapons inspectors in the fall of 1998, rising discontent in Arab countries and

Muslim communities over the basing of American military forces in the Persian Gulf

region, the erosion of sanctions’ effectiveness over time, and declining international

support for containment.47

     A related argument for pre-emptive action in 2003 stresses the potential for a future

military conflict with Iraq that would involve much higher costs. According to Pollack

(2002, pp. xv-xvi):

          In the case of Iraq, if we do not act soon to topple Saddam Hussein’s
     regime, we are likely to face a much worse conflict with Saddam down the road
     after he has acquired nuclear weapons and advanced conventional weapons. An
     invasion of Iraq in the near term, when Saddam has only a limited stockpile of
     weapons of mass destruction and his conventional forces remain weak, is likely
     to seem effortless and cost-free compared to a war with Saddam after he has
     crossed the nuclear threshold. Given Saddam’s propensity to miscalculate, his

46
  See, for example, chapter 7 in Coughlin (2005).
47
   This assessment has not gone unchallenged. See Lopez and Cortright (2004), for
example.

                                             38
     penchant for aggression, and his willingness to absorb horrific punishment, it
     would be a terrible mistake for the United States to allow him to acquire such
     capabilities and risk war with a nuclear-armed Iraq…. This book argues that war
     with Saddam’s Iraq is well nigh inevitable and that it would be far, far better for
     the United States to face this challenge sooner rather than later.48

Shawcross (2004, pp. 71-73, 93, 115-116) develops a similar argument. He applauds

Israel’s bombing of Iraq’s Osirak nuclear reactor in 1981 because it set back Saddam’s

efforts to acquire nuclear weapons. He also asks whether pre-emptive action against Al

Queda and the Taliban regime in Afghanistan would have prevented the 9/11 attacks.

     O’Hanlon (2002c) summarizes the state of affairs this way in September 2002:

          Saddam continues to have chemical weapons in abundance and probably
     biological agents as well, but we have already proved we can deter him from
     using these weapons over the past dozen years, and there is no reason to think he
     has transferred either type to al-Qaida. By contrast, a nuclear weapon is
     something Saddam almost surely does not now have, but that he might someday
     acquire – and that, if ever used, could clearly dwarf 9/11 in its effects. …
     [L]etting Saddam get a nuclear weapon and then seeing what if anything he
     might do with it is a social science experiment we can live without. Simply
     having such a weapon could give Saddam “defensive cover” for aggression,
     fundamentally changing the balance of power in the region.
          That, in a nutshell, is the case for a pre-emptive war. Whatever one thinks
     of this case, it should not depend on advocates producing a “smoking gun.”…
     Saddam is trying to get the bomb… [and] it would make more sense to fight
     before he had the bomb than after.

O’Hanlon also notes that “Iraq was disturbingly close – perhaps only months away –

from building a nuclear weapon at the time of Desert Storm” in 1991.

     But unlike Pollack and Shawcross, O’Hanlon favors containment over war. He

wraps up his essay by stating that “Even a war skeptic such as me must acknowledge that

48
  Pollack reiterated this argument shortly before the invasion of Iraq: “The choice we
have before us is we either go to war now or we will never go to war with Saddam until
he chooses to use a nuclear weapon and he chooses the time and place. The question for
me is not war or no war. It’s a question of war now, when the costs may be significant, or
war later when they may be unimaginable.” See “Some of Intellectual Left’s Longtime
Doves Taking the Role of Hawks” by Kate Zernike, 14 March 2003 issue of the New
York Times.

President Bush has a reasonable case when he describes the risk involved in Iraq’s

nuclear program. Rigorous inspections and disarmament would, to my mind, be an

acceptable solution. But to get that outcome, we may have to threaten war, threaten it

quite credibly.” O’Hanlon does not spell out the dimensions or costs of a credible threat.

   These arguments by Shawcross, Pollack and O’Hanlon – and related arguments by

many others – partly turn on underlying views and implicit assumptions about the

prospective costs of war and containment. To help evaluate these arguments, we extend

our analytical framework to consider concerns related to the cost of credible threats, the

effectiveness of containment, and the likelihood and cost of future conflict with Iraq

under a policy of containment. In the same spirit, we also consider how the cost calculus

depends on the potential impact of the war-versus-containment choice on the likelihood

of major terrorist attacks on the United States.

5.2. Costly Credible Threats

    There was widespread agreement prior to the Iraq invasion that an effective

containment policy required a rigorous program of inspections and disarmament. So

what did it take in the way of military resources to compel Iraqi compliance with an

effective inspections program? What constituted a credible threat forceful enough to

inspire Iraqi cooperation? Precise answers to these questions are not at hand, but the

historical record offers some guidance.

    Iraq repeatedly resisted the U.N. weapons inspections process, a fact evident from

the many U.N. Security Council resolutions on the matter. On 1 November 1998 Iraq

halted all cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors. Four days later, U.N. Security

Resolution 1205 demanded that Iraq “provide immediate, complete and unconditional




                                             40
cooperation” with inspectors and warned of the threat to “international peace and

security” posed by non-cooperation.49 Later the same month, the United States aborted a

missile strike on Iraq when its government agreed to cooperate with the inspections

process. After the Iraqi government failed to follow through, the United States and

Britain launched Operation Desert Fox, an extensive four-day aerial bombardment of

Iraqi targets. The U.S. portion of the operation involved over 40,000 troops, 300 aircraft

and 40 ships.50 Despite its destructive intensity, Operation Desert Fox failed to compel

the readmission of U.N. weapons inspectors to Iraq.

     In fact, weapons inspectors did not return to Iraq for four long years. It is instructive

to briefly recount the sequence of events leading up to their return. On 12 September

2002, President Bush addressed the United Nations, “challenging the organization to

swiftly enforce its own resolutions against Iraq. If not, Bush contends, the U.S. will have

no choice but to act on its own against Iraq.” On 11 October 2002, the U.S. Congress

authorized an attack against Iraq. On 8 November 2002, the U.N. Security Council

unanimously approved resolution 1441 calling for “tough new arms inspections on Iraq

and [providing] precise unambiguous definitions of what constitutes a ‘material breach’

of the resolution.” Resolution 1441 also warned that Iraq would face “serious

consequences” if it violated the resolution. By this point in time, the likelihood and

prospects of an Iraq war were major sources of concern and discussion throughout the

world. There was no doubt about the seriousness of the threat confronting the Iraqi

regime. In the face of this rather considerable pressure, Iraq finally relented and allowed

U.N. weapons inspectors to return on 18 November 2002.51

     This historical summary highlights two points. First, aerial bombardments on the

scale of Operation Desert Fox were insufficient to compel Iraqi compliance with a

rigorous inspections and disarmament regime. Second, not until the approach of a full-

scale, regime-ending war did Iraq finally relent and permit the resumption of a viable

inspections program. Credible threats of this sort are costly to mount.

     The same point applies to the occasional extra deployments required to deter Iraqi

aggression under the containment policy. For example, in October 1994 Iraqi forces

began massing near the border with Kuwait. The United States responded by rapidly

increasing troop levels in the Persian Gulf region to about 60,000 and by deploying

another 350 military aircraft and a carrier battle group to the region. Britain also

reinforced its military presence in the region. Faced with an impending attack by the

United States and Britain, Iraq withdrew its forces well away from the Kuwaiti border,

ending the confrontation. But two years later, in response to the mobilization of Iraqi

military forces and fears of an Iraqi attack on Jordan, Kuwait or Saudi Arabia, the United

States engaged in a similarly large deployment of military forces to the Persian Gulf

region.52

                                             42
    In light of this historical record, consider a containment policy that relies on costly

credible threats, as needed, to compel compliance with inspections and disarmament and

to deter Iraqi aggression. The present value cost of containment now becomes

            ∞
                  (Annual Containment Cost) + p ( Credible Threat Cost ) (1 − λ ) R(i ),
                                                                                  i
                                                                                           (3)
           i =0


where p is the probability that, in any given year, effective containment requires the

mounting of a credible threat. In calculating equation (3), we consider two values for the

cost of a credible threat, $13.05 billion and $26.1 billion. The latter figure is the sum of

deployment and redeployment costs under the Heavy Air Option (Table 6). We also use

the baseline annual containment costs of $14.54 billion (Table 2), a 2 percent annual

discount rate, and a 3 percent annual probability of peaceful regime change.

    Figure 1 illustrates how the need for costly credible threats affects the present value

cost of containment. For comparison, the figure also shows the present value cost of war

under scenarios 5(a) and 6. As seen in Figure 1, the probability and cost of credible

threats have important effects on the cost calculus. For example, the cost of war in

scenario 5(a) exceeds the baseline containment cost by about $115 billion, but this gap

vanishes if effective containment involves a 22 percent chance of mounting a high-cost

threat in any given year. Similarly, war scenario 5(a) and an effective containment policy

are equally costly, if there is a 44 percent chance of mounting a low-cost threat.

5.3. Limited Wars

    With some probability, an effective containment policy might require a limited war

against Iraq; i.e., a war that reverses or prevents some hostile action by Iraq but does not

proceed to forcible regime change, occupation and reconstruction. Contingencies that

might lead to limited war include Iraqi aggression against neighboring states, large-scale


                                               43
slaughter of civilians by Iraqi security forces, and information that Iraq was on the verge

of acquiring or building a nuclear weapon. Limited war followed by the resumption of

containment implies a present value cost expression with the same form as equation (3).

The cost of a limited war replaces the credible threat cost in (3), and p now refers to the

probability of a limited war in any given year.

     As illustrated in Figure 2, the prospects for limited war also have important effects

on the cost calculus. In constructing Figure 2, we assume that a limited war involves the

same level of military resources and U.S. casualties as Scenario 1 in Table 10 (excluding

the postwar costs and casualties). Recall that Scenario 1 involves the Heavy Air Option

with two months of major combat and 500 U.S. fatalities. Based on our earlier analysis,

the projected cost of such an engagement is $53.3 billion.53 Other assumptions

underlying Figure 2 are the same as in Figure 1.

     As seen in Figure 2, containment is as costly as war scenario 5(a) when there is a 10

percent chance of a limited war in any given year. Containment is as costly as war

scenario 6 when there is a 31 percent chance of a limited war in any given year.

5.4. War and Forcible Regime Change, Now or Later?

     Some argued for pre-emptive war and forcible regime change in Iraq on the grounds

that war was highly probable in any event and likely to be much costlier at a later date.

To assess the force of this argument, let P denote the probability of war and forcible

regime change in the next N years under a policy of containment, and suppose that the

undiscounted cost of a future war is m times the cost of an immediate war. Let pi denote

the probability of war in year i conditional on the survival of a dangerous Iraqi regime

53
  The sum of costs for Initial Deployment, Major Combat and Redeployment plus the
cost for 500 U.S. fatalities and about 3,600 U.S. injuries.

                                             44
through year i − 1. pi can be thought of as the conditional probability that the United

States faces a war of “necessity” with Iraq in year i.

    If p0 = 0 in the initial year (2003), pi = p > 0 for the next N years and pi = 0

thereafter, the probability of a future war of necessity under a policy of containment is

                                       N                              p 1 − (1 − λ − p) N
                           P= p              (1 − λ − p)   i −1
                                                                  =                                  ,   (4)
                                      i =1                                        λ+p

where λ is the annual hazard rate for peaceful regime change, as before. The present

value cost of the containment policy now becomes

                                                                       N
                  ( Annual Containment Cost ) 1 +                              (1 − λ − p )i R(i )
                                                                       i =1
                                                                           N
                  + p m ( Cost of Immediate War )                               (1 − λ − p )i −1 R(i )   (5)
                                                                         i =1
                                       ∞
                  + (1 − λ − p ) N              ( Annual Containment Cost ) (1 − λ )i − N R(i)
                                     i = N +1


Figure 3 applies equation (5) to illustrate how the present value cost of the containment

policy varies with the probability and cost of a future war. We allow for a possible war

in the next ten years, i.e., through 2013. War costs are based on scenario 5(a), and annual

containment costs are set to the benchmark value in Table 9. As in Figures 1 and 2, we

assume a 2 percent discount rate and a 3 percent hazard rate for peaceful regime change.

    Figure 3 show that the possibility of a future war can profoundly alter the cost

calculus. For example, if a future war is twice as costly as an immediate one, and the

probability of such a war in the next ten years exceeds 25 percent, then containment is

more costly than an immediate, pre-emptive war. If a future war is five times as costly

and occurs with probability greater than 8 percent in the next ten years, then containment

is more costly than immediate war. If a future war is five times as costly and occurs with



                                                         45
a 50 percent chance in the next ten years, then the present value expected cost of the

containment policy exceeds 1.1 trillion dollars.

    We think this analysis helps to understand the wide divergence of opinion about the

wisdom of the Iraq war. The precise probability and cost of a future war with Iraq matter

greatly for the cost of containment, but there is no sure method for assessing the

probability and cost of a future war. Even modest differences of opinion about, say, the

probability of a future war translate into sizable differences in the costliness of

containment. From this perspective, it is unsurprising that the decision to invade Iraq in

2003 and overthrow the regime remains a matter of intense controversy.

    Our analysis also highlights a problematic aspect of the oft-drawn distinction

between a war of “choice” and one of “necessity”. In particular, the analysis shows that a

war of “choice” can be highly desirable when it forecloses the possibility of a more costly

war of “necessity.” This statement continues to hold when the possibility of a war of

necessity is remote, provided that a future war is costly enough relative to an immediate

one. In this respect, there is no clean separation between a war of choice and one of

necessity. Of course, the mere possibility of a costly war of necessity at some future date

does not ensure that immediate war is the best policy choice.

5.5. Future Terrorist Attacks

    Views also differ widely about the likelihood that the pre-war Iraqi regime would

support or facilitate a major terrorist attack against the United States. For some, this

danger became a major plank in the case for war. Others dismissed the possibility of

Iraqi participation in a terrorist attack against the United States. Indeed, many argued

that war in Iraq raised the likelihood of a major terrorist attack against the United States.




                                              46
We do not try to settle these differences of opinion. Instead, we offer brief remarks about

the magnitude of the stakes.

    To gauge the potential cost of a future terrorist attack, it is helpful to review the

economic scale of the 9/11 attack. Bram, Orr and Rapaport (2002) estimate direct costs of

the attack on the World Trade Center – “comprising earnings losses, property damage,

and the cleanup and restoration of the site” – of $33 billion to $36 billion. Their

calculations understate the direct costs, however, because they equate the value of lost

lives to the value of foregone earnings. In fact, as common sense suggests and economic

analysis shows, a lost life is worth more than foregone earnings. Murphy and Topel

(2005), for example, estimate the value of a human life to be about three times earnings

capacity. Tripling the Bram et al. estimate of lost earnings yields a figure of about $50

billion for the direct costs of the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center. This figure is

highly conservative as an estimate for the overall costs of 9/11, because it omits indirect

costs associated with disruption to the U.S. financial system and the regional economy in

the New York area. The economic costs of a future terrorist attack could be considerably

larger, especially if it involves chemical weapons, biological agents or nuclear weapons.

    Suppose, for example, that a dangerous Iraqi regime raises the probability of a major

terrorist attack by 4 percentage points in any given year, and that the economic cost of

such an attack is $100 billion. These figures imply an expected cost from (additional)

terrorist attacks of $4 billion per year. Capitalizing this flow at the factor 1/(r + λ ) with

r = .02 and λ = .03 yields a present value cost of $80 billion. This is a sizable effect and

potentially large enough to tilt the scale in favor of war. Of course, if war raises the




                                              47
probability of a major terrorist attack on the United States, then the effect cuts in favor of

the containment policy.54

5.6. An Integrated Treatment of Costly Threats, Wars and Terrorist Attacks

     Costly threats, terrorist attacks, limited wars and a full-scale regime-changing war are

possible contingencies under a policy of containment. The analysis above considers

these contingencies one at a time; Table 11 considers all four at the same time. The table

shows present value containment costs for three new scenarios plus a scenario with no

contingencies as in Table 9. The table considers the baseline annual containment costs of

$14.5 billion and lower annual costs of $9.7 billion, annual discount rates of 2 and 6

percent, and an annual hazard for peaceful regime change of 3 percent. Our discussion

focuses on the baseline case with a 2 percent annual discount rate.

     In the “optimistic” scenario, a hostile Iraqi regime has no effect on the likelihood of a

terrorist attack, but there is a 5 percent annual chance that the United States mounts a

costly threat and a 3 percent annual chance that it fights a limited war against Iraq. These

contingencies apply so long as a hostile Iraqi regime persists. There is also a 5 percent

chance that the United States fights a full-scale regime-changing war against Iraq at some

point in the next ten years in the optimistic scenario, where the undiscounted cost of such

a war is the same as for war Scenario 5(a) in Table 10. Factoring in these contingencies




54
   Peaceful regime change under a policy of containment and forcible regime change as a
consequence of war need not have the same impact on the probability of a terrorist attack.
Hence, to quantify the present value cost of terrorist attacks under both policy options, it
is necessary to specify five parameters: the discount rate, the cost of a terrorist attack and
the attack probabilities under containment, peaceful regime change and forcible regime
change. One of the probabilities can be normalized to zero when calculating the net
impact of the war-versus-containment choice on the present value cost of terrorist attacks.

                                              48
yields a present value containment cost of $346 billion for the optimistic scenario, as

compared to $297 billion when all contingencies have zero probability.

   The “middle” scenario posits a greater probability of mounting a costly threat and a

greater probability of engaging in a regime-changing war. Credible threats and a regime-

changing war are also more costly in the middle scenario. Finally, the middle scenario

posits that the annual probability of a major terrorist attack on the United States is 2

percentage points higher with a hostile Iraqi regime. The economic cost of such an

attack, if it occurs, is set to $100 billion. Factoring in these contingencies yields a present

value containment cost of $441 billion for the middle scenario.

   The “pessimistic” scenario posits yet higher probabilities for all contingencies and

higher costs for threats, terrorist attacks and regime-ending wars. Factoring in these

contingencies yields a present value containment cost of $705 billion. We have

designated the assumptions that underlie this large cost figure as “pessimistic”, but they

seem well within the range of pre-war assessments offered by some knowledgeable

observers. This is not to say that these pre-war assessments were correct, but neither

were they easily dismissed. For those who held such views, or even more pessimistic

ones, continued containment was a highly unattractive option.



6. War versus Containment: Effects on Iraqi Economic Well-Being

6.1. The Economic Collapse under Saddam Hussein

   After Saddam Hussein became President and secured his position as dictator in 1979,

the Iraqi population suffered a catastrophic collapse in living standards – largely as a

consequence of Saddam’s rule. Nordhaus (2002, page 53) estimates that Iraq’s real GDP



                                              49
per capita (at 2002 prices) fell from around $9,000 in 1979 to $1,000-1,200 in 2001. The

upper figure for 2001 implies a staggering 87 percent decline in per capita output. The

most significant factors in the collapse were the devastating war with Iran in the 1980s,

draconian economic sanctions imposed on Iraq in response to its 1990 invasion of Kuwait

and its later refusals to comply with U.N. Security Council resolutions, and the

destruction of Iraq’s infrastructure during allied efforts to expel Iraqi forces from Kuwait

in 1991. The militarization of Iraqi society, the diversion of resources to Saddam’s

palaces and monuments, and declines in the relative price of oil amplified the collapse in

Iraqi living standards.

   After 1990, lost oil revenues alone were enormous. According to Nordhaus (2002,

page 53), “Under sanctions, oil production during the 1991-2002 period averaged 1.4

million bpd. Assuming Iraq could have produced 3 million bpd during this period, the

revenue shortfall since the first Persian Gulf War was about $150 billion.” The implied

average annual revenue shortfall of $12.5 billion is 40-50 percent as large as Iraq’s

estimated GDP in 2001. This figure for lost oil revenues is almost certainly too low, if

the comparison benchmark is a stable Iraqi economy with ready access to export markets

and international oil exploration and extraction technologies. Iraq’s oil production

peaked at more than 3.4 million bpd in 1979 and had been trending sharply upwards since




                                             50
1973.55 Further, as Nordhaus (page 72) remarks, “Experts believe that, if restructuring

operations can operate effectively, Iraq’s production capacity can be raised to between 3

and 4 million bpd within two years…. Iraq has enormous reserves relative to its current

production … [and] has negotiated $40 billion of contracts with Russia, China, and

France to develop approximately 5 million bpd of new capacity.”

     Much of Iraq’s greatly diminished output was diverted to an oversized military, an

apparatus of terror and repression and the relentless glorification of Saddam Hussein.

Pre-war Iraq employed nearly 500,000 persons in various intelligence, security and police

organizations and a total of nearly 1.3 million when the armed forces and paramilitary

units are included. All together, the various security organizations and military units

accounted for about one quarter of employment in pre-war Iraq.56 This militarization of

Iraqi society occurred principally under Saddam Hussein – the army rose from 180,000

men in 1980 to one million men (six percent of the population) in 1988.57 Despite the

sanctions imposed on Iraq after the Gulf War, the regime “embarked upon a series of

costly projects to build victory monuments and palaces for Saddam (fifty of them at last

count), which cost Iraq as much as another $2.5 billion per year…. Many of the fifty new

palaces Saddam has built for himself since the Gulf War have gold-plated faucets and

artificial rivers, lakes, and waterfalls that employ pumping equipment that could have

been used to address the country’s desperate water and sanitation problems.”58

      The foregoing assessment based on pre-war data sources is broadly consistent with

the analysis in Foote et al. (2004), four economists who worked for the Coalition

Provisional Authority in Baghdad, and who had access to additional data on Iraq’s

economy. They estimate that real GDP per capita at constant 2002 prices fell by 60

percent from 1979 to 2001. Living standards fell much more because of two other factors

under the regime’s control – the militarization of Iraqi society and the diversion of output

to Saddam’s palaces and monuments – and because of declines in oil prices after 1979.

Based on this review of the evidence, we conclude that real income per capita fell by

roughly 75 percent as a consequence of Saddam’s rule and the regime he established.

6.2. Assessing the Impact of War and Regime Change

      To assess the impact of regime change on Iraqi economic welfare, we consider an

extended transition period to a higher level of GDP per capita. During the transition,

output grows by enough to recover much or all of the declines in Iraqi GDP per capita

caused by Saddam’s misrule. Our analysis below treats GDP per capita as a measure of

living standards. However, since war and containment imply different time paths for



58
     Pollack (2002), pages 131 and 135.

                                             52
GDP per capita, we carry out the analysis in terms of economic “welfare”, which captures

current and future levels of GDP per capita.

       6.2.1. Baseline Model

    Let V T denote per capita welfare at the outset of transition, immediately after regime

change. The regime change may occur spontaneously or as the result of external

intervention (war). In the latter case, welfare is V T − W , where W denotes the direct one-

time impact of war on GDP per capita. Let V S denote per capita welfare under the

current regime assuming no external intervention.

    We make the following assumptions:

 (A1) Prior to regime change, GDP per capita grows at annual rate g.

 (A2) After regime change, GDP per capita grows at rate g plus, during an N-year

       transition period, an additional rate h.

 (A3) The extra component of the growth rate h during the transition period equals

        M 1/ N − 1, where M is a multiple of initial output (just prior to regime change) that

       captures the favorable long run effect of regime change on the level of GDP per

       capita.

 (A4) Absent external intervention, there is a probability λ in any give year of

       spontaneous, peaceful regime change.

 (A5) The discount rate applied to future income is a constant denoted by r.

       Under these assumptions, per capita welfare at the outset of transition is

                                   N
                                         (1 + g )(1 + h)    M (1 + g ) N +1
                           VT =                          +                     .           (6)
                                  i =0        1+ r         (1 + r ) N (r − g )

Given no external intervention, per capita welfare satisfies the following relationship:


                                                  53
                                       V T (1 + g )            V s (1 + g )
                         V S = 1+ λ                 + (1 − λ )              .              (7)
                                          1+ r                    1+ r

The first term on the right side is GDP per capita at the initial output level, which we

have normalized to unity. The second term is the probability of a spontaneous regime

change multiplied by the present value of welfare under transition. The third term is the

continuation probability for the current regime multiplied by the present value of welfare.

Solving this equation for V S yields

                                           1 + r + λV T (1 + g )
                                 VS =                                 .                    (8)
                                        [(1 + r ) − (1 − λ )(1 + g )]

    Using equations (6) and (8), we can compare the effects of war and containment on

Iraqi economic welfare. The ratio (V T − W ) / V S provides a convenient measure for the

impact of war relative to containment. When this ratio exceeds unity, war improves Iraqi

welfare relative to containment. Subtracting one from this ratio gives the impact of war

on Iraqi welfare, expressed as a percentage of initial welfare.

       6.2.2. Model with Foregone Growth Prior to Regime Change

    The baseline model of how regime change affects Iraqi welfare is conservative in the

 sense that it assumes identical long term growth rates before and after regime change.

 An alternative model allows for slower long term growth in the absence of regime

 change. So consider an alternative model with growth rate g S under the initial regime.

 For this model, assume that regime change brings about an N-year transition period to a

 higher level of income per capita and a higher long term growth rate g ≥ g S . In

 addition, assume that output growth foregone prior to regime change is never made up.

 In other words, the catch up process after regime change recovers the drop in output per


                                               54
 capita under Saddam, but it does not return the economy to its initial baseline growth

 path. This alternative model involves only slight modifications to the preceding

 equations. In particular, the g terms in equations (7) and (8) are replaced by g S .

6.3. The Effect of War on Iraqi Welfare

   We now use the model to project the effect of war on the average economic well-

being of Iraqis. For our baseline case, we assume a 20-year transition period following

regime change. We set M = 4 based on the evidence that Iraqi living standards declined

by 75 percent or more under Saddam Hussein. Given N = 20 years, this choice for M

implies h = 7.18 percent per year. As before, we assume that the probability of

spontaneous regime change is 3 percent per year. We set the long-term growth rate at

g = 2 percent per year, and we set the annual discount rate on future income flows at

r = 5 percent. We assume that the destruction associated with war amounts to 50 percent

of a year’s GDP.

   Plugging these values into the baseline model, we calculate that (V T − W ) / V S equals

about 1.5. That is, war raises Iraqi welfare by 50 percent relative to containment in the

baseline case. This is an enormous improvement in economic welfare. Table 12

quantifies the impact of war on Iraqi welfare for several alternative parameter choices.

The table shows that war leads to large gains in Iraqi welfare under a wide variety of

alternative parameter choices. Even in the least favorable case for war – involving

higher war costs, little catch up during the transition, and a high rate of peaceful regime

change – war leads to a substantial improvement in Iraqi welfare compared to a policy of

containment.




                                             55
    Table 13 quantifies the impact of war on Iraqi welfare in the model with foregone

growth prior to regime change. In contrast to the Table 12 results, we now assume that

regime change, whether peaceful or forcible, raises the long term growth of GDP per

capita by two percentage points. This modified model implies that war brings very large

welfare gains for Iraqis, ranging from 35 to 170 percent in Table 13. War has a more

favorable effect in Table 13 because regime change now has a positive effect on long

term growth.

   The results in Tables 12 and 13 strongly suggest that war is an economic blessing for

Iraqis compared to the alternative policy of containment. How is this possible, given the

obvious destructive consequences of war? The answer has two parts. First, the Iraqi

economy was in terrible condition before the war, and it would have remained in a sorry

state under the policy of containment. Second, as we discussed above, economic well-

being underwent an extraordinary collapse under Saddam Hussein. If, over the course of

a generation, Iraqis recover even half of the economic losses they suffered under Saddam

Hussein, then economic welfare will rise significantly as a consequence of forcible

regime change.




7. War versus Containment: Lost Iraqi Lives

   This section briefly reviews evidence on Iraqi casualties in the 1991 Gulf War, the

number of premature Iraqi deaths from 1991 to 2003 under the containment policy, and

the broader record of war, death and repression under Saddam Hussein. Our account

draws heavily on Pollack (2002) and Welch (2002). After reviewing the evidence, we


                                           56
reach a rough judgment as to whether continued containment would have saved Iraqi

lives compared to a policy of war and forcible regime change.

7.1. Lost Lives under Saddam Hussein

    The regime of Saddam Hussein was a ghastly enterprise that brought death and

torture to hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and others. Pollack recounts the following:

           200,000 Iraqi troops killed in battle during the 1980-1988 war with Iran, and

           another 400,000 to 500,000 wounded. (Page 24) Iranian casualties were much

           greater.

           In reprisal for Kurdish assistance to the Iranians, the Iraqi regime slaughtered

           Kurds and destroyed their homes in 1988 and 1989. “When the campaign

           finally ended in 1989, some two hundred thousand Kurds were dead, roughly

           1.5 million had been forcibly resettled, a huge swatch of Kurdistan had been

           scorched by chemical warfare, and four thousand towns had been razed.”

           (Page 20)

           The Gulf War initiated by Saddam “probably caused no more than 10,000 to

           30,000 Iraqi military casualties and another 1,000 to 5,000 civilian casualties.”

           (Page 139)

           In 1991, after the Gulf War, “anywhere from 30,000 to 60,000 Shi’ah were

           killed in the suppression of the intifadah in the south.” (Page 51)

           In 1992 and 1993, the regime drained about 4,500 square kilometers of

           wetlands in the south. “In so doing, [the regime] created an ecological

           catastrophe and destroyed the way of life of several hundred thousand Marsh




                                            57
              Arabs who had made their homes among the rushes and reeds for more than a

              millennium.” (Page 125)

              In addition, perhaps 200,000 or more Iraqis died after the 1991 Gulf War and

              the postwar intifadah through some combination of sanctions and internal

              repressions. (Pages 138-139) More than half of the premature deaths were

              children under five.

       The issue of child deaths under sanctions attracted much attention. Welch (2002)

provides an informative discussion and a helpful assessment of conflicting claims. He

cites Richard Garfield, Clinical Professor of International Nursing at Columbia

University, as the most credible source for estimates of how sanctions affected mortality

among Iraqi children.59 According to Welch,

            Garfield concluded that between August 1991 and March 1998 there were
       at least 106,000 excess deaths of children under 5, with a ‘more likely’ worst-
       case sum of 227,000. (He recently updated the latter figure to 350,000 through
       this year.) Of those deaths, he estimated one quarter were ‘mainly associated
       with the Gulf war.’ The chief causes, in his view, were ‘contaminated water,
       lack of high quality foods, inadequate breast feeding, poor weaning practices,
       and inadequate supplies in the curative health care system. This was the product
       of both a lack of some essential goods, and inadequate or inefficient use of
       existing essential goods.’… It seems awfully hard not to conclude that the
       embargo on Iraq has been ineffective (especially since 1998) and that it has, at
       the least, contributed to more than 100,000 deaths since 1990.

          All told, the regime of Saddam Hussein killed or caused the deaths of well over

half a million Iraqis. Under the policy of containment after the Gulf War, a reasonable

estimate is that 200,000 or more Iraqis died prematurely at the hands of the regime or as a

direct consequence of its policies – including its refusal to comply with U.N. Security

Council Resolutions and the diversion of oil revenues and other resources to construct

palaces and monuments.

          Despite their sobering quality, the raw numbers fail to convey the sheer horror of

the regime. Pollack succinctly captures some of the horror in a gut-wrenching passage

(page 123) that tells of gouging out the eyes of children to force confessions from parents

and grandparents, lowering victims into huge vats of acid, cutting out the tongues of

regime critics, the systematic rape of women and girls in front of male relatives, and

other extreme forms of torture and abuse.

7.2. War and Containment Compared

          How does the tally of human misery and repression under containment compare

to the likely consequences of war? Under the policy of containment in effect after the end

of the 1991 Gulf War, premature Iraqi deaths numbered at least 10,000 per year and

probably two or three times as many. If we discount future lost lives at a rate of two

percent per year, and assume a three percent annual hazard for spontaneous and peaceful

regime change, then a continuation of the containment policy could be expected to result

in another 200,000 to 600,000 dead Iraqis. In comparison, the Gulf War of 1990-91

killed as many as 35,000 Iraqis, mostly troops who died during a long and intensive aerial

bombardment by the United States and its allies.60 Iraqi troops might be expected to

adopt more effective tactics in reaction to their crushing defeat in the 1991 war. Or they

might be expected to fight harder in response to an invasion. Either way, a more



60
     Pollack (2002), page 139.

                                              59
effective response by Iraqi military forces would prolong combat and probably lead to

greater Iraqi casualties.

        O’Hanlon (2002a, 2002b) looks to the 1989 U.S. invasion of Panama and the

1993 U.S. engagement in Somalia to assess the probable loss of lives in a 2003 Iraq war.

Scaling up from these conflicts, he estimates that “Iraqi troop losses might be expected to

be anywhere from 2,000 to 50,000, with civilian casualties in the same relative range.”

He stresses that a key unknown is the willingness of Iraqi troops to fight. He also

cautions that Iraqi use of chemical or biological weapons against U.S. troops or its own

population could substantially raise Iraqi casualties. However, even his most pessimistic

projections involve fewer fatalities than the 200,000 to 600,000 expected premature

deaths that we project under a continuation of the containment policy.

        There is a great deal of uncertainty about the number of premature Iraqi deaths

under both war and containment. We think the weight of evidence points to a greater

Iraqi death toll from a continuation of the pre-war containment policy than from a policy

of war and forcible regime change. Perhaps the strongest reason to question this

assessment is the possibility that a post-war Iraq could devolve into an extended and

large-scale civil war. This possibility cannot be ruled out. What can be ruled out in light

of the evidence is that the leading alternative to war involved little loss of Iraqi lives.

8. Concluding Remarks

   Forcible regime change in Iraq has proved to be a costly undertaking. As of January

2006, it appears likely that the Iraq intervention will ultimately unfold along a path that

implies present value costs for the United States in the range of 410 to 630 billion in 2003

dollars. These figures reflect a 2 percent annual discount rate. They capture the

estimated economic costs of U.S. military resources deployed in the war and postwar

occupation, the value of lost lives and injuries sustained by U.S. soldiers, the lifetime

medical costs of treating injured soldiers, and U.S. outlays for humanitarian assistance

and postwar reconstruction. Pre-invasion views about the likely course of the Iraq

intervention imply present value costs in the range of $100 to $870 billion. Military

resources devoted to postwar occupation account for more than half the total costs except

in optimistic scenarios that envision a short occupation, little postwar conflict and a

smooth reconstruction effort.

    The high cost of the Iraq intervention is sometimes seen as a compelling argument

against the decision to forcibly overthrow the ruling order and install a new regime. This

argument is deficient because it ignores the costs of alternative responses to the national

security and humanitarian concerns presented by the pre-war Iraqi regime. A well-

founded verdict on the Iraq intervention requires, at a minimum, an evaluation of what

these alternatives would cost. We tackle this issue by assessing the costs of sticking with

the pre-war containment policy.

    Containment required the continuous engagement of a potent U.S. military force in

southern Turkey, the Middle East and the Persian Gulf. The United States devoted

roughly 28,000 troops, 30 naval vessels, 200 military aircraft and other equipment to




                                             61
Iraqi containment efforts prior to the pre-war buildup. We estimate the economic cost of

these military resources to be about $14.5 billion per year. Based on our assessment of

the likely duration of a dangerous regime in Iraq, absent external intervention, this annual

flow translates into an expected present value of nearly $300 billion. Hence, containment

was also a costly option for the United States, even under the favorable assumption that it

would be completely effective in achieving its national security goals.

    Advocates for forcible regime change in Iraq expressed several concerns about the

pre-war containment policy. Some stressed an erosion of political support for the

containment policy that threatened to undermine its effectiveness and lead to a much

costlier conflict with Iraq in the future. Others stressed the difficulty of compelling Iraqi

compliance with a rigorous process of weapons inspections and disarmament, widely

seen as a critical element of containment. And others stressed the potential for Iraqi

collaboration with international terrorist groups. To evaluate these concerns, we model

the possibility that an effective containment policy might require the mounting of costly

threats and might lead to a limited war or a full-scale regime-changing war against Iraq at

a later date. We also consider the possibility that the survival of a hostile Iraqi regime

raises the probability of a major terrorist attack on the United States. We draw on our

empirical analysis to assess the potential costs of these contingencies, but their

probabilities are especially difficult to assess with confidence.

    We show that any one of these contingencies can sharply raise the expected cost of

the containment policy. We also develop an integrated analysis that simultaneously

captures several possible contingencies under a policy of containment. The integrated

analysis focuses on three scenarios chosen to capture a range of views about the




                                              62
likelihood and cost of the contingencies. Factoring the contingencies into the analysis

yields present value costs for the containment policy in the range of roughly $350 to $700

billion. These large sums are in the same ballpark as the likely costs of the Iraq

intervention seen from the vantage point of early 2006. Thus, even with the benefit of

partial hindsight, it is difficult to gauge whether the Iraq intervention is more costly than

containment.

    We also consider the consequences of the war-versus containment choice in two

other respects: the economic well-being of Iraqis, and the loss of Iraqi lives. Based on our

analysis, we conclude that the war will lead to large improvements in the economic well-

being of most Iraqis relative to their prospects under the policy of containment. This

conclusion follows from some basic observations. First, the Iraqi economy was in terrible

condition before the war, and it would have remained in a sorry state under the policy of

containment. Second, the regime of Saddam Hussein was an economic failure of

tremendous proportions. The available evidence suggests that real income per capita fell

by roughly 75 percent as a consequence of Saddam’s misrule. In addition, much of Iraq’s

greatly diminished output was diverted to an oversized military, an apparatus of terror

and repression and the relentless glorification of Saddam. Third, the removal of

sanctions, the expansion of petroleum exports, large-scale reconstruction aid, and the

reintegration of Iraq’s economy into the world economy provide a strong basis for

economic gains – even in a society with serious institutional weaknesses. If, over the

course of a generation, Iraqis recover even half of the economic losses they suffered

under Saddam Hussein, then they will be significantly better off in material terms as a

consequence of forcible regime change.




                                              63
    The economic failures of the Saddam Hussein regime were not its greatest crimes.

The regime brought torture, repression, displacement and death to huge numbers of Iraqis

and others. We review some of the evidence in this regard, drawing heavily on work by

others. All told, the regime killed or caused the deaths of more than 500,000 Iraqis.

Under the policy of containment after the 1991 Gulf War, a reasonable estimate is that at

least 200,000 Iraqis died prematurely at the hands of the regime or as a direct

consequence of its policies, including its refusal to comply with U.N. Security Council

Resolutions and its diversion of oil revenues and other resources to palaces and

monuments. Had containment remained in effect, the historical record suggests that

premature Iraqi deaths would have continued indefinitely at the rate of 10,000 to 30,000

per year. There is, of course, a great deal of uncertainty about the number of premature

Iraqi deaths under either war or containment, but we think the weight of evidence points

to a greater Iraqi death toll from a continuation of the pre-war containment policy.

Perhaps the strongest reason to question this assessment is the possibility that a post-war

Iraq could devolve into an extended and large-scale civil war. This possibility cannot be

ruled out. What can be ruled out in light of the evidence is that the leading alternative to

war involved little loss of Iraqi lives.

    The question of how to deal with “tyrants, rogue states and terrorists who threaten

not only their own people but also others” is a profoundly difficult one. The stakes,

human and economic, are enormous. The policy options are complex and fraught with

uncertainty. And sound decision-making requires a daunting range of inputs and

analysis. Yet, precisely because the stakes are so high and the decisions are so difficult,

it is essential to systematically evaluate alternatives as an input to decision making and




                                             64
the formulation of national security policy. Our study is an effort to apply a systematic

approach to the evaluation of the two leading policy options on the table prior to the Iraq

war.

Source: Authors’ calculations based on data in CBO (2000), CBO (2001) and CBO
(2005b, Tables 2 to 5).

Notes:
   1. Except for Navy ships, straight-line depreciation rates in line (1) are based on
       equipment lifetimes reported in CBO (2005b). The figures are value-weighted
       means over different types of equipment. The straight-line depreciation rate for
       Navy ships is calculated as (8.5/300) based on the annual shipbuilding rate needed
       to sustain a 300-ship Navy, as reported in CBO (2000).



                                           73
2. According to CBO (2001, page 5): “[Operations and Maintenance] O&M
   spending for equipment includes the costs of the parts and fuel used by military
   units, as well as the costs incurred in maintaining equipment at large centralized
   maintenance facilities called depots. Parts include what are termed
   ‘consumables,’ such as washers, filters, and gaskets, and ‘depot-level reparables’
   (DLRs), such as spare parts, avionics, and engine components. Major overhauls
   at depots, which are public (DoD) or private (contractor) repair facilities, involve
   major inspection and repair of weapon systems; the costs for them include both
   material and civilian labor costs. The cost of military personnel engaged in
   operating and maintaining the equipment are not included in O&M spending.”
3. Data from page 1 and Figure 1 of CBO (2001) indicate that O&M spending on
   capital goods accounts for 7.4% of defense expenditures, which amounts to 39%
   of procurement spending. Applying the steady-state assumption yields an O&M
   spending rate equal to 39% of straight-line depreciation costs. Assuming that the
   ratio of O&M spending on capital goods to straight-line depreciation costs is the
   same for all types of military equipment yields the entries in line 2.
4. The extra rate of depreciation and maintenance in line (3) is calculated as the
   “increase in annual depreciation” for in-theater equipment divided by the value of
   the equipment, as reported in CBO (2005b). These estimates are based on U.S.
   experience in Iraq, Kuwait and Afghanistan in recent years. For Army and
   Marines equipment, the extra rate of depreciation includes an annual two percent
   loss rate for in-theater equipment. For Navy ships, we assume that the extra rate
   of annual depreciation and maintenance costs amount to 0.5% of the capital value.
   Depreciation rates for Army and Marines equipment are much higher in theater,
   because the equipment is used much more intensively. For example, miles per
   truck in theater are ten times as high as in peacetime use. Note that line (3) does
   not capture extra fuel costs due to a higher operations tempo for in-theater
   military equipment.
5. Line (5) reports our figure for the sum of depreciation, maintenance and operating
   costs for the military equipment devoted to containment. For Army and Marines
   equipment (mostly ground equipment), we use a much lower figure than line (3),
   because the operating tempo of ground equipment under containment is lower
   than the one reflected in lines (3) and (4).
6. The opportunity cost of capital in line (6) reflects a real interest rate on
   government debt of two percent. See Section 4.1 in the text.
7. Lines (8) and (9) report additional user costs of capital that we apply to military
   equipment deployed in an Iraq war over and above the costs for operations
   support projected by the CBO (2002). That is, the entries in lines (8) and (9) are
   not intended to capture the full user cost of capital in an Iraq war. Rather, they
   capture the portion that, in our judgment (based principally on other CBO
   sources), is missing from the prewar projections in CBO (2002).
8. For Army and Marines (ground) equipment, line (8) is the sum of straight-line
   depreciation in line (1) and the opportunity cost of capital in line (6). For aircraft
   and ships, we also add the normal rate of O&M spending in line (2) less 0.3
   percent for fuel usage during peacetime operations.




                                         74
9. For Army and Marines (ground) equipment, line (9) is a weighted average of the
    Army and Marines entries in line (4), less 0.3 percentage points for fuel usage
    during peacetime operations. We weight the Army entry three times as heavily as
    the Marines entry. For aircraft and ships, line (9) is the sum of lines (4) and (6),
    less 0.3 percentage points for fuel usage during peacetime operations.
10. The real user cost of capital in lines (10) and (11) are educated guesses based on
    adjustments to line (4) for fuel consumption and operations tempo. These figures
    include two percentage points for the opportunity cost of capital.

       aircraft in Marine Air Wings and Navy Carrier Air Wings.
   2. It is unclear whether helicopters are included in the CBO figures for “total
       aircraft.” Moseley (2003) reports that 1,666 U.S. aircraft (excluding helicopters)
       actually participated in Operation Iraqi Freedom, including some aircraft that
       supported operations but did not deploy into theater. The 1,666 figure includes
       655 fighters and 51 air force bombers.

Source: Authors’ calculations based on data in CBO (2000, 2002, 2005b).

Notes:
   1. Capital values for Aircraft and Naval Vessels are estimated by applying the
       method described in Section 2.1.2 of the text to the force requirements listed in
       Table 4. For this purpose, we assume that the figure for “Total Aircraft” reported
       in Table 4 is exclusive of helicopters.
   2. Capital values for All Equipment are based on the recent experience of U.S.
       ground troops. According to Table 2 in CBO (2005b), Army equipment use in
       theater in Afghanistan, Kuwait and Iraq during 2005 has a capital value of 31.34
       billion 2005 dollars for 100,000 to 150,000 troops. Using the midpoint value for
       number of troops and deflating by 5 percent to express in 2003 dollars yields
       $238,781 for the value of “Ground Equipment, Including Helicopters” per Army
       personnel in theater. Similar calculations using data in Table 3 of CBO (2005b)
       yield $154,286 per Marines personnel. (In computing this figure, we exclude the
       value of fighters and tanker aircraft operated by the Marines, because they are
       included under “Aircraft.”) We multiply the per person equipment values by the
       corresponding number of Army and Marines personnel listed in Table 4 to obtain
       the capital value of “Ground Equipment, Including Helicopters.” For Special
       Operations personnel, we use the per-person equipment value for Marines.

Notes:
   1. For “Personnel and Personnel Support”, we adjust the corresponding entries in
       Tables 3 and 4 of CBO (2002) by adding an estimate for the basic pay of active-
       duty military personnel. The adjustment equals the number of projected active-
       duty military personnel in CBO (2002, Table 2) multiplied by $51,223/12 per
       month. See footnote 8 in the text for our derivation of the average basic pay
       figure per full-time equivalent military personnel.
   2. According to CBO (2002, Tables 3 and 4), “Operations Support” includes “all
       incremental costs related to the operation and maintenance of air, land, and sea
       forces involved in the Persian Gulf. It includes costs associated with the
       incremental increase in flying hours and steaming days, such as costs for
       increased fuel consumption and repair parts. Operations support also include the
       costs of equipping and maintaining ground troops and purchasing equipment, as
       well as costs associated with command, control, communications, and
       intelligence. In addition, the category covers force reconstitution, which includes
       the replacement of munitions stocks and repair or replacement of damaged
       equipment, and the incremental cost of increased depot maintenance for items
       such as aircraft, tanks, and ships.”
   3. “Additional Capital Costs” are computed by applying the entries in lines (8) and
       (9) of Table 1 to the Capital Value estimates in Table 5. We assume that all
       equipment is engaged for three months during the deployment phase, that naval
       vessels and ground equipment are engaged for three months during the
       redeployment phase, and that aircraft are engaged for one month during the
       redeployment phase.

Notes:
   1. Panel A: Postwar occupation costs for Ground Troops in Theater are the sum of
       labor costs per person from Table 2 Panel A ($226,000 per person year) plus
       capital costs. Drawing on Table 5, we use a capital value of $238,781 per person
       for ground equipment. We apply a user cost of capital of 16 percent per year
       from Table 1 line (11) at a low operations tempo and 24 percent at a high
       operations tempo. In the high op-tempo case, we add another $10,000 per person
       year for munitions.
   2. Panel A: Postwar occupation costs for Naval Forces are the sum of capital costs
       for naval vessels and labor costs for naval personnel. Applying the same figure
       for capital value per ship as in Table 2 and a user cost of capital of 7.5 percent per
       year yields annual capital costs of $1.2 billion. Appling the same ratio of naval
       personnel to naval vessels as in Section 2.1 for the containment policy, and using



                                             82
     a figure $226,000 per year for personnel yields annual labor costs of $1.4 billion.
     Summing the capital and labor costs yields $2.6 billion.
3.   Panel A: Postwar occupation costs for Air Forces are the sum of capital costs for
     fixed-wing aircraft and labor costs for Air Force personnel. Applying the same
     figure for capital value per aircraft as in Table 2 and the user cost figures for
     aircraft from lines (10) and (11) of Table 1 yields annual capital costs of $1.9 –
     2.2 billion, depending on operations tempo. Applying the same ratio of Air Force
     personnel to fixed-wing aircraft as in Section 2.1 for the containment policy, and
     using a figure $226,000 per year for personnel yields annual labor costs of $2.9
     billion. We sum the capital and labor costs to derive the figures reported in the
     table, adding another $300 million for munitions under a high operations tempo.
4.   Panel A: “Occupation costs per 100,000 armed forces in theater” are calculated as
     “Total occupation costs” divided by 118,962 armed forces.
5.   Panel B: “Occupation costs per 100,000 armed forces in theater” are calculated
     using the All-in Costs per Person-Year for Army, Navy and Air Force personnel
     reported in Panel B of Table 2. The force composition (ground troops, naval
     personnel, air force personnel) is the same as in Panel A.
6.   Panel C: The projected cost range for Humanitarian Assistance is from Nordhaus
     (2002, page 67), and the projected cost ranges for Reconstruction Aid are from
     U.S. House Budget Committee (2002, page 22) and (2003, page 2).
7.   Panel D: The figure of $6.9 million per fatality is the midpoint value of a
     statistical life in the studies reviewed by Viscusi and Aldy (2003), as reported in
     Wallsten and Kosec (2005) and adjusted to 2003 dollars. Based on experience
     through August 25, 2005 for U.S. military personnel and contractors, the Iraq
     engagement has involved 7.153 injuries per fatality. Wallsten and Kosec classify
     these injuries by severity into several categories and assign welfare costs based on
     estimates of the willingness to pay to avoid injury. They add lifetime medical
     costs for injury treatment to obtain the economic cost of injuries, discounting
     future medical costs at 5 percent annual rate.

Common assumptions for Table 8 scenarios:

   1. Initial deployment commences in December 2002, major combat commences in March 2002, and redeployment concludes
      three months after the end of major combat.
   2. Costs of initial deployment, major combat and redeployment of forces engaged in major combat as specified in Table 6.
   3. Occupation force levels and costs commence immediately following redeployment phase. For example, if the major combat
      phase lasts two months, then post-war occupation costs commence in August 2003.
   4. Fixed ratio of ground troops to Navy and Air Force personnel during occupation phase, as specified in Panel A of Table 7.
   5. Occupation costs as specified in Panel A of Table 7.

Notes:
   1. Annual costs are computed as the average of the Method 1 and Method 2 cost
       calculations summarized in Table 2. Relying on Method 1 only yields annual and
       present value cost figures that are 22.5 percent smaller.
   2. The present value cost of containment is calculated according to equation (1) with
       λ = .03 and exponential or gamma discounting, as indicated. λ is the annual
       hazard rate of spontaneous transition from a dangerous to a benign regime in Iraq.
   3. Under exponential discounting, R(i ) = (1 + r )− i for i = 0,1, 2,.... Under gamma
                                           −z
       discounting, R(i ) = 1 + iσ 2 / µ        , where z = ( µ / σ ) 2 . The gamma discounting
      parameters are drawn from Weitzman (2001). The implied effective discount rate
      is 4 percent per year initially and declines for more distant years.
   4. The impact of expected regime duration can be read from Table 8 by recognizing
      that, to a close approximation, the present value cost of containment under
      exponential discounting depends on the sum of the hazard rate and the discount
      rate. For example, the present value cost of containment at a hazard rate of .03
      and a discount rate of .04 is nearly the same as the present value cost at a hazard
      rate of .05 and a discount rate of .02.

Note: The present value calculations are carried out using an expanded version of
equation (5) in the text with λ = .03 . Regime change, whether peaceful or forcible,
eliminates the possibility of additional threats or wars and reduces the (relative)
probability of terrorist attacks to zero.
