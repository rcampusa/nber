    Using data from the NBER survey of Inner City youth and the
National longitudinal survey of young men this paper examines the
effect of church—going and other aspects of the background of youth on
their allocation of time, socially deviant behavior, and labor force
behavior.

     1)Church—going is associated with substantial differences in the
     behavior of youths, and thus in their chances to 'escape' from inner
     city poverty. It affects allocation of time, school—going, work
     activity, and the frequency of socially deviant activity.

     2)The diverse background factors examined in this study have
    different effects on various outcomes. Their differential effects
    suggest true causal impacts, with for example, the proportion of a
    youth's family working having positive effects on his labor market
    activity but not on other activities.

    3)In addition to church going, the background factors that most influence
    'who escapes' are whether other members of the family work and whether the
    family is on welfare.

    4)The allocation of time and activities by youth is significantly influenced
    by market opportunities (or perceptions thereof). Those youths who
    believe it is easy to find a job are more likely to engage in socially
    productive activities than others. Youths who see many opportunities
    to make money illegally are less likely to engage in socially
    productive activities than other youths.

      The 1970s was a period of severe economic plight for inner—city black

 youth that went beyond the worst nightmares of even pessimistic social analysts.

 Rates of unemployment of young black men rose to unprecedented levels; labor

 participation rates fell; and as a consequence the ratio of employment to popu-

 lation plumetted to extraordinary low levels. In 1980, even before the major

recession of the early l980s, the unemployment rate stood at 39% for

 16—19 year old black men and at 24% for 20—24 year old black men compared to

16% and 11% for 16—19 year old and 20—24 year old white men, respectively.

Civilian labor participant rates were 32%, 56% and 79% for black men aeed 16—17,

18:19 and 20—24 compared to 54%, 74 and 77 for white men in the same age

brackets.1 Over the same period, crime rates rose amon2 black
                                                              youths, and
problems of drug addiction and alcoholism worsened.

    Many observers in both the academic community and in the black coimnunitv

expressed serious concern about the potential loss of a large p'rtion of an

entire generation of inner city youths to the labor force and normal society.2

    While the number of youths who lacked jobs was unprecedented, a significant

number still managed to surmount the socio—economic problems facing them to

advance in the society. Some did well in high school and went on to college.

Some obtained work and held down regular well—paying jobs in the mainstream

economy. Some escaped the often pathological environment of inner city   slums.
    What are the characteristics of these youths? How important are person:d

and family factors in their surmounting the burden of being raised in the worst

slums in the country? What determines 'who escapes'?

    This paper examines these questions with data from the 1979—80 Nation]

Bureau of Economic Research—Mathematjca survey of inner—city black youth,
                                 —.)—




(NBER) and from the 1979—81 National Longitudinal Survey of Young Men, (NLS).

The NBER Survey had the advantage of gathering information on youths' allocation

of time in a day and on socially deviant behavior (crime, drug use) in

addition to standard school and work questions. The NLS data permits comparison

of young blacks and whites not possible with the NBER Survey.

    The primary finding of the study is that even in relatively homogenous

inner city poverty areas there is enough diversity in the measured backgrounds

of youths for certain aspects of youths' background to provide remarkably

good predictions about 'who escapes'.   There is also some indication that

at least part of the background—achievement relation among young black men

represents a 'true' causal link rather than a sorting of youths by background

and achievement.

     More specifically, ensuing empirical analysis shows:

     1) The principal variable on which the paper focuses, church—going, is

associated with substantial differences in the behavior of youths, and thus in

their chances to "escape" from inner city poverty. It affects allocation of

time, school—going, work activity, and the frequency of socially deviant

activity. While it is difficult to determine the causal links by which

church—going affects behavior——in particular, whether church—going is simply

an indication that youths are "good kids" or whether it truly alters behavior——

the pattern of statistical results suggests that at least some part of the church-

going effect is the result of an actual causal impact. At the least, the

effect of church—going is not due to general "good attitudes" by church—going

youth nor to those youths having better market opportunities than others.

     2) The diverse background factors examined in this study do not have
                                     —3—



 comparable effects on various outcomes. Some significantly influence certain

 outcomes, and not others, which rejects the notion that all the background

 factors measure is a single unobserved family—person
                                                        heterogeneity factor.
 Indeed, the differential effects of the background factors suggest true causal

 impacts, with for example, the proportion of a youth's family workirhaving

positive effects on his labor market activity but not on other activities.

     3) In addition to church—going, the background factors that most

influence 'who escapes' are whether other members of the family work and

whether the family is on welfare. By contrast, youths from homes in which

both parents were present at age 14 do only marginally better than those from

homes in which only one parent is present at that age, implying that by

itself, the female headed home is not a major deterrent to socioeconomic

success. In addition, having some males in the household who are not employed

appears to have negative effects on some outcomes.

     4) Youths'allocatjon of time and other activities are significantly

influenced by market opportunities (or perceptions thereof), with those who

believe it is easy to find a job if they had to find one more likely to engage

in socially productive activities than others, and youths who see many

opportunities to make illegal money less likely to engage in socially produc-

tive activities than other youths.

     The paper is divided into four sections. Section one describes the

outcome and background variables on which the analysis focuses, in particular

the unique NBER Survey data on the allocation of time by inner citY black

youths. Section two presents the results of least squares regressions linking

the outcome variables to various measures of the background of youths.
                                 —4—



Section three probes the possible routes by which church—going influences

behavior, in particular whether church—going operates through (or stands for)

religious (other) attitudes and general market factors. Section four

discusses the possible causal significance of the estimated links ——   that   is,

whether the estimates reflect the "true" Impact of the independent variables

or whether they reflect sorting or selectivity of youths by background and

outcome.

 I. Outcome and background Variables

      The first step in evaluating the socioeconomic success of inner city

 black and other youth is to develop a set of Outcome variables relevant to

 their position in life. Commonly used variables, such as school—work activi-

 ties questions on the Current Population Survey, while useful, are far from

 adequate in judging youth. Classifications like "out—of—the—labor_force" or

 "unemployed" provide little information on the activities of youth: they tell

 us what youths are not doing with their time, rather than what they are doing.

 Even when youths report themselves employed at a given wage, the information

 is potentially less valuable than      comparable information for adults. This
is because of the high mobility and change in status early in the work life.

     Accordingly, this paper will treat several nonconventional measures of

what youths do (two measures of their allocation of time, and several measures

of deviant activity), as well as standard outcome variables.


Time allocation

     Since in principle the allocation of a youth's time provides the most

complete measure of his behavior, particular attention
                                                          will be given to the
daily activity and monthly time line questions in the NBER Survey. In the

daily activity module of the
                               questionnaire, youths were asked what their main
and other activities were in a 24—hour weekday.3
                                                    Responses to this question
provide us with our best picture of what
                                            Out—Of—school not employed youth are
doing with themselves. In the monthly time line the principal activity of

youths in each month over the past year was organized on
                                                             a monthly basis.4

Responses to this question provide us with our best picture of the changing

activities of youth over time.

    Pigure1 summarizes the responses to the two time allocation questions for
                                 —6—




all youths, for out—of—school youths (at the time of the survey) and for not—

employed out—of-school youth. Taking the average allocation of months first,

panel A shows the division of main activities among employment, school, looking

for work, and other activities. For the sample as a whole just one—third of the

months are spent at work, just about a third in school or in training programs, and

nearly a third in other activities, primarily looking
                                                        for work. For the out

of school youths, only 42% of months are spent at work and 9% at school/training,

leaving half of their tine in other activities.   Most disturbing of all, those

not employed and out of school at the time of the survey spent just over 20%

of their months in the previous year at work and 35% in the fruitless search

for work.

     The daily diary questions asked youths their main activity during and, also,

as noted, other activities they did at the same time. There are several ways

in which one might analyse dual use of time. For descriptive purposes, we

have simply recorded allocation of time across main activities (panel B) and the

allocation of time across main and supplementary activities (panel C) in the

figure. Both sets of figures show that, on a daily basis, proportionately

less time is spent on earning or learning or on searching for a job than is

indicated in the monthly time line. This is because these activities,

while being the major activity in a month, do not take up all of the youths' time.

For the out of school not employed youths, no more than 2 hours a day can

be classified as likely to be socially productive. The major activity is

 "hanging out/talking with friends" and "watching TV/movies."   While from

 one perspective these are consumption activities, the youth are not the

 idle rich. They are in the part of their life cycle where investments
                                         7




 in human capital, either in school or on the job, are traditionally made for

 long tel-rn economic advancement.

 Other outcome measures

        Table 1 records the mean values of some standard measures of socioeconomic

 Outcomes such as unemployment and wages, and of selected measures of deviant

 behavior, notably criminal activity, drug, and excessive alcohol usage, in the

 NBER Survey and, where available, for black and white youths in the NLS

Survey as well.

       The data on labor force status show, as one might expect, that the NBER

youths are in a markedly worse position in the job market than all black
youths and all white youths.             38% of the NBER sample were

employed in the survey week; and just 48% of the out—of—school group were

employed. Consistent with studies based on Current Population Survey data

(Freeman and Medoff), the NBER data show that the low percentage of youths

working is due as much to low labor participation as to high unemployment.

By   contrast the wage   figures for 1979—1980 show their wages differ only

modestly from the wages paid other youths in 1980, with much of the observed

difference due to the difference in periods covered (late 1979—

early 1980 in the NBER vs late 1980 in the NLS).

       Perhaps the most surprising statistics in the table relate to socially

deviant     behavior. While   the youths in the NBER show considerable illegal

activity,     drug—taking, and drinking, both blacks and white youths in the   NLS

show   as   much or more such activity.5 Some of this is explicable (whites have

more to spend on drugs) but other differences are hard to understand nd may

reflect self—reporting biases for reasons that are difficult to undorstand.

Some studies of self—reporting of socially deviant activities show an
                                       8




underestimate by black youths, (Hindelang), which might explain the results

in the NBER,   but   not the high proportions of crime reported in the

NLS.

       Finally, the evidence on income and work over the year shows some dif-

ferences and similarities among the groups. For all youths, annual incomes are

relatively similar, and NLS incomes are close to the weekly consumption expenditures

reported in the NBER survey ($4025         83 x 52). For all youths out of school and not

employed the main difference is between blacks and whites in the NLS, while

the NBER sample has comparable earnings to the NLS whites. For al]. youths out

of school the lack of employment among blacks in both the NBFR and NLS surveys

produces lower incomes compared to that for white youths.

       In judging the earnings andconsumption figures, it is important to

remember that the vast majority of the black youths in the NBER sample are living

with their parent(s), so that housing and at least some food and clothing

are presumably paid for by the parent. From this perspective, the incomes

and spending are of a magnitude comparable to that of college students

 (ignoring tuition charges). The problem is less one of low income for

persons in the relevant age group as one of lack of productive allocation

of time, as indicated in figure'.l.


Measures of background

       Most studies of the impact of background factors on soclo—economic

achievement focus on the education or occupation of the individuni's parents

and on whether they are brought up in a one—parent (female—headed) or two

parent family.        Some look at family income.    Some look at related measures

 of the position of the family: whether the family is on welfare or resides

 in a public housing project.6 The NBER survey supplements these standard
                                       9




variables with information on two other aspects of background which may be

important for inner—city youth from low poverty backgrounds: whether or not

other members of the family are engaged in fruitful activity, notably working;7

and whether or not the youth is involved with potentially supportive social

institutions, in particular, organized religion in the form of the church.

Church—going differs from the usual family measures of background because it

reflects the individual's relation to a broader institution.8

     For this reason, and because of the importance of the black church

in the black cotnmunlty,91 pay particular attention to the impact of church-

going on the achievement of black youths in this study.

     Table2 records the mean level of the various background variables of

interest in the NBER and NLS samples. By virtually all of the measures, the

ordering of the groups of youths is the same: the inner city black

youths have the most disadvantaged background, the black youths In the NLS are at

a somewhat lesser disadvantage, while the whites in the NLS have the most advantage.

background. For example, just 43% of the youths in the inner city sample

report living with both parents at age 14 compared to 58% of black youths

in the NLS and 84% of white youth in the NLS. Nearly a third of the NBFR

group reside In public housing projects compared to 10% of all black youths

and just 17% of all white youths in the NLS. Church—going shows a similar

pattern, with proportionately more inner city youths never attending and

fewer attending once a week or more than other youths. In short, there is

no doubt that by measures of background, the inner city youths in the NBER

are the most disadvantaged, far more so than the average black youth.

     The next question is: do the background variables, particularly church-

going,   affect   the Outcomes described earlier?

II. Impact   of Background
    To determine whether or not background factors are important determinants

of which young inner city blacks 'escape' from the potential pathologies of

the inner city slums, I estimated least squares regressions linking the

outcome variables to the background variables. Such regressions do not, it

is important to recognize, tell us whether background factors 'cause'

outcomes or whether good (bad) background and good (bad) outcomes go together
                                                                              It
for other reasons —— such as a sorting of hetereogeneous persons/families.

does not imply that changes In a background variable will cause changes in

an outcome. To draw such an implication requires a structural model of

causality and treatment of possible sorting and other noncausal interpreta-

tions of the data. Least squares regressions are, however, essential to

any such more sophisticated probe of the data.

     Because none of the background variables are categorical, the way in which

one measures the responses can affect results (see Grether).   If one gives

the variable a numeric scale (6=highest response, 1=lowest, and so on),

monotonic transformations can, under some circumstances, alter regression

results significantly. If one enters the variable as a set of dummies

taking value 1 If the response is in the category and 0 otherwIse, one can

get a confusing number of coefficients.   What I have done is to transform

the categorical variables Into Z—scores, on the assumption that they reflect
                                  10
an underlying normal distribution. This is done for the church—going variable

In this section and for church—going and several other variables in section 3.

Time allocation

      Table 3 summarizes the results of regressions linking the percentage

of daily time and percentage of months spent on "socially productive" as
 opposed to "socially nonproductive" activities. In the hours calculations

"productive time" includes the following activities: working, searching for

work, travelling to work, school—going, housework, and reading; "nonproductive

time" includes: "hanging out, playing games, watching TV/movies, going to

parties, listening to music, getting high." In the month calculations,

productive time includes: months spent on a job, training, or in school;

nonproductive time includes: months spent in jail, unemployed, and so forth.

     The calculations reveal powerful and statistically significant impacts

for two of the background variables on youths' allocation of time. On the

positive side, church—going invariably raises the amount of time a youth

spends on productive activity while on the negative side, coming from a

welfare home invariably reduces the amount of time spent on productive

activity. The other background variables have more mixed impacts on the time

allocation of youths, with the proportion of males in the household generally

having a negative impact on time allocation while the proportion of the house-

hold working has in several cases a positive effect, due (as we s1iall see) in

large measure to its impact on work activity.

     Differences in time allocation between productive and nonproductive

activities reflect specific outcomes, such as committing illegal acts, going

to school, working, and so forth. By examining the effect of church—going

and of other variables on specific outcomes, we can get a better picture

of the routes by which the variables operate and some insights into their

possible causal significance. Accordingly, I estimated the relation between

the various background variables and socially deviant   activities, school—

going, and for Out of school youths, labor market activity.

    Table:. presents the estimated coefficients, standard errors, and

percentage impacts of church—going on the various outcomes. What stands
                                      12




out in the table is that church—going has a powerful negative impact on

socially deviant activity and a positive impact on school—going, but only

a modest positive impact on employment or time worked and

relatively little impact on wage rates or annual income. The pattern of

results is sufficiently comparable across the NBER and NLS samples to

give us considerable confidence in the result. It suggests that the major

effect of church—going is influencing or reinforcing the youths decision to

allot his time to activities with a future payoff and less in improving his

immediate labor market position. By increasing the time youths spend in

school, church—going ultimately will raise earnings and employment; it does

not have that strong an effect on the employment/earnings of current out-

of—school youths.

       Table 5 summarizes the estimated effects of other background variables

in terms of + or —     signs   for whether the variable has/does not have a

reasonably significant impact (t1.5) on the outcome measure. The pattern of

signs reveals some Interesting relationships. First, and most important,

note that the various background factors have dIfferen:ia1 effects on different

variables. Some, like being a gang member have a strong effect on deviant

activity and may Indeed be regarded as part—and—parcel of that activity while

others, notably proportion of adults working in the household, have rather

mixed effects, increasing deviant activity while also improving

the labor market position of the youths. Even the variable with th most

consistent pattern, coming from a welfare home, does not affect the wage rate.

What this suggests is that the results do not reflect a single background

factor   ("good" versus "bad" family backgrounds) but rather that the various
background factors operate in distinct and sensible ways. For instance,
a   family with a high proportion of adults working is likely to providi' less
                                    13




supervision of youth, permitting the increased socially deviant activity

obtained but at the same time is likely to provide the labor market Contacts

which h1t he youth in the job market (see Rees and Gray).

     in st.m, the evidence shows that church—going and other background factors

have generally substantial and plausible effects on outcomes but that

these effects are not uniform across outcome variables.. Instead they are

concentrated on some outcomes, giving plausibility to more complex and causal

analyses of the determinants of "who escapes".
                                   14




III. What Are the Routes of Impact?

    Finding strong linkages between background variables and who escapes

is just the first step in analyzing the impact of background on socio—ecoflOThiC

outcomes. An important issue, which will help us Interpret the findings,

relates to the routes by which the background factors affect behavior. Do
                                                                           or
they operate by influencing attitudes, as social psychologiests suggest,
                                                                      references,
do they operate by altering market opportunities, through contacts,

and the like? In this section I examine these questions using a simple

intervening variable path model. I introduce into fhe regressions of tables

3 an two types of intervening variables:      (1) variables measuring

attitudes or motivation (which can be interpreted as reflecting the

utility function of economics); and (2) variables measuring labor market

opportunities. Then I examine the change in coefficients on church—going

and the other background factors. If these new variables are significant

intervening variables, the coefficients on church—going and other factors

will decline. Alternatively, however, it could be argued that declines in

the coefficients Imply that the previous regressions give spurious results:

the attitude/market variables were omitted factors which belonged in the

equation In the first place. At the least, putting in a variety of

attitude and market variables into the equation provides a further

test of our conclusion that church—going and some of the other background

factors have, indeed, Important connections to outcome.

     To measure attitudes I have taken eight questions from the NBER survey.1'

The most important question used Is "how strong a role does religion play

in your life?", as it represents a related but alternative variable to church-

going. To the extent that church—going either operates through religious
                                      15




attitudes or is itself dependent on it, religious attitudes should enter

significantly and greatly reduce the impact of church—going. To the extent

that church—going reflects other forces, such as community connections,

reinforcement of modes of behavior, church—going should remain an important

factor.

     Measuring market opportunities Is difficult because, exclusive of the

city of residence (already in the calculations), the only information available

relates to the individual's views of the market and It is necessary to assume

that these views reflect the actual market rather than some mix of attitudes

and reality. The two most important questions which I use here are: "How

often do you have a chance to make money illegally?" which I have coded 1

if the person answered a few times a day/a few times a week and 0 otherwIse;

and "What do you think your chances of getting a job at this time?" which I

have coded as a Z—score variable. In addition, I included three other

measures of the market In the calculations.'2

     The effect of Introducing the vectors of intervening attitude and market

variables on the estimated Impact of church—going is examined in Table 6

which records coefficients of church—going with and without the Intervening

variables in the regressions and the coefficients on religious attitudes and

on the two major market variables. The regressions include all the other

variables used in tables 3 an 4 and the full set of attitude and market

variables listed In the table note.

    There are three notable findings. First is the general continued erfect

of church—going on outcomes in the presence of the additional variables.

Except Fbr Illegal activities and months employed, both of which were

reduced largely by the introduction of the market variables, the inclusion
                                  16



of additional variables barely affected the coefficients on church—going.

Similarly, the effect of other background variables was also almost always

not reduced by the addition of the attitude and market variables,

suggesting that the various sets of factors operate essentially orthogonally.

Second, note the general insignificance of the religious attitudes in the

equations (a result consistent with Datcher—Loury and Loury). It is the

act of church—going, not religious attitudes, which affects behavior.

This suggests that it is the role of church as a social institution which

underlies our statistical findings. Third, our market variables have

extremely significant and powerful effects on outcomes. Youths who have

many chances to make money illegally spend fewer hours/months on socially

productive activities, engage in more socially deviant activities and

work less while, by contrast, youths who think jobs are easy to find spend

more hours on productive activities, notably working.

     The continued impact of church—going and the other background variables,

despite addition of 'intervening variables' is in some ways encouraging

and in other ways discouraging. It is encouraging because it means the

relationships persist despite changes in specification. It is discouraging

because it means we have not been able to pin down the routes by which the

factors affect behavior.

 IV. Conclusion

                  "Those regressions impress me. Now I know what
                   to do to improve the economic position of inner
                   city black youth. Force them to go to church.
                   Kick their families off welfare. Get jobs for
                   their family members." —— Simple Activist

                 "These regressions tell us nothing about what
                  to do. All they show is that there are good
                  families and good kids and bad families and
                  bad kids in the inner city. The good ones
                  go to curch. The bad ones live on welfare.
                  The good ones will be good no matter what;
                  the bad ones will be bad no matter what. Put
                  a bad kid in church and he'll just disrupt
                  everything. There's nothing in the analysis
                  that says what to do." —— Simple Do—Nothingist



        The next question is to what extent, if at all, the estimated effects

of background variables reflect      true causal impacts as   opposed to a sorting of

individuals   and their families by unobservable "good" and "bad" characteristics.
To resolve the issue requires a      genuine experiment in which one changes the
relevant   background variable and observes ensuing behavior. For instance, one

could provide money to black churches to expand their membership and see whether

the youths attracted to the churches altered their behavior. In the absence of

such experiments, it is difficult to make more than tentative       inferences about
causality. Even    longitudinal   data, which   is widely used to control for fixed

unobservables, may not suffice because of the      possible endogeneity of   changes:

a family which on its   own accord   leaves welfare, a youth who   on his own accord

stops   going to church, is likely to behave differently than the randomly

selected experimental family/person in the ideal experiment. Difficult though

the causal issue may be, it is incumbent to address it, if only to highlight the

shortcomings of causal inferences from survey data of the type used here.

        In this section I probe, albeit tentatively, some aspects of the relation
                                         18



among church—going and the other variables to see if it is possible "to
wrest some intelligence from less than ideal information and to cope with

intrinsically refractory problems of conceptualization and model specifi-

cation"    (Duncan and Featherman, p. 230).
     One      potential   alternative to the section 2 and 3 analyses   of church-
going   is to look at it as a dependent variable, causally determined by

other background factors. If church—going is highly dependent on other

factors in a manner similar to Outcome variables, one might prefer to view

it as endogenous rather than exogenous. If there were plausible instrumen-

tal variables in the data set (which I do not believe there are) one might

further seek to instrument church—going on those factors.

        Table 7 presents the results of some calculations which relate church-

going to various explanatory factors in the data sets. While there are

some definite links between church—going and other factors, the pattern of

coefficients on the independent variables is different from that found in

regressions of other "outcomes" on those variables; having both parents

at age 14, for example, greatly raises church—going, while it had no

significant effect on outcomes; living in a public housing project reduces

church—going in contrast to its generally negligible effect on outcomes.

In the NBER survey, religious attitudes, which affected virtually no

outcomes,      is, of   course, closely related to church—going. While these

patterns of effects are not definitive, they do illustrate once more that

background factors have drastically different effects on different outcomes,

including church—going viewed as an outcome.

        All   told,   while we cannot reject the possibility that the effects of

church—going are noncausal, the patterns of regression coefficients are
                                   19



clearly inconsistent with relatively simple single factor "omitted

heterogeneity" explanations of its impact. At the least, more complex

factor models are needed, and here as elsewhere reliance on increasing

numbers of omitted factors to explain results calls into question the

noncausal explanation.

     Even if one rejects the causal interpretation of the relation found

in this paper, however, It is important to recognize that our analysis has

identified an important set of variables that separate successful from

unsuccessful young persons In the Inner city. There are a significant

number of inner city youth, readily identifiable, who succeed in "escaping"

the pathology of inner city slum life.
