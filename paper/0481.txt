                            ABSTRACT



     This paper prasanta a test for the existence o debt clieteles

in which the latter are represented by progressive personal tax brackets.

The test generates some evidence consistent with the implication of debt

clientele theory that, over time, firms' debt ratios should vary with the

relative tax incentives which their investors have to hold debt. Changes

in the relative structure of taxes, however, at best only partially account

for the time series behavior of debt ratios, especially in the case of

high debt firms.

                            TAXATION AND CAPITAL STRUCTURE




1.    INTRODUCTION

           An implication of Miller's theory [6] on the relationship between debt

      and taxes is the existence of financial leverage clienteles. Investors with

      low personal tax rates tend to hold the coon stock of highly levered firms,

     whereas high bracket investors hold the stock of firms with little or no 1ev—

      erage. Changes in tax structure affect investor preferences at the margin

     and; hence, the balance between the debt and equity clienteles. A change in

     relative taxes shifts the equilibrium level of debt for companies as a whole

     at the macro level.

          The existence of financial leverage clienteles has been tested for by

     Kim, Lewellen & McConnell [4] who found only weak supporting evidence. How-

     ever, their formulation of clienteles was based upon cross—sectional survey

     data äf individual investors and ignored institutional investors who hold about

     40Z of outstanding common stock. Since the institutional type with the great-

     est common stock holdings (pension funds) —   is   tax exempt, the omission of in-

     stitutions eliminated a major source of variation in the clientele distribu-

     tion. By contrast a strong association over time between relative tax rates

     -and the mean debt ratio of corporations was found by Grier and Strebel [2].

     Although   these results are consistent with Miller's theory, it is difficult

     -to draw any inference of causality since both the debt ratio and the debt in-

     centive tax ratio, measuring the gains from leverage, are subject to a strong

     secular trend.

          The purpose of this paper is to test for the implicit existence of sep-

     arate clienteles for corporations with differing leverage rations, by ex—
                                          —2—



     amining the relationship between the time series behavior of debt ratio

     deciles and various categories of debt incentive tax        ratio.   The latter

     are obtained from Miller's expression [4] for the tax        benefit   of debt,

     net of both corporate and personal taxes. Ranges of the debt incentive

     tax   ratio   are used to represent investor clienteles in the corresponding

     tax   brackets.   To test whether these tax   clienteles   are true financial

     leverage clienteles, two empirical hypotheses are formulated in Section 2.

     The data and the results obtained from the tests are discussed in Section 3

     and conclusions summarized in Section 4.



2.   TAX INDUCED SHIFTS IN FINANCIAL LEVERAGE CLIENTELES

           Although others have made the argument that the tax subsidy on interest

     payments at the corporate level may be offset by the tax subsidy on equity

     income at the personal level [1, 10], Miller was the first to analyze this

     question in a macroeconomic equilibrium framework. His theory is based on

     the following assumptions: First, the personal tax on capital gains is zero;

     second, there are no limitations on personal interest deductions, apart from

     the no arbitrage rule preventing borrowing to hold risk free tax—exempt bonds;

     and third, the tax    on ordinary personal income is progressive with a range on

     both sides of the corporate tax rate. Miller argues that corporations have

     an incentive to issue bonds provided that the tax savings associated with the

     interest payments offset costs associated with the higher interest rates

     necessary to induce investors to switch from tax—free municipal bonds to cor-

     porate bonds. The equilibrium level of corporate debt at the macro level

     is determined by the point at which the tax savings on interest payments are

     equal to the incremental interest needed to induce the marginal investor to

     hold bonds. This is considered to be the optimal macro level of corporate
                                      —3—



debt.    At the micro level, however, no optimal capital structure exists,

since owing to clientele switching, no company is able to increase its mar-

ket value by changing its capital structure.

        Investors who choose to lend, that is, bondholders, can be grouped into

two categories. The first consists of those with marginal personal tax rates

less than the corporate rate who prefer corporate bonds, because the tax sav-

ings at the corporate level exceed the additional taxes on interest income at

the personal level. The second consists of bondholders with tax rates greater

than the corporate rate who prefer tax—free municipal bonds. In addition, as

shown   by KLM (4), stockholders have an incentive in Miller's framework to
"demand extreme corporate financial leverage policies." Low tax bracket stock-

holders tend to gravitate toward extremely levered firms, because they obtain

greater tax savings by borrowing through the corporation than on their own

account. Those who prefer less risk exposure can unlever unwanted corporate

borrowing by purchasing corporate bonds and, thus, obtain the bondholder sur-

plus which is related to the difference between the corporate tax savings and

the personal taxes on interest income. Correspondingly, high bracket stock-

holders gravitate to firms with either zero leverage or net lending positions,

because in that situation they can reduce their tax rate on interest income to

the corporate rate. High bracket stockholders who desire to borrow do so on

their own account, because they obtain greater tax savings on personal than

corporate borrowing.

     A possible implication of extreme capital structure policies, is a bi-

modal distribution of debt ratios across firms. KLM found some evidence of

such a distribution. However, they find little additional support for the

existence of financial leverage clienteles based upon personal income tax

brackets. As previously suggested, this may be a result of their failure to

take into account tax exempt financial institutions. Their Inclusion would
                                            —4-

probably result in a clientele distribution across tax brackets not unlike

the distributions shown in Figures 1 and 2 of KLM's paper and Figure 1 of

this paper.

     In contrast to KLM's cross—sectional test based on somewhat problem-

atical survey data', we present an implicit longitudinal test of Miller's

debt clientele theory. The test Is implicit because we do not attempt to

identify directly the financial leverage clienteles. Rather, the hypothe-

tical clienteles are represented by progressive personal tax brackets which

are assumed to affect clienteles' net tax incentive to hold firms with vary-

ing degrees of leverage.

     Investors' debt incentive tax ratios are derived from Miller's [6] ex—

ression for the difference, 6, in the after tax present value of a before tax

flow of operating income through the levered and unlevered forms of the same

corporation:



     6 = 1 —                                                                       (1)
                    (l_TC)(l_ts)/(l_Tb)

where t   is    the corporate income tax rate, , the personal tax rate applic-

able to stock income, and 'b' the personal tax applicable to bond income.

When there are no taxes (t        =       = Tb = 0), the original Modigliani and Miller
(M& M [8]) result is obtained, while when only corporate taxes are considered

(Tb = Tb =     0,         0) the later M & Fl [9] result applies. Since 6 reflects the

firm's tax incentive to issue debt on behalf of its stockholders, we shall call

6 the debt incentive tax ratio. According to Miller's theory, changes in 6

should reflect changes in the degree of financial leverage preferred by investors
                                     —5—


     Given the relationship between tax rates in (1), a change in taxation

policy wilihave a differential impact on the investor clienteles in differ-

ent tax   brackets.   For example, an increase in the capital gains tax rate

will have a significant effect upon high income investors. Such an increase

in the capital gains tax rate relative to other tax rates, causes an increase

in the demand for debt and a reduction in the demand for equity, -   especially,
by high bracket clienteles. This creates a temporary disequilibrium in the

securities market, with excess demand for debt and an excess supply of equity.

The effect is a temporary increase in the price of debt and a decline in

the price of equity leading to a reduction in the cost of debt and an in-

crease in the cost of equity. Companies desiring to raise new capital take

advantage of the situation by selling more debt and less equity than they

otherwise would. This corporate reaction, of course, brings the market back

into equilibrium, but with a greater total amount of debt outstanding than

existed previously.

     In the absence of transaction costs, any firm could change its capital

structure to accommodate the shift in clienteles. and, thereby, re—equili-

brate the market. The affected investors would be able to revise their

portfolios without cost, In the presence of transaction costs, however, in-

vestors are better off, if the firms in their portfolio facilitate a minimiza-

tion of portfolio revision by altering their capital structures to reflect the

dhanges in tax structure. In effect, portfolio revision costs encourage

clientele loyalty. Tax induced changes in the degree of financial lever-

age preferred by investors clienteles should be correlated, therefore, with
the changes in debt ratio of the affected clientele firms over time.

     In estimating the clientele debt incentive tax ratio, 6, for a given

period, the marginal corporate income tax,       is assumed to be identical

for all corporations and is taken as the nominal corporate tax rate during
                                    —6—

 the period. The range of Tb the marginal tax rate on bond income is used to

delineate eleven different investor clienteles. Two consist of the extreme

cases (zero tax and the maximum personal income tax rate during the period).

The remaining nine correspond to nine equally spaced points between zero and

the maximum
              'b for the period. Two different estimates of   T, the   marginal
tax on stock income, are considered. First, it is taken to be zero and, sec-

ond, it is approximated by the maximum nominal capital gains tax rate for each

clientele. The first estimate is based on the argument that the marginal tax

on stock Income is close to zero, because the realization of capital gains can

be deferred and dividend income can be sheltered using the interest cost of

investor borrowing [7).

     The companies in the sample are ranked according to their initial debt

ratios at the beginning of the 15 year period and placed into 11 categories:

one category consisting of firms with zero debt and the remaining 10, compris-

ing equal deciles of approximately 60 companies each, based on their debt ratio

rankings. The correlation over—time between each clientele's debt inceztive

tax ratio and the mean debt ratio of each. financial leverage category is

then computed. Initially, the highest personal tax bracket is matched with the

zero debt companies, the lowest bracket with the most highly levered firms and

the intermediate brackets in sequence with firms of intermediate leverage. The

initial assignment of tax brackets to debt ratio categories is then altered and

the correlation analyses repeated, until all possible assignments have been ex-

hausted. The following hypothesis is used as a basis for testing whether the

tax clienteles are true financial leverage clienteles:


           The debt incentive tax ratios of high (low) tax bracket in-

           vestors are more strongly correlated over time with the mean

           debt ratio of low (high) debt ratio deciles than with the high

              (low) deciles.
                                        —7—

         If financial leverage clienteles exist, then all the firms serving a

    particular clientele have a similar incentive to alter their capital struc-

    tures to accommodate tax induced changes in the level of corporate debt

    preferred by their clientele. Thus, not only should the mean debt ratio of

    each company decile move with the approporate debt incentive tax ratio,

    but the standard deviation of the decile debt ratios should not change

    significantly over time. To facilitate the testing of this implication, the

    following hypothesis is employed:

        H2: The standard deviations of the debt ratio deciles remain con-

             stant over time.




3. DATA AND EMPIRICAL RESULTS

        Annual data on the debt ratio for all companies listed on the NYSE

   having no preferred stock were obtained for the period 1962—76.   Companies
   with preferred stock were excluded because of the indeterminate nature of

   preferred stock (relative to equity and debt). The number of companies for

   which complete data was available for the years 1962—76 was 864. The debt

   ratio used below is the book value of long term debt divided by the sum of

   the book value of equity and long term debt. It is assumed that factors

   tending to overstate book debt ratios, such as undervaluation of inventories

   and plant, are largely offset by factors tending to understate book debt

   Iatios, such as off—balance sheet financing [5].

        For comparison with KLM's data, the 1970 distribution of debt ratios

   is provided in Exhibit 1. It exhibits a similar bimodal structure, largely

   as a result of the relatively high number of zero debt companies. As .dis—

   cussed earlier, a bimodal distribution of debt ratios is consistent with

   Miller's clientele theory. Exhibit 2 lists the mean and standard deviation

   of the debt ratio distributions over the 15—year period studied. A strong

   trend towards higher mean debt ratios Is apparent in Exhibit 2.
                                                                     Previously,
                                    —8--


Crier and Strebel [2], reported a significant relationship between the

debt incentive tax ratio for the highest tax bracket clientele and the

mean debt ratio. [Exhibit 3]. However, any inference of causality had

to be made with e.xtreine caution owing to the common secular drift in both

the ratios.

     To overcome the serial correlation problem, the disaggregated im-

plicit clientele test embodied in H1 was developed. This test takes ad-

vantage of the differences in the direction of the mean trend of debt ratio

subsamples over the period analyzed. As is evident from Exhibit 4, while

the lower debt ratio deciles (numbers 0 to 6 comprising firms with debt ratios

from zero to .225 in 1962) displayed an increase in mean debt ratio between

1962 and 1976, the higher debt deciles (numbers 7 to 10 comprising firms with

debt ratios from .271 to .886 in 1962) exhibited a decline in mean debt ratio

over the same period. The increase in the mean debt ratios of the lower debt

deciles and the decline in the mean ratios of the higher debt deciles sugg-

ests the possibility of reversion to the mean. This would imply a declining

standard deviation of debt ratios for the entire sample over time. However,

the standard deviation of the total sample distribution is stable over time

[see Exhibit 2).

     The clientele debt incentive tax ratios, based on the assumption that

income from stock is taxed at the nominal capital gains rate, are shown in

Exhibit 5. They also exhibit different trend directions over the period

with the lower bracket clientele categories (0—2) having small declines in

their debt incentive tax ratios between 1962 and 1976 and the remaining cat-

egories (3—10) experiencing increases throughout the period.3 The reason for

the difference in trend is that- the increase in personal taxes over the per-

iod more strongly affects the higher bracket tax ratios, whereas the slight

decline in corporate tax rates has a greater impact on the lower bracket tax

ratios. Similar results are obtained when the marginal tax on stock income
                                         -.9—

is assumed to be zero.

        Given the imputed clientele tax ratios and the firm   debt   ratios, we

may proceed to test the first hypothesis H1. The mean debt ratio over time

for each of the 11 company deciles was regressed separately with the debt

incentive tax ratio over time for each of the 11 debt clientele categories.

These regressions were estimated both for debt incentive tax ratios computed

assuming zero marginal tax on personal income from stock and assuming a mar-

ginal stQck income tax equal to. the nominal tax on capital gains. If Miller's

theory is correct, the time series correlations should be strongest between

the mean debt ratios of the lower (higher) debt deciles and the debt incentive

tax ratios of the higher (lower) debt deciles. Results are presented in Ex-

hibit 6 where the marginal tax on personal income from stock is assumed to be

zero and Exhibit 7 where the marginal stock income tax is assumed to be equal

to the nominal capital gains rate.

        Visual inspection of Exhibits 6 and 7 indicates four basic combinations cf

clientele tax ratios and decile debt ratios. The most significant is the posi-

tive correlation between the high bracket tax ratios corresponding to clienteie.s

3 to 10 and the low debt ratio deciles, 0 to 6. This block of correlation co-

efficients reflects the positive secular trend in both the highest bracket tax

ratio and the total sample debt ratio shown in Exhibit 3. In Exhibits 6 and       7,

however, the common positive secular trend is clearly restricted to the highei

tax brackets and lower debt ratios, irt accordance with the debt clientele the-

ory •    The other block of positive correlation coefficients in the two exhibits

corresponds to the negative secular trend in both the lower bracket tax ratios,

o to 2, and the higher debt ratio deciles, 7 to 10. The remaining blocks of

correlation coefficients contain mainly negative entries. The overall re-

lationship between inputed clientele tax ratios and decile debt ratio over

the period 1962 to 1976, is consistent with hypothesis
                                                         H1.
                                 —10—


     Assuming independence, the random chance that personal tax rates would
exhibit a positive trend, thereby pushing the higher bracket tax ratios up-

wards, while corporate rates exhibit a negative trend, pushing the lower

bracket tax ratios downwards is 1/4. Moreover, in the absence of reversion

to the mean, the random chance that high debt ratios would move upwards and

low debt ratios downwards, is also 1/4. Therefore, the observed relationship

between clientele tax ratios and decile debt ratios can be said to differ from

a null hypothesis of no relationship at approximately the 6% level of signif i—

cance.

     Alternatively, the results may be summarized by considering the two

block diagonals separately. The first diagonal (D1) containing the lower left

and upper right blocks of correlation coefficients, corresponds to debt de—

ciles and clientele debt incentive tax ratios matched in accordance with Miller's

theory. The other diagonal (D2) containing the upper left and lower right

blocks reflects a matching exactly opposite to the one hypothesized by the

clientele theory. If the regressions between clientele tax ratios and decile

debt ratios were random and independent between blocks, the expected number

of positive correlation coefficients different from zero at the 1% level of

significance would be 1/2 x .01 times the number of correlation coefficients

on either block diagonal, or .34 on     and .26 on D2. A    test of the differ-

ence between the number of positive and significant correlation coefficents and

the number expected by chance was highly significant for D1 and insignificant

for D2. Since the observed empirical relationships are consistent with the

theory and cannot be attributed to chance, H1 cannot be rejected.


     The second hypothesis (H2) concerning the constancy of decile standard

deviations can be tested by means of the data presented in Exhibit 3. In-

creases in decile standard deviations are readily apparent. While,in 1962,

all of the differences between adjacent decile means are greater than the

standard deviation for each decile, in 1976, the differences between the means

of the deciles were well within the respective decile standard deviations.
                                      —11—

     Moreover, an F—test on the difference between the 1962 decile debt ratio

     variance and the 1976 decile debt ratio variance was significant (at the

     1% level) for all 11 deciles. Consequently, H2 must be rejected. It follows

     that, contrary to the implication of the debt clientele theory, there is

     little evidence of strong uniform clientele loyalty over time within the

     debt ratio deciles.



4.   CONCLUSION

          In the presence of transaction costs, debt clientele theory suggests

     that, over time, the firm's debt ratio should vary with the tax incentive

     which its clientele has to hold debt. In accordance with the theory, the

     results of the implicit clientele test indicate that the debt incentive tax

     ratios of high bracket clienteles are more strongly correlated with the mean

     debt ratio of low debt firms than high debt firms. Although, the correspond-

     ing results for low tax brackets have the correct sign, they are much less

     significant statistically. Moreover, contrary to the theory, there is little

     evidence of uniform clientele loyalty within debt ratio deciles over time.

     Overall, the implicit clientele test generates somewhat stronger support for

     the existence of financial leverage clienteles than the data reported by KLN.

     Changes in the relative structure of taxes, however, at best only partially

     account for the time series behavior of debt ratios, especially, in the case

     of high debt firms.

          Several explanations of the discrepancy between the above results and

     the predictions of debt clientele theory are possible. First, the overall

     methodology of the imputed clientele test may be inadequate. However, the

     similarity between our results and those reported by ELM using an entirely

     different methodology reduces the likelihood of this explanation. Second,

     the problem may lie with the assumption of clientele loyalty generated by
                                 FOOTNOTES

1.   As KLM acknow1edgesurvey data is subject to measurement error, for
     example, ttindividuals at the lower end of the income—and—wealth scale
     tend to overstate the level of their earnings and assets, whereas the
     reverse is true for individuals at the other end of the scale.t' More
     important, however, for testing the existence of debt clienteles is
     KLM's omission of institutional data.

2.   In his equlibrium analysis of the market for corporate debt, Miller
     assumes that the personal tax rate on stock income is zero Ct =0).
     When i  is  not zero, the equilibrium becomes a function of th wealth
     distrigution of personal tax rates and has yet to be properly specified.
     In this paper, we consider the value of 6 for different tax brackets
     both for t = 0 and t > 0.

3.   Exhibit 5 shows that between 1963 and 1964 the debt incentive tax ratio
     for the higher tax brackets increases dramatically (from —3.0 to —.63
     for clientele 10). The results reported below are not significantly
     affected by omitting the 1963/64 tax ratios from the data set for the
     higher bracket clienteles.
