                TESTING FOR CONTRACTING EFFECTS ON EMPLOYMENT


                                   ABSTRACT

     I test the importance of wage rigidities from long-term contracts by

observing how employment behaves when firms and workers recontract.     If

rigidities are important then we should observe employment adjusting after

recontracting to undo movements in employment during the past contract

that were excessive due to rigid wages.

     The data are for twelve manufacturing industries that display a

strong bargaining pattern.

     I find that contract rigidities are important, causing considerably

larger fluctuations in employment than would occur with flexible wages.

By far the most striking case is in motor vehicles where long-term

contracts much more than double the size of fluctuations in employment.      I

also examine the behavior of wage rates when new contracts are introduced.

Wage growth does respond to employment growth during the prior contract in

several of the industries; but these responses are not related to the

pattern of employment responses across industries.
