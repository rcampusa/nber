                                             ABSTRACT

        Proposals for mandatory private saving accounts differ in the degree of investment discretion

that they provide to individual savers, and in their provisions for annuitization of accumulated assets.

With respect to investment choices, some argue that individuals must be prevented from investing

too conservatively, and earning low returns over their accumulation period, while others argue that

individuals should be protected from recklessly investing their retirement assets. With respect to

annuitization, there is concern that individuals might not choose annuities and would thereby expose

themselves to a risk of outliving their assets in a privatized system. This paper draws on the existing

experience with 401 (k) plans and other defined contribution pension plans to provide evidence on

each of these issues.     We find that the share of401 (k) plan assets held in corporate equities has

increased substantially in recent years. We are only able to provide limited evidence on participant

asset management,       since many 401 (k) plans have limited options in this regard.      We do find,

however, that a participant’s education and income levels are related to asset allocation decisions,

with less educated and lower income participants less inclined to invest in equity securities. We also

analyze a unique data base on TIAA-CREF participants and find several attributes of annuitization

behavior that seem inconsistent with standard behavior in the lifecycle model.

       Two important design features in proposals to supplement or replace the current Social

security     system with a system of individual saving accounts are the degree of individual

autonomy that would be allowed with respect to the investment                      of accumulating     assets, and

with respect to tha distribu~            of accumulated       assets.     At one extreme are proposals that

would mandate          the allocation    of assets between         stocks,      bonds, and other investment

categories during the accum~tion             phase, and require tie purchase of a government-provided

annuity at retiement.           At the other extreme are plans that wodd aUow substantial individual

ohoice in ti         investment     of assets,   and in the time profik            and method     of distributing

acctited           assets.’

           Assat allocation decisions can have important                triplications   for the rate of return on

retirement     assets, and hence on the degree of retirement                  security that a given stream of

individual contributions         during the working life can provide.          The standard source of data on

long-term returns, Ibbotson Associates            (1995],     reports that since 1926,        the distribution of

returns m a diversified          portfolio of ccuporate stoch       has a mean of 9.9 percent per year,

compared with a mean of 4.8 percent for a portfolio of long-term                        bonds and 3.8 percent,

hardy more than the infktion           rate, for a poftfdio    of short-term Treasury Mls.           Siegel (1 994)

prasants _            ftiings     using data from 1802-1992:        the mean equity retwn is 8.1 percent,


the mean bond return 4.7 percent, and the mean inflation rate 1.3 percent.                         The expected

VW    at retiemant        of an ~urnulated       retirement fund invested in equities is greater than the

expected      value of one invested in lass risky fixed income assets, although there is also a

greater chance of having sustained losses on such ● portfolio.

           -tory         saving plans that provide substantial investment                discretion to individual

participants       have led to discussion of two conflicting             concerns regarding individual asset




    ‘Diamond and Valdes-%ieto (1994) and Feldstein (1996)                       discuss a range of issues that
arias in considering SocM Secwity reform proposals.

management         choices.     One is the possibility that some individuals will invest conservatively,

thereby earning low rates of return on their account                 balances and thus not accumulating

sufficient     resources to finance retirement         consumption.      The other concern is that some

individuals     will invest      their accounts     recklessly,    bearing   substantial     risk and incurring

substantial probability of reaching retirement            with a very small accwnt          accumulation.      It is

in winciple possible that each of these investment                patterns might apply to sme           part of the

popdation,      so that the group reaching retirement with low levels of reswrces                would consist

o~ some conservative            investors and some plungers. 2 Restricting          asset allocation       options

provides one way to avoid either of thesa wtcomes.

          It is difficult to evaluate     the importance     of restricting individual investment          choice,

since there has never been a universal system of retirement                  saving accounts in the United

States.    A substantial fraction of U.S. households accumulates             very little financial wealth (see

Poterba, Venti, and Wise (1994a)),             instead relying primarily on Social Security and to a lesser

extent corporate pensions to sustain retirement              consumption.       Another grwp,       which does

SCCumhte         some fiml           wealth,     tends to hold only fixed-income           instrwents      in thair

portf~.        It is difficdt   to ga~e   how such households would invest theti ratir~nt                   saving

assets, if they were provided with the chanca to ti                so. A particularly difficult issue is how

a pOt@ntid reduction in the current level of Social Security                 benefits,     which provide a real

annuity “floor” under retirement consumption,             would affect asset allocation choices earlier in

the Iifetti.

          A related set of issues arises with respect to paywts          from mandatory saving accounts.

Ons of the risks that is partially insured by cwrent               defined benefit pansion plans (through



     ~he average return to all investors in a cohort might not be affected by the presence of
some very conservative, and some risk-loving, investors, but the distribution of wealth at
retirement would be affected.

annuity contracts purchased with the accumulation in defined contribution pension pJans) and

by Swial Security is the risk of outliving one’s resources.          Mandatory saving plans that require

annuidzadon      of accumulated      balances at retirement      or at a particular age, ~h        as 65, also

provM     a guar~a      that resourcas will be spread over an individual’s rernting           tifetime.     Such

Mns      also entail ti~hter restrictions   on individual choice than plans that wouJd allow more

dscretion    in asset withdrawal,      and they may involve additional government            involvement       in

the ProviAon of annuities or the oversight of the private annuity market.

          At the center of the discussions of both accumulation             and withdrawal         options are

questions of how individuals and couples would behave in a system of mandatory                            saving

accounts.      One potential source of information on these issues is the behavior of participants

in various targeted retirement        saving plans, such as Individual Retirement         Accounts        (IRAs),

Salary    Reduction    Arrangements       (SRAS),   401 (k) plans,     and other    self-directed     defined

contribution     pension   plans.     The growth    of such targeted       retirement     saving    plans has

expanded the set of individuals with substantial financial asset holdings and some discretion

regarding their investment.         The participants in these @ans tend to have higher incomes than

non-participants,     so there are immediate questions about the degree to which findings based

on such groups can be generalized            to the population as a whole.         Mvetiheless       it seems

approprhte      to examine    the behavior     of participants     in these plana snd to extract           what

information is available about accumulation         and distribution behavior.

         This paper considers a range of different saving vehicles that provide individuals with

some discretion in investment         and some opportunity to choose the nature of their payouts,

including    IRAs,   SRAS, 401 (k) plans, the TIAA/CREF             retirement   system    for college and

university employees,      and the federal government’s       thrift saving plan.    It provides evidence

on individual financial decisias        in these plans.

          The paper is divided into five sections.            The first presents summary information           on

participation in various retirement           saving programs, drawing on data from the 1992 Survey

of Consumer Finances and the recently-released                Health and Retirement Survey.          Section two

summarizes asset atiocation decisions in a variety of the existing saving mans. We note that

available evidence          from 401 (k) plan providers suggests that the equity allocation                of new

contributions        to 401 (k) ~ans is greater than that for the existing stock of assats, and that

there are differences           by age and income in the asset allocation         pattern in 401 (k) pJans.

Section      three    focuses     on both accumulation        and withdrawal     decisions     of TIAA-CREF

participants, and summarizes the allocation of retirement saving contributions between stocks

and fixed-income assets. The fourth section considers the demand for annuities among TIAA-

CREF participants,          and relies in particular on a 1988       survey of both TIAA-CREF         retirees to

explore how individual characteristics           affect annuity demand.     There is a brief conclusion that

suggests several issues for further investigation.



                      . .            .     .
1. The Growth of Pa-tIon                   In Tar~d     Retirement    Savino PlaM

          In the last decade and a half, tha structure of the private pension system has shifted

substantially        from   defined-benefit     (08)   to defined-contribution      (DC)    plans,    and many

indivitils      have     taken    advantage     of opportunities     for tax-deferred      saving    in targeted

retirement     saving accounts.          The result of these changes has been a shift, small for those

already retired but potentially           much greater for those who will retire in the future, toward

retkement      saving accounts that rely in some way on individual investment                 decisions.

          The first substantial      targeted    retirement   saving plan was the Individual Retirement

Account (IRA).         IRAs were introduced for most households in 1981,             and rose to substantial

popularity, with nearly 16 million contributors, before the 1986 Tax Reform Act curtailed the
                                                         7

tax benefits for IRA participation           by higher-income households.         Since 1986 the flow of new

contributions to IRAs has been substantially reduced, but total assets in IRAs have continued

to grow as a resdt of roll-over contributions from other retirement plans, and the increase in

value of previousl y invested assets. By the end of 1995, Bernstein Research (1995) estimates

that nearly $1 trillion was held in IRAs.

          In contrast to IRAs, a second targeted saving pJan, the 401 (k) plan (named after the

section of the Internal Revenue Code that created it), has expanded rapidly since the early

1980s.     Although formally created in 1978,           401 (k)s did not gain popularity until after 1981,

when      the Treasury       Department       issued clarifying     regulations    that    made    it possible for

employers to estabJish such plans. These plans have diffused rapidly through the work~ce,

first at large employers and then at smaller firms.               401 (k) participants can defer income tax

liability on their contributions.           Assets in 401 (k) accounts accumulate           tax-free   and income

from these plans is taxed when the funds are withdrawn.                     Prior to 1987,        employees could

contribute up to $30,000          each year to a 401 (k) plan. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 reduced

the limit to $7,000         beginning in 1987      and instituted    indexation    for inflation in subsequent

years.     Th     contribution   limit was $9,235      for the 1995 tax year.             Wny    empJoyers match

mpIOyeO         contributions    to 401 (k) plans, often at rates between           50 and 100 @rcent           (we

Poterbe, Venti, and Wise ( 1994b)).             The number of participants in 401 (k) @ans MS increased

from 7.5 million in 1984,         to 15.2 million in 1988,        to 22.4 million in 1992,        the most recent

year for which the Department               of Labor (1996)     has released detailed information           from IRS

Form 5500        filings.   Bernstein Research (1995)          estimates that the market value of assets in

401 (k) pJans was approximately              $650 billion at the end of 1995,       and that these assets will

increase     rapidly    in the    future.      Contributions     to IRAs and 401(k)             plans now    exceed

contributions      to traditional employer-provided          defined benefit pension plans.
                                                      8

          Both IRAs and 401 (k)s provide individuals            with    opportunities    to make   financial

dactions     about the investment   of retirement plan assets, and about the distribution of these

assets after retirement age.      Individuals have substantial the greatest discretion in investing

IRA assets.      Although some assets, such as gdd and silver coins and hedge funds, could not

be held in lRAs until recently,        thase restrictions    are utikely    to constrain the investment

choices of many IRA -pants.               IRA assets can be withdrawn          in various ways, including

lump-sum payouts at any aga (although such payouts before age 59 1/2 incur a 10 percent

penalty tax upon withdrawal),       according to a schedule of participant age-specific            minimum

distributions determined     by the IRS, or by purchasing an annuity.

          Participants in 401 (k) ~ns      face less discretion than IRA investors with respect to

asset     allocation.   The available    investment       options   are plan-specific     and as such are

determined by h         employer’s arrangement     with tha 401 (k) provider.      Since 1993,     however,

Department       of Labor guidelines    have required that all 401 (k) #ans             offer at least three

inva-nt         options, including a broad-based equity fund, a bond fund, and a money market

fund.     Many 401 (k) plans offer a more diverse range of investment            options.    Assets Can be

witMrawn       from 401 {k) @ans at any time, although lump-sum withdrawals               before age 59 1/2

that are n~      rolled-ovar into other taxdeferred        redrarnent saving plans incur the same 10

parcent panalty tax as withdrawals        from IRAs. Some401         (k) plans offer annuitization options,

while othars can be annuitized only if tha individual participant            purchases an annuity in the

private insurance market.

          To provide some information on the characteristics           of current participants in IRAs and

401 (k) plans, Tabla 1 presents information on the age-spacific            prevalence of IRA ownership,

and tha rate of 401 (k) participation        in 1991.       These patterns    are important     background

information given the data that will be presented below on the asset allocation of IRA and
                                                          9

401 (k) participants.    The data in the upper panel show that IRA participation rises with income

and also with age.         More than 40 percent of those between                the ages of 55 and 65 have

Individual Retirement       Accounts,   while only one quarter of those in a cohti               twenty    years

younger have such accounts.         The prevalence of IRAs is also sharply rising in income.                The

data on IRAs dy         indicate that a respondent has an account, not that contributions to such

accounts     were   made in the survey year (1991).                Thus it is possi~e       that many of the

participants    opened these accounts before 1986,               and have continued to hold the accounts

without making contributions.3          Between     1986 and 1989,        IRA contributions     fell by roughly

seventy-five    percent.     Some IRA holders are also likely to have created these accounts as

vehicles into which to roll-over distributions from other tax-qualified              retirement saving plans.

         The center panel of Table 1 shows the probability of participating                  in a 401 (k) plan.

These probabilities vary relatively little by age, but once again rise substantially                 as income

increases.     As the data in the lower panel of Table 1 show, most of the income-dependence

in 401 (k) participation rates arises from varying rates of 401 (k) eligibility, not from variation

in participation    rates conditional   on eligibility.       The 401 (k) take-up rate for all eligibles was

70,8   percent in 1991, substantially        higher than the IRA participation             rate for all but the

highest income categories.        It is possible that some of the participation            in 401 (k)s at lower

income     level reflects    employer    “helper”    contributions       that   are made     to include    these

employees in the plan and thereby to satisfy nondiscrimination                   rules for plan qualification.

         We have also explored the prevalence of IRAs and various salary reduction plans in the

Health and Retirement        Survey (HRS), an ongoing survey of 12,600                individuals between the




    3Some individuals may have multiple Individual Retirement                          Accounts,     and   make
contributions in a given year to only one of these accounts.
                                                  10

ages of 51 and 61 in 1992.4      The HRS questionnaire does not ask the same questions as the

SJPP survey instrument,      but it is nevertheless    possible to estimate the prevalence    of IRAs,

defined contribution plans at the respondent’s current job and from former jobs, as well as the

prevalence of other tax-deferred    saving vehicles suchas401      (k)s and 403(b)s.    The results are

shown in Table 2.

          The HRS findings are broadly consistent witi those from the SIPP. For IRAs, the HRS

data suggest that 36.1 percent of respondents have an IRA or an IRA and a 401 (k) plan. Of

the 8.4 percent of the respondents who are shown as “other multi~e”           in Table 2, 7.7 percent

report having an IRA, so the total IRA participation is 43.8 percent for the HRS respondents.

This compares with 35.3       percent for the 45-54     age group, and 43.8   percent for the 55-64

aoe group, in the SIPP data shown in Table 1. With respect to 401 (k) pJans, the HRS data

suggest that 14.8 percent of respondents participate; this percentage is somewhat lower than

in tha SIPP sample.

         The SIPP and HRS data suggest that IRAs and 401 (k) participation             is not randomly

distributed across the income distribution,     but tends to increase with age and income.5        The

sample of participants in these plans will therefore provide more information on the investment

decisions of older, higher-income grwps that are more tikely to participate in these plans than

on younger, low~ome          workers who are not.       We address these issws     in our subsequent

adysis    by stratifying   housahoJds by age and income where possible.




   ‘Poterba, Venti, and Wise ( 1995b) analyzed the HRS data in studying the utilization of
lump-sum distributions from defined contribution plans.

   5This is why studies of the saving effects of these retirement saving pJans, such as
Poterba, Venti, and Wise (1995a), stratify households by income level in carrying out saving
comparisons.

2.   ~sse~   Allocation Patterns in Ret irement sav ing plans

        This section presents information           on the asset allocation of retirement       saving plans.

We begin by presenting           survey-based      information    from the    1992     Survey   of Consumer

Finances,     which    asked respondents         about investment     patterns    in IRAs, salary-reduction

arrangements       (SRAS) such as employer           thrift plans, and 401 (k) and traditional         defined

contribution pension pJans (DC @ans). We then present information from other sources, such

as industry association tabulations on asset allocation decisions in IRAs and 401 (k) plans or

specialized tabulations       on asset allocation in the federal government’s            Thrift Saving Plan.

Each of these different methods of obtaitig               information provides some evidence on current

patterns of household asset allocation.




%1    SUWV         lnformati~n    from the ~ev            of Consumer Finances

        The Survey        of Consumer         Finances    (SCF) is a stratified   random sample        of U.S.

housaMds       administered      by the Federal Reserve Board.           It is designed to gather detailed

information     on assets,     liabilities,   and demographic       characteristics.      To collect    useful

infwmation     on asset hoJdings, in light of the skewed distributions of many types of financial

snd real assets, each survey oversamples                 high income hwsehdds.         Each SCF contains an

area-probatitity      sam~ts, which is a stratified random sampIe of housahdds              chosen from the

population at large, and a stratified random sample of households dra wn from a set of high-

income tax returns.        Both samples are surveyed using the same questionnaire,               but missing

value imputations        in the public release versions are typically done separately.           We use the

most recent publicly-available        survey, the 1992 SCF, to provide some information              on asset

docation      patterns    in IRAs, 401 (k) and 403(b)          plans and other supplemental        retirement

accounts, and traditional defined contribution pension plans. The latter category in the SCF
                                                   12

includes profit sharing or thrift plans and Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPS).e

         TabJe 3 presents data on the fraction of assets in each of these retirement         saving

vehicles that are held in the form of corporate stock or mutual funds that invest primarily in

corporate equities.’     The data are stratified   by age in each case.    The resdts   show that

approximately    half of the assets in each of these accounts are held in corporate equities.     At

least for the individuals who are currently participating in these plans, it therefore appears that

equity investment      is viewed as an important aspect of accumulating     assets for retirement.

There are apparent differences in age-specific rates of equity ownership, with those over the

age of 65 showing a lower equity fraction of IRA and SRA assets than comparable,                 but

younger, individuals.

         One difficulty in evaluating resuJts such as those in Table 3 is that it is not clear what

“theory” suggests we should find. There is no presumption that house~ds           of different ages

should allocate the same fraction of their portfolio to equities.   Bodie, Merton, and Samuelson

(1992) develop an argument for reducing equity exposure as households age, and Samuelson

(1989,    19901 discusses arguments for age-related     variation in equity holding.”   Similarly, if

househtis     view their retirement   accounts as part of a broader portfoJio selection pro~em,

one must analyze their overall investment      decisions rather than auocation choices in these




     ~he critical limitation of the SCF for studying this question, and a limitation of most
survey data on retirement saving plan asset allocation, is that we do not know whether the
retirement plan is self directed.  In some plans the plan sponsor may restrict asset allocation
choices, for example by contributing all employer contributions to a pension plan to an
account that holds onJy company stock.

    7A related discussion and data summary may be found in the General Accounting             Office
(1 996) study.

    ‘Even if households reduce equity exposure as they age, they may still want to hdd

accounts alone.        For individuals who face high marginal tax rates on interest income, for

example,       holding bonds rather than equities in their tax-favored           retirement     accounts    may

provide higher after-tax      portfolio returns than alternative       portfolio profiles.




                       es of Information    on IRA and 401 (k) Asset Allocation P~

          In addition to survey information       like that c~tained     in the SCF, it is a[so poasiMe to

obtain data on asset allocation            in IRAs and some other categories             of retirement    saving

accounts from financiaJ industry sources that monitor aggregate trends.                    Information    of this

type is presented for IRAs in Table 4, which shows data for 1989 and 1994.                     These data are

disaggregate        by tha type    of financial    institution   holding the IRA,        but this provides a

reasonable guide as to the assets held in the account.              In 1989,     commercial      banks, credit

unions, and thrift institutions       accounted     for 49.1 %    of all IRA assats.         IRAs with these

institutions     were presumatiy     invested     in various fixed-income      securities.     Adding money

market mutual funds and bond and income funds to these assets brings the total of fixed-

income assets to 62.2%.         By 1994, the share of assets in these fixed-income              categories had

declined to 40.3%.          Equity mutual funds increased from 11 .5% to 16.7%                  of IRA assets

dining this ~iod,        but the sharpest ~ease         (from 18.1%        to 34.6%)      was in “other self-

directed” ~ts.          The data from the Survey of Consurner Finance suggest that various types

of equity investment       are likely to account for a substantial share of this category.

          The best source of aggregate information on401 (k) plan asset allocation is the annual

set of IRS Form 5500        fitings, most recently published for 1992 data in Department                 of Labor

(1996).        These   show    401 (k) plan assets      of $510.2       billion, with    employer     securities

(presumably company stock) worth $88.2              billion, or 17.3%    of the total.    Identifiable interest-

baaring assets, which include interest-baaring cash, CDs, corporate and government debt, and
                                                        14

various loans, totalled $60 billion, or 11 .2°A of the total.        Common and preferred stock direct

holdings totalled    $45.7     billion, or 9% of all assets.      ‘Indirect   investments,”   which are not

identified by the nature of the underlying securities on Form 5500,                  are an important    and

unallocated category,     including $101.9         billion in “interests in master trusts,” $47,2   billion in

registered investment        companies,    $75.6    billion in insurance company general accounts, and

$26.9   billion in unspecified general investments.

        The coarse informatia         on Form 5500       has led to a number of private sectw surveys

of 401 (k) plan asset allocation.      Such surveys are based on a subset of existing 401 (k) pJans,

and whether the plans included in each survey are representative                 of the broader population

of plans is difficult to evaluate.        Nevertheless these surveys provide an important source of

evidence on the evolving pattern of 401 (k) asset allocation.           Table 5 presents this type of data

from two different surveys over the 1988-1995                period. These surveys, by Access Research

and IOMA, have been conducted periodically since the late 1980s or early 1990s.                 The survey

findings suggest that there are some differences              in results across the two surveys, even in

a given year, but the trends in two surveys over time are similar.

        There are several noteworthy         findings in Table 5. First, consistent with the Survey of

c onsumer Finance evidence,          approximately      half of 401 (k) assets are currently invested in

equities.     However,   the data ~esented         here suggest that a higher fraction of 401 (k) assets

than othar equity assets are invested in shares the company where an individual works. There

is a correspondingly     lower investment       fraction in diversified national or international     equity

Portfolios.    The Access Research findings suggest 43%                in corporate equities or company

stock, with another 14% in balanced funds that would include some equity holdings.                       The

lOMA findings suggest 55%           in corporate equities, without        further detail as to breakdown.

The data from the Form 5500s,         and the Access Research results, suggest that one important
                                                  15

feature of 401 (k) plans is thek substantial holdings of company stock.            One reason for the

significant level of such holdings is that employers sometimes channel their matching funds

into accounts that are limited to hoJding corporate stock.       In such cases employees may have

some discretion in the investment     of their own contributions,      but have no control over the

investment   of em~oyer   contributions.e

       The second significant    finding in Table 5 is that the share of 401 (k) assets held in

equity securities has increased substantially     during the last half decade.       Both the Access

Research and the IOW      data suggest a sharp increase, with an 8 percent increase between

1992 and 1995 in the latter.     This trend toward equity investment          coincides with a decline

in the ~re   of Guaranteed    Investment    Contracts     (GICS).   The tr~     toward greater equity

holdings may be the result of several factors:         high equity returns raising the relative asset

share of these securities,   even if 401 (k) investors hdd fixed their contribution         allocation

between equities and fixed income assets; declining nominal long-term interest rates, which

have made GICS less attractive    in the eyes of some investors; rising expectations         of future

equity returns, driven in part by extrapolative    expectations      and the recent period of strong

equity returns.

       The 401 (k) asset allocation    choice reflects two decisions: one by employers            with

regard to which investment      options to offer, and a second by employees           with respect to

which investments   to choose, given the available menu.        Broad choice is now the rule, rather




    9How individuals adjust their portftio holdings to the existence of corporate defined
benefit plan accounts held in company stock is an imptiant       unresolved issue. If individuals
do recognize the employer’s contribution, and pursue the imperfect hedging strategy of
reducing their hoJdings of equity in general to offset the holding of employer shares, then the
data suggest that individuals seek to hold roughly half of their assets in equities. If they do
not consider the employer contributions, however, then it becomes appropriate to subtract
this 20% of the value of401 (k] assets from both the equity holdings and from the total value
of these accounts. This suggests an equity share of sJightly less than 40%.
                                                        16

than the exception,      in 401 (k) plans. A recent RogersCasey (1996)          survey found that only 1

percent of401 (k) participants worked at firms with only a single investment option; 2 percent

had two options, 6 percent three options, 9 percent four options, 18 percent five options, and

74 percent had six or more investment           options.     More than three quarters of 401 (k)s offer an

actively managed domestic equity investment vehicle, compared with 62 percent offering a

money market fund, 61 percent offering a stable value fund, and 60 percent offering a U.S.

balanced fund.

          Table 6 presents information        from the 1994       Access   Research (1995)       survey that

shows both the availa~ity          of various investment      options, and the use of these options given

their availability.    The data show that roughly 60% of individuals make at least some use of

equity    mutual      funds when    they are included in the opportunity          set.     Index funds and

international equity funds are somewhat less popular, conditional on availability, than various

types of growth funds.        The data in Table 6 shed some light on the role of company stock

(shares in the firm that employs the workers who participate in the plan) in 401 (k) @ans, and

suggests that some individual purchase company stock even though they are not required to

do so by plan regulations. 10 While less than half of the 401 (k) participants surveyed had a

company stock investment           option in their401   (k) plan, nearly 60 percent invested in com~ny

stock if this option was avaiJable. Company stock, GICS, and various growth-oriented                  e~ity

mutual funds have the three highest takeup rates conditional on availability.

          AM of the foregoing data focused on aggregate docation               patterns in 401 (k) assets,

with no information       on how individuals in different circumstances          choose to allocate their

assets.    Table 7 presents information drawn from Goodfellow and Schieber’s (1996)                 analysis




    10Whather em~oyers exert tacit pressure for purchasing company                       stock in retirement
accounts is an open issue.

of almost 36,000      participants in twenty-four    401 (k) plans. 11 The table shows the fraction

of 401 (k) plan assets held in each asset category, by the age of plan participant.12 The data

show clear asset allocation differences across age groups. Younger plan participants are more

likely to invest their 401 (k) assets in stock funds or company stock than are older workers.

The fraction of assets in the three equity categories, domestic or international stock funds and

company stink,     declines from 52.9 Permnt for those aged 21-30,           to 30.3 percent for those

in their fifties and 13.4 percent for those over the age of 60.13

         Table 8 presents analogous information          with participants   disaggregate      by income

level.   Since the analysis is based on 401 (k) plan records, income in this context represents

wage and salary income from the plan-sponsoring firm, not total family income.              As with age,

there is a dear pattern in asset allocation by income category.        Higher income earners allocate

substantial! y larger shares of their 401 (k) assets to equity securities.       For participants with

incomes between $15,000          and $25,000,   for example, 29.9 percent of 401 (k) assets are held

in equities,   compared   with    59.4   percent for those with incomes between             $75,000   and

$100,000,      and 64.5 percent for those with incomes above $100,000.           The fraction of assets




    1lThe Em~oyee -fit       Research Institute ( 1996b) presents a related analysis of the a-t
allocati~ tices    of investors in three large 401 (k) plans. The resuJts are broadly consistent
with -      from the large sample of plans analyzed by Goodfellow and Schieber (1 996).

    l~he entrias in the total column raise some questions abwt the comparability of this
sample with the 401 (k) universe. The share of assets held in company stock is substantial y
kss than that for al! 401 (k) pJans, with a correspondingly greater ~re    of fixed income
investments.

    13Goodfellow and Schieber ( 1996) also present data on the fraction of401 (k) participants
who auocate nona of their contributions to equity investments (31.2 percent of the total
sample, with some age variation as suggested by 29.2 percent for those aged 21-30, 30.6
percent for those between 41 and 50, and 52.3 percent for those over 60), and the fraction
who allocate more than 60 percent of their contributions to equities (36.7 percent for the 21-
30 group, 30.7 percent for those 41-50, 18.8 percent for those 60+, and 31.4 percent of
the entire sample).
                                                          18

heJd in balanced funds also increases with income, while the allocation to fixed income funds

faus roughly in half between the lowest and highest income categories.

        The relationship between          income and the share of contributions allocated to equities

in the G@     fellow and Schiaber (1996)            data parallels our earlier finding from the Survey of

c onaumar F-es,            but the W          bstween    participant age and contribution       mix (Table 6) is

much stionger than in the Survey of Consumer Finances.                    This may be due to tha difference

between      the definition    of “age=         in the   SCF and in data        bases    with   information    on

individuals.14     Because     SCF respondents           are asked about       the financial    status   of their

household,    participation    in a 401 (k) means that someone in the house~d                     has a 401(k)

account.     Household age is determined             by the aga of the household head, with is a noisy

measure of the age of actual participants.               This could weaken the relationship between           age

and the behavior of participants as measured in the SCF. 16

        It is difficult to evaluate      IRA and 401 (k) asset allocation choices in the absence of a

benchmark,       darived    either    from      theoretical    analysis   of   the   return   distributions   and

consumpti        needs confratkg         investors, or from othar sources.           One possibla comparison

is the current assat mix in these ~ns               relative to that in defined benefit pension pJans. In

19S4,   Bernstein Research           (1995)     reports that thesa plans held 46%             of their assets in

mstic       equity, 11 % in international equities, 28% in btis,               5% in GICS, 3% in red estate,

and 7% in other assets.         IRA and 401 (k) investment            patterns thus reflect a much greater



    14Bajtelsmit and VanDerhei (19961 analyze asset aUocation decisions in a single large
defined contribution plan, and find some avidance that both younger workers and ddar
workers are more likely to Nd assets in fixed-income instruments than are middle-aged
workers. This resdt may be driven by their use of a quadratic specification in meddling the
age-dependence of asset holdings, or by special characteristics associated with the defined
contribution plan under analysis.

   lGAnother possibility is that the Goodfellow-Schieber data set reflects an unrepresentative
sample of 401 (k) p~icipants,    but we have no way to address this issue.

holding of GICS, and a somewhat                   lower      level of equity     investment,     but they      are not

dramatically     different from the asset allocations of defined benefit pension assets. 10

3~n                         In TWO    Retirement     Savina SYS-

         The    discussion       so far has considered             asset    alJocatM      in Individual    Retirement

Accounts,      which are available (at least in some form) to all individuals with current earned

income, and 401 (k) plans, which are broadly available in the private sector.                           In this section

we draw on the experience             of two more specialized retirement                saving programs, the Thrift

Saving Plan for federal government            employees and the TIAA-CREF                 system for employees of

educational     institutions,     to address similar issues of asset allocation.




                      tion FxDerience in the Federal Fmo]ovee Thrift Savin~                     Plan

         The    federal     government’s         retirement       system     includes     an option     for voluntary

contributions    to the federal thrift savings plan (TSP), which is structured along the lines of

most 401 (k) plans. In early 1995, the TSP had two million participants and nearly $27 billion

under management,           according to Hinz, MCarthy,            and Turner ( 1996).      Employee contributions

to the TSP are made on a pre-tax basis. The fedaral government                           matches,     dollar-fordollar,

em~oyae       TSP contributions up to three percent of salary, and 50 cents-on-thedollar                         for the

next two percent of salary. Contributions to the TSP are constrained by the same contribution

limits   as    401 (k)     contributions    at     private     sector      employers,     although     there    are   no

discrimination            ruJes constraining the distribution of contributions to the TSP.

         Table 9 shows          the percentage of workers choosing to make contributions to the TSP


    lYhe merits of this comparison may be questioned on the grounds that defined banefit
plan assets are managed to achieve objectives of an infinite-lived agent, the plan’s corporate
sponsor, and are insured by a government agency, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.

in 1993.     In contrast to the private sector experience with 401 (k) plans, where participation

in these plans conditional on eligibility exceeds 60 percent even at low income levels (see

Poterba, Venti, and Wise (1 995a)),          participation   in the TSP is below 50 percent at income

levels below $20,000       per year, and rises to 96 percent at income levels above $70,000.              The

federal    government     automatically     contributes      one percent      of salary to the TSP for all

employees; this is not considered “participation”            in this table.

          The federal Thrift Saving Plan historically offered more limited investment options than

many private 401 (k) plans.17        Until 1987,      all TSP contributions        had to be invested     in a

federal government       securities fund.     This requirement      was gradually ~ased         wt   between

1987 and 1991.         Since 1991,   TSP assets can be allocated between              three different   funds,

without restriction.    Participants are allowed tore-allocate        assets that have accumulated       from

pre-1 987     contributions,   as well as to allocate        new contributions,      among three funds: a

government      securities fund which earns the average market return on marketable                  Treasury

securities with more than four years to maturity, a Iarge%apitalization              stock fund that invests

in tha S&P 500, and a fixed income fund that invests primarily in a Shearson Lehman Hutton

commingled Government/Corporata             bond index fund. The General Accwnting             Office (1995)

reports that at tha beg-          of 1995,     70 parcent of the assets in the federal thrift plan were

invested in fedaral securities fund, while 6 percent were held in a commercial bond fund and

24 percent in tha corporate equit y fund. The equit y fund is currently attracting a higher share

of contributions    (35 percent in August 1994) than its share of assets, but participants have

apparently made Iittla use of a post-1990         provision permitting re-allocation of funds that were

contributed    during the period when au contributim             were directad to the government         bond

fund.

          TIAA-CREF is the retirement saving system for employees of colleges, universities, and

some other nonprofit institutions.        It includes university faculty as well as staff.    Many TIAA-

CREF participants,     like employees       of the federal government,       are better educated     than

randomly-selected     individuals in the population, so analysis of their retirement saving behavior

may not be com~tely        repre~tative        of all who might participate in a mandatory,     economy-

wide saving system.       Nevertheless,     one important benefit of analyzing the TIAA-CREF         data

is that we can obtain individual-level data as well as aggregate information on asset allocation

choices.

          Eecause TIAA-CREF is a financial service provider, individual data recwds suffer from

the sa~     limitations as participant recordsin401       (k) pJans, notably the lack of information on

demographic cbacteristics         and house~d        income.   However,    two special data bases, the

1993 Premium Paying Research Panel and the 1988 Participant Survey, have been collected

in recent years, and each of these data bases has detailed information on individual attributes.

Both surveys include a set of questions about participant retirement             and financial pJanning,

and they Povti       valuable information       for studying participant   decisions.   The decision we

focus on is the choice between         allocating funds to TIAA accounts,         which are invested in

portfolios of fixed-income      instruments,     and CREF accounts,    most of which we invested in

equities .18

          Table 10 presents information        on the current asset allocation choices of TIAA-CREF

@writs,         as well as tk   atiocation of existig     balances between CREF and TIAA accounts.

In 1993,    TIAA accounts attracted       38 percent of contributions      (contributions    to TIAA CREF



     l“Since 1988, CREF has offered a Money Market Account, and since 1990, CREF has
offered a ~nd Market Account. When the survey data were collected in 1988, however,
virtually all CREF assets were invested in equities.

are frequently         referred to as premiums). 1e There is a clear link between        age, income, and

the fraction of contributions        allocated to fixed-income      instruments.     The TIAA share is 32

percent for those under the age of 35.             It rises to 38 percent for those between     the ages of

45 and 54, and then to 53 percent                 for those over the age of 65 who are still making

contributions      to TIAA-CREF.      The fraction devoted to TIM         declines by more than fifteen

percentage       points as we move from individuals with incomes of less than $25,000                to those

with incomes above $100,000.

        The fraction of total TIAA-CREF assets held in TIAA accounts is remarkatiy                  similar to

the asset atiocation mix of current contributions.              This reflects the combined effect       of an

increase over time in the share of contributions              that participants    have allocated   to CREF

accounts, and the greater return on equities than on bonds. The first effect would cause the

contribution      -e       going to TIAA to fall below the share of existing assets held in TIAA

accounts, while the second effect works in the opposite direction.

        To ftiher         ex~we   the factors that affect asset allocation choices, we obtained data

from the 1988           TIAA-CREF   Participant    Survey.    This unique data base has been usad by

Laitner and Justar ( 1996) to stud y the determinants of intergenerational            altruism; the data are

described in detail in Juster and Laitner (1990).            In addition to information on tha percentage

of TIAA-CREF accumulation           held in each type of account, drawn from participant records, the

data base also includes information         on participant and other famtiy income, financial assets

and other components           of net worth, and various demographic characteristics.          We use this

to hybrid accounts or other specialized accounts.

            + X ~,i*EDUC,        + 1 ~,i*WEALTHj      + c.

EDUC, denot~     a sat of indicator variables for particular ranges of education,         and WEALTHi

similarly denotes a set of indicator variables for nat worth in various categories.           Nat worth

is defined as the sum of all f~            assets nat of dabta, ~        the reported va&Js of housing,

-      real estate,    boats, autos,    life insurance,   trusts,   and businesses   owned.       INCOME

corresponds to family income, so it includes both income that the TIAA-CREF participant may

earn outside the educational institution, as well as income earned by others in the household.

The median asset share in TIAA for this sample is 43 percent, and the mean is 52 percent.

These values are highar than in the 1993 data shown in TabJe 9, consistent with the view

that TIAA-CREF     participants have becorna increasing y equity-oriented          over tirne.m

       Table 11 presents the results of estimating these regression models. The ta~e shows

three different specifications     with respect to education and wealth.         The only demographic

variable that affects asset aUocation in all three specifications       is the gender of the respondent;

woman systamaticalJy invest approximately            four percent more of their accumulation      in TIAA

SOcounta. 21 Family incoma, education,           and h~             net worth are also related to assat

~uti        choicas.   With respect to family home,          tha only category indicator that enters the

equations   in a statistically    significant   fashion is that for family income above $100,000.

Participants from such households allocate batween five and seven percent less of their TIAA-



    ‘Assets in CREF accounts can be transferred into a TIAA account, but once assets have
bean pJaced in a TIAA account, thay may not be reallocated to a CREF account. This places
constraints on tha spaed with which tha aggregate TIAA-CREF portfolio can shift from bonds
to stocks.

    ‘lThis finding also appears in other data sets; see in particular Hinz, McCarthy,                 and
Turner’s (1996) analysis of data from the federal Thrift Savings Plan.

CREF assets to TIAA than do pafiicipants           from households with incomes below $50,000              per

year.     These   results are consistent      with   earlier evidence,     for 401 (k) clans and IRAs,

suggesting that higher income households are more likely to choose equity investments.                   With

respect to education, the only important distinction is between those TIAA-CREF participants

with twelve    or fewer years of schooling, and those with more than 12 years of schooling.

The former group allocates more than ten percent more of its portfolio to TIAA than does the

combinad more educated group.




3-4     ln~

          Similar asset    allocation   patterns   emerge    with   respect     to household    net worth.

Participants from households with net worth above $250,000                     allocate approximately    fwr

percent less of thair TIAA-CREF accumulation to TIAA, but there are no statistically significant

differences   in the asset allocation patterns of participants        from households with net worth

below this level.        The results in Table 11 support the evidence             from other sources that

suggest that high income, high net worth individuals are more likely to allocate retirement

saving assets to equities than are their counterparts            from Iower-tiome,        lower-net     worth

~s.

          Our ubiquitw     finding that Iowar-incm,        less-educated   individuals sllocata a smaller

sharts of ratirarnent plan assets to equities can be interpreted in either of two ways.               First, it

is possibb that these individuals are more risk averse than higher-income,                 batter-educated

individuals, and that they are choosing different asset allocations because of this underlying

difference in preferences.      The second, alternative,     interpretation,    is that these individuals do

not correctly parceive the higher expected returns associated with equity investing, and that

they are making an optimization         error by holding too large a share of their portfolio in fixed-
                                                    25

income assets.

           One way to distinguish between these alternative views might involve studying how

participant education affects        asset allocation choices.   If 401 (k) and other retirement   pJan

partic~pants in low income classes choose to hold a higher fraction of their assets in equity

after they have been exposed to information on portfolio returns, then the optimization error

view may receive some sup-               relative to the risk aversion ex~anation.     The Employee

Benefit Research Institute (1996a)        reports that asset allocation is one of the most frequent{ y

covered      topics in participant    education   programs   at firms with   401 (k) plans or similar

retirement savin~ options. The impact of this education on asset choices is an important issue

for further investigation.zz

           Tha extent to which individuals would use the proceeds accurndated           in mandatory

saving accounts to purchase annuities is another important issue in evaluating and designing

such @ans. Rdatively       few household surveys explicitly inquire about income received from

indiviti     annuity contracts.      The Health and Retirement Survey did include such a question,

but since the respondents were typically in their fifties, it is not surprising that the resulting

prevalence of annuity income, 1.57 percent, was low. 23 Perhaps more relevant, in the HRS

sample dy       8.0 percent of respondents who had previously worked for an employer with a

defined contribution pJan reported that they had selected an annuity as the method of payout




    22Miti,  VanDerhai, and Yakoboski (1996) present some information on the assat
allocation choices of individuals in 401 (k) plans with different types of participant education
systems, but they do not report ‘before and after” asset allocation patterns.

annuity income is #13,496.

fw their accumulated           DC plan assets.       Other possibJe responses to this question included

withdrawing       the money, rolling it over into an IRA, and allowing it to accumulate.




4.1    WOW      Current Retirees Moose         to Pur~

        A more valua~e         source of information on potential anntity demand is the 1988 TIAA-

CREF survey of annuitants, which paralleled the survey of TIAA-CREF contributors discussed

above but waa adtistered            dy     to annuity reci~ts.      X Annuities are only one of the ways

TIAA-CREF       participants    can withdraw     their accumulated      account balances.      Although rare

during the time period corresponding to this survey, participants could also choose lump sum

payouts w withdrawals           of several substantia~y equal payments.         The 1988 survey focused

ody on those participants          who had reached the distribution phase of their saving plan, and

who had chosan the annuity               option.2s    TIAA-CREF     offers a variety    of potential   annuity

options, including participating annuities (with a low guaranteed               payout rate but historically

substantial     dvidends)      for TIAA    participants    and variable annuities      based on a range of

different ~fdos         for CREF participants.

        Om of the quastions on the TIAA-CREF                   annuitant survey was “If yw     unexpectedly

received $100,000,          what would you do with it?” Just over one quarter of the respondents,

26.5   percent,    indicatad that they would wchasa               an annuity.   This fraction did not vwy

substantially     as a function of respondent          age.    RwgM y the same fraction,       24.5    percent,

indicated that they wwld          either spend roughly $16,000         per year (which wtid      exhaust the




    ‘~he assat allocation patterns between TIAA and CREF in the participant and annuitant
surveys are similar. At the lowest education and net worth levels, there is a pronounced
tendency for greater investment in TIAA rather than CREF.

    ‘Some participants tight          have stopped contributing to TIAA-CREF, but not yet begun to
withdraw thair accumulation.           They would not be included in the survey.

windfall in abwt     eight years), or $10,000     per year (windfall exhausted in about twelve years.

Thirty seven percent of the respondents indicated that they wwld                  consume only the income

from the windfall,     and abwt    twelve   percent reported that they wwld            spend less than the

annual income from this windfall.

       It is important     to recognize three features of the TIAA-CREF               annuitant    group that

makes them special fw the purpose of analyzing annuity demand.                      First, all of the survey

participants have both a real annuity from Social Security and another annuity payout from

TIAA-CREF.M         Their responses     may consequent y not describe the responses of retired

households who do not have annuity couurage beyond Social Security, or the responses that

would be observed if the current Social Sacurit y system were pared back..                  Second, most of

the respondents are drawn from the upper quintile of the U.S. income and wealth distributions

(see Laitner and Juster (1 996)),       althwgh    thay are not Iikel y to represent the very highest

income and wealth strata of the population.             If the demand to bequeath assets is related to

lifetime incorna, then this group may provide a guide to the annuity demands of ~y                      a part

of the wpulation.      Third, the TIAA-CREF       participants may have access to annuities on more

favorable terms than individuals in the privata marketplace,               and may be assuming that they

wti    ~chase       additional annuities on such tarms.

       while    recognizing     these    limitations,        we   a~ored    the   factors   that   affect   the

respondent’s    answer regarding how a windfaU would be allocated.’7                 Our ap~oach       follows




    hlAA-CREF     participants who purchase standard annuities can choose between simple
nominal annuities and “graded” policies in which the stream of payments is backloaded in part
to offset the effacts of inflation. Thus TIAA-CREF annuitants are not necessarily holding
Sirn@e nominal annuities in addition to their Social Security real annuity.

     270na difficdt y with surveys of this type is ‘surveyor preference bias:” respondents
attempt to provide what they believe the survey-taker believes is the “correct” answer. It is
difficult to know how important biases of this type are likely to be in this data set.

the regression strategy that we used above to investigate the share of assets that TIAA-CREF


Particim          hold in TIAA accounts.           We now estimate linear probability models for each of

the    possible        responses      to the    qwstions     on windfall     use,   Nustratod    for exam~      by

BUYANNUITY,             which equals unity if the respondent indicated that he or she would purchase

an annuity with the windfall proceeds:

(2)        BUYANNUITY              = #0 + #l ●AGE + ~z*MARRIED             + #~* FEMALE + ~a*SOCSEC

                                   + #~*KIDS    + E #e,l*EDUCj + Z f17,j*WEALTH, + E.

The family income varide                 from the earlier specification       is now replaced ~h       a variati

measuring tha house~’s                 Social Security benefits, which proxy for a ranking of tifetime labor

income.       We also augment the eartier specification             with a varia~e     indicating whether or not

the house~             has children, since that may be a proximate determinant              of annuity demand.

           The resuJts of estimating this equation are shown in Table 12, and they suggest that

it is difficult to fti       simplta patterns in the responses to these questions.               The only robust

-i-            f~ti       is t~t     TIU-CREF      participants    with c~ren       are less likely to cho~     an

annuity w a rapid “spend-down”                 plan, and more likely to pursue policies that preserve their

capital,      than     are participants     without    children.     There   is some evidence       that   married

respondents are less likely to annuitize a windfall than are other respondents; this may indicate

a belief that tha question is Iirnited to individual annuitias, which terminate at th                death of the

annuitant (a married coupJe could also choosa a jointand survivor’s annuity).                       There is also

           One issue that Tl~-CREF                 data can edighten      is the type of annuity contracts        that

i~iduals          purchase        when    they do purchase         annuities.      TIAA-CREF    retirement    annuity

contiacts    can be written on a single life or two lives (typically to provide for the participant

and a spouse), and these contracts can be written as simple annuities, in which the payouts

ceasa whan the annuitant(s)               die, or as annuities with guarantees that payments will be made

for a certain period, even if the annuitant(s)               do not survive for this period.n         In a standard

Iifecycle setting without bequest motives, the simple annuity, which provides a higher monthly

payout      in each period when the annuitant                  is alive than any of the guaranteed            options,

domimtes      the other choices.ze

           Tabk        13   presents     information    on the choice           of annuity   @icy   by TIAA-CREF

~icipants         who contracted          for annuities in 1978 and in 1994.          The ta~   shows both single-

Iife and joint-life         annuity    policies.    King (1 996)     reports that in 1978,      44 percent      of the

annuitias contracted              for by male TIAA-CREF      participants were single-life policies, compared

with 26 percent of such policies in 1994.                 For w-n,         the respective percentages        of single-

Iifa -s           were 81 percent (1 978) and 68 percent (1 994).

           Ths table shows that simple annuities without gwantee                       provisions account for only




    ‘-Yws-certain”   annuities are life annuities with a guarantee that payments will be made
for at least some number of years.

    Whis assumes that the available annuity policy is actuarially fair for the potential
purchaser. In practice, since TIAA-CREF uses a unisex tife table to price annuities, it cwld
ba the case that poJicies other than a simple annuity are optimal for some participants.
                                                        30

about me third of all single annuity policies, but less than fifteen percent of joint life policies.

Policies with certain payout periods of fifteen years or more account for more than one third

of the single+ife annuities chosen by both men and women in 1994,                     and they account for

nearly two-thirds of the two-life policies. Since the guarantee provisions in annuity contracts

only become operative when the annuitit                dies, in the case of single-life policies, or when

~      annuitants die, in the case of two-life policies, the widespread choice of annuities with

guaratees     casts doubt M the vafue of the simple Iifecycla model as a starting point for

describing househofd annuity demand.



                                                ..                  ,..
4.3    Theore~                        of the Utlllty Gain from An~atlo~

         To provide some perspective            on the utility consequences       of choosi~   to amuitize   a

giv~     amount of wealth,       we present illustrative calculations similar to those in Kotlikoff and

Spivak(198       1 ) and Friedman and Warshawsky         ( 1990).   We consider an individual who derives

utility from consumption each month according to a standard iso-elastic utility function, U~ =

(C,l~ -1 V(I -#), where B is the coefficient         of relative risk aversion.    When # = 1, this utdity

function yields the special case of logarithmic utility.            We assume that an individual faces a

proba~ty     of daath each month that corresponds to the annual mortatity rates reported in the

1996 Social Security Actuary’s cohort life table for man bwn in 1930 (i.e., 65-year-dds                      in

1995).     We assume that no one lives beyond age 115, and that lifetime expected                  utility for

a man aged 65 is given by

                           115
(3)               v   =     ~ pt+(l    + ~“’*u(c,)
                          t=65

where P, denotes the survival probability (to age t) for a sixty-five             year dd white man and 6

is the individual’s time preference rate.
                                                     31

           We   first compute   the expected    lifetime    utility   associated   with   a “home-made

annuitization”    policy that involves consuming an amount in each period that equals current

wealth divided by life expectancy. m This im~ies that wealth evolves accordkg                to:

(4)               w t+l = (1 + r)Wt - (l/~)   *W,

where r is the real rate of return.     We assume that an individual has accumdeted            assets of

100 at age 65, find the value of V (which we denote V ~)                       that corresponds    to this

consumption strategy.

           Next, we assume that the individual can purchase an actuarially fair real annuity at age

65.   We find the level of wealth at age 65 that wodd            generate the same Iifatime expected

utility as the home-made annuity appJkd to wealth of 100 at age 65. Tha ratio of this wealth

to 100 indicates how much the wealth of the 65-year-old               could reduced, while leaving him

at tha sama lifetime expectad        ut~ity level, if he had accass to an actuarially        fair annuity

market.     We perform a similar calcdation    assuming that only nominal annuities are availa~e,

but again maintaining the assumption that these policies are actuarially fair.

           Finally, we consider the effect of allowing for pre-existing real annuity policies in this

setting.    We assume that the 65-year-old      man has both 100 in accumulated           assets and the

claim to a real annuity with an expected            present value of 100; that is, Wf      his wealth   is

annuitized.      We then repeat the calculation       allowing this individual to purchase a real or

nominal annuity, and find the reduction in wealth that would lead to the same expected utility

Ievd if tha annuity market were avahble.



    Yhis    doas not represent the optimal consumption @icy in the presence of lifetime
uncertainty, except in special cases. When period-by-period utility is given by U = log c,, and
the individual’s time preference rate is zero, for example, the optimal consumption profile
involves consuming wealth/(life expectancy) in each period. We focus on this consumption
rule even in cases when it is not optimal because it is a simple rule, analogous to some
withdrawal roles from retirement saving accounts such as IRAs, that individuals might easily
implement.
                                                  32

       TaUe 14 presents the results of these calculations.       The upper panel considers the case

in which real annuities are available in the private market, and the lower panel considers the

case of ntinal     annuities.    The first entry, for the log utility (#?= 1) case, shows that with

a three percent real interest rate and an annual discount rate of one percent, with no “pre-

existing” annuity,    an individual would receive the same lifetime expected          utfity    if he had

waalth of 100 and no access to a real annuity market, or wealth of 64.0 and access to such

a market.    A 65-year-old      man would be prepared to give up 36 percent of his wealth if he

could purchase a real annuity rather than consume according to the reciprocal life expectancy

role. This finding, and the other results in the table for different parameter values, is broadly

consistent with the results from the Kotlikoff and Spivak (1981)        study.    Higher risk aversion

values increasa the share of wealth that the individd         would be prepared to give up to obtain

access to an actuarially fair annuity market.31

       The lower panel of Table 14 presents results for nominal rather than real annuities.

The waalth      equivalent   rasults are similar to those for the red       annuity   case,     although

individuals wouJd not be prepared to forego as much wealth if they cdd              purchase nominal

as if they CM     purchase real annuities.    The effect of a~owing for a pre-existing red annuity

stream on h       weaJth equiv~nt       measure   is small, as can be seen from the differences

between the wealti      aquiva&nts    in ths first and seed     columns of Tati     14.

       These findings, wtila       based on a stylized model, generally suggest that individuals

receiva substantial    expected    utility benefits from purchasing annuity contracts,         at least in

standard models.      They draw attention to the limited fraction of TIAA-CREF        annuitants who

rem      that they woufd use a lump sum windfall to purchase an additional annuity.




5. Cotions           and E~

         More than half of U.S. households between the agesof51                 and61   currently participate

in some form of sdfdirected          retiement    saving account.    The financial management          decisions

of houaahdds      with these accounts can provide msi              atvidence on the how houaahdds         might

manage funds in a mandatory             private saving system.      Wa consider two aspects of financial

management:       asset allocation between         stocks and bonds, and demand for annuities.             With

respect to the choice between               stocks and bonds, we find that the aggregate            fraction of

401 (k) or IRA assets that are held in stocks is smahr,                 by approximate y ten percentage

points, than the equity fraction held by defined benefit pension fund managers.                    One notabfe

feature of 401(k)     investment        patterns is that they involve more holdings of own-company

stock, and less investment in diversified portfolios of common stocks or international eqtities,

than defined benefit plan portfolios.          The share of401 (k) and IRA assets allocated to equities,

either via direct stock holding or through investment with intermediaries such as mutual funds,

has increasad signif~dy            -e       tha kte   1980s.   There are clear age-related        and incorne-

rehtad    @erm       in asnt     dl~tion:      higher incQma ~s,                and younger participants      in

retiement     sav~    -,         tend to hdd a higher fr~ti~        of their asaats in equities.

         Whik     these    f-s          provide some evidence        on asset    allocation,    they   must be

interpreted     with caution for two important          reasons.     Ftist, pfan participants     do not have

compfete investment         discretion with ra~ct        to aJl assets in 401 (k) ~ans,        as they do with

assets in Individual Retirement          Accounts.     Some 401 (k) pfans involve restrictions on asset

choice, such as rules that employer contributions              must be invested in employer stock.            A

related issue may arise in analyzing allocations for TIAA-CREF                participants,    some of whom
                                                      34

face restrictions on the allocation of account inflows.          Asset allocation patterns in IRAs may

therefore provide a better indicator of unconstrained asset choice than decisions in existing

employment-linked          retirement saving plans.

        A second difficulty        in interpreting   existing asset allocation     decisions is that these

decisions are made in an envirmment            in which individuals expect to receive a real annuity,

Social Security, which provides a floor on their consumption                opportunities.   Because some

mandatory saving plans would scale back at least part of the existing Social Security system,

it is possible that portfolio allocation decisions in such an environment would differ from those

under the currant system.         This is an issue that can be analyzed under specific assumptims

about tha nature of individual’s utility fwtions,          the distribution of returns avaiJable to them,

and the nature of Social Security.

        This paper also prasents ~             evidence on the damand for annuities by participants

in the TIAA-CREF       system, which provides retirement         benefits for employees of educational

institutions.     Roughly one quarter of TIAA-CREF           annuitants     in the late 1980s, a group of

individuals who already receive income from annuitis,                indicated that if thy      received   a

$100,000        windfa~,    they would use these funds to purchase an ~                      annuity.   Our

anaJysis of a cross-sactional         survey of thasa Tl~-CREF             annuitants   reveals few strong

cwrelates of this demand for additional annuities; married individuals are less likely to demand

an additional annuity, and there is weak evidence that those with higher levels of net worth

would be less likely to annuitize a windfall.

        An impwant          issue, that we have unfortunately      been unable to find data to ~alyze,

concerm     the choice between        annuities and otbr      payout options by individds        who have

accumulated       assets in retirement     saving plans.    Participants    in the Health and Retirement

Survey, who were between the ages of 51 and 61, report that in eight percent of the cases
                                                        35

when they left previous employers who had offered defined contribution ~ans, they chose to

distribute plan assets by purchasing an annuity.             This sample is too young to provide a clear

Wspactive      on tb    decisions made by individuals who reach rettiement with Wstantial              assets

accumulated       in a self-directed   retirement    saving account.

        Even if it were possible to accurately measure the fraction of assets that are annuitized

in this way,      it is not clear how this informatti         would bear on individual choicas under a

system of mandatory saving accounts.                For Precidy     the reasons noted above, any prop-l

that scales back the real annuity associated with the existing Social Security system may

affect individual demand for annuities.             It is not clear what model to use in evaluating this

issue. In simple Iife%ycle models, individuals with access to actuarially fair annuity markets

should annuitiza all of their wealth at retirement.               However,    these models may not provide

a realistic guida to individual behavior.            In models with bequest motives,          private annuity

markets that do not offer actuarially         fair annuities, and uncertainty         regarding future health

risks and associated        consumption     needs, individuals might choose not to fully annuitize.

Analyzing   how individuals would decide between                  annuities and other distribution    options

requires a tiel        that incorporates thesa featwes.       In addition, as Diamond (1994)       notes, one

of tha kay eons            about a system of privately~naged                 saving accounts is what annuity

policies wdl ba offered by pfivate insurers in this setting.                  Considering general equilibrium

effects in ths annuity market corn~icates             the analysis even fwther.

Accounts, CDs, ~        Money Market Funds,” “Stocks, - “Bonds,” “A Com~tim             of Stocks

of indivm       reporting “A Combination of Stocks and Bonds” is added to the equity total.
For 401 (k), 403(b), and other defined cmtribution pension fund investments, tha options are
“-y       in stocks, “ ‘mostly b bonds, and “split bet wean. ” We add those as~ts that are
