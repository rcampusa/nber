                                              ABSTRACT

Alcohol policies have potentially far-reaching impacts on risky sexual behavior, prenatal health behaviors,
and subsequent outcomes for infants. We examine whether changes in minimum drinking age (MLDA)
laws affect the likelihood of poor birth outcomes. Using data from the National Vital Statistics (NVS)
for the years 1978-88, we find that a drinking age of 18 is associated with adverse outcomes among
births to young mothers -- including higher incidences of low birth weight and premature birth, but
not congenital malformations. The effects are largest among black women. We find suggestive evidence
from both the NVS and the 1979 National Longitudinal Study of Youth (NLSY) that the MLDA laws
alter the composition of births that occur. In states with lenient drinking laws, young black mothers
are more likely to have used alcohol 12 months prior to the birth of their child and less likely to report
paternal information on the birth certificate. We suspect that lenient drinking laws generate poor birth
outcomes because they increase the number of unplanned pregnancies.

1         Introduction

State regulations on the consumption of alcohol by minors are widely credited with reducing teen

drinking and alcohol-related traffic fatalities. Much less emphasized is the potential effect of drink-

ing policy on pregnancy and drinking while pregnant, and subsequent outcomes for infants. The

existing evidence suggests that alcohol policies affect risky sexual behavior and influence teen birth

rates. However, surprisingly little is known about whether, by reducing underage drinking, alco-

hol regulations also improve birth and infant outcomes. Given the high teen pregnancy rate in the

United States and the high incidence of drinking among young adults (47 percent of twelfth graders

in the 2005 Monitoring the Future Survey drank in the month prior to the survey), the impact of

alcohol regulation on outcomes among births to young mothers is potentially large.

        In this paper, we evaluate the consequences of minimum legal drinking age (MLDA) laws on

birth outcomes. Despite the fact that all states have had a drinking age of 21 since the late

1980s, policy interest in minimum drinking ages and alcohol policy more generally remains high.1

There are two channels by which access to alcohol by young adults might affect the health of the

next generation. First, by increasing risky sexual behavior, alcohol consumption could change the

composition of births towards parents with fewer resources and births resulting from unintended

pregnancies. Second, independent of the compositional effect, drinking alcohol during pregnancy

may cause poor health outcomes directly.

        Using data from the National Vital Statistics (NVS) to analyze increases in state minimum

drinking ages over the 1980s, we find that less restrictive drinking laws are associated with higher

rates of low birth weight and premature births to young mothers. The results are particularly strong

for black mothers. We then use both the NVS and the 1979 National Longitudinal Study of Youth

(NLSY) to explore whether these adverse outcomes are due to changes in parental characteristics,

    1
    There have been a number of recent studies examining minimum drinking age laws, as discussed in
section 2.1.



                                                  2
prenatal health behaviors, or both. Although the findings suggest that black mothers are more likely

to drink while pregnant if the drinking age is low, most of the evidence points to a compositional

story. In particular, young black mothers are more likely to have used alcohol 12 months prior

to the birth of their child and less likely to report paternal information on the birth certificate in

states with a drinking age of 18.

        Our analysis proceeds in two parts. First, we examine the relationship between drinking laws

and low birth weight births, prematurity, and congenital anomalies. Second, we examine parental

characteristics and prenatal health behaviors to evaluate how these might contribute to the observed

relationship between MLDA laws and infant health.


2         Background and Previous Literature
2.1        Minimum Drinking Age Laws

During the early 1970s, 29 states lowered their minimum legal drinking age from 21 (in most

cases) to 18, 19, or 20. Because of a subsequent rise in alcohol-related traffic accidents involving

young drivers, the majority of these states increased their MLDA in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

In 1984, the federal Uniform Drinking Age Act stipulated that federal highway funds would be

withheld from states that did not have a MLDA of 21; as a result, by 1988, the MLDA in all states

was 21. Our study focuses on the years 1978 to 1988.2

        The changes in the MLDA have been widely studied, and there is agreement among most

researchers in the field that a higher MLDA reduces driving fatalities and alcohol consumption

among young adults. Using cross-sectional variation in state laws, Coase and Grossman (1988)

estimate that a uniform drinking age of 21 in all states would reduce the fraction of 16-to-21-year-

    2
     We do not examine the effect of legal drinking age reductions in the early 1970s. Vital statistics data do
not include consistent reporting for prematurity or congenital anomalies during this time period. Further-
more, it should be noted that these reductions sometimes corresponded with “mature minor” provisions that
influenced access to contraception for young women, making it difficult to isolate the effect of the MLDA
policy during that time period.

olds who drink more than 4 times a week by 3 percentage points (from a base of 11.5) and the

number who drink 1-3 times a week by 2 percentage points (from a base of 27.3). Kaestner (2000)

uses several econometric approaches and finds inconsistent estimates of the effect of drinking age

laws overall. However, the estimates of these laws on drinking among affected women are fairly

robust and suggest a reduction in the weekly frequency of drinking of 0.3 on a base of 1 occasion

per week. DiNardo and Lemieux (2001) estimate a structural model using state and time variation

in the drinking age; it implies that raising the drinking age from 18 to 21 decreases the fraction

of high school seniors in a state who use alcohol by 4.5 percentage points from a base of 67.

Carpenter and Dobkin (2007) find a discontinuous jump in alcohol use and associated mortality

around age 21. Miron and Tetelbaum (2007), however, argue that increases in the drinking age are

not responsible for traffic fatalities. In an overview of the alcohol policy literature, Cook and Moore

(2002) conclude that there is “consensus that MPA [minimum purchase age] is effective in controlling

alcohol consumption and abuse by those young enough to be affected (p.125).” Wagenaar and

Toomey (2002) conduct another review of the literature and find that about half of the studies

find evidence of a statistically significant inverse relationship between minimum drinking ages and

alcohol use, while most of the remaining studies find no significant relationship.

   It is worth noting that several studies of the studies referenced above document effects of

drinking age policies on high school seniors or youth under eighteen years of age. When the

drinking age is 21, a sixteen-year-old is less likely to have friends or siblings who are legal to

purchase alcohol, and is less likely to be able to ‘pass’ as legal using false identification. Indeed,

given the lack of drinking age enforcement on college campuses, it is possible that the effects of the

minimum age laws would be concentrated among high school students.

   In sum, although the findings are not uniform, the preponderance of evidence suggests that

higher legal drinking ages reduce alcohol consumption among young adults, including high school

students under 18, to a modest degree.

2.2     Effect of Alcohol Policies on the Composition of Births

Alcohol policies may affect infant outcomes through a change in the composition of births. There

is an extensive literature demonstrating the positive relationship between substance use and risky

adolescent sexual behavior, including early initiation of sexual intercourse, multiple sexual partners,

and engaging in intercourse without contraception (see Rashad and Kaestner (2004) for an extensive

list). Thus, teens that drink are more likely to have unprotected sex and to become pregnant

(Kaestner & Joyce, 2000; Cooper, 2002; Grossman & Markowitz, 2002; Rees, Argys, & Averett,

2001; Hingson, Strunin, Berlin, & Heeren, 1990; Markowitz, Kaestner, & Grossman, 2005; Rashad

& Kaestner, 2004; Sen, 2002).

   Previous work has also investigated the relationship between alcohol policy and fertility. Sen

(2003) finds that higher beer taxes do not have an effect on aggregate state-level birth rates, but

that they reduce teen abortion rates. Using variation in MLDA laws, Dee (2001) reports that

alcohol availability and use have large effects on childbearing among black teens, but does not find

convincing evidence that this is the case for white teens.

   Birth outcomes may suffer if a greater fraction of births are to teen mothers whose pregnancies

resulted from alcohol use and were unintended. Unwanted pregnancy is associated with prenatal and

postpartum maternal behaviors that adversely affect infant and child health (Brown & Eisenberg,

1995; Joyce, Kaestner, & Korenman, 2000). In sum, it is quite plausible that alcohol control policies

alter the composition of teens who give birth and that this compositional change affects average

birth outcomes.


2.3     Effect of Alcohol Policies on Prenatal Alcohol Use

Despite a large literature on alcohol policies in general and minimum drinking age laws in particular,

there is little evidence on the effect of these policies on drinking while pregnant and on infant

outcomes. It is striking to contrast the sizable literature on the effect of tobacco control policies



                                                  5
on maternal tobacco use (e.g., Evans & Ringel, 1999; Colman, Grossman, & Joyce, 2003) to the

absence of information on the effect of alcohol policies on maternal alcohol use.

   Maternal alcohol use is of interest because the potential impact is large. Estimates of drinking

alcohol among pregnant women are around 20 percent according to three data sources (CDC,

1995; NIDA, 1994; Serdula, Williamson, Kendrick, Anda, & Byers, 1991) and the rates of drinking

and heavy drinking are particularly high for women who are younger, less educated, and single

(Leonardson & Loudenburg, 2003). Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), which is thought to result

from high prenatal alcohol exposure, involves growth retardation, characteristic facial features, and

anomalies of the central nervous system (O’Leary, 2004). A conservative estimate of the prevalence

of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) in 1993 is 6.7 cases in 10,000 births, based on the Centers for

Disease Control and Prevention birth defects surveillance programs (CDC, 1995). These estimates

are expected to be a lower bound since FAS is a complex diagnosis and is not always recognized

at birth (Stratton, Howe, & Battaglia, 1996). Higher estimates of FAS and more generally of fetal

alcohol effects are found by clinic-based studies - from 1.7 to 3.3 cases in 1,000 births in the U.S.

(Stratton et al., 1996). Given that there are 4 million births a year in the U.S., there could be as

many as 13,000 babies born with birth defects associated with prenatal alcohol use. The estimated

annual cost of care for individuals with FAS in the U.S. was $4 billion in 1998 (Lupton, Burd, &

Harwood, 2004).

   While there is substantial evidence that heavy drinking is related to preterm delivery (Albertsen,

Andersen, Olsen, & Gronbaek, 2004) and low birth weight (Day & Richardson, 2004; Whitehead &

Lipscomb, 2003), epidemiologists and other medical researchers argue that the effects of prenatal

exposure to alcohol may be significant even for low and moderate drinking (see Russell, 1991, for

a review). Day and Richardson (2004) argue that the effects of alcohol exposure on growth are

measurable at below one drink per day. Testa, Quigley, and Eiden (2003) find that prenatal alcohol

exposure at any level is associated with lower mental development. Day et al. (1991) find that



                                                 6
children born to mothers who drank alcohol moderately during pregnancy had significant height

and weight deficits at age three. In addition, policies affecting prenatal alcohol consumption in

Sweden are linked to adult labor market outcomes (Nilsson, 2008). An Institute of Medicine report

on prenatal nutrition suggests that prenatal alcohol use may interfere with the absorption of some

minerals, particularly zinc, calcium, and amino acids, and notes that heavy drinkers tend to have

poor nutrition (IOM, 1990). However, the report concludes that“the evidence concerning the effects

of low levels of alcohol consumption is both limited and inconsistent” (p.395). Indeed, most of the

studies in this area are associational in nature and are subject to selection concerns (Nilsson, 2008,

is a notable exception). Thus, neither the effect of alcohol policy on prenatal drinking nor the effect

of prenatal drinking on infant health is well understood.


3     Data

The primary data used in this study are the National Vital Statistics Natality Detail Files. Publicly

available data are available for births in 1968 and subsequent years; these data represent 50 or 100

percent samples of birth certificates for U.S. births, depending on the state and year. By 1979, all

but 9 states report information for 100 percent of births.

    We use birth years 1978-1989 to create a sample of births conceived in the years 1978-1988 to

mothers aged 14 to 24 at the time of conception. In 1978, 37 states and DC permitted alcohol

consumption for those under the age of 21; 1988 is the first year where no states permitted drinking

under age 21. We include women under age 18 because the literature described above indicates

that alcohol consumption among those under 18 is affected by state MLDA policies.

    Importantly, the data contain information on mother’s age, race, and state of residence. There

is also information on birth weight, and, with less completeness, gestation length and congenital

anomalies. Maternal and paternal characteristics are also reported. More recently, birth certificate

data include questions about smoking and drinking behavior, but this information is unavailable



                                                  7
in the years prior to 1989. In addition, there is concern that prenatal alcohol use in particular is

underreported in the Natality data (Evans & Ringel, 1999). We therefore use the Vital Statistics

data to estimate the reduced form relationship between MLDA laws and birth outcomes, and use

another data source, the NLSY, to investigate prenatal health behaviors.

       There are well known differences in health outcomes across race and ethnicity groups and

between immigrants and non-immigrants. A limitation of the natality data in this period is that

Hispanic status is inconsistently measured over time and across states, with a very large fraction of

missing values. To investigate heterogeneous effects of alcohol policy, two demographic sub-samples

are considered: births to native born white mothers and birth to native born black mothers. A

third group, births to immigrant mothers, is included in the full sample, but because results for

this group are almost always insignificant, we do not report them separately.3 In interpreting the

results, it is important to keep in mind that all groups include a combination of Hispanic and

non-Hispanic mothers.

       The sample includes 16.17 million observations on births to mothers aged 14 to 24 at the time

of conception. As shown in Table 1, about 7.4 percent of births recorded in Vital Statistics have

low birth weight, with a higher rate of 13.0 percent for births to black mothers. The rates of

prematurity and congenital anomalies are 10.5 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively, with rates of

18.3 percent and 1.4 percent for black mothers.

       Data on MLDA laws come from the Distilled Spirits Council of the U.S. (DISCUS).4 We use the

minimum drinking age in the estimated month of conception as the indicator for the relevant policy

regime. We use the date of conception as the relevant date because the effects of prenatal alcohol

use are thought to be particularly pronounced in the first trimester. Furthermore, the policy at the

date of conception would capture any health effects due to changes in the composition of women

   The lack of significance may indicate that these mothers are not affected by the laws or may result from
smaller sample sizes.

becoming pregnant. We assume the month of conception is nine months prior to the month of birth

in cases where gestation length is not reported, and otherwise use the gestation length to calculate

the month of conception. Because the vital statistics report maternal age at birth but not birth

date, we assume age at conception is one year younger than age at birth if gestation length exceeds

six months or is not reported and assume age at conception equals age at birth otherwise. Roughly

twenty-five percent of our sample will be classified as younger at conception than their actual age.

This could bias the estimated effect of the policy regime, most likely by attenuating the results.5

      As a supplement to the main analysis, we examine drinking, smoking, and sexual behavior

among young women and mothers using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979. The

NLSY follows a cohort aged 14 to 21 in 1979 from 1979 onwards. In 1979, when all individuals in

the NLSY were 21 or younger, 37 states and DC permitted alcohol consumption for those under

the age of 21. By 1986, when the youngest participants in the NLSY reached age 21, only 7 states

permitted drinking under age 21. The restricted version of the dataset includes state identifiers

which allow us to match individuals to the relevant alcohol policy regime. The NLSY asks all

women who became mothers by 1986 whether they had used alcohol or cigarettes in the twelve

months prior to birth or during pregnancy. The NLSY also asks questions about a woman’s sexual,

fertility, and marital history in 1984 and 1985 and a more limited set of questions in 1986. From

these questions, we can discern the month and year in which a woman had sex for the first time

and the timing of her births.

      Table 2 shows means of variables for two NLSY samples: one of women in the cohort observed

monthly between 1979 and 1986 if between the ages of 14 and 24, and one of births that occurred

by 1986 to women in the cohort aged 14 to 24. To be consistent with the NVS analysis, we show

separate analyses for native born white mothers and native born black mothers, where native born

Hispanic mothers are assumed to be white. The cohort sample includes 319,346 observations on

  5
   Analysis by year of age shows a minimal effect of MLDA policies on birth outcomes for 20-year-old
mothers. We are therefore not concerned that our results are driven by misclassification.

4,164 women, who are between the ages of 14 and 24, observed between the years 1979 and 1986.

71 percent had sex for the first time and 35 percent became pregnant for the first time during this

period, with slightly higher rates of 77 percent and 37 percent, respectively, among native black

women. 46 percent of all women in the sample had at least one birth (not necessarily their first

birth) during this period, with a higher birth rate of 54 percent among native black women. 16

percent had at least one non-marital birth, with a substantially higher non-marital birth rate of 37

percent among native black women. The birth sample includes 3,910 births to 2,750 mothers aged

14 to 24 at the time of birth. 40 percent of these mothers drank 12 months before the birth of their

child and 33 percent drank during pregnancy, with higher rates of drinking of 46 percent and 38

percent, respectively, among native white women. These are higher rates of prenatal alcohol use

than the 20 percent estimated by the CDC and others (CDC, 1995; NIDA, 1994; Serdula et al.,

1991) mentioned above, presumably because this is a young cohort of women.

   Several features of the NLSY are important to note. First, the data set is longitudinal, so each

woman appears multiple times in the cohort sample and, if a woman has had multiple children, she

will appear multiple times in the birth sample. We treat each monthly observation or birth as a

separate observation. Standard errors take account of intrastate correlations across observations, so

they account for repeated observations of a mother in most cases. Second, the NLSY over-samples

blacks and Hispanics. We treat the un-weighted NLSY cohort as our sample, recognizing that it is

not representative of the United States. The number of births in each state-age-year cell is small.

Furthermore, because of the aging of the cohort, there are no births to 16-year-olds after 1981

and no births to 17-year-olds after 1982, and so on. These limitations lead us to view the NLSY

evidence as suggestive rather than definitive, particularly for births to the youngest mothers.




                                                 10
4     Empirical Strategy

Studying the effects of alcohol policy, rather than alcohol use per se, has the advantage that it is

less subject to concerns about selection. Women who drink prior to pregnancy or while pregnant

are likely to be different on a wide range of unobserved dimensions. Potential confounding factors

which may be correlated with prenatal drinking include illicit drug use, number of prenatal doctor

visits, nutrition, and other health and life-style behaviors. Drinking frequency may be positively

related to socioeconomic status.6 Because drinking is correlated with factors that directly impact

infant health, it is difficult to isolate the causal effect of drinking on birth outcomes. For this reason,

we focus on the effect of MLDA laws, which are plausibly exogenous to the personal characteristics

of young women affected by them. Changes in birth outcomes associated with MLDA laws are

likely due to the causal impact of the laws on substance use prior to or during pregnancy.

    It is important to keep in mind that alcohol policy may affect the use of drugs other than alcohol.

For example, alcohol consumption is a complement to cigarette consumption (Cameron & Williams,

2001; Decker & Schwartz, 2000; Serdula et al., 1991), and maternal smoking is known to be harmful

to the fetus (Case & Paxson, 2002). Decker and Schwartz (2000) estimate that a one percent rise

in the price of beer decreases smoking by about the same amount as a one percent rise in the price

of cigarettes, suggesting that smoking is very responsive to changes in drinking behavior. DiNardo

and Lemieux (2001) estimate that raising the minimum drinking age from 18 to 21 increases the

prevalence of marijuana use among high school seniors by about 2 percentage points, implying that

marijuana and alcohol are substitutes. Thus, the observed relationship between alcohol policy and

infant outcomes could be mediated by substances which are complements or substitutes to alcohol.

We address this concern in part by investigating whether changes in MLDA laws affect smoking

   6
     Casswell, Pledger, and Hooper (2003) find that frequency of drinking is positively influenced by income,
but less well-educated young adults drink significantly more during a drinking occasion. Cook and Moore
(2002) use the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse for 1996 and find that the self-reported prevalence
of drinking increases with education and family income. However, Lowry, Kann, Collins, and Kolbe (1996)
report that lower family income is associated with episodic heavy drinking among adolescents.


                                                     11
behavior.

       To estimate the effect of MLDA laws on birth outcomes, we use a difference-in-differences model

with women aged 21 to 24 at the time of conception as a control group to account for unobserved

time-varying state-level factors which could affect infant health. In doing so, we implicitly assume

drinking laws have a negligible effect on the behavior of those 21 and older.7 We view the increase

in the drinking age as an increase in the cost of obtaining alcohol for young women.

       In an analysis of drinking habits among high school seniors, Dee (2001) finds that an indicator

for an MLDA of 18 captures the relevant variation in drinking behavior. We follow this standard

in our analysis.8 Thus, the baseline specification for the least squares birth outcome analysis is as

follows:


                            outcomeiasm = B1 M LDA18sm                                                  (1)

                                           + B2 M LDA18sm age14to17iasm

                                           + B3 M LDA18sm age18to21iasm

                                           + δs + θy + αa + uiasm




where M LDA18 indicates whether the drinking age in the state was 18 in the month of conception,

age14to17 indicates mothers who were between the ages of 14 and 17 at the time of conception, and

age18to20 indicates mothers who were between the ages of 18 and 20 at the time of conception. The

M LDA18 variable controls for any unobserved state characteristics affecting birth outcomes across

   7
    Because 21-to-24-year-olds in a low MLDA state were themselves more likely to have been legal to drink
at eighteen, they may be more likely to drink as adults. If that is the case, the effect of MLDA laws on
women under twenty-one could be understated.
   8
     We have also tried tracking the legality of each cohort to drink. This approach generates results that
are less robust, in part because teenagers under eighteen may be indirectly affected by changes to the legal
drinking age. Furthermore, we have replicated the analysis using an indicator for a drinking age of 21. The
results are largely consistent with those presented here for the NVS analysis, but the NLSY results become
insignificant.

weight status, preterm birth status, and whether the baby has any congenital anomalies. Because

the NLSY samples are too small to detect changes in these relatively rare birth events, we only use

the NVS for the birth outcomes regressions.

       To augment the baseline model, we include various sets of controls. We include controls for birth

characteristics - whether the infant is male and the plurality of the birth - which are unlikely to be

endogenous to the policy regime. These controls do not affect our estimates very much. In some

specifications, we also add controls for maternal characteristics including race/ethnicity/nativity

status, education, and number of children. These factors may reflect underlying state-level popula-

tion changes, or may stem from compositional effects associated with the policy change. Paternal

characteristics such as age, race/ethnicity, and education, are also included in some models.9 In the

birth weight analysis, additional controls for preterm birth are included in some models to assess

the extent to which low birth weight is due to prematurity. In addition, in some specifications,

we control for state-specific time trends and age-specific time trends. In the appendix, we also

consider the effects of other time-varying factors that could influence birth outcomes, such as beer

and cigarette taxes, parental notification and consent abortion laws and aggregate birth rates.

       All reported results are for linear probability models.10

   9
    We experimented with including mother’s marital status as a proxy for the father’s relationship to the
mother. However, states had different policies for determining marital status during this time. Some states
used last names to impute marital status, and others assumed the mother was married unless she specifically
indicated otherwise. The results of models including the marital status variables are often counterintuitive.
Because this variable seems to be unreliable, we exclude it from the specifications we present here. We view
the presence or absence of paternal information on the birth certificate as a more reliable indicator of the
relationship between the parents at the time of birth.
  10
    As noted by Ai and Norton (2003), coefficients on interaction terms in non-linear models cannot be
readily interpreted.

5     Effect of MLDA Laws on Birth Outcomes
5.1     Birth Weight

Birth weight is a widely used and accurately measured indicator of infant health at birth. The

medical literature suggests that prenatal alcohol use may stunt fetal growth, which could lead to low

birth weight. In addition, if alcohol use leads to an increased number of unintended pregnancies, the

resulting births could have an increased incidence of low birth weight because of prenatal behaviors

or parental characteristics associated with low birth weight. Births under 2500g are considered low

birth weight.

    Table 3 shows the results of the low birth weight analysis for all women. The first column

includes state fixed effects, year of conception fixed effects, and maternal age fixed effects. Columns

II through V add additional sets of controls.

    In the first column of Table 3, there is a small but statistically significant effect of the MLDA

of 18 on low birth weight for both women younger than 18 and women between the ages of 18 and

20. Women conceiving under age 21 are 0.27 to 0.50 percentage points more likely to conceive a

low birth weight birth in months and states with a drinking age of 18 (on a base of 7.4 percentage

points.) The effects are larger for younger mothers. However, even among the youngest group, the

estimated effect is small in magnitude; moving to an MLDA of 18 increases the probability of low

birth weight by less than 10 percent. Controlling for birth characteristics (gender of baby, twin,

triplets or higher order status) has little effect on the estimates, as shown in column II.

    The model including state-specific time trends in Column III of Table 3 has no effect on the

coefficients of interest. Controlling for preterm birth (<37 weeks gestation) and whether the gesta-

tional length information was missing reduces coefficients by about a quarter, suggesting that part

of the observed effect on birth weight is due to prematurity. We explore the relationship between

drinking age laws and prematurity in section 5.2.

    When age-specific time trends are included in Column V of Table III, the size of the coefficients


                                                  14
falls by about a third and the estimates become statistically insignificant. We discuss this issue

below.

       Because birth outcomes are known to differ substantially by race/ethnicity and immigrant

status, we divide our sample into native-born white mothers, native-born black mothers, and im-

migrant mothers.11 Results for immigrant mothers are almost always insignificant and we do not

report them here. Table 4 presents the effect of MLDA laws on birth weight for the other two

demographic sub-groups. The results for native born white mothers are significant but smaller

in magnitude, ranging from 0.12 to 0.23 percentage points. The estimated effects for native born

black mothers are much larger, ranging from 0.59 to 0.99 percentage points. For both sub-groups,

the effects are robust to the inclusion of state-specific time trends.12

       In the third and seventh columns of Table 4, we include an indicator for whether the infant

was born prematurely (<37 weeks gestation) and whether the gestation length information was

missing. The inclusion of premature status reduces the estimated effect of MLDA laws on birth

weight by about a quarter to a third for native black mothers and somewhat less for white mothers.

This suggests that MLDA laws are associated with prematurity for black mothers, but prematurity

cannot fully account for the relationship between MLDA laws and birth weight.13 Below we examine

the association between MLDA laws and preterm birth directly.

       For white mothers 18-to-20 years old, the results in Table 4 are also robust to the inclusion of

age-specific time trends. However, for black mothers and for younger white mothers this is not the

  11
    As noted above, Hispanic status is not reliably reported during this period. All groups include both
Hispanics and non-Hispanics.
  12
    If we separate by metropolitan status, the results are statistically significant for rural white mothers,
rural black mothers, and urban black mothers. Also, it should be noted that the size of the coefficients for
the youngest black mothers are reduced by about half (but remain statistically significant) when controls for
beer taxes are included in the model. However, as discussed in the appendix, we suspect that the beer tax
variables may not capture meaningful policy variation and we exclude them from our preferred model.
  13
    Of course, there could be more subtle changes in gestational age that are not fully captured by the
preterm birth indicator and could affect birth weight.




                                                     15
case. There are two explanations for this phenomenon. First, policy or other changes over time

may differentially affect the health of infants born to some age groups. The observed pattern is

consistent with the secular improvement in birth outcomes for births to younger mothers relative to

older mothers. In the appendix, we try controlling for a number of factors that might be related to

birth outcomes. However, none of these factors explain the observed pattern (see Appendix Tables

A and B). A second possibility is that the age-specific trends absorb useful variation in MLDA laws

and make identification of their effects difficult. Given this possibility, in the analysis that follows,

we treat the specification with state-specific time trends (but not age-specific time trends) as our

preferred specification, but report results with and without age-specific time trends where space

allows.

   As a supplement to the birth weight analysis, we examine the effect of drinking age policy on

a continuous variable, birth weight in grams. The results (not shown) suggest an MLDA of 18 is

associated with a significant 16-22 gram decrease among black women and a small and insignificant

decrease among white women.


5.2       Prematurity

A similar analysis is performed to examine the relationship between MLDA laws and premature

birth, defined as gestation length under 37 weeks. We show results for the two demographic sub-

groups in Table 5. The results indicate that a drinking age of 18 is associated with an increased

likelihood of premature birth by 0.39 percentage points for native white women (on a base of 8.4

percent) among mothers under age 18 at conception. For native black mothers, the estimated

coefficient is much larger for mothers under age 18 and mothers between the age of 18 and 20. A

drinking age of 18 is associated with an increased likelihood of premature birth by 1.28 percentage

points for native black mothers under age 18 at conception and 0.65 percentage points for native




                                                   16
black mothers between the ages of 18 and 20 at conception (on a base of 18 percent).14 This is

consistent with the findings from Table 4 which suggested that prematurity played a role in the

relationship between the MLDA laws and low birth weight among native black women, but less so

for native white women. For both groups, the findings are robust to the inclusion of state-specific

time trends. The inclusion of age-specific time trends substantially reduces most of the estimated

coefficients, though coefficients for the youngest black women remain statistically significant at the

10 percent level.

       Estimation of the model with gestation in weeks as the dependent variable indicates reductions

in gestation length of 0-0.04 weeks for white women (with only the youngest group showing a

significant relationship) and 0.07-0.11 weeks for black women (results not shown).


5.3        Congenital Anomalies

Of the three outcome measures, the measure of congenital anomalies is the least well measured.

Definitions of congenital anomalies differ across states and the variable is not reported by every

state in every year. Furthermore, reported anomalies are rare (occurring in about one percent of

births) and so policy impacts are likely to be difficult to detect. Nevertheless, because the medical

literature suggests a relationship between heavy prenatal alcohol use and Fetal Alcohol Syndrome,

it is important to consider the effect of drinking laws on this outcome.

       The results in Table 6 are small, wrong-signed, and insignificant, suggesting no relationship

between MLDA laws and congenital anomalies. That we find no persuasive effects on congenital

anomalies is somewhat surprising, given the apparently strong link between heavy drinking during

pregnancy and Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. We believe there are at least two potential explanations.15

First, given the caveats described above, we cannot rule out the possibility that measurement error

  14
    As in the birth weight analysis, the magnitudes of the coefficients for black women are diminished when
beer taxes are included in the model.
  15
    It is also possible that the relationship between prenatal alcohol use and congenital anomalies has been
overstated.


                                                    17
is driving the null result. Second, it is possible that alcohol policy has little impact on heavy

prenatal drinking. The observed effects of MLDA laws on birth weight and prematurity might

relate not to adverse impacts of prenatal drinking, but rather to the selection into birth. In the

next section, we investigate how MLDA laws affect the composition of births.


6     Effect of MLDA Laws on the Composition of Births
6.1     Evidence from NVS

We find significant effects of MLDA laws on birth weight and prematurity, and no relationship

between the laws and congenital anomalies. The interpretation of the observed relationship between

alcohol policy and birth outcomes hinges on whether MLDA laws affect the composition of births,

the health status of any given birth, or both. In this section, we examine the effects of MLDA

laws on the composition of births. We use the NVS to investigate changes in the composition of

maternal and paternal characteristics and we use the NLSY to examine changes in drinking and

sexual behavior associated with MLDA laws.

    First, we investigate the role of MLDA in shifting the composition of births across demographic

subgroups. Point estimates (not shown) suggest a 0.8-2.2 percentage point increase in an infant’s

probability of an infant having a native black mother (on a base of 18.6 percentage points). These

findings are consistent with Dee (2001), who finds six percent reductions in childbearing among

15-to-19 year old black women associated with a higher drinking age. However, the results of our

analysis are statistically insignificant, so we focus on compositional changes within demographic

sub-groups.

    In Table 7, we examine whether adding controls for parental characteristics changes the esti-

mated effects of MLDA laws. We focus on low birth weight in this table, but the pattern in the

similar for prematurity (not shown). In the first and fourth columns, we present our preferred




                                                18
specification for native white women and native black women.16 In the column to the right, we add

maternal controls, such as race/ethnicity/nativity status, age at conception, parity, and maternal

education. We then add paternal controls, such as race/ethnicity/nativity status, age at concep-

tion, and education. For each set of controls we also include indicators for missing information.

Missing paternal information, in particular, proves to be an important predictor of poor health

outcomes.

       The inclusion of maternal controls reduces the size of the estimated coefficients on MLDA laws

for native white women. Further analysis (not shown) shows that less restrictive minimum age

laws are negatively associated with the educational distribution of women who give birth. After

controlling for maternal characteristics, there is no significant relationship between MLDA laws

and infant health among white mothers.

       In contrast, column V of Table 7 suggests that including maternal information does not reduce

the estimated effect of MLDA substantially for black mothers. This suggests that the observ-

able characteristics of black mothers do not change very much as the result of drinking age laws.

Rather, it is the inclusion of paternal characteristics that affects the coefficients. A drinking age

of 18 is associated with undesirable (from an infant health perspective) paternal characteristics.

Further analysis suggests that controlling for any one set of paternal controls - age, education, or

race/ethnicity/nativity - weakens the relationship between the policy and infant health. This leads

us to explore the role of missing paternal information.

       Given the link between alcohol policy and risky sexual behavior, we are particularly interested

in births that might arise as the result of unintended or unplanned pregnancies. Though the birth

certificate data do little to shed light on this question directly, one proxy for the involvement of the

father is the presence of his information on the birth certificate.17 We focus on whether or not his

  16
       These models are the same as those presented in Columns II and VI of Table 4.
  17
    As noted in a footnote 9, we have concerns about the marital status variables and we do not use them
here.


                                                     19
age is reported.18 Births with missing paternal information may be more likely to be the result of

unintended pregnancies or may otherwise reflect unobserved maternal or paternal characteristics

associated with poor infant health outcomes.19

       Table 8 shows that lower minimum drinking ages are significantly associated with higher rates

of missing paternal age for native black women, but not for white women. The results for black

women are significant even when controlling for age-specific time trends. To investigate whether

these results do suggest a link between MLDA laws and unintended pregnancies, we divide the

sample into states with and without parental notification (or consent) abortion laws. If abortions

are harder for young women to obtain, then we expect the compositional birth effects of MLDA

laws to be greater. We find that, for native born black women, the effect of MLDA laws on missing

paternal information is sizable in states with restrictive abortion laws but not other states. In

parental notification states, for the native black group, a drinking age of 18 is associated with an

8.8-19.5 percentage point increase in the probability of a birth with missing father information (on a

base of 50 percentage points). Though there may be other differences between notification and non-

notification states, these results are consistent with the notion that missing paternal information

is serving as a proxy for unintended pregnancies.

       In sum, the evidence from the NVS suggests that composition plays an important role in the

relationship between MLDA laws and birth outcomes. However, the NVS cannot be used to look

at the relationship between MLDA laws and drinking prior to or during pregnancy. In addition,

the NVS does not include any women who did not have births. Thus, we turn to the NLSY to

examine the effect of MLDA laws on drinking prior to pregnancy and sexual behavior, keeping in

  18
    Paternal age is almost always reported if any paternal information is reported. One exception is that
paternal race is sometimes included even when other information is missing. This may be the result of
imputation.
  19
    For instance, the probability of a low birth weight birth is estimated to be 0.3 to 1.8 percentage points
lower for any reported age category relative to the missing age category, based on the analysis shown in
Table 7. The link between missing paternal age and birth weight is stronger for black women.

mind the limitations of the NLSY discussed previously.


6.2       Evidence from NLSY

First, we use the birth sample to examine drinking in the 12 months prior to pregnancy.20 We

examine the relationship between MLDA laws in effect one year prior to the birth and drinking

behavior, as shown in Table 9. For white women, the key coefficients are sizeable but statistically

insignificant. However, a drinking age of 18 is significantly associated with a marginally signifi-

cant increased probability of drinking among 18-to-20 year old native black women.21 The point

estimates indicate a 9 to 11 percentage point higher likelihood of drinking in the 12 months prior

to birth, representing approximately a 30 percent increase. The estimated effects of the laws on

alcohol consumption among black women are large.22 This association is robust to the inclusion of

controls for individual characteristics, including Hispanic origin, education of the mother’s parents,

and whether she lived with both parents until age 18. We also test models which account for

age-specific time trends and find that, while the coefficient size remains large, it is not statistically

significant (results not shown).

       In Table 10, we examine the relationship between MLDA laws and the timing of a woman’s

sexual initiation using the female cohort sample.23 Among women who had never had sex at the

beginning of 1979, this outcome variable is coded 0 for every month until she had sex for the first

  20
    Each birth is treated as a separate observation, but standard errors are clustered to account for within-
state correlations. We have a small sample of births to women under 18, so these results should be interpreted
with caution.
  21
   The lack of significant impact on the younger ages may be due to the relatively few observations for the
youngest groups resulting from the aging of the NLSY cohort.
  22
    We expect an imperfect correlation between the policy regime and behavior. Drinking laws are widely
evaded, grandfathering of cohorts implies that not all 18-to-20 year old women are affected when the law
is changed, and individuals may live near a state with a lower drinking age than their own. Coase and
Grossman (1988) report small effects of the drinking age in bordering states in some models.
  23
    Each month between 1979 and 1986 is treated as a separate observation, but standard errors are clustered
to account for within-state correlations.



                                                     21
time (such that her last observation is coded 1), or when the latest interview question was asked

(in 1984 or 1985).24 We match the drinking age law to the observation month. The results suggest

that a lower drinking age is associated with an increased probability of having sex for the first time

in a given month for all women. The estimated effects are large for both white and black women

(effects of 0.1 to 0.4 percentage points on a base of 0.5 percentage points), but only statistically

significant for 18-to-20-year-old black women. The results are robust to the inclusion of controls

for individual characteristics but not age-specific time trends.

       Finally, although we do not show the results here, we also examine the relationships between

MLDA laws and becoming pregnant for the first time, having a birth, and having a non-marital

birth, all using the female cohort sample. For all three outcomes and both demographic groups,

the coefficients are insignificant. It may be that the laws do not affect these outcomes, but it may

also be the case that the NLSY sample is not large enough to detect modest effects.25

       In sum, the evidence reported in this section suggests that drinking laws may affect the com-

position of births, particularly among native black women. The inclusion of maternal and paternal

controls dampens the effect of MLDA laws on the probability of low birth weight, suggesting an

increase in births to parents with less healthy characteristics in states with lower drinking ages.

Among white women, maternal characteristics change substantially in association with MLDA laws.

Among black women, there is a substantial increase in the fraction of births with absent fathers,

representing up to a 25 percent increase. These are most pronounced in states with restrictive

abortion laws. Evidence from the NLSY indicates that black women are more likely to drink 12

months prior to a birth and have their first sexual intercourse when the drinking age is 18. Overall,

we believe the findings point to an association between a low drinking age and the likelihood of

  24
       In months when women were no longer at risk for sexual initiation, they are excluded from the analysis.
  25
    The NLSY analysis is based on a fairly small number of births in each age-year cell. Furthermore, as
noted above, there are no births to 16-year-olds after 1981, no births to 17-year-olds after 1982, and so on,
due to the aging of the sample.

birth stemming from unintentional pregnancy.


7        Effect of MLDA Laws on Prenatal Behaviors

Observable characteristics of parents do not explain all of the differences in birth outcomes associ-

ated with MLDA laws, particularly among black women. In this section we examine whether the

drinking age is associated with prenatal health behaviors as well.

       In Table 11, we investigate the relationship between MLDA laws and drinking during pregnancy

using the birth sample from the NLSY. We match the drinking age law to six months prior to the

birth month.26 Black women between the age of 18 and 20 are more likely to report prenatal

drinking when the drinking age is 18. We observe no evidence of an increase in prenatal drinking

among white women in either age group when the drinking age is 18.

       Because smoking is a complement to drinking, and the effects of prenatal smoking are believed

to be quite detrimental, we also examine whether MLDA laws affect prenatal smoking. We do

not show the results because, regardless of specification or demographic group, the coefficients are

never significant and often wrong-signed.

       In conclusion, we do find a relationship between the drinking age and prenatal drinking. How-

ever, the changing composition of observed parental characteristics leads us to suspect that unob-

served characteristics are also influenced by the policy regime. Therefore, we cannot isolate the

causal impact of prenatal drinking on birth outcomes.


8        Conclusions

This paper examines the effect of minimum age drinking laws on birth outcomes. Minimum drink-

ing age laws are related to the incidence of prematurity and low birth weight births among young

women, particularly among black women. We present evidence that a lower drinking age is associ-

  26
       The results do not change if we match the drinking age law to 9 months prior to the birth month.



                                                      23
ated with drinking in the 12 months prior to a birth and prenatally, sexual initiation, and absence of

paternal information on the birth certificate. Taken together, these findings lead us to suspect that

a lower drinking age raises the proportion of births resulting from unintentional teen pregnancy,

thereby generating adverse health outcomes for infants.

   The infant health effects associated with an MLDA of 18 are small, representing far less than

a ten percent change in rates of prematurity or low birth weight for blacks, and smaller changes

for other groups. However, the effects of minimum legal drinking ages on drinking are also modest.

Alcohol policy that more effectively curtailed drinking, or the risky behaviors associated with it,

might hold greater promise for infant health. Our results suggest that alcohol policies may have

positive unintended consequences - benefits for the well-being of a generation beyond those directly

targeted.

APPENDIX

Exploring Sensitivity to Age Specific Linear Time Trends

   In this appendix we examine the reasons for the sensitivity of our results to the inclusion of age-

specific time trends. A number of our results are rendered statistically insignificant by the inclusion

of such trends as controls. Notable exceptions include results for 18-to-20 year old whites in Table

4 (low birth weight analysis), results for the youngest blacks in Table 5 (prematurity analysis) and

all results for black mothers in Table 8 (missing paternal information).

   Because the minimum drinking age is increasing over time in our study period, the sensitivity is

consistent with younger age groups experiencing better relative health outcomes over time relative

to older age groups or, equivalently, more recent cohorts experiencing better birth outcomes at any

given maternal age. We try to add a number of sets of control variables to determine if any might be

associated with these trends: beer and cigarette taxes, parental notification and consent abortion

laws, the group-state-age specific birth rate, and the log of the birth rate. Tax data come from

the World Tax Database at the University of Michigan (http://www.bus.umich.edu/OTPR/otpr).

Abortion law information comes from Haas-Wilson (1996) and Greenberger and Connor (1991).

Birth rates are estimated by the authors using the Census Public Use Microdata Series to generate

age-state-group-specific denominators. Linear interpolation is used between Census years.

   The results of our analysis are shown in Tables A and B for whites and blacks respectively.

Column I of each table shows our preferred specification which includes state-specific time trends

but not age-specific time trends. In column II, we include the real beer tax interacted with the age

groups and an indicator for missing data. These variables do reduce the coefficients slightly in Table

A and more substantially in Table B, though in neither case do they render the coefficients sta-

tistically insignificant. Further investigation reveals that nominal beer taxes changed infrequently

during the time period, so changes are likely to reflect age-specific responses to inflation (or another

time-varying factor) in states with high initial taxes rather than a genuine policy response.


                                                  25
    Next, we investigate the role of cigarette taxes in column III. We include real cigarette taxes

interacted with the age groups and an indicator for missing data. The results are largely unchanged

relative to the first specification.

    In columns IV and V, we explore the role of abortion laws. Though our sample period follows

the Roe decision legalizing abortion, states differed on requirements for minors seeking access to

abortion. We control for the existence of parental notification (or consent) laws, interacted with

age groups, in column IV, and control for the more restrictive parental consent laws only in column

V. These controls do little to change the coefficients, suggesting they do not explain the sensitivity

of our results to age-specific time trends.

    Finally, we consider the possibility that increasing teen birth rates might explain the age-specific

time trends. It is possible that healthier teens were entering into the population of mothers over the

time period. To test this hypothesis, we estimate age and state specific birth rates for native whites

and native blacks. Controlling for the birth rate does little to change the estimated coefficients, as

shown in column VI. We try controlling for the log of the birth rate in Column VII, with similar

results.

    In sum, we are unable to explain the sensitivity of our results to age-specific time trends. It

is possible that these trends reflect secular trends driven by factors for which we are unable to

account, or that controlling for age-specific trends eliminates useful variation in drinking age laws.

We present both sets of results so the reader can assess the strength of the evidence.
