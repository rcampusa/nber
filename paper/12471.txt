Should Sixth Grade be in Elementary or Middle School? An Analysis of Grade Configuration

                                           ABSTRACT


Using administrative data on public school students in North Carolina, we find that sixth grade
students attending middle schools are much more likely to be cited for discipline problems than those
attending elementary school. That difference remains after adjusting for the socioeconomic and
demographic characteristics of the students and their schools. Furthermore, the higher infraction
rates recorded by sixth graders who are placed in middle school persist at least through ninth grade.
A plausible explanation is that sixth graders are at an especially impressionable age; in middle
school, the exposure to older peers and the relative freedom from supervision have deleterious
consequences.

INTRODUCTION

       What is the best grade configuration for schools that serve early adolescents? The

predominant answer has changed over time. At the beginning of the twentieth century, school

configuration in the United States began moving away from an eight-year primary and four-year

secondary model, toward a definition of secondary education as beginning in the seventh grade.

At that time and continuing through mid-century, middle schools known as “junior high” (grades

7-9 or 7-8) were the norm (Goldin 1999). This arrangement was intended to create a transitional

period between the sheltered elementary school and the more demanding high school

environment (Juvonen et al. 2004).

       In recent decades there has been a marked shift away from junior high school, toward the

middle school configuration of grades 6-8, or occasionally 5-8. In the early 1970s, less than one-

quarter of middle schools incorporated sixth grade: by 2000, three-quarters of all middle schools

enrolled sixth grade students (see Figure 1). North Carolina’s public middle schools, which form

the basis for the analysis that follows, have led the national trend of incorporating sixth grade. In

the 1999-2000 school year, more than 90 percent of the state’s 379 middle schools served grades

6-8 (McEwin, Greene and Jenkins 2001).

       Figure 1

       Why is the current generation of sixth graders attending middle school while preceding

generations attended elementary school? The practical problem of dealing with swelling cohorts

of students was a factor in promoting the shift in the 1970s, but there was also support from

educators. In a survey of middle grade school administrators in 2000, 65 percent of respondents

selected the 6-8 grade configuration as the “ideal” form of organization (Valentine et al 2002).

Grade span re-configuration was part of a new paradigm for middle grade education that moved




                                            -2-
away from the “bridging” concept, toward focused consideration of the unique challenges faced

by young teens (Juvonen et al 2004; National Middle School Association 1995). The debate

over the proper configuration of grades has heated up again in recent years, with researchers and

practitioners challenging the rationale of a separate middle school. One influential proposal has

been to reduce the number of school transitions through a configuration that combines

elementary and middle grades (Hough 1995; Juvonen et al 2004).

       What has been for the most part lacking in this debate, and what we seek to provide, is

direct evidence concerning what difference the grade configuration is likely to make for students.

An important exception is the recent study by Kelly Bedard and Chau Do, which demonstrates

using national data that moving to a middle-school configuration that includes sixth grade has the

effect of reducing on-time high-school completion rates by approximately 1-3 percent (Bedard &

Do 2005). Our study provides evidence in general support of this finding by documenting one of

the potential mechanisms – an increase in serious infractions.



       THE MIDDLE SCHOOL DIFFERENCE

       The middle school educational environment is different from the elementary school

environment in several ways. A sixth grader in an elementary school will typically be assigned

to one teacher and spend much of the day in that teacher’s classroom with the same group of

students. A sixth grader in middle school will typically be assigned to a team of teachers and

move from classroom to classroom over the course of the school day, with somewhat different

groups of students in each. Middle schools place greater emphasis on discipline and academic

accomplishment (including greater use of between-classroom ability grouping), with less




                                           -3-
opportunity for close relationships to specific teachers (National Center for Education Statistics

2000; Mills 1998).

       The decision of whether to locate sixth grade in middle school or keep it in elementary

school should take account of the behavioral and academic consequences for the sixth graders

themselves, as well as for the younger grades in elementary school, and the older grades in

middle school. It is a difficult time of life at best. Between the ages of 10 and 14, students

typically must adjust to puberty, as well as to changes in social relationships with peers, family,

and authority figures (NMSA, 1996; Elias et. al, 1985; Eccles et al. et al., 1993; Rudolph et al.,

2001). Research suggests that difficulties in coping with multiple transitions may underlie some

of the negative effects that many students experience during the transition from elementary to

middle school (Eccles et al. et al., 1993). These effects include a decline in motivation and a loss

of self-esteem, particularly when the transition occurs at younger ages (Simmons and Blythe,

1987; Rudolph et al., 2001); decline in academic achievement (Alspaugh and Harting, 1995;

Alspaugh, 2001); strains on interpersonal functioning (Barber and Olsen, 2004); and in the long

term, increased risk of dropping out of school (Alspaugh, 1998; Rumberger, 1995).

       Perhaps the most important difference is that a sixth grader in elementary school is

among the oldest students in the school; a sixth grader in middle school is among the youngest,

with daily exposure to older adolescents. In terms of both the developmental changes

experienced by early adolescents, and the social and academic challenges that they face in the

middle school environment, the influence of the peer group on behavior is particularly important.

Research on adolescent delinquency suggests a developmental pattern of delinquent peer

influence: the influence of peers on behavior already is significant in early adolescence, peaks

during middle adolescence, and then begins to decline (Jang 1999). Peer influence may take a




                                            -4-
variety of forms, both direct and indirect. Direct influence may include bullying and initiation of

fights, recruitment into delinquent gangs, an enhanced supply of drugs and alcohol, seduction

and sexual importuning, an appreciative audience for rowdy behavior, companionship in truancy,

and so forth. Indirect influence may occur through modeling illicit behavior (Reinke & Walker

2006; Cook & Goss 1995).

       School characteristics have been shown to have contextual effects on the impact of peer

influence. The influence of peers on individual substance use tends to be strongest in schools

with higher rates of substance use (Cleveland and Wiebe, 2003). Other school context

characteristics, including the size of the school population, racial composition, poverty levels,

and levels of parental education also have been linked to peer influences on behavior (Teitler and

Weiss, 2000; Ellickson et al., 2003; Hardy, Bukowski & Sippola 2002).



       CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

   In this study, we estimate the impact of school grade span on EOG test scores and on the

prevalence and incidence of infractions by North Carolina public school students. Our main

interest is on the infractions data; the data on EOG test scores, while of intrinsic interest, serve

here as a check on the validity of our findings concerning behavior.

   We presume that the behavior of student i attending school j in year t can be measured with a

latent variable Bijt. When this variable exceeds some threshold level, which we normalize to

zero, we observe an indicator variable Rijt indicating that a report of a negative behavioral

outcome has been filed. Our conceptual model thus takes the form:

   (1) Rijt=1 if Bijt =   0   +   1Xi   +   2Zj   +   ijt   > 0,




                                                            -5-
where Xi denotes a vector of student-level characteristics, and Zj identifies a vector of school

characteristics. Our central hypothesis is that a particular school characteristic, the grade span,

influences behavioral outcomes. The final term,         ijt,   is a residual reflecting unobserved

individual and school-level characteristics that determine whether a report is filed, plus any true

idiosyncracies that operate in the report-generating process. There is a possibility that elements

of   ijt   are correlated with observed school-level characteristics, in which case estimates of the

coefficient vector      2   will be biased. We discuss this concern in more detail below.

            Why might school grade composition affect student behavioral outcomes? Based on the

discussion in the previous section, we can identify at least three potential causal mechanisms.

     a) Social control effects. The overall rate of behavioral problems in a school can be

            influenced by various features of the school environment. The degree of freedom

            accorded the students, the capacity of the faculty and administration to monitor and

            control behavior, and the composition of the student body are all plausibly important.

            Elementary and middle schools tend to differ in all these dimensions.1

     b) The transition effect. This mechanism suggests that student behavior will tend to

            deteriorate in the first year of exposure to a new school environment, particularly when

            that environment is less closely supervised than previously experienced, simply because

            it may take time to learn the rules and stay out of trouble in the new environment. This

            mechanism predicts a spike in behavioral problems for sixth grade students entering

            middle school, followed by a reversion to the usual age-based trajectory as the student

1
  It should be noted that among the environmental attributes that distinguish the two types of
schools, not all are intrinsic to the form. For example, if sixth-grade teachers tend to prefer an
elementary-school environment to a middle-school environment, then those who have a choice
(including the most able teachers) will tend to concentrate in elementary schools. In that case the
lower infraction rate in elementary schools would reflect the superior classroom-management
ability of the teachers there.


                                                 -6-
       learns to meet the new expectations. Seventh grade students entering middle school for

       the first time should also exhibit a spike in behavioral problems.

   c) Deviant peer-influence effects. Sixth graders might also display elevated levels of

       behavioral problems if they are unduly influenced by older peers who act in a similar

       fashion. This is a true “social” effect (Manski 1993): placement with a set of well-

       behaved older peers would presumably lead to no increase in behavioral problems.

       Deviant contagion effects could possibly lead to permanently elevated levels of behavior

       problems, to the extent that such behaviors are habit-forming or self-reinforcing.

   In addition to these hypothesized causal mechanisms, it is possible that any correlation

between school grade span and the measured infraction rate reflects nonrandom sorting of

students. Parents may choose where to live or whether to keep their children in the public

schools based in part on the configuration of grades. That sort of selection process may

influence the characteristics of the student body in ways not necessarily reflected in observed

indicators.

       Yet another possibility is that the likelihood that student misbehavior will be reported by

school officials differs between elementary and middle school. In the context of our model,

variation in standards of reporting across schools is one component of the error term     ijt.   Thus a

finding of higher rates of disciplinary infractions in these schools need not reflect any differences

in actual student behavior. The finding may still be of interest, since at a minimum it tells us

something about the likelihood that a student will acquire a “record.”

       In addition to the analysis of student infractions, we estimate standard linear models for

the determination of EOG test scores, incorporating the same covariates as in equation (1).

EOG tests are administered and scored the same for sixth graders whether they are in elementary




                                            -7-
or middle school. As a result, observed differences in performance are not an artifact of the

measurement system.

        DATA AND MATCHING PROCEDURE

        Our analysis makes use of an administrative database covering all public schools and

students in the state of North Carolina for a number of years. The data were provided by the

North Carolina Education Research Data Center. The indicators of behavioral problems are

derived from a statewide database of disciplinary infractions recorded during the 2000-2001

academic year. Each disciplinary report reflects a decision on the part of a school official

(usually a teacher) of whether to “write up” a student for misbehaving, and then a decision on the

part of the principal of whether to report to the state. (Schools are required to report incidents in

the event that they result in the out-of-school suspension of one or more students, or if the

offense is severe enough to warrant the contact of law enforcement officials, but reporting is

otherwise left to the discretion of school officials.)

        The districts in which sixth graders still attend elementary school in North Carolina are in

small towns or rural areas, and are somewhat unrepresentative of the state school system as a

whole in other respects as well. In our statistical work we used a matching procedure to select

the middle schools for our sample; this procedure eliminated much of these differences. Our

procedure had four steps. (1) Drop all middle schools located outside of small towns and rural

areas. (2) Run a logit regression on the 344 remaining schools that included a sixth grade (both

middle and elementary schools), to estimate the likelihood that that 6th grade would be in middle

school based on student characteristics and per pupil expenditures. (Table 1 reports the results.)

(4) Compute probabilities for each of the 344 schools based on this estimated equation, and

identify the maximum probability for an elementary school and the minimum probability for a




                                             -8-
middle school. (4) Select the matched sample, defined as those schools that had an estimated

probability lying in between these extremes, thus ensuring a common support across the two

groups.

          Table 1 here

ANALYSIS OF INFRACTION RATES

          The matched sample included 41,833 middle-school sixth graders of the 76,915 total, and

almost all of the 5,320 elementary-school sixth graders. Table 2 reports summary statistics. All

told, these students were responsible for 20,433 reported disciplinary infractions over the course

of the school year. The summary statistics indicate a large difference in the average number of

infractions per student between middle and elementary schools: There were 47 recorded

infractions for every 100 sixth graders attending middle school, compared with only 16 per 100

in elementary schools. When infractions are classified by type, middle school students record

over twice the rate for each category (Figure 2).

          Table 2 here

          Figure 2 here

          The large differences in the infraction rate may be partly due to differences in

characteristics of the student populations that remain despite the matching procedure. We used

regression analysis in an attempt to adjust for these remaining differences. The sample for this

analysis consists of sixth grade students in North Carolina in 2000-1 that are in our matched

sample; the dependent variable indicates whether students appear in the infractions database.

Control variables include indicators for the type of school attended, the number of students in

sixth grade in that school, and school-level socioeconomic indicators, as well as individual

characteristics including race and gender, parental education levels, and standardized EOG test




                                              -9-
scores from 5th grade. The results confirm that attending middle school in sixth grade is

associated with greatly elevated odds of an infraction. Our point estimates imply that other

things equal, the odds of having at least one infraction in sixth grade are increased by a factor of

2.3 if in middle school; the odds of a violent infraction are increased by a factor of 2.0, and the

odds of a drug infraction by a factor of 4.8.2

        Table 3 here

        These regression results also reveal elevated prevalence rates for males, blacks, children

of parents with less education, children in low-income families (who qualify for reduced price or

free lunch), as well as children who are old for the grade or have low test scores in fifth grade.

Note that each of these results emerges even controlling for all else.

        These regressions include three explanatory variables characterizing the school rather

than the individual student. The coefficients tend to be less precisely estimated, not surprising

given that there is less variation. Still, it is interesting that the coefficient estimates on the size of

the sixth grade are negligible, and that infraction rates are inversely related to the percentage of

the school population that is poor (again, controlling for individual status in this respect).

Behavior Before and After Sixth Grade

        It would be informative to follow these students over several years of schooling before

and after sixth grade. Infractions in fourth and fifth grade would provide an individualized

baseline on misbehavior. Infraction rates after sixth grade would allow a check on whether the

elevated rate for the middle-school sixth graders is simply the result of problems resulting from a

transition to a new school, or rather sustained over time. As it turns out, we only have



2
  We also estimated a negative binomial regression on the number of infractions. The results are
qualitatively similar to the logit regression results for prevalence. The estimated coefficient on
attending middle school in sixth grade is .913, with a standard error or .222.

                                              - 10 -
infractions data for the single academic year (2000-1), so it is not possible to follow the behavior

of individual students over time. However, we are able to perform a pseudo-longitudinal

analysis of behavior based on the fact that our database, while only including one year of

infractions data, does include a number of years’ worth of data on other aspects of each student’s

career. In particular we know what sort of school the students who are in fourth or fifth grade in

2000-1 are destined to spend sixth grade, and we know in what sort of school older students in

that year did spend sixth grade. Using this information, we sort all students in grades 4-9 in

2000-1 into two groups, which we identify as 6Es and 6Ms. For example, a ninth grader is a

“6M” if she spent her sixth grade in middle school; a fourth grader is a “6E” if he subsequently

attends sixth grade in an elementary school.

       Figure 3 graphs the trajectories for the two groups with respect to probability of an

infraction. These prevalence trajectories are computed for the same set of values for the

regression covariates; the difference in trajectories reflects the proportional effect on the

infraction probability estimated from the logistic regression, and the 95% confidence interval

represents the uncertainty in that estimate.3 We see that in the baseline period, grades 4 and 5,

there is little difference between 6Es and 6Ms. A large gap opens up in sixth grade. The gap

narrows a bit in seventh grade, when most of 6Es enter middle school, but is then sustained in

eighth and ninth grades and remains statistically significant throughout.4 Other measures of

misbehavior produce qualitatively similar results.



3
  The values assumed for the covariates generally refer to an average male student. Parental
education is specified as high school graduate, and the race variable is 25 percent black (in line
with the sample). Any changes in these or other covariates would only serve to shift both lines
either up or down by the same proportional amount. The key is the significant difference across
the groups holding all else equal.
4
  Figure 3 is based on regressions of the sort reported in Table 3, for 4th, 5th, 7th, 8th, and 9th
graders. The coefficient estimates on the indicator for whether they attended 6th grade in middle

                                            - 11 -
                                            Figure 3 here

       These results do not rule out the logical possibility that the observed differences are

partly due to differences in school reporting practices rather than in the actual behavior of the

students. It seems reasonable to suppose that middle schools tend to be more formal and severe

than elementary schools, which might explain the infraction gap between 6Es and 6Ms in sixth

grade. However, it does not explain why that gap persists in seventh, eighth, and ninth grades,

when all the students have moved on past elementary school. Hence we believe that the

“infraction gap” reflects a “behavior gap.”

DISCUSSION

       The causal mechanisms that account for this difference in behavior cannot be identified

directly from our data. Several differences between elementary and middle school may be

relevant. In comparison with elementary school, middle school provides students more freedom

and lacks the continuity and close connection provided by having one primary teacher. Most

obviously, middle school brings sixth graders into routine contact with older adolescents who are

likely to be a bad influence: older adolescents as a group are more rebellious and more involved

in delinquency, sex, illicit drugs, and other activities that violate school rules. Of greatest

concern is that the negative influence of middle school on sixth graders appears to linger through

ninth grade.

       Our results complement the recent finding that school systems that move sixth grade

from elementary to middle school experience a 1 -3 percent decline in on-time graduation rates

(Bedard & Do 2005). We would predict that that shift would increase behavior problems, which


school and the corresponding standard errors from the logistic regressions for the probability of
committing any infraction are as follows: for 4th graders, - 0.242 (0.195); for 5th graders, -0.081
(0.162); for 7th graders, 0.438 (0.158); for 8th graders, 0.329 (0.161); for 9th graders, 0.376
(0.168).

                                            - 12 -
in some cases could lead to retention in grade or dropout. Together these findings cast serious

doubt on the wisdom of the nationwide shift to the middle school format.

 *The sample includes schools containing 6th grade students that can be
 categorized as either an elementary or middle school. The regressors are
 characteristics of the 6th grade students only. Because all of the elementary
 schools containing 6th grade are located in small towns or in rural areas, only
 middle schools from those locales are included in the sample.
