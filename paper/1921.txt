       Risk Aversion and Determinants of Stock Market Behavior




                               ABSTRACT




     A simple model of equity pricing is developed to address two related
questions.   First, to what extent can unanticipated changes in such
"fundamental" variables as profitability, real interest rates, inflation,
and the variance of returns account for the observed behavior of the stock
market? Second, how risk averse are investors in the aggregate?      We find
that the pretax profit rate and the variance of returns are both significant
explanators of the market, and interest rates somewhat less so. Estimates
of the index of relative risk aversion are obtained that put that parameter
in the range of 3 to 4.

 1. Introduction.

      This paper addresses two related questions. First, to what extent can

the behavior of the stock market be explained by observed changes in

such "fundamental1' variables as profitability, inflation, real interest

rates,   arid   the   variance of stock returns —   variables   that affect the

expected real after—tax flow of dividends to investors, and/or the; rate at

which that flow is discounted? llate that this question is in noway in

conflict with the notion that the market follows a random walk. We are

simply asking whether the "suprises" that have been observed in the market

can be explained in part by unpredicted changes in economic variables, and

in a manner consistent with theory.

     The answer to this first question is in part dependent on the answer to

the second: How risk averse are investors in the aggregate? There is litle

concensus as to the index of relative risk aversion for U.S. investors in

the aggregate, with recent estimates ranging from 0.3 to numbers in     excess
of 6.'   Knowledge of this parameter is important for our understanding of

the structure of asset demands. For example, several recent studies havE

used aggregate asset demand models to determine the effects of government

budget deficits or to explain the behavior of interest rates, and in each

case a number was chosen for the index of risk aversion.2 But the results


     1Consumption—based estimates are usually below 1;   for example, Hansen
and Singleton (1983) and Mankiw, Rotemberg, and Summers (1985) obtained
estimates in the range of .3 to 1.0.   Asset demand studies have yielded
higher estimates; the papers by Friend and Blume (1975), Friend and
Hasbrouck (1982), and Grossman and Shiller   (1981) support estimates in the
range of 2 to 6.

     In his study of crowding out, Friedman (1985) uses a value of 4 for
the index of risk aversion. In a similar study, Frankel (1983) attempts to
estimate this parameter, but after obtaining an estimate in excess of 100,
he set the value at 2. Bodie, Kane, and McDonald (1983) explain the behavior
of long—term interest rates in terms of changing asset return covariances;
they also use a value of 2.
of such studies can be sensitive to this choice. This paper provides new

estimates of this parameter.

     A number of earlier studies have sought to explain broad movements in

stock prices by changes in economic variables. For example, the papers by

Modigliani and Cohn (1979), Fama (1981), Feldstein (1980a,b), and Summers

(1981) attribute (for different reasons) the secular decline in the market

between 1965 and 1980 to increased inflation. A paper of mine (1984) argues

that this decline is better explained by increases in the variance of equity

returns, and by reductions in the expected return on capital. Gordon (1983)

obtained similar results; he used a general model of share valuation under

inflation to show that reduced profitability and a higher risk premium,

rather than increased inflation, explain the market decline. The role of a

changing risk premium is also supported by the work of Hasbrouck (1984a,b),

who finds that ex ante measures of uncertainty over real economic activity

(obtained from survey data) are a significant determinant of stock returns,

and are meaningfully related to the ex post variance of those returns, and

French, Schwert, and Stambaugh (1985), who find that unexpected returns are

negatively related to unexpected changes in volatility.3

     This paper develops and tests a structural model that explains stock

returns in terms of changes in several fundamental variables. The model

relates these variables to the basic determinants of stock prices ——    the
expected real after—tax flow of dividends to investors, and the discount

rate investors use to discount this flow. This involves modelling the tax


     3However these statistical studies are not based on structural models
of stock price determination.    Similarly, Chen, Roll and Ross (1985) Use
non—structural regressions to examine the ability of a number of economic
variables to explain stock returns.

 system and the financial structure of firms, as is done in some of the

 studies cited above. Also, as Poterba and Summers (1985) have pointed out,

the effects of changes in explanatory variables will depend in part an the

persistence of those changes.4 For example, if changes in interest rates,

etc. are short—lived, they should have only a small effect on investors

asset demands, and on asset prices. Finally, the effects of changes in

explanatory variables will depend on the degree of investor risk aversion.

This last parameter is particularly important, and an estimate of its value

is essential for any explanation of market behavior.

     Our approach assumes constant relative risk aversion, so that changes

in stock prices can be related to unanticipated changes in each of several

different economic variables, with elasticities that all depend on the

degree of risk aversion. Specifically, the price of equity is related to

four explanatory variables —   the pretax profit rate, the real short—term

interest rate, the rate of inflation, and the variance of equity returns —

that affect the expected flow of dividends and/or the rate at which that

flaw is discounted by investors, 'as well as tax and financial parameters,

and the index of risk aversion. Changes in the price of equity depend in

part on changes in these explanatory variables, and on the persistence of

those changes. As in Poterba and Summers (1985), persistence effects are

modelled by describing the explanatory variables as AR(1 processes.

    By linearizing the expression far the pri'.e of equity around the mean

values of the explanatory variable, a set of regression equations with


     4Poterb. and Summers make this point in reference to the volatility of
the stack market. It has long been recognized that the volatility of equity
returns has changed over time; see Officer (1973), Black (1976), and Nerton
(1980). Paterba and Summers argue that these changes are short—lived, and
thus should have had only a small effect on stock prices.

cross—equation parameter    constraints is obtained. The first equation

relates changes in the price of equity to innovations in the explanatory

variables. The remaining equations are the ARCL) processes for the explana-

tory variables. Each constraint ties an elasticity in the first equation to

a corresponding AR(1) parameter, and to the index of risk,àversion.

Estimating this system yields values for the elasticities, and for the index

of risk aversion. Also the underlying theory is completely summarized by the

constraints, and can be tested by testing the constraints.

     The empirical results can be summarized as follows. First, the response

of stock returns to changes in profitability, interest rates, inflation, and

the variance of returns is consistent with an index of relative risk

aversion of about 3 or 4.     This is in the mid—rangeof estimates obtained

from earlier asset demand studies, but at the high end of the range of

numbers used in applications of asset demand models (see Footnotes 1 and 2).

     Second, estimates of the model support the argument that changes in the

volatility of returns play a significant role in explaining stock price

movements. Although changes in volatility have not been very persistent

during the post—War period (as Poterba and Summers have demonstrated), the

magnitudes of those changes have been large enough, and the index of risk

aversion high enough, to make their effects significant.        Changes in the

pretax profit rate and the real interest rate are also significant explana—

tors of stock price movements. However, inflation is not significant, in

keeping with the findings of Gordon (1983) and Hasbrouck (1984a,b).

    The next section lays out the model. The data and issues of estimation

are discussed in Section 3. Statistical results are presented and discussed

in Section 4, and Section 5 contains some concluding remarks.

2. The lodel.

        As in my earlier paper             (1984), portfolio choice is limited in this

model to two assets, stocks and short—term nominal bonds. Here I             treat the

instantaneous inflation rate as deterministic, so that bonds are risk—free,

with a net real return given by:

           =   (1—$)R — II                                                      (1)
where R and i      are the nominal interest rate and inflation rate, and $ is the
personal tax           rate on interest and dividends. (Parameters and symbol

definitions are summarized in Table I of Section 3.)

        The total gross return to investors from holding stacks has two

components, capital gains and dividends. Let                 be the net real return to

investors from stocks. Then the expected net real return is given by:


        E(,)       (1$e)                       +   (1$)D/p   -   $              (2)



where P is the price of equity, D is the pretax flow of dividends, and $ is

the effective tax rate on capital gains.

        Assuming constant relative risk aversion, the risk premium can be

approximated by:

        Et() —    b    =
                           'Var()                                               (3)



where     is the aggregate index of relative risk aversion.8 (For heteroge-

neous investors,           = lJE(w/X), where         is the index for investor i, and

the weight Wf     is   based on wealth.)      Now let o be the variance of pretax


     8lhis is an approximation, even for constant relative risk aversion. If
the state variables , r, etc. move stochastically over time, as they are
assumed to in this model, the risk premium will also depend on a set of
hedging demands, and (3) will not hold exactly. See Merton (1973).

real stock returns1 and d be the average ratio of dividends to net
earnings.             Then the variance of                    the after—tax real return is ((1—$)d I-

(1—El)(l—d)]2ff2,           and


                            = rE(l—s)d + (1—e)(1—d))2tr2
        Et() —        b                                                                                 (4)



        To simplify the model,                I take the real interest rate, denoted by rt,

as exogenous, and write R r + flt, SO that dR/d,r                                          1.   Then eqns. (1)

to (4) can be combined to yield the following equation relating the after—

tax real excess return to the variance of the pretax real return, o:


                  —
                                  + OiDt/Pt    —

                                                                                          Ct            (5)

Here          =            — E(P+,)]/P             is an expectational error, 0 =

and 02       = t(l—9)d      +   (1—e1—d)]2/u—e).                 Sinced 0,                and a series for u

can all be calculated, with a suitable stochastic specification eqn. (5) can

be used to obtain a preliminary estimate of Y.                          This is done in Section 4.

        The expectatzonal error Ct                 in   eqn. (5) consists in part of the effects

of Linanticipated changes in the explanatory variables, effects which depend

in part on the index of risk aversion .                            We   therefore want to "explain11

this portion of c.                  Doing so will reveal information about the relative

importance of the various explanatory variables in affecting stock prices,

and   will enable          us to obtain more efficient estimates of X.

        We    proceed        by obtaining an              expression    for         the    expected flow of

dividends. First1 note that the firms expected real net earnings per

dollar of equity, E(q'.), can be written as:

        (1—b)E
                  t (Ps)        (1—7 )ç(
                                    e      t — (1—7
                                                  s
                                                    )b(r +r )
                                                        t t         + (b—X)ir
                                                                                t                      (6)


where        c is the expected pretax rate of profit (the expected real gross
                                                      —7--
 return on capital),              b is the average rate of                    borrowing per dollar of
 capital, T.          and 'T       are respectively the effective and statutory corporate
 tax rates, and X is a measure of the reduction in real net earnings through

 the tax    effect          of    inflation.6 We can thus write the following expression

 for the pretax flow of dividends to investors:


            = TI 1_t                         (l-7b(rt+nt) +           (b_X)t]
        Now, utilizing this expression for Ut,                          eqn. (5) has the following
solution for the price of equity:



        P       E
                    t 3-0
                                 if (1 +
                                           1rt.   -




where       =
                 d(1—i.)J(1—b),                (1—T.)bd/(1—b, and Ø = 04               +   (X—b)d/(1—b).

        Eqn. (8) expresses the price of equity in terms of current and future

values of the explanatory variables                                     and    g2•             in P will
                                                      c,   r,   it,                  Changes

result from changes in the current values of these variables, and changes in

their expected future values. To describe expectations, I follow Poterba and

Summers and treat these variables as AR(1) processes, i.e.

                                     + "it                                                          (9a)

     'The effective tax rate is less than the statutory rate because of
accelerated depreciation and the investment tax credit. Nominal interest
payments, b(r+it), are deductible at the statutory rate, and since inflation
reduces the real value of the firms debt, the after—tax cost of borrowing
is (1—r)b(r+T) — bir. Finally, as Feldstein (1980b) has shown, because the
value of depreciation allowances is based on original cost, inflation
reduces their real value and increases real taxable profits; I use
Fe1dsteins linear approximation that a 1% increase in the price level
reduces net profits by X. For a more detailed discussion, see my 1984 paper.

     1Clearly one could do better. For example, Hendershott (1984) shows
that changes in 6—month 1—bill rates can be partly predicted by unantici-
pated changes in expected inflation, and in the growth of industrial pro-
duction and base money. But the AR(1) specification provides a reasonable
"first—order" forecast, and greatly simplifies the model.

'.   The estimation of this model is discussed in the next section.



3. Estimation and Data.

        Eqn. (12) is an exact relaton between changes in the price of equity

and unanticipated changes in the explanatory variables.                               If no other

variables affected stock prices (and the linearization used to derive (11)

and the AR(1) relations were exact), this equation would fit the data

perfectly, completely explaining St.                       This of course is unlikely to be the
case.             In general there will be other variables affecting stock prices,

observed by investors but "hidden" to the econometrician, so that s will

remain partly unexplained. We can account for these hidden variables by

including an additive error term, Vt., fl eqn.                     (12).

        I will make the standard assumption that the price of equity follows a

geometric random walk, so that the expectational error e in eqn. (5) is

normally distributed, serially uncarrelated, and has a time—varying variance

o. Then                  the additive error term v will also be normally distributed

and serially              uncorrelated, and heteroscedastic with variance roughly

proportional to o. Therefore before estimating eqn. (12) (or eqn. (5)), I

divide through by t so that the transformed errors are homoscedastic.

        Equations (9a)        —    (9d)    and the transformed eqn. (12) can be estimated

simultaneously, subject to the nonlinear constraints (13a) —                          (13d).     Note
                                      — 11 —

that   all    of the constraints depend on the unknown parameter ,    the    index of

risk aversion. (Recall that , the mean discount rate, is a function of L)

Compared to estimating eqn. (5),      this   provides a more efficient estimate of

  (by utilizing information embodied in the innovations of Ut1       rt,    etc.), as

well as estimates of the elasticities 1lc1 Tlr, nw, and           Also the under-
lying theory that relates the elasticities to ,         the ARC1) parameters, and
the tax and financial parameters is completely described by the constraints

(13a) —      (13d), and can be tested by testing these constraints.
       Two issues should be mentioned before proceeding.           First, we are

treating the RHS variables in eqn. (12) as exogenous, whereas in fact the

relationship between the stock market and the macroeconomy is not unidirec-

tional. However, stock prices respond much more quickly to new public

information about economic variables           (u, r, etc.) than those variables

respond to stock prices.'        Also, we are measuring the short—run impact of

changes in these variables, i.e. the change in price that equilibrates the

demand for equity with a fixed supply, given the change in the expected flow

of dividends and/or the discount rate. Thus to good approximation the RHS

variables should indeed be viewed as exogenous.

       Second, the error term Vt   includes the effects of unanticipated changes
in omitted variables, such as tax rates, world commodity prices, etc. If

innovations in omitted variables are correlated with those on the RHS of


     9tlaximum likelihood estimation is used, iterating over the cavariance
matrix. The test statistic is 2(LuLr) , where L and L,. are the values of
the log likelihood function for the unrestricted and restricted models
respectively. This is distributed as chi—square, with degrees of freedom
equal to the number of restrictions.

     'Fischer and Merton (1984), for example, find the stock market to be a
good predictor of changes in 6NP and its components.
                                    — 12 —

(12),     the parameter estimates could be biased. The use of instrumental

variables is not a practical solution because the only effective instruments

will be macroeconomic variables which themselves are likely to be correlated

with omitted variables. Fortunately this problem is unlikely to be severe,

because innovations in any omitted variables will affect stock prices much

more rapidly than they affect economic variables.

        Estimation of the model is done on both an annual and monthly basis.

In each case it requires values for the tax and financial parameters, and

data For capital gains and dividends based on an aggregate stock price index

F, and for the exogenous variables c, r, ir, and 2• For estimation on an

annual basis I use monthly CRISP data for the total return, the rate of

capital gain, and the dividend rate on the NYSE Index. After adjusting for

inflation the total return        series is   used to    generate an annual

non—overlapping series for the sample variance of the real return in year t:

          = (1/11)
                     12
                     E
                     jj   x
                          ')

where        is the logarithmic return in month j of year t.'°

        Monthly data for the nominal Treasury bill rate and the rate of

inflation are used to calculate the real interest rate r, and the monthly

series for P, r, and n are annualized. There is no standard source of data

for , but we can draw upon the work of Feldstein, Poterba, and Dicks—

Mireaux (1983), who calculated an annual series for the realized pretax rate

of profit. This series for c covers the years 1948—1983, and sets the

limit   on the time bounds for estimation.1t

        The model is also estimated with monthly series.    Daily data for the

total return on the combined NYSE and AMEX index, obtained from the CRISP

tape for 1962—1983, are used to generate a monthly non—overlapping series

for the sample variance of the nominal return.'2 Separate data for capital

gains and dividends were unavailable; instead an average dividend rate,

computed for 1962—1983 from the monthly returns data, was used to divide the

total return into its components.t3           I use monthly sums of the daily

returns, together with the monthly data for r and it.       A   monthly series is

calculated for     by regressing the annual series on a set of instruments

correlated with profitability, and for which monthly data are available.'4

        Ideally, changes in the tax and financial parameters should be embodied

in eqn. (12). For example, the effective corporate tax rate         r. might have

been specified as an exogenous variable that also follows an AR(1) process,

with innovations in this rate inclided on the RHS of            (12), and with a

corresponding       cross—equation parameter      constraint. In practice, our

knowledge of or ability to compute these parameters is too limited to treat


     'The data are from column 4 of Table 2 in Feldstein et. al. (1983).
The published data cover the years 1948—1979, but an updated and revised
series was provided by James Poterba.

     '2Since there is no daily inflation data, one cannot estimate the
sample variance of the real return. The variance of the nominal return is a
good approximation, however, in that the rate of inflation usually does not
vary much over the course of a month. In computing this monthly series for
a, eqn. (14) is adjusted for non—trading days by dividing the daily returns
by the square root of the number of days between trades.

     '5This division is necessary only because of the different tax

4. Results.

     Table 2 shows values of          obtained from OLS estimation of eqn. (5).

Recall that these initial estimates of         are "naive in that innovations in

the explanatory variables are ignored, but they serve as a basis for

comparison. For 1949—83, the estimate of           is above 5.     This number is

smaller for the 1962—83 subsample, based on either annual or monthly data.


     *For an explanation of how these values were obtained, see the
Appendix of my 1984 paper (which used averages for 1965—81).

      Results of estimating the full model are shown in Table 3.          Observe

that for the full 1949—83 sample, the estimate of         is about 3.4, signifi-

cantly below that obtained from eqn. (5).      (The standard error, however, is

close to 1, so we can not rule out a value for               as high as 5.)   The

elasticities with respect to ,       r,   and y2   are all significant; only the
inflation rate has no significant effect on stock prices. Finally, the

likelihood ratio test fails to reject the cross—equation restrictions.

      It is useful to examine the magnitudes of the elasticities. The profit

rate elasticity q., is statistically significant, and a little larger than

.05, so that if   this   elasticity is taken at face value, reduced profitabil-

ity should have accounted for at most a 107. decline in stock prices during

these periods. While this may seem small, remember that changes in profita-

bility are transitory. The same is true of the real interest rate, and a 4X

increase in that rate should only decrease stock prices by about 67..

     Changes in 2 are        even more transitory (g is about .23), but the

estimated value of Y is high enough, and the actual changes in u2 have been

large enough, so that this variable can explain a significant share of

observed movements in stock prices. The estimate of i         is   about —2.9. In

1974, for example, Ao' was about .04, which would account for at least 107.,

or about a third, of that year's roughly 307. decline in the market. The

decrease that occured in the profit rate would account for another 4 or 57..

     The remainder of Table 3 shows annual and monthly estimates of the

model for 1962—B3. The annual estimates show roughly similar values for the

elasticities, a   lower value for Y (again a standard error close to 1), and

again failure to reject the restrictions of the model. The lower value of I
                                             - 16   —


is    likely to be peculiar to the short sample; note from Table 2 that OLS

estimates of eqn. (5) also yield a smaller value of                          for 1962—83 than for

1949—83. Estimation of the model with monthly data again yields a value of

     of about 3.4,        but    very    different values of the elasticities. This

reflects    a failure       of   eqns. (9a) — (9d) to         capture        the evolution of     the

explanatory variables with monthly data,1' and                 a failure of         the lineariza-
tion; observe      that    the cross—equation restrictions are               strongly rejected.

        These   results let us draw tentative conclusions about the value of                      the

index    of relative risk aversion, and the relative importance                    of profitibil—

ity,    interest rates, inflation, and the              variance   of    returns as determinants

of    stock market behavior.            First,the index of risk aversion seems to be
much larger than estimates from time—series consumption—based studies                       would

suggest,    and is probably in the range of                 3 to        4.    Second, changes in

profitability, real interest rates, and the variance of                        equity returns are
all    significant explanators of stock prices.                 Changes in variance do not

explain as much as my earlier paper (1984) suggests, because those changes

are not very persistent (as Poterba and Summers (1985) point out). But they

do seem to explain more than any other variable, because they have been

large in magnitude, and because the index of risk aversion is large.



5. Concluding Remarks.

        The model presented here provides a rather simple description of equity

pricing, and its limitations are numerous. Perhaps the most important is the

convenient and fundamental assumption that investors have constant relative


     1'Ne would expect the monthly estimate of       when raised to the 12th
to roughly equal the corresponding annual estimate, but it is much less.
                                      — 17 —

risk   aversion. Recent work by King and Leape (1984), using survey data for

over 6000 individual households, strongly rejects the CRRA hypothesis.1'

Unfortunately it is difficult to construct aggregate asset demand models

that can be estimated and tested without making this assumption.

       There are other limitations. The model is restricted to two assets, and

this may result in an overestimate of . (But          while it is natural to add

long—term bonds! which bear inflation—specific risk,       it is doubtful that

investors really juggle their holdings of housing, durable goods, and human

capital as interest rates, etc. change.)       The ARC1) representation for the

explanatory variables is overly simple, and probably does not accurately

capture investors' rational expectations regarding future changes. (One can

expand the model so that ,       r,   r, and 2 are jointly described by a first—

order vector autoregression, but this introduces 6 additional parameters,

stretching the explanatory power of the data, and probably still not fully

capturing the formation of expectations.) And finally some of the variables

may not properly measure what they are intended to measure. For example, u2,

even if estimated accurately, is a crude measure of investors' perceptions

of capital risk. (Although Hasbrouck's (1984a) work, using survey data to

measure perceived risk, yields results consistent with those reported here.)

       These limitations aside, the model provides an alternative framework

for   estimating the degree of    risk aversion for investors in the aggregate,

and for testing the extent to which "fundamental" economic variables can

account for the behavior of the stock market. Also, the empirical results

may    help to illuminate the debate over the relative roles of profitability,

        17(Uso Morin and Suarez       (1983), using Canadian household data, find
decreasing   relative risk aversion when housing is excluded from wealth       or
treated as   riskiess, and that risk aversion increases uniformly with age.

risk,   and inflation as explanators of the secular movements in the market

that have been observed during the past few decades.
