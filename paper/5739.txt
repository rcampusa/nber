                                           ABSTRACT



        This paper analyzes two-way interactions between structural reform and macro policy. If
structural reforms increase the flexibility of labor markets, they are likely to improve the short-run
inflation-unemployment tradeoff, providing an incentive for policymakers to expand aggregate
demand. In turn, the promise by policymakers that they will encourage a decline in unemployment
in response to good news on inflation can be used to strike a political deal with political interests
opposed to the introduction or extension of structural reform. Expansionary monetary policy also
provides relief on the fiscal front, directly by bringing the actual budget deficit closer to the
structural budget deficit, and indirectly, by encouraging structural reform, potentially reducing the
structural budget deficit itself.
        In 1992-93 several European countries dropped out of the ERM to pursue more expansionary
monetary policies. The difference in the performance of these countties and those countries which
maintained a peg between their currencies and the Deutsche mark provides an important test case
of the consequences of expansionary monetary policy. The depreciating nations by 1995 enjoyed
a substantial relative acceleration of nominal GDP and, surprisingly, an even greater deceleration
of inflation, so that their growth rate of real GDP accelerated more than their growth rate of nominal
GDP in relation to the pegging countries. The continued deceleration of inflation in the depreciating
countries provides evidence that their natural unemployment rate has declined and that expansionary
monetary policy has interacted beneficially with structural reform.

                                         1. Introduction

        Perhaps     the most important        single economic     issue in Europe    today can be

linked to the topic of this paper, macroeconomic         policy and structural      maladjustment.

Is it possible for Europe       to pursue the macroeconomic          policies needed to achieve

monetary    union despite the existence of structural         maladjustments,     such as excessive

fiscal debt and deficits,       underfunded      state pension     and welfare     programs,      state

subsidies of inefficient     firms, and overregulated     product     and labor markets?         What

are the connections       and feedbacks between macro policy and structural            reform?     Do

these connections      suggest any new avenues for policy in countries like France that are

currently   struggling    to resolve the conflicts among fiscal stringency         required    on the

route to monetary        union, monetary    tightness required     to maintain    a fixed exchange

rate, and the political     strife with interest groups resisting structural       reform ?

       The paper         begins by examining      data on major aspects         of macroeconomic

performance       in Europe and the United States.       It then turns to a theoretical        section

that interprets     the interactions   between macro policy and structural          maladjustment

in terms of aggregate       demand     and supply analysis.      In this view, the task of macro

policy is to control      the growth    rate of nominal aggregate      demand,     while structural

maladjustment       can be viewed as an adverse supply shock, and successful structural

reform as a beneficial supply shock.        We shall analyze the similarities and differences

between the effects of structural        maladjustment    and adverse supply shocks, such as

oil price shocks.
                                                                        Macroeconomic        Policy, Page 2




        The supply shock model forces us to distinguish                 between the level and rate of

change of structural         maladjustment.       Structural   reform may be viewed as analogous

to a negative        change      in the    degree     of structural     maladju~ment.           On      closer

examination      some types of structural           reform are just as likely to reduce the rate of

productivity     growth as to raise it. The analysis of demand and supply shocks forces

us to distinguish      as well between         two leading models          of aggregate      supply — the

natural rate hypothesis         and the hysteresis model — and a hybrid that combines them.

How does the outcome             of alternative     policy interventions        depend    on knowing       the

right model in advance?

       The next section of the paper examines feedback from reform to macro policy:

countries with more flexible markets may have a more favorable short-term                         inflation-

unemployment        tradeoff.     This is particularly     important     from the perspective           of the

hysteresis     hypothesis,      which   implies that a reduction           in unemployment           may be

achieved     at the cost of only a finite increase in the inflation                rate, the amount         of

which depends on the slope of the short-run                tradeoff    curve.    There is also feedback

from macro policy to reform:              a policy that leans in the direction           of expansion     may

make it possible to create a political deal with interest groups that resist reform.                       An

expansionary      policy also reduces the impact of transition              costs from reform.

       Most of our discussion of macro policy revolves around monetary                          policy and

exchange rate policy.         There is still the need to determine          where fiscal policy fits in.
                                                                        Macroeconomic     Policy, Page 3




Is there still a role for fiscal policy in managing            aggregate    demand?      The theory of

the monetary-fiscal       mix states that        monetary      policy    mainly     controls    aggregate

demand;      fiscal policy mainly influences       the real interest       rate and hence the rate of

long-run     capital accumulation     and growth.

       Should monetary policy be conducted                differently in nations that have relatively

high ratios of public debt to GDP?             When fiscal deficits exceed the level consistent

with a stable debt-GDP ratio, the need to run a budget surplus becomes an imperative

and requires a stimulative     monetary        policy to compensate,        with the implication       that

exchange     rate stability may not be consistent          with fiscal convergence.

       The empirical section of the paper examines data on the experience                      of selected

European     countries   since the 1992 breakdown           of ERM, which         provides a controlled

experiment      of the consequences       of expansionary         aggregate    demand      policy.     We

examine the behavior of nominal GDP growth, as well as the “split” of nominal GDP

growth between inflation and real GDP growth, in those countries                      that experienced

major effective exchange      rate depreciations          in 1992-93     as compared      with some of

those that did not depreciate.         We conclude         by developing      the implications       of the

empirical results for future macro policy within Europe and exploring                   the desirability

of a continued     push toward      monetary     union.

                  2. The Primary Puzzles in Macroeconomic                           Behavior

2.1   Inflation, Unemployment,              and Labor’s Share

          We begin by comparing             basic macroeconomic         indicators     for Europe and the

United States, in order to identify the puzzles to be explained.                     Figure 1 displays the

well-known        divergence        in the time series of unemployment          rates in Europe and the

United      States.     In 1995 the unemployment                rate for the current      members        of the

European       Union      (labelled    “Europe” in Figure         1) was 11.0 percent,          compared      to

roughly      2 percent        for     the   same    countries     in the    early    1960s,        The      1995

unemployment           rate in the United States was 5.7 percent, exactly the same as in 1963.

The upsurge of European               unemployment        relative to U. S. unemployment             occurred

primarily     between      1975 and 1985, suggesting              that the search for an explanation

should begin with major structural             changes that occurred         within Europe during that

decade.

          The major theories that describe the interrelation               between the unemployment

and inflation         rates are the natural        rate hypothesis     and the hysteresis         hypothesis.

Inflation    rates for the Unit~~d States and the same set of European                          countries    are

displayed     in Figure 2. Here we see that the average inflation                    behavior    of “Europe”

has been remarkably         similar to that of the United States since the late 1960s, with the

European      inflation rate exceeding that for the United States by one or two percentage

points per year in most years. Given the similarity of the inflation performances,                           the
                                                                            Macroeconomic       Policy, Page 5




natural      rate hypothesis     is consistent      with the data only if the natural                  rate of

unemployment         was roughly stationary        in the United States over the last three decades

but increased      by roughly as much as the actual unemployment                       rate in Europe     over

the same period.         This leaves the causes of the increase                 in the European        natural

unemployment         rate unexplained.

          During the early 1980s a popular           explanation       for the divergence       of European

and U. S. unemployment           rates was a contrast in labor-market               behavior.    The seminal

work      of Branson-Rotemberg           (1980),     Sachs       (1979),      and    Bruno-Sachs      (1985),

emphasized        the contrast    between     real wage          rigidity    in Europe      and real wage

flexibility in the U. S.       Following the early- 1970s slowdown                  of productivity   growth

shared in common         by all industrialized        nations,     real wage flexibility        in the U, S.

allowed the growth of real wages to decelerate               in tandem with productivity              growth,

while     real wage rigidity in Europe prevented             such a deceleration.

          It is easy to assess the validity of this hypothesis              by examining     data on labor’s

share in national income.        By definition,      labor’s income share (S) is equal to the real

wage ~/P)       divided by output per hour (Q/H).            Using lower-case          letters for logs, this

definition    implies that the growth rate of the real wage is equal to the growth                        rate

of productivity     plus the growth rate of labor’s share:


                 Aw-Ap      =     (Aq-ti)        + As                                                      (1)
                                                                     Macroeconomic      Policy, Page 6




Thus any tendency          of the growth rate of real wages (Azu - Ap) to exceed the growth

rate of productivity       (Aq - Ab) would be reflected         in positive growth in labor’s share

(~).   In consequence,       the real-wage rigidity hypothesis leads us to expect that labor’s

share in Europe        would have increased        relative to that in the United States during

1975-85,      the period of the rising relative European          unemployment      rate.     As the cost

of labor increased relative to its marginal product, profits would have been squeezed,

the demand         for labor       would   have decreased,      and unemployment            would     have

increased.

       The real-wage         rigidity hypothesis    regarding     Europe   has as its counterpart         a

substantial     U, S. literature     on the failure of real wages to grow over the past two

decades,      despite a positive      (albeit small) growth     rate of output    per hour.         In the

American view, structural           features of U. S. labor markets account        for the failure of

real wages to keep pace with productivity.            According     to equation    (l), this common

perception      implies that the U. S. wage share must have declined              substantially.       For

zero real wage growth          to have been consistent        with a 1.0 percent      annual        rate of

productivity     growth,    labor’s share should have declined at 1.0 percent               per year, for

instance from 70 percent           in 1973 to 53 percent in 1993.

       Both the real-wage rigidity hypothesis          for Europe as well as the common U. S.

perception     of stagnant real \/ages appear to be the reverse of the truth, as shown by

the display of wage shares ir~ Figure 3. These wage share series, constructed                       by the
                                                                         Macroeconomic       Policy, Page 7




OECD, include in wage income an imputation                     for the labor income earned by the

self-employed.        Far from declining rapidly, the wage share series for North America

(dominated       by the U. S. ) has remained            roughly    constant,     falling only from         68

percent      in 1973 to 66.5 percent         in 1993.       The wage share series for Europe              did

increase relative to North America during 1974-81, which coincides with the period

when the European         unemployment        rate began its relentless descent.           But since 1981

the European      wage share has declined much more, from a 1981 value of 69.3 percent

to 63.4 percent       in 1993.

          Thus any effect on unemployment           of the high European         wage share during the

late 1970s should have been more than reversed by the declining wage share during

the   1980s     and    early   1990s.       The   absence     of such a reversal           in the    natural

unemployment          rate casts doubt       on the original      rigid-real-wage       hypothesis       as a

convincing     cause of persistently      high European      unemployment.        The difficulty in this

explanation      is parallel     to that in linking     the worldwide          post-1973       productivity

slowdown       in the industrialized    countries    to the oil price shocks of the 1970s, since

the   oil shocks      have     now   been    completely       reversed    in real     terms,     while   the

productivity     slowdown      has not been reversed in most countries.

        Competing       with the view that the increased natural rate of unemployment                    was

structural    in origin is the hysteresis hypothesis,        which postulates       that the natural rate

is “state dependent,”     automatically      following in the path of the-actual unemployment
                                                                                   Macroeconomic          Policy, Page 8




rate like the tail of a dog.1           The hysteresis hypothesis                  can explain the evolution             of

actual unemployment             in Europe      by a combination                of events that raised the actual

unemployment          rate, especially adverse supply shocks (e.g., higher oil prices and a

temporary       increase in labor’s share) accompanied                        by restrictive     demand       policy.    In

turn,     through     hysteresis      the   natural       rate    followed         in the      path      of the    actual

unemployment          rate,     Because the actual unemployment                      rate was above the natural

rate during the transition          process, the inflation            rate declined,        as shown in Figure 2.

To reverse the process, some combination                       of beneficial supply shocks supported                     by

expansionary        demand      policy must bring the actual unemployment                               rate below the

natural     rate, i.e., the unemployment              gap must become negative,                    in order to “drag

down” the natural rate.

          As we shall see in Fig~re 4, none of the major European                              countries      is close to

having      a negative        unemplc yment        gap.        The consequence              of such hypothetical

expansionary        policies would be to raise the inflation rate until the economy stabilizes

at a new equilibrium          with a lower actual and natural unemployment                             rate, and a more

rapid rate of inflation.         A key issue in evaluating               the merits of expansionary                policy

is to determine      the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment                             in the transition       to

the new equilibrium.           The divergent experiences               of those countries          that dropped         out

of the ERM in 1992-93              highlight   the recent behavior                of the tradeoff.

2.2 Unemployment           Gaps, Structural Deficits, and the Stabilizing              Deficit Ratio

           Studies are available for many different         countries    which provide estimates          of

the natural     rate of unemployment,          and of the gap between          the actual and natural

rates of unemployment.          1995 unemployment           gaps for the G-7 countries,        plus Spain

and Sweden, are shown in Figure 4. The source is Giorno et. al. (1995), which uses

a method       developed     by Elmeskov       and MacFarlan         (1993).      The natural      rate of

unemployment        is estimated     by solving an equation         in which the rate of change of

wages is related simply to the unemployment                 gap; thus the natural        unemployment

rate is equal to the actual unemployment             rate in any year in which wages are neither

accelerating     nor decelerating.        The unemployment           gaps in Figure       4 are arrayed

between the United States, which in 1995 had a negative unemployment                         gap and was

assessed to be producing        act~al real GDP in excess of potential            real GDP, and at the

other extreme      France and Spain, with estimated            unemployment         gaps in excess of 3

percent.      The average gap for Europe is about 2 percent,               and subtracting      this from

the actual     unemployment        rate of 11 percent         (Figure    1) implies that the natural

unemployment        rate for Europe in 1995 was about 9 percent,                much higher than the

estimate of 6 percent       for the United States.*




        2. In Gordon (1995a) I ha~~e recently estimated the U. S. natural rate of unemployment    as a time-
varying parameter and have found it co have decreased gradually from about 6.4 percent in 1981 to about 5.8
percent in 1995.
                                                                      Macroeconomic        Policy, Page 10




          Using a version      of Okun’s          law to translate    unemployment        gaps into gaps

between actual and potential            output,      Giorno et. al. (1995) also compute           structural

budget deficits, i.e., the budget deficit that would be incurred                    if the economy       was

operating     at potential   output instead of at actual output.             Figure 5 displays the 1995

estimates for the same set of countries               covered by Figure 4 and shows that most of

the fiscal problems       of the high-deficit        European    countries    are structural     rather than

recession-induced.        None of the European countries have actual deficits that are more

than double their structural          deficits.     Of course, if the natural rate of unemployment

were lower in these countries, the structural             deficits would be correspondingly           lower.

This provides a link between the hysteresis hypothesis                    and the fiscal dilemma facing

Europe.     There is the possibility that monetary              expansion     could pull down both the

actual and natural        rates of unemployment,           and thus reduce the structural            deficits

without     politically   difficult   budget-cutting.       But this would require         exchange      rate

depreciation,      the acceptance         of additional      inflation,      and   the abandonment         of

monetary     union.

       The consequence          of large fiscal deficits is, of course, an increase in the ratio

of government       debt to GDP.        Currently      for the major European        countries     this ratio

ranges from 52 percent          for France to 125 percent            for Italy, as shown in Figure 6.

A standard relation states that stability of the debt-GDP ratio requires that the deficit-

GDP ratio be equal to the growth                  rate of nominal    GDP times the debt-GDP            ratio.
                                                                        Macroeconomic           Policy, Page 11




Table 1 compares         the actual and structural         deficits for the same countries            included

in Figure 6 with a computed             “stability value” of the deficit-GDP           ratio.     The stability

ratio is the current        debt-GDP       ratio from Figure 6, multiplied             by the “warranted

growth      rate of nominal       GDP, which in turn is set equal to the rate of potential

output growth plus the current             rate of inflation,3       As shown in the first column of

Table 1, for the U. S., in which nominal                 GDP growth        of 5.0 percent         is consistent

with steady inflation        and steady output         growth     at the potential      rate, the required

deficit-GDP      ratio is 2.3 percent        (.46 times .05 equals .023), a bit above the 1995

actual deficit and exactly equal to the 1995 structural                     deficit.     Hence      the figure

displayed     on line 5 for the U. S. is -0.5, indicating            that the actual deficit is smaller

than the stability value, implying a slight shrinkage                 in 1995 of the debt/GDP             ratio,

while the figure displayed           c~n line 7 is 0.0, indicating        that the structural         deficit is

exactly equal to the stability value.

         Table 1 includes simil:~r calculations          for the other European         countries     covered

by Figures 4-6. Line 5 shows that all but Germany and Italy have actual deficits well

in excess of the stability value, implying continued                  growth     in the debt-GDP         ratio.

The surprising      inclusion of Italy in the stability group results from a combination                      of

a huge debt/GDP          ratio and relatively        rapid inflation      (and hence high warranted

that inflation is demlerating.  Thus the warranted nominal GDP growth rate allows the rate of real GDP

nominal GDP growth).           The list of countries    with structural    deficits in excess of the

stability value on line 7 is the same as the list of countries          with positive gaps on line

5, although     of course the debt/GDP         ratio would grow more slowly if these countries

adopted     expansionary     policies to eliminate their output and unemployment               gaps.


2.3   Exchange Rates, Demand Growth, and Inflation

        The macroeconomic          policy discussion within Europe over the past few years

has been dominated         by the Maastricht    conditions   for monetary union, and the debate

over the significance        of the breakdown       of the ERM in 1992.          Figure 7 plots the

effective exchange      rates of the four largest European         countries    from 1981 to 1995.

The history has three stages: convergence           from 1981 to 1987, the ERM period from

1987 to 1992, and then the breakdown               period starting in 1992.

       Subsequently        we will return to the recent period and ask how the post-1992

divergence      of exchange     rates influenced     nominal     GDP growth        and the split of

nominal     GDP growth       between     real GDP growth       and inflation.    A preview for the

four largest     countries    is provided      in Figures    8 and 9.     Many     different    factors

influence    nominal    GDP growth,       and we can focus on several major episodes.              The

major events that occurred after 1987 were the British boom of 1987-89, the German

reunification    boom      of 1990-91,      and the divergence      of British    nominal      demand

growth from the French rate after 1992.            Italy presents a puzzle, with the appearance
                                                                 Macroeconomic        Policy, Page 13




of convergence         of nominal     GDP growth      closer to the French          rate rather    than

divergence      after the 1992 Italian exchange rate depreciation.

          Further     puzzles are evident   in the behavior     of inflation      rates in Figure 9,

French and German inflation rates were relatively close together                  after 1987, except

for the period of the German reunification            and its aftermath,       1991-93.    The puzzle

is that British and Italian inflation rates were much closer to the French and German

inflation     rates after    1992 than before.       We shall return       to this puzzle,    and its

implications        for demand management     policy, in section V of the paper.


      3. Stwctuml        Maladjustment      and Aggregate Demand-Supply                   Analysis

This section links the two main topics of the paper,               macro policy and structural

maladjustment,        to several simple analytical    tools and theories.         These include the

distinction     between      demand   and supply shocks, the natural           rate hypothesis,     the

hysteresis     hypothesis,    and the response   of demand-management              policy to supply

shocks.


3.1    Demand Shocks and the Natural Rate Hypothesis

          We begin with the familiar expectational        Phillips curve diagram in Figure 10,

which plots the inflation        rate against the unemployment         rate.      If the natural   rate

hypothesis     is valid, the long-run   Phillips curve (LP) is a vertical line rising above the

natural unemployment          rate (U*). The initial short-run     Phillips curve (SPJ is drawn
                                                                        Macroeconomic        Policy, Page 14




 on the assumption         that the expected inflation rate is p’. which in turn is equal to the

actual inflation       rate (p~, the point in the vertical dimension              at which the SP curve

intersects     the vertical LP line. The SP cume shifts whenever                 there is a change in the

expected       inflation   rate (p’).    The SP curve can also shift upward               in the case of an

adverse supply shock, and down in the case of a beneficial supply shock.                            We will

shortly link the concept         of structural   maladjustment        to that of supply shocks.

        The influence of aggregate demand is shown by the DG [for Detnarui Growth)

schedule.       The position     of the DG schedule is determined            by the excess of the rate

of nominal        GDP growth        over potential     output   growth,     or “excess nominal           GDP

growth” (x), as well as the previous period’s unemployment                       rate.    When x is equal

to the inflation       rate, then by definition       actual output      gro~h      is equal to potential

output growth,        and the unemployment           rate is fixed.     When x exceeds the inflation

rate,   then      actual   output       growth   exceeds    potential      output        growth,   and    the

unemployment          rate declines.4

        Consider the effect of a permanent           acceleration     of excess nominal GDP growth

from XOto xl. The DG line shifts upward as shown, and the economy initially moves

to point El. With adaptive expectations               and an adjustment       coefficient      of unity, the


         4. When this analysis is done on a diagram with the output gap on the horizontal axis then the DC
=hedule is a negative 45 degree line. If the Okun’s law coefficient linking the unemployment      gap to the
output gap were unity, then the DC schedule in Figure 10 would be a positive 45 degree line. If the Okun’s
law coefficient is 2 (an output gap of 2 corresponds to an unemployment gap of 1), then the slope of the DC
line is 2, indicating that a shortfall of inflation below x of one percentage     point corresponds    to an
unemployment     gap of minus 0.5.
                                                                       Macroeconomic          Policy, Page 15




expected       inflation     rate is equal to last period’s actual inflation          rate.    Hence in the

subsequent       period the SP line shifts upward to cross the LP line at a point (marked

C) directly to the right of point El. In the subsequent                period the DG schedule shifts

to intersect the long-run          rate of inflation directly above the initial equilibrium               point

(at the point marked A).5 If the rate of excess nominal GDP growth                             is maintained

at xl permanently,          the economy will go through the loop shown by the dashed spiral

line.

        This      diagram      summarizes        the basic results     implied      by the      natural     rate

hypothesis.        A permanent        acceleration     of excess nominal         GDP growth         causes a

permanent       acceleration      of inflation    of the same amount       after a transition       period in

which the inflation           rate oscillates above and below its long-run             equilibrium        value.

Maintaining       an unemployment         rate (UJ below the natural          unemployment          rate (U*)

requires a steady acceleration          of excess nominal GDP growth and results in a steady

acceleration      of the inflation rate.         The process is symmetric        if the short-run    Phillips

curve is linear,       as shown       in Figure      10.    A deceleration       of inflation     requires     a

permanent       deceleration     of excess nominal GDP growth, results in oscillating inflation,

and a temporary            period of unemployment          above the natural rate.




         5. Imagine a DGZ line drawn through point A. This indicates that the unemployment      rate would be
unchanged if the inflation rate at that point (pJ equal led the value of excess nominal GDP growth (xl) at the
same point.
                                                                             Macroeconomic        Policy, Page 16




3.2   Supply Shocks and t~                 Interpretation     of Structural Maladjustment

          Figure 11 uses the same model to examine                        the effects of an adverse supply

shock.     The shock is viewed as shifting the SP schedule upwards without changing its

slope.     If the shock is an agricultural           crop failure, the relative price of farm products

will temporarily      increase, and the initial SPOschedule will shift upward to SP’. But

after the cause of the agricultural            problem is over and normal conditions                   return, the

relative price of farm products              will decline.        The economy will temporarily              enjoy a

beneficial    supply shock due to the relative price decline, and the SP curve will shift

down to SF’ during            the transition        period    back to normal         prices.      The OPEC oil

shocks of 1974-75        and 1979-81               raised the relative       price of oil for a substantial

period.      In this case the upward shift of the SP curve to SPYis followed                          by a return

to the initial     position      (SPJ when           the transition       to the higher         relative   price   is

complete,     ignoring the impact of shifting inflation                   expectations.

          A central case useful for the analysis of supply shocks is a situation                           in which

excess nominal GDP growth remains unchanged                         at XO,and so for the initial transition

period     the DG schedule         remains         fixed.    Then with an adverse              supply shock the

economy       would     go     initially      to    point    L,    with     higher    inflation      and     higher

unemployment.         Even if in tile subsequent period the supply shock goes away, the SP

schedule will stay above its initial position                if expectations     are formed as we assumed

previously     in Figure 10, reflecting            the response      of expected     inflation     to the higher
                                                                 Macroeconomic         Policy, Page 17




actual inflation    caused by the supply shock.         Gradually    higher unemployment          will

push down the inflation rate, and the economy will slide back to the initial position

by the route shown by the dashed line.

       But policymakers        will be tempted     to fight the unemployment            caused by the

supply shock.      If they accelerate    nominal demand growth sufficiently,            i.e., pursue a

policy of “accommodating”         the supply shock, the economy will avoid an increase in

unemployment        but at the cost of a permanent        increase in inflation.        The economy

will arrive at a point like N, with both actual and expected               inflation     equal to the

permanently     higher rate of excess nominal GDP growth.             The shift from a point like

EOto a point like N provides a realistic description           of the process by which the U. S.

made a transition       from 5 percent inflation in the early 1970s to 10 percent inflation

in the late 1970s.

       The opposite extreme is a policy of “extinguishing”           the supply shock. Nominal

GDP growth is dropped          sufficiently   to push the economy rightward            to a point like

M.   Because inflation      does not accelerate,     there is no adjustment        of expectations.

Eventually,    when the initial transition       is completed     (i.e., the relative    price of oil

settles down to its new higher level), the SP curve will shift back to its initial position.

However,      excess nominal GDP growth has been diminished,              and if this reduction       is

maintained,     there    will be a permanent       reduction    in the rate of inflation       in the

subsequent    transition.   In short the policymakers      face a tradeoff in reacting to supply
                                                                            Macroeconomic       Policy, Page 18




shocks,      with a neutral       (point    L) or extinguishing             (point   M) policy          implying       a

temporary       increase      in unemployment,          but an accommodating               policy        (point    ~

implying      a permanent        increase     of inflation.      The contrast        between     the effects of

accommodating           and extinguishing        policies helps to explain why Germany                     did not

experience      an increase in its inflation         rate in the late 1970s, whereas the U. S. and

several other      European       countries     did experience        an acceleration       of inflation          that

persisted     until the major monetary           restriction    of the early 1980s began.

        Numerous        events can be fit into the framework                of supply shocks and demand

responses.      In particular,    Franz-Gordon         (1992) show that a change in labor’s share,

such as that implied by the real-wage rigidity hypothesis                    discussed in Part II, shifts the

inflation-unemployment            relation in exactly the same way as a change in the relative

price of oil. The SP schedule shifts upward during the period when labor’s share is

increasing.     Whether       or not it returns to its original position             depends on the degree

of accommodation,          if any, and the adjustment            of expectations       of inflation.

        Thus     far    the    analysis     does     not      allow   for     a permanent          increase         in

unemployment,          simply because the natural rate hypothesis               is maintained      and we have

not allowed for an increase in the natural rate of unemployment.                           This could occur

in two ways. First, the nature of the structural                maladjustment        could be to impair the

functioning     of the labor market           sufficiently     to increase the natural          rate.     Second,

there   could be a hysteresis         mechanism         in place which         automatically       translates       a
                                                                     Macroeconomic       Policy, Page 19




period      of high actual        unemployment      into    an increase     in the      natural     rate   of

unemployment.

         Krugman     (1994) asks whether         generous European       welfare policies, combined

with a relatively     high reservation      wage (or legal minimum          wage) could explain the

rise in the natural        unemployment      rate in Europe.      Such policies could explain high

unemployment         but not rising unemployment,             as was observed        between      the early

1970s and late 1980s, unless the benefits had increased significantly.                    But European

welfare states were already generous             back in the early 1970s when unemployment

was relatively low. Instead, he argues that the facts are consistent                 with a twist in the

demand for labor, combining             a decrease in the demand for low-productivity               workers

and an increase in the demand for high productivity                 workers.       If reservation     wages

do not change,        or if there       is a minimum       wage that does not change,             then the

decreased      demand       for low-productivity       workers     will be translated        into     higher

unemployment        rate than reduced relative wages.            This hypothesis      is consistent     with

the facts that long-term         unemployment      of young people has increased            significantly

in many European           countries,   while in the United States the same demand twist has

emerged in the form of an il lcrease in the inequality             of wage rates,       In searching for

explanations     of the demand twiw, Krugman               rejects international     competition       from

low-wage      countries,     which he argues would change the sectoral                mix of high skill
                                                                    Macroeconomic     Policy, Page 20




relative to low skill employment.          Instead, he favors the explanation          that there has

been a generalized      skill-biased shift in technology       that has affected all industries.

           Krugman places his emphasis on skill-biased technology            shifts by comparing     the

evolution     of European     and American labor markets.          In contrast,   Bean (1994) argues

that   no one factor        appears   significant    enough    fully to explain      the increase     in

European       unemployment      and concludes      that there must be multiple        causes, rather

than a single cause.        Gordon    (1995), like Krugman,        uses the differing performance

of the American and European            economies     as a criterion    to assess the plausibility    of

a long list of potential      causes of a rising natural       unemployment        rate in Europe     in

contrast     to a stable (and recently     declining)    natural   rate in the United States.        He

centers his analysis on a standard        labor market diagram in which, following             Layard

et. al. (199 1), short-term      equilibrium    occurs at the intersection        of a labor demand

curve with a positively        sloped “wage setting curve” which displays the wage that

emerges      from the bargaining      process   at alternative     levels of labor input.       What

factors could have caused the European              wage-setting    curve to shift upwards     or the

U. S. wage-setting     curve to shift downwards?

        1. An increase in the tax wedge.            Since firms pay pre-tax wages but workers

receive after-tax wages, any increase in payroll or income taxes can shift up the wage-

setting schedule.     The tax wedge in the Europe is both higher and increased                  more

than in the United States between the late 1960s and late 1980s (Bean, 1994, p. 586).
                                                                       Macroeconomic         Policy, Page 21




          2. The rigid real wage hypothesis             seems consistent      with the observed bulge in

the European         labor share between       1974 and 1982 (Figure 3 above), which coincides

with the period of most rapid increase in the natural rate of unemployment.

          3. A leading candidate         for causing divergent behavior across the Atlantic is the

marked decline in U. S. trade union membership,                    from 26.2 percent in 1977 to 15.8

percent        in 1993 (union members as a fraction of wage and salary workers).

          4. The real minimum wage has fallen sharply in the United States while rising

in some European           countries,    particularly   France.

          5. Both legal and illegal immigration              of unskilled workers       into the U. S. has

added substantially        to the supply of unskilled labor and plausibly added to downward

pressure       on the U. S. wage-setting        schedule.

          6.     Product   market     r~:gulation in Europe,       particularly     German    shop-closing

hours, reduce the demand fot unskilled labor as contrasted                    to the demand that would

emerge with an unregulated              product    market.

          These six factors are complementary                to Krugman’s     skill-biased   demand twist

and provide a convincing            set of macroeconomic          phenomena       that can be summarized

by the phrase “structural           maladjustment.”      We will return below to the interactions

of structural      maladjustment        and reform with demand management                policy and with

the evolution       of productivi~]      growth.

3.3     The Hysteresis        Hypthesis

          The second approach              to explaining      a permanent        rise in the natural     rate of

unemployment          is the hysteresis         hypothesis.        It can be shown        formally     that     the

hysteresis hypothesis          is equivalent     to replacing the level of the unemployment                  gap as

the driving variable in the inflation                  equation    by the change of the unemployment

rate.G It contradicts         the basic implication        of the natural rate hypothesis       that demand-

management        policy cannot           permanently       alter the unemployment         rate.     Instead,     it

revives    the original        Phillips     tradeoff     between     inflation    and unemployment.              A

demand-induced         recession boosts unemployment,                  which in turn boosts the natural

rate.     Inflation   stabilizes at a new lower level when the new higher                          natural     rate

converges      to the new higher actual unemployment                    rate.    In reverse, the hypothesis

implies that demand-management                  policy always is faced with the choice of achieving

a reduction      of unemployment            at the cost of a finite, not ever-accelerating,            increase

in the inflation      rate.     But, unlike the original stable Phillips tradeoff,                 the tradeoff

schedule available to policymakers               at any given time depends on all of past history.

The experience        of high unemployment                implies that European       policymakers       cannot

push the unemployment              rate as low as they could were they taking the same policy

actions as fifteen or twenty-five              years ago.



         6. Our diseuxion here refers to a “linear” version of the hysteresis hypothesis in which the equilibrium
unemployment    rate “like an elephant” remembers all pastshocks. Cross (1995b, p. 190) distinguishes this from
the nonlinear version in which the memory of past shocks is selective.
                                                                            Macroeconomic          Policy, Page 23




         If hysteresis     is present       in fact, this calls for a theoretical             explanation.’        The

insider-outsider       model of wage determination               shows how employed insiders are able

to convert a favorable          demand         or supply shock into wage increases                 for themselves

rather     than into new jobs for the unemployed.                       The target real-wage              bargaining

model goes in the same direction.                 In addition to total unemployment                in the Phillips

curve approach,          nominal wage increases are influenced                in addition        by the deviation

of real wages or of labor’s income share from target levels.                            If the target level of

labor’s share responds          hysteresis-like      to its actual level, then any pressure on wages

stemming       from      deviations     of the actual         share    from      the target      share     gradually

disappears.


3.4 Implications of Structural Maladjustment                      and Hysteresis

           How can the structural           maladjustment      and hysteresis hypotheses be interpreted

in the diagrammatic          framework         previously introduced?            In Figure 12 we consider              a

possibility    that might have occurred             in the 1970s and early 1980s, the conjunction

of a temporary        adverse supply shock caused by higher oil prices and/or an increase

in labor’s      income      share,      with    a permanent           increase     in . the     natural     rate    of

unemployment          caused by Krugman’s labor demand twist toward more highly skilled

workers,      together      with      some     combination        of my previous          list of supply-side




         7. A wide variety of theoretical    and empirical   papers on hysteresis is found in Cross (1988).
                                                                    Macroeconomic    Policy, Page 24




impediments,          including an increase in the real minimum wage and an increase in the

tax wedge.          In Figure 12 the temporary     shock is indicated by the upward shift in the

SP curve, and the permanent           increase in the natural rate by the rightward       shift in the

LP line.

          What choices are open to policymakers?              If the growth rate of nominal GDP

relative to potential        output   growth   (x) remains      unchanged,    the economy    initially

moves to point L, just as in Figure 11.               Once the source of the supply shock is

removed       (e.g., the relative price of oil or labor’s share stabilizes at a new level), in

Figure 11 inflation and unemployment              returned   to their original levels. But in Figure

12 there no longer is a positive unemployment                 gap at point L. Inflation     is higher

than excess nominal           GDP growth,      and so output        must grow more slowly than

potential     output,    and the unemployment         rate must rise relative to the new higher

natural     rate.     The econom]~ goes through         the disinflationary    loop shown       by the

dashed line in Figure 12, initially experiencing             a further   rise in unemployment      and

then a partial recovery to the equilibrium            level UI *.

          Both the structural     m~ladjustment      approach    and the hysteresis approach       can

explain the observed increase in Europe’s natural rate of unemployment.                     Can they

be distinguished?        One apprcach    is to estimate wage and price equations       to determine

the validity of the condition         for “pure hysteresis,” namely the absence of a “level”

effect of the unemployment            gap.   In one such attempt,        Franz and Gordon       (1992)
                                                                   Macroeconomic       Policy, Page 25




found that hysteresis was partial rather than full in both Ge~many and the United

States, since both level and rate of change               effects are highly significant        in both

countries.     Because the German and U. S. coefficients          are so similar, yet the evolution

of unemployment          in the two countries        is so different,   there    appears    to be little

potential     through this route for explaining that evolution.         If hysteresis is partial (i.e.,

inflation depends on both the level and change of the unemployment                    gap), it provides

no explanation       of a permanent       increase    in unemployment,          since the equilibrium

properties     of the economy are the same as with a straightforward               natural rate model

in which inflation     depends    only on the level of the unemployment              gap.

        The structural    maladjustment     approach     as depicted in Figure 12 has the appeal

of realism.     Oil shocks, an increase in labor’s share, and a skill-biased            demand twist,

all began to occur in the 1970s.       By the time the oil shocks and the increase in labor’s

share had been reversed,         the natural rate of unemployment           had been increased       by

aspects of the European       welfare system that prevented         the demand twist from being

translated    into greater inequality of wages, as it was in the United States and to some

extent in the United Kingdom.

        4. Intemctions           between Macro Policy and Structura! Maladjus~ent

4.1     Responses         of Demand Management                   to Successful Structural Reform

          We can now discuss interactions                  between structural reform and macro demand-

management          policy.       If the sources of structural               maladjustment         are identified      and

macroeconomic             policy reform        begins to reverse their effects, how should                        demand

management          policy respond?s            Our previous framework                 is easiest to interpret        if, as

in Figure 13, we assume that successful structural                            reform instantaneously          shifts the

~       line Ieftward.          We have relabeled               the points        on the diagram,          so that      the

economy’s initial high level of the natural rate is at UO* and moves leftward suddenly

to    U1*.Because          the unemployment               gap is now zero at point .E1 there is a new SPI

schedule that has shifted to the left at the initial inflation rate and expected inflation

rate.    However,         the econom:r does not move instantly from point EOto El.                                Instead,

it moves to point A, which is at the intersection                          of the new SP1 line with the initial

DGO line, which holds fixed the initial rate of excess nominal GDP growth                                         (x~. At

point A inflation           has declined        below the initial value of x, and this allows actual

output growth to rise above the rate of potential                          output growth.         Successive periods

in which inflation remains below XOallow a temporary                             acceleration      of output growth,

which in turn allows the actL,al unemployment                          rate to decline to the new equilibrium

point El. An alternative                poiicy could achieve the same output path by temporarily


          8. A detailed    evaluation   anti chronology    of structural   reform efforts is provided   in OECD    (1994 b).
                                                                 Macroeconomic      Policy, Page 27




raising excess nominal GDP growth by enough to maintain a constant                   inflation    rate,

thus allowing the economy to move straight left from EO to El rather than following

the curved dashed path drawn through             point A.

        How can such a policy procedure          be carried out in practice?     The U. S. Federal

Reserve Board appears          to follow a policy procedure       that could be interpreted          as

targeting the unemployment         rate consistent with steady nonaccelerating        inflation, i.e.,

adjusting interest rates to keep the actual unemployment             rate as close as possible to

the natural    unemployment       rate (U*).    Since the Fed believes that the effects of its

immediate     instrument,    the Federal Funds rate, take roughly one year to influence the

unemployment        rate, it leans toward      raising the Federal   Funds rate when its best

forecast of the actual unemployment            rate one year from now is below its estimated

value of U*. Symmetrically,         it leans toward   reducing   the Federal Funds rate when

its best forecast      of the actual unemployment       rate one year from now is above its

estimated     value of U*.

       Although     U* may not move around as much as the actual unemployment                     rate,

but it is not immutably       carved in stone as a single precise number.          When inflation

turns out to be lower than the value forecast           by the Fed’s staff or a consensus            of

private forecasters,     as in much of 1995, the Fed concludes that U* has declined from

the value previously      assumed by forecasters.     This makes it more likely that the Fed

will reduce interest      rates and less likely that it will raise them.       Accordingly,      a low
                                                                           Macroeconomic      Policy, Page 28




realized value of inflation          or a high realized value of unemployment                  can both lead

to lower long-term           interest rates as speculators          guess that the Fed’s next move will

be to reduce short-term            interest rates.

        The Fed appears to act as if it is operating                 in a closed economy       environment,

and it does not appear to adjust its operation                   of this policy procedure      in response to

movements        of the exchange        rate of the dollar.          It would therefore       appear that an

attempt by an individual           central bank within Europe to emulate the Fed’s procedure

could       lead to exchange         rate   fluctuations        sufficiently    large   to compromise           the

movement        toward Monetary         Union.       A policymaker       in Europe attempting         to reduce

the actual unemployment              rate in response           to a lower natural       unemployment          rate

(achieved      by a successful        nlicroeconomic        reform      policy)    would    notice    first that

inflation     is turning     out to be below forecast,            and would react by reducing              interest

rates   to stimulate         the   dolnestic     economy         in order      to push     down      the    actual

unemployment         rate.     The c(:ntral aspect of this policy is taking the good news on

inflation     to be a signal that stimulative            policies should be adopted           to reduce the

unemployment         rate, rather      than just “accommodating”               the lower inflation         rate by

maintaining      the existing unemployment              rate.


4.2 Structural Reform and l>roductlvity Growth

        The analysis of Figurl: 13 did not take into account                       any effect of structural

reform on the growth rate of potential                output, which would reduce x (the excess of
                                                                        Macroeconomic    Policy, Page 29




nominal GDP growth over potential                 output growth) if actual nominal           GDP growth

were to remain unchanged.             Uncertainty     regarding   the effect of structural      reform on

potential   output growth stems from the conflict between two forces.                    Pure efficiency

gains should raise productivity         grotih.      But reforms in labor markets that make labor

less expensive      for employers      to hire, such as the reduction            or elimination     of the

minimum wage, may raise the demand for labor at a given level of output and reduce

productivity.       The same effect would            be expected        of particular   product    market

reforms,    especially   a loosening      of German       regulations     on shop-closing      hours that

would trade consumer         convenience      for an increase in the labor requirements            needed

to achieve a given total of real retail sales.

       The interactions          between changes in the degree of structural            maladjustment,

both in an adverse and beneficial direction,              are explored      in Gordon    (1995 b). The

evolution      of European   unemployment         is portrayed    as resulting from a set of adverse

wage-setting      shocks (e.g., an increase         in the real effective minimum            wage) which

initially raises unemployment           and, by shifting the economy             northwest     up a labor

demand curve, also boosts the marginal and average products ‘of labor.                        This is then

followed    by a profit squeeze and a period             of disinvestment,       which eliminates      the

productivity     gain but further increases the unemploymel]t             rate. Reversing this process

by achieving      a beneficial    wage-setting      shock (e.g., a reduction       in the real effective

minimum        wage) would initially reduce unemployment                  and both the marginal       and
                                                                          Macroeconomic    Policy, Page 30




average products      of labor,    This would then be followed                by a profits boom and an

increase of investment,      which would offset the initial productivity                  loss and further

reduce the unemployment           rate.


Feedback from Macro Policy to Structural Reform and Vice Versa

            The analysis of Figure 13 emphasizes                the opportunity      for macro policy to

respond     to a reduction   in the natural rate of unemployment                  achieved by structural

reform.     A policy response that stabilizes inflation and responds to a reduction                  in the

natural rate as an opportunity            to accelerate      nominal demand growth          differs from a

passive policy in which excess nominal GDP growth (x) is stabilized.

          This policy choice may influence               the likelihood    and magnitude     of structural

reform.      When   there    is strong       political     opposition     to such reform     measures    as

reducing the minimum         wage and reducing government                   subsidies, the willingness   of

central bankers and finance ministers to respond                   aggressively to successful reforms

may make those reforms more likely. There is potential                      for a political deal in which

the demand-management          authorities       promise to lean toward lower interest rates and

faster nominal demand growth, in trade for the willingness of political interest groups

to support those reform measures that appear to have the greatest chance of reducing

the natural    unemployment        rate.      Demand         expansion,     by creating   jobs, may also

reduce the transition    costs of reform policies which create temporary                  unemployment

through the required restructuring           of a particular     industry that, for instance, has been
                                                                              Macroeconomic        Policy, Page 31




overstaffed       as a result of previous            state ownership          and subsidies       (the “olive-belt”

airlines come to mind).

          Another     related feedback is from monetary                    policy to fiscal policy.            Demand

expansion      which reduces the unemployment                  gap brings the actual government                 budget

deficit closer to the structural                deficits displayed     in Figure 5.          A successful deal in

which demand expansion                goes hand in hand with structural                reform may succeed in

reducing      the     natural     rate    of unemployment             and     hence    the     structural       deficits

themselves.       Reducing the deficit then raises the potential                 for using the fiscal dividend

to reduce tax rates and hence the tax wedge, at least in those countries                            which are not

on an explosive track for the debt-GDP                    ratio.

          There     is feedback      in the reverse        direction        as well.    Countries        with more

flexible labor markets may have a more favorable inflation-unemployment                                     tradeoff,

i.e., a flatter SP schedule in Figures 10-13.                   This is particularly         important      from the

perspective         of the      hysteresis       hypothesis,       which     implies   that      a reduction          in

unemployment          may be achieved at the cost of only a finite increase in the inflation

rate, the amount of which depends on the slope of the short-run                              tradeoff curve. The

United     States, with its flexible labor market,                   has a very flat short-run              tradeoff.

Current       estimates      show        that    a one-year         sustained     reduction       of     the     actual

unemployment          rate by one full percentage              point below the natural            unemployment
                                                                            Macroeconomic           Policy, Page 32




rate raises the inflation            rate by only 0.35 of a percentage                   point     after one year

(Gordon,       1995a, Table 1).


                 5. Policy Lessons fmm tie 1992-93 ERM Breakdown

An important           controlled     experiment      was carried       out in Europe        in 1992-93        when

several important           countries,      particularly    Italy, Portugal,        Spain, Sweden,           and the

United Kingdom,            broke away from the ERM and achieved substantial                          depreciations

of their currencies         against the countries          which remained         aligned with the Deutsche

mark,      including      France,     the    Low Countries,           Austria,     and Switzerland.            Some

European       analysts      have previously        believed    that     depreciation        by any individual

country     is futile, since any transitory            output    gains soon would                be eroded    by an

acceleration     of inflation that will soon cause the competitive                   gains from the exchange

depreciation      to evaporate.          In its most extreme form, t:his view holds that countries

do not have any control,              p:.st a transition     period     of a year or two, over their real

exchange      rates.

        A pessimistic         interpr~:tation      of the outcome         of the 1992-93            divergence       is

provided     by some authors.          I )eGrauwe     (1995, p. 9) focusses on the two cases of Italy

and Spain.       He points          to tne temporary        nature     of the competitive           gains.    While

initially the sharp depreciations            “did not affect inflation very much in these countries

(mainly because of the rece:;sion), since 1994 inflation                         differentials     with Germany
                                                                       Macroeconomic       Policy, Page 33




have started to increase significantly.”          He concludes that in order for Italy and Spain

to guide their inflation      rates to the differential       prescribed    by the Maastricht          Treaty,

a new policy of “painful disinflation”               would    have to begin.       Since he views the

prospect    of success of such policies as low, he thinks that ‘the door to monetary

union will be shut for a long time for these countries.”

        DeGrauwe’s     treatment     is misleading,      for numerous      reasons.     He focusses only

on two depreciating     countries.         He greatly exaggerates        the acceleration      of inflation

in those countries    by comparing          their inflation   rates only with Germany,               failing to

note that the German         inflation     rate was temporarily       high in 1992-93        as a result of

the aftermath    of the reunification        boom.      A more balanced appraisal          would look at

a set of countries   that depreciated         and compare      them with a set of countries              other

than Gemny        that did not depreciate.         The omission of Germany is crucial, because

the time path of its disinflation          in 1994-95     makes the inflation         differential     of any

other country    with Germany            a misleading    indicator    of the inflation     differential     of

that country with all countries           other than Germany.

       The results of the analysis are summarized               in Table 2. The five appreciating

countries   (not including     Germany)        are Austria, Belgium, France, Netherlands,                 and

Switzerland.    On average these countries experienced               a nominal-effective     appreciation

of 10.2 percentage    points, from exchange rate indexes of 99.5 in 1992:Q2                          to 109.7

in 1995 :Q2. In contrast the depreciating             countries — Italy, Portugal,       Spain, Sweden,
                                                                       Macroeconomic           Policy, Page 34




and the United Kingdom — experienced                an average depreciation               of 22.2 points, from

an average index value of 99.1 in 1992:Q2                 to 76.9 in 1995 :Q2. All of the average

values in Table 2 are weighted across the five countries in each group using Summers-

Heston      1985 PPP weights.         Thus among the appreciating                countries,     the weight of

France is 59 percent.         Among the depreciating             countries,     the respective     weights of

Italy, Spain, and the U. K. are 36,2, 17.0, and 37,2 percent.

          Both groups of countries          enjoyed an acceleration           of nominal GDP growth,             a

deceleration     of inflation,    and thus an even greater acceleration               of real GDP growth.

But there the similarity          stops,    The acceleration        of nominal        GDP growth           in the

depreciating     countries    exceeded that in the appreciating               countries     by 1.3 percentage

points.    Yet none of this was absorbed by inflation; inflation actually decelerated more

in the depreciating countries than the appreciating countries.. And as a result the

acceleration     of real GDP growth in the depreciating                countries      exceeded     that in the

depreciating     countries    by 1.7 percentage        points.

          It is implausible      that this favorable     outcome       for the depreciating          countries

could continue forever, but the IMF forecasts for 1996 (from the same source as used

for Table 2) show no acceleration             of inflation to be predicted           for the same average

of five depreciating     countries.        Thus it appears that the depreciating               countries    have

discovered     a “macroeconomic        free lunch,” an improvement               in competitiveness        and a

route to macroeconomic            expansion    without    inflation.     The implication         is that there
                                                                Macroeconomic        Policy, Page 35




is substantial    room for individual    nations in Europe to reduce their unemployment

gaps and their actual budget deficits through          expansionary       monetary     policy.     The

inevitable     depreciation   in the nominal   exchange      rate will translate     into a durable

depreciation      in the real exchange rate and an improvement           in competitiveness.

        With inflation in Germany at only 2 percent, some of which doubtless reflects

the well-known       upward    bias in price indexes, there is ample room for Germany               to

lead the remaining        nations   tied to its exchange   rate into a further        expansion     of

nominal GDP growth,           The experience   of the depreciating      nations suggests that the

“split” of additional     nominal   GDP growth     between     output    growth    and inflation     is

highly favorable under present conditions.         Stated another       way, the benign behavior

of inflation     in Europe suggests that the natural rate of unemployment             has begun to

decline, just as the Federal Reserve believes has occurred           within the United States,
                                                                     Macroeconomic           Policy, Page 36




                                              6. Conclusion

           The management        of demand      policy interacts    with structural         maladjustment,

both when maladjustment              is getting worse, as in the 1970s and early 1980s, and

when successful structural          reforms reduce the influence           of structural     maladjustment

and allow a decrease in the natural             (i.e., constant-inflation)      rate of unemployment.

In our interpretation         a combination     of structural    factors, rather than a single “silver

bullet”, explains the substantial increase in Europe’s natural unemployment                       during the

decade 1975-85          and the divergence      of that natural rate from the stationary              or even

declining natural         rate in the United States.      In the 1970s two-supply            shocks, in the

form of higher real oil prices and an increase in labor’s share in national                           income,

pushed       European       economies     in the     direction   of higher       inflation      and       higher

unemployment.           Reactions    of central banks varied, with monetary                accommodation

in some countries         — but not others — leading to a substantial            divergence      of inflation

rates in Europe by the early 1980s.

           These   two supply       shocks,   both   of which      were      temporary      and had their

influence      reversed     in the mid- 1980s,       combined      with      more   deeply      entrenched

structural     maladjustments       to boost the European        natural     unemployment         rate from

low single digits in the early 1970s to nearly 10 percent                     by 1985.       While real oil

prices and labor’s income share declined subsequently,                the natural rate did not. This

reflects     the role of other      longer-lasting     maladjustments,        especially     inflexible     real
                                                                   Macroeconomic         Policy, Page 37




wages for the unskilled who were harmed by skill-biased                  technical    change, and this

inflexibility   in turn reflects three dimensions         along which Europe (on average if not

for every country) differs from the United States – high and rising tax wedges, more

powerful     unions, and a higher and (in some countries)            rising real minimum            wage.

          This account does not place much emphasis on hysteresis.               Empirical      research

does not support the “pure hysteresis” view that requires the absence of level effects

of the unemployment        gap in dynamic wage and price adjustment                    equations.      The

most plausible channel by which hysteresis operated               was through        feedback from the

other sources of maladjustment         to low capital accumulation,         with the result that the

capacity utilization   rate in Europe has been roughly stationary             despite the rise in the

natural    unemployment     rate,     Stated     differently,   Europe   no longer       has sufficient

capital to employ fully its existing labor force.

          The paper stresses two-way interactions          between structural        reform and macro

policy.    With flexible labor ]narkets, the short-run          inflation-unemployment          tradeoff

is likely to be favorable, providing     an incentive for policymakers          to expand aggregate

demand.      The benign effect of the British depreciation          in 1992 on the inflation           rate

provides one example of the potential payoff of more flexible labor markets.                    In turn,

the promise by policymakers         that they will encourage       a decline in unemployment             in

response to good news on inflation can be used to strike a political deal with political

interests opposed to the introduction          or extension of structural reform.        Expansionary
                                                                           Macroeconomic        Policy, Page 38




monetary       policy   also provides         relief on the fiscal front,            both    by reducing       the

unemployment          gap and bringing          the actual budget deficit closer to the structural

budget deficit, but also, by encouraging                 structural     reform, potentially       reducing     the

natural unemployment            rate and therefore        the structural     budget deficit itself.

          In 1992-93     several European          countries    dropped      out of the ERM to pursue
                                                                                   .
more expansionary           monetary       policies.    The difference      in the performance of these

countries     and those countries          which maintained       a peg between their currencies               and

the      Deutsche    mark      provides      an important        test    case of the         consequences       of

expansionary        monetary     policy,     Not surprisingly,        the depreciating        nations by 1995

enjoyed a substantial       acceleration      of nominal GDP growth relative to the nations that

did not depreciate.         But, surprisingly,         they enjoyed an even greater deceleration                of

inflation,    so that their growth rate of real GDP accelerated                  more than their growth

rate of nominal GDP.

          This augurs well for a favorable outcome                of expansionary           demand policy.       It

may be that the natural           unemployment           rate has begun to decline             significantly    in

Europe, and that this explains why inflation has continued                      to decelerate     in countries

which have depreciated            their exchange         rates significantly.        Job creation      in those

countries    creates an environment           favorable to continued         success in structural      reform.

          The set of issues addressed         in this paper seems a long way from the depressing

litany     of contractionary       demand        decisions     currently     being     made     in numerous
                                                                 Macroeconomic        Policy, Page 39




European     countries   in the name of the Maastricht      criteria.    Some countries    are on an

explosive path for the debt-GDP           ratio and need to bring their fiscal house in order.

An important       lesson can be drawn from the traditional             textbook   discussion   of the

fiscal-monetary      mix, that a shift toward tighter fiscal policy need not reduce output

or raise unemployment        if accompanied      by a shift toward easier monetary         policy.   A

shift toward      a mix of tighter   fiscal policy and easier monetary         policy can occur in

two ways. First, the Bundesbank           could adopt easier policies, allowing other countries

to expand      while maintaining     a fixed exchange     rate with Germany.          Second, if the

Bundesbank        does not adopt     easier policies,    other   countries     have the option       of

abandoning      the path to monetary union and adopting expansionary               monetary policies

that would bring down botl~ the actual and natural rates of unemployment                        with a

minimal acceleration      of infhition.
