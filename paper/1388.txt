                           An Empirical Model of Wage
                    Indexation Provisions in Union Contracts



                                     ABSTRACT



        Cost of living escalators are an important feature of North American

labor contracts. This paper presents a measure of the response of index—

linked wage increases to concurrent price increases for a sample of Canadian

contracts, and   then   analyses this response in terms of a simple model of

indexation to the aggregate price level. The model highlights the impor-

tance of aggregate price movements in conveying information about industry—

specific prices. The empirical analysis confirms that industry—specific

correlations between input and output prices and the Consumer Price Index

are important determinants of the response of wage to prices across index

contracts.

  An Emipirical Model of Wage Indexation Provisions in Union Contracts



     A distinctive feature of North American labor contracts is their

provision for a link between contractual wage rates and the consumer

price index. At present, just under 60 percent of workers in large

union contracts in the U.S. are covered by some form of indexation

clause.!' The response of indexed wage rates to concurrent price

increases is important not only for the structure of relative wages, but

also for macroeconomic wage and price dynamics.V In this paper,

measures of the sensitivity of contract wages to concurrent price

changes are tabulated for a sample of indexed Canadian contracts, and

then analysed in light of a simple model of indexation to aggregate

prices. The model explains an important property of the contract data,

namely, the dispersion in the response of contract wages to price

increases across different industries, by examining the relationship

between industry—specific prices and the aggregate price index.

     The first section of the paper contains a brief description of

escalation provisions in North American labor contracts. It is argued

that diverse indexation formulas are usefully summarized by the marginal

response of contractual wage rates to the consumer price index. The

wide cross—sectional distribution of this response motivates the model

in the second section of the paper. The model shows that, if wages are

linked exclusively to aggregate prices, then the escalation formula

adjusts wages according to inferences of market—specific Input and out--

put prices, conditional on the observed level of aggregate prices. To

the extent that market—specific prices have different correlations with

the consumer price Index across different Industries then, the response
                                  —2—



of escalated wage increases to concurrent price increases varies across

industries.

     In the third section of the paper, the model is tested as a

description of the intercontract distribution of the response of wages

to prices during escalation. Industry—specific estimates of the corre—

latlon between input and output prices and aggregate price shocks are

used to estimate the parameters of the model, including the relative

risk aversion coefficients of workers and firms. The data lend con-

siderable support to the notion that escalation provisions are tailored

by the bargaining parties to reflect their particular environment and

its relation to the aggregate price index.


I. Characteristics of Wagscalators in Major Union Contracts


     Wage indexation provisions emerged in North American labor markets

over 100 years ago.'' The form of current indexed labor contracts,

however, was largely influenced by the historic 1948 agreement between

General Motors and the United Auto Workers.±" With few exceptions, pre-

sent day indexed contracts have adopted the pattern of the original

GM—UAW accord. In the first place, they combine both non—contingent and

contingent wage increases over the life of the contract. Secondly, they

link absolute wage increases to the absolute increase in the consumer

price index above some contractually specified base 1eve1.1 In many

contracts, including the 1948 CM—UAW agreement, the price level at the

signing date of the contract forms the basis for subsequent Index—linked

wage increases..' In other contracts, however, the base level is the
                                    —3—



price level at a date part way through the contract, or less frequently,

a percentage markup on the price level at the start of the contract.

Finally, most escalator clauses generate the same absolute wage

increases for all workers in the contract, regardless of the level of

their wages.

      Formally, these features imply that w(t) ,    the wage rate of a

particular group of workers in the contract at time period t, consists

of the non—contingent wage rate for that group at period t, w(t), and

a contingent component that is proportional to the difference between

the price level at t, p(t) , and the base price level pt



(1)       w(t) = w'1(t) + max [0, a(p(t) —   pT)]

In this equation,   c&   represents the wage increase awarded by the esca-

lator per point increase in the consumer price index (CPI). A typical

indexed labor contract specifies a non—contingent wage schedule for each

group of workers in the contract, a base price level for the calculation

of contingent wage increases, and the index—linked wage increase per

point increase in the CPI.ZJ In addition, some contracts specify a

maximum absolute increase due to escalation.

      On the basis of equation (1), there are several alternative charac-

terizations of contractual escalation formulas. For example, the margi-

nal elasticity of indexation in the tth period of the contract is just


          a p(t)
            w( t)


if the escalator is operative, and zero otherwise. One     particularly
useful way to summarize escalation formulas Is In terms of the marginal
                                        —4—



elasticity of escalation, relative to the wage rate at the start of the

contract (period 0):


                 p(O)
           e -
                 w(O)

In   contracts with multiple wage rates that provide the same index—linked

wage increase for all workers, the marginal elasticity of indexation

must be defined with respect to a particular wage rate. Obviously, the

marginal elasticity of indexation is lower for more highly paid workers.

As a consequence, escalation provisions have typically contributed

toward the erosion of skill differentials during the life of the

contract

      The marginal elasticity measure e provides an ex ante estimate of

the overall elasticity of wage Increases to price Increases during the

life of the contract, If the base price level T and the non--

contingent deferred wage increases in the contract are related in a

simple way. Observe that a linear escalation formula with no delay in

the start of indexation generates a wage—price relationship of the form


           w(t) = w(O) ÷   a(p(t)   —   p(O))

where w(O) and       p(O) are the wage rate and price level at the start

of the contract.2' On the assumption that price level growth during

the contract period is less than (say) 20 percent, this is approximately

equivalent to the constant elasticity wage formula


            log w(t) =   log   w(O) + e(log p(t) —   log   p(O))
                                          —5—



where e = a                 Therefore, in contracts with no delay In the


start of wage escalation, e is an appropriate estimator of the elasti-

city of nominal contractual wages with respect to price increases over

the life of the contract. On the other hand, the same wage—price rela-

tionship emerges in the presence of delayed indexation provisions If the

wage rate at the start of indexation w(t) is related to the base price
    T
p       by—
              w(T) — w(O) —     pt   — p(O)
(2)                       — e
                 w(O)


According to this interpretation, the role of non—contingent deferred

Increases in the contract Is to compensate for price increases that

occur prior to the start of indexation. If the elasticity of non—

contingent deferred increases with respect to price increases prior to

indexation equals the marginal elasticity of contingent wage increases

with respect to price increases during indexation, then the total

elasticity of wage increases with respect to price increases over the

life of the contract Is approximately equal to the (observable) marginal

elasticity e

        The choice between larger non—contingent increases, coupled with

longer delays in the start of indexation, and smaller non—contingent

Increases, coupled with shorter delays in the start of indexatlon, is

problematical.1 In any case, however, the degree of inflation pro-

tection provided by the combination of contingent and non—contingent

deferred increases Is approximately e , assuming that the non—

contingent wage increases in the contract are linked to the delay in
                                  —6—



indexation by equation (2). In the absence of any model of non—

contingent deferred increases In indexed contracts, therefore, I will

use the marginal elasticity e as an estimate of the ex ante desired

responsiveness of contractual wage rates to concurrent price increases,

for escalator clauses taking the form of equation (1). While this

measure abstracts from desired productivity—linked Increases in real

wage rates over the life of the contract, and also ignores cap provi-

sions that limit the size of escalated wage increases, at the very least

it summarizes one Important dimension of escalated contracts..1!

     Figure 1 presents a frequency distribution of the marginal elasti—

city measure from a sample of 189 indexed labor contracts written in the

Canadian manufacturing sector between 1968 and 1975)±1 These elasti-

cities are defined for a weighted average of the highest and lowest wage

rates In each contract.!! Marginal elasticities for unskilled workers

are generally 7—12 percent higher than those in Figure 1, while marginal

elasticities for highly skilled workers are generally 10—15 percent

lower. The Figure illustrates two important facts: first, marginal

elasticities are generally between .75 and .95, although there are

contracts with marginal elasticities as low as .50, and a significant

number of contracts with marginal elasticities in excess of unity..!!'

Second, there is substantial dispersion in marginal elasticities. An

analysis of variance, however, reveals that a large fraction of this

dispersion is attributable to the industry of the contract. In fact,

three—digIt Industry fixed effects explain over 60 percent of the cross—

sectional variation In marginal escalation elasticities. On the other
                                  —7—



hand, the within—industry distribution of marginal escalation elastici-

ties is largely unsystematlc..Zi These observations suggest that a

model of indexation based on industry—specific determinants of the

responsiveness of contractual wage rates to aggregate price increases

can explain a significant share of the dispersion of marginal elastici-

ties illustrated in Figure 1. A simple version of such a model Is pre-

sented in the next section; and tested against the data in Section III

of this paper.


II. A Model of Wage Indexation


     Assume that a union and a firm bargain over a contingent wage

schedule that links the wage rate in the contract to the aggregate price

level. Assume further that the firm sets employment in the contract

period, subject to the wage rate and the prices It faces for inputs and

outputs.!1 The basic idea of the model is this: if movements in the

aggregate price level convey information on contemporaneous shifts in

the demand and supply of labor to the contract, then the wage escalator

will vary the contractual real wage rate with the realization of aggre-

gate prices. In particular, if increases In aggregate prices signal an

outward shift in the demand curve for labor, or alternatively an

increase in the alternative opportunities for workers, then the real

wage rate will increase with the price level. On the other hand, if

aggregate price increases signal an inward shift In the demand curve for

labor, or alternatively a downward shift In the supply curve of labor to

the contract, then the real wage rate will decrease with increases In
                                  —8—



the price level.

     The ability to infer the level of market—specific prices from the

observed aggregate price level implies that the desired elasticity of

nominal wage escalation with respect to the aggregate price level may

vary across industries, depending on the statistical relationship bet-

ween industry—specific prices and the aggregate price level.

Unfortunately, however, this model cannot answer a more fundamental

question: why not index—link wages directly to market—specific prices?

While there is some historical precedent for indexing wages to industry

selling prices, it remains an interesting puzzle as to the nearly uni-

versal practice of escalation to the consumer price index.121 The

approach taken here is to assume that wages are linked to the consumer

price index, and then to derive and test the implications of the model

for observed marginal elasticities of indexation in contracts where

wages are indexed to the CPI. The model cannot explain why wages are

linked exclusively to the CPI, only how they are linked to aggregate

prices in the presence of market specific prices.

     For simplicity, assume that the contract lasts for one period and

takes effect immediately after the bargaining period. Let L represent

the level of employment during the contract period, let w represent the

contractual real wage, and let a represent the alternative real wage

available to employees during the contract period. Assume that the pre-

ferences of the union are represented by the expected value of the

function

(3)              U(w,L,a) =
                                      +— [u(w)                 .—   ()6J
where    u(x) =         x1-         has the interpretation a constant relative risk


aversion utility function and L has the interpretation of a reference

level of empioyment..a2! This function contains a number of well known

union preference functions as special cases. For example, if c = 0                          ,


then


                 U(w,L,a) =— u(w) + (1 —-) u(a)

which gives the expected utility of employment when L0 represents

total union membership and workers are allocated randomly between

contractual and alternative employment. On the other hand, if

u(x) =   x   ,   then equation (3) can be written as

                                         L
              U(w,L,a) = a + (—) [wL — a 5                      dtj
                                                       (-h-)

and union preferences depend on the difference between the wage bill and

the opportunity cost of employment, assuming that the supply price of

workers to the contract is a(—)

                                           0


       On the firm's side, assume that production is Cobb—Douglas with two

inputs: labor and non—labor inputs. It is convenient to parameterize

the production function in terms of the elasticities of labor demand

with respect to wages and non—labor input prices. Let —                          represent
the former, and let           —ri    represent the latter.            The assumption that

production is Cobb—Douglas implies                   > 1 and r > 0 .          Assuming that
                                      —10—



the firm sells its output competitively at the price 0 , and purchases

non—labor inputs at the price q ,       its   profits during the contract

period are proportional to


           ir(0,w,q) .1.   0n w1       qfl



Finally, assume that the owners of the firm       evaluate   the contract in

terms of the expectation of v(rr) ,      where    v is a constant relative

risk aversion utility function with relative risk aversion parameter y

       From the perspective of the bargaining period, an optimal wage

escalator is one that maximizes the expected utility of profits, subject

to a minimum expected utility requirement for workers. This is equiva-

lent to maximizing


           E [v(ir) + X U(w,L,a)]


for a fixed positive number X ,       where expectations are taken with

respect to aggregate prices, the alternativereal wage, and the prices of

output and non—labor inputs. Since


           E[v(',T) + A U(cu,L,a)] = E E[v(T) + A U(w,L,a)      p]


the choice of an optimal wage escalator function is equivalent to

maximizing


           E[v(ir) + A U(w,L,a)   I




at   each aggregate price level p with respect to the real wage rate at

p. Following this strategy, the first order condition for the real

contractual wage rate at the price level p is
                                       —1 1—




(4)        E{vv(1r4!L. +       (w,L,a) +        (u,L,a) .!     p]     0



where           represents the derivative of the demand for labor with

respect to the wage rate w •        This equation requires that the expected
marginal utilities of workers and owners are in constant proportion

across all realizations of the aggregate price level.               Since employment

is set by the firm, the marginal utility of an increase in wages from

the point of view of the union consists of two components: a direct

positive effect, and an indirect negative effect via the employment

effect of the wage change.

      Given a joint distribution for the prices in the model, the first

order condition (4) is readily evaluated. For simplicity, assume that

prices in the contract period have a joint lognormal distribution, with



          E[log p] =     log                   var[ log p] =

          E[log   0] =   log                   var[ log e] = a21

          E[log q] =     log                   var[ log q] = a22

          E[log a] =     log                   var[ log a] = a2

and


                       correlation [log p,log o] = p1

                       correlation [log p,log q] = p2

                       correlation [log p,log a] =
                                                      p3

Furthermore, assume that the conditional distributions of 0, q, and a

given aggregate prices, are independent..a!! Under these assumptions,
                                           —12—




the conditional expectation of employment, given the aggregate price

level p ,     is:

            E[LIp] =      w E[elp] E[qIp]
                      =   w exp{(+i)r1 log(p/) +4(+n)2o21(l.p21)}
                              exp{—nr log (p/i) +             o22(l—p22)}
where


              =     cov{log   8,log p] I var{log p] = p1        a/o
is the regression coefficient of unanticipated changes in the log of the

industry selling price on unanticipated changes in the log of the aggre-

gate price level, and


          r2 =      cov[log   q,log p] / var [log P1 =
                                                              p2o2/a

is the regression coefficient of innovations in the log of the industry

input price on innovations in the log of the aggregate price level.!/

By the same token, the conditional expectation of the utility of

employment at the alternative wage rate                is:



         E[u(a) Jp] =      .j    E[a- p]


                               jlt5 exp{(l—cS)r3      log(p/)    +4(l_c5)2a23(l_p23)}

where


              =   cov[log     a,log p] I   var[log   p] =
                                                             p3a3/a    .
                                          —13—



is the regression coefficient of unanticipated changes In the log of the

alternative real wage on unanticipated changes in the log of the aggre-

gate price level. Substituting these expressions into equation (4)

yields the simplified first order condition recorded as equation (B.3)

in Appendix B.

        Since the first order condition for the contractual wage rate

(p) holds across all realization of the aggregate price level, under

suitable conditions equation (4) can be differentiated with respect to

p to obtain the derivative of the wage escalator, w'(p) .            If   the con-

ditional distribution of alternative wages and Input and output prices

is independent of p , then equation (4) is independent of the aggregate

price level, and '(p) = 0      ,   or   equivalently, the elasticity of the

nominal contractual wage rate with respect to the aggregate price level

is unity. tre generally, however, movements in the aggregate price

level signal movements in alternative wages and/or firm—specific prices.

In response to changes In the conditional inferences of supply and

demand conditions for labor and the profitability of the firm, the

contractual wage rate adjusts with aggregate prices to restore the first

order condition. Some manipulation (see Appendix B) establishes that

the elasticity of the real contractual wage rate with respect to changes

In aggregate prices during the contract period is given by:

The second order condition for w(p) requires that the function a3(p)

is positive.

       According to equation (5),                 the elasticity of the escalated wage
rate is a weighted sum           of       the three regression coefficients that

translate observations on the aggregate price level Into inferences of

the real prices of outputs and non—labor inputs, and the alternative

wage rate. The form         of   the functions                '      and c3 reflects two

distinct roles for the contractual wage. First, since employment is set

unilaterally by the firm,                 the   wage acts as a proxy for the opportunity

cost of employment. The latter depends on inferences of the alternative

wage, and also on the level of demand for labor, to the extent that the

opportunity cost schedule is upward sloping (i.e., c > 0) .                        Secondly,
the wage represents a transfer payment between owners and workers. If

either party is risk averse, the wage performs an insurance function by

stabilizing the profits of owners                  and/or the     expected utility of

workers.
                                      —15—



       The general expression for the elasticity of indexation given by

 equation (5) simplifies dramatically if both parties are risk neutral.

 In that case, the role of the contract wage is simply to mimic the

marginal cost of employment, and insurance considerations are absent

 from the wage function. Substituting 6 = y = 0           into equation (5),
        23/
yields—

              a w'(p) =   c(+n) r — cr r     +
 (6)          w            l+ I l+c 2            l+c r3

 Given risk neutrality, the elasticity of indexation is constant for

all prices, and independent of either the expected relative wage gap

        or the expected level of contractual employment p)

Furthermore, the elasticity of indexation varies with the industry—

specific covariances between input and output prices and the CPIif and

only if the supply schedule of workers to the firm is upward sloping

(e > 0) .      Holding constant inferences of the alternative wage, if
increases in consumer prices signal an outward shift in the demand curve

for labor Cr1 > 0 or r2 < 0) , then the contractual wage increases

with prices to compensate for the increasing marginal cost of employment

at the firm. On the other hand, if increases in prices signal an inward

shift in the demand curve for labor (r1 < 0 or r2 > 0) , then the

contractual real wage rate decreases with the aggregate price level and

the inf erred marginal cost of contractual employment.

       While equation (5) generally implies a different elasticity of

Indexation at each price level, if the variances of opportunity wages

and input and output prices are relatively small, and the supply of

workers to the contract is fairly elastic (c is small), then the

elasticity of indexation is approximately constant and equal to:

from the assumptions that c is small and that the expected relative

wage is close to unity. Under these conditions, c1 and c3 are

postive, while c2 is negative. Furthermore, it can be shown that

increases in the relative risk aversion of owners translate into

increases In the absolute values of c1 and c2 , and decreases in

      .    If owners are more risk averse, the stabilization of profits
receives greater emphasis in the determination of the optimal wage

escalator, and wages are more elastic with respect to inferences of

input and output prices, and less elastic with respect to inferences of
                                   —17—



the alternative real wage rate. Similar conclusions with respect to

changes in the relative risk aversion of workers cannot be established

unambiguously. However, for larger values of the relative, risk aver-

sion coefficient of workers (6 > 1.0) increases in the risk aversion of

workers are associated with reductions in the absolute values of c1

and c2 .    By the same token, increases in the elasticity of the margi-

nal cost of contractual employment have an ambiguous effect on the

coefficients in equation (7). In the risk neutral case, increases in

c ,   which imply a more inelastic marginal cost schedule, increase the
absolute values of c1 and c2 and decrease the absolute value of the

coefficient c3 .     As the supply schedule of additional workers becomes

more inelastic, the contract wage becomes more responsive to inferences

of shifts in the demand for labor schedule, and less responsive to

inferences of shifts in the supply schedule itself. These results con-

tinue to hold for lower values of the relative risk aversion parameter

of workers (6 < 1.0) .    They are reversed, however, for higher values

of the relative risk aversion parameter of workers (6 > 1.0)

       Finally, the elasticity of indexation is independent of the

expected relative wage gap between contractual and alternative

employment in the absence of risk aversion. If workers are risk

averse, however, increases in the expected relative wage tend to

decrease the absolute values of the coefficients c1 and c2 , and

increase the absolute value of c3 .       In   contracts with risk averse

workers and higher relative wages, greater emphasis is placed on stabi-

lizing the differential between the contract wage and the alternative
                                  —18—



wage, and less emphasis is placed on responding to inferences of labor

demand and the profitability of the firm.



III. Testing the Model of Wage Indexation


     The model of the previous section gives a concise expression for

the elasticity of wage indexation in terms of the parameters of tech-

nology, preferences, and the contract environment. Any test of the

model against the intercontract distribution of escalation elastici-

ties, however, requires a description of how these parameters vary

across contracts. Since firm—specific information is largely una-

vailable, the testing strategy adopted here is to model escalation

elasticities at the three digit industry level. As it happens, the

individual contract data are not inconsistent with the hypothesis that

the within—industry distribution of marginal escalation elasticities is

uncorrelated with firm—specific factors4!' In view of this fact, a

comparison of the fit of the model to the fit of a simple industry

fixed effects scheme provides a useful measure of the success of the

model in describing the intercontract distribution of escalation

elasticities.

     Industry level data is available that permits estimation

of several of the components of the escalation formula, including the

industry—specific elasticities of labor demand with respect to wages

and non—labor input prices (— and   —n   respectively)   and the regression

coefficients of output and input price shocks on aggregate price shocks

(r1 and r2 respectively). I also assume that the expected relative
                                    —19—



wage between contractual and alternative employment (z) is repre-

sented by the industry—specific union—non—union relative wage for

unskilled production workers. The remaining parameters of the model,

including the elasticities of relative risk aversion ( and             y), the

elasticity of the opportunity cost of employment schedule (c), and the

regression coefficient of innovations In alternative wages on aggregate

price shocks (r3), are treated as fixed and unknown constants across

all industries.

      Let x1 be a vector consisting of estimates of the elasticities

of labor demand and the union relative wage for the 1th three digit

Industry (x1 =    (j,ni,zi)),   and let d represent the vector of

unknown taste parameters (d =    (S,)',c)).    Assuming that the marginal

elasticity measure e represents the desired elasticity of nominal

wages with respect to intracontract price increases, equation (7)

implies that the logarithm of the marginal elasticity in the contract

written by the th firm in the 1th industry in period t is

approximately equal to:


(8)       log ejj = c1(x1,d)r11 + c2(x.,d)r2. + c3(x19d)r3 +

where r11 and      r2i are Industry—specific estimates of r1 and r2,

      c2 and c3 are the coefficients described in equation (7), and

       has the interpretation of an error term. If                  contains

Industry fixed effects, then the parameters d and r3 are uniden-

tifiable, and equation (8) is simply a regression on industry dummy

variables. On the other hand, if           =     +          where              Is
                                                     °Ijt
                                  —20—



homoskedastic and uncorrelated across industries or time periods, then

equation (8) implies a nonlinear regression with period fixed effects.

Estimates of equation (8) form the basis for the empirical analysis of

indexation provisions in this paper.

     Prior to the estimation of equation (8), however, two issues must

be addressed. The first of these concerns the estimation of the

industry—specific variables on the right hand side of equation (8).

Under the maintained assumption of a Cobb—Douglas production function,

industry—specific elasticities of labor demand can be estimated directly

from data on the shares of labor and materials costs in the value of

Industry shipments..aW This procedure yields a contract—weighted

average estimate of the elasticity of labor demand of 1.67, and an

average estimate of the cross—price elasticity of labor demand with

respect to nonlabor input prices of Is

     Industry—specific estimates of the union markup of unskilled wage

rates (z) can be obtained by comparing wage rates of unskilled

laborers in each industry with the average wage rate of nonunion

laborers.1 This method generates an average estimate of the union

relative wage for unskilled nonproduction workers of 1.21, with larger

union differentials in the soft drink, brewery, tobacco, aircraft and

motor vehicle industries and smaller differentials in the textiles and

furniture industries. These estimated differentials must be interpreted

carefully, since they do not control for labor—force quality by

industry. Nonetheless, the general pattern of the differentials Is pre-

sumably correct.
                                              —21—


        Finally, industry specific estimates of the coefficients            r1 and
        can be obtained from the multivariate time series representation of

the consumer price index             Pt ,   the industry selling price O , and    the

industry input price             .     In a one year contract, r1 is just the
regression coefficient of unanticipated changes in the annual industry

selling price on unanticipated changes in the annual consumer price

index. In principle           r1 takes on somewhat different values in the

later years of two and three year contracts. For simplicity, however,

differences in contract length are ignored, and all contracts are

treated as one year contracts..?2!

        The following regression equations were fit by industry to annual

observations from 1961 to 1979 on the consumer price index, the three—

digit Industry selling price (deflated by the consumer price index) and

three digit intermediate input price (similarly deflated):


(9a)         log Pt = a1 log t—l + a2 log t—2 + ...           +   ak log nt—k +


(9b)                   =
            log            b11 log 0_ + b12 log           + b21 log

                      + b22 log t—2 + vi

(9c)        log        =
                           c11 log          + c12 log     + c21 log

                      + c22 log t—2 + v2

Then, using the estimated residuals from these equations, the coef-

ficients r1 and r2 were estimated In the auxilliary regressions


(lOa)             =
                      r1      + lt

                  =
(lOb)
                      2    Ot + 2t
                                  —22—


Very similar estimates of r1 and r2 were obtained from a two step

seemingly unrelated regression model fit to the CPI and the industry—

specific prices.

     The exclusion restrictions in equations (9) were adopted mainly

for parsimony. On one hand, selective testing revealed no evidence of

Granger causality of consumer prices by either industry input prices or

industry output prices. Accordingly, the log of the aggregate price

level was fit by a second order autoregression in first differences.

On the other hand, the lack of data prior to 1961 dictated a par-

simonious representation of the industry Input and output prices.

Lagged values of input prices were therefore excluded from the output

price equations, and vice versa. A two year lag specification in

equations (9b) and (9c) generally fit the industry price data well, and

more or less eliminated serial correlation In the forecast errors.-91

     The estimates of r1 average .27 across the 44 three digit

industries. Tobacco products, metal stamping, aircraft, truck

assembly, railroad equipment and communications equipment industries

yield large negative estimates of r1 (between —.90 and —.30), while

meat packing, bakery products, textile, woodworking, pulp and paper,

Iron and steel, and agricultural equipment industries yield large posi-

tive estimates of r1 (between .50 and 3.0). Across industries, the

pattern of r2 is similar to that of r1 .     In fact, the contract—
weighted correlation of the estimates of r1 and r2 is .76. As

one might expect, Industries with positive correlations between output

selling prices and aggregate price shocks tend to be those with posi-

tive correlations between input prices and aggregate price shocks. A
                                       —23—


notable exception is the soft drink           industry, in which selling

price shocks are negatively correlated with consumer prices while input

price shocks are positively correlated with the CPI.

     The Industry—specific estimates of the elasticities of labor

demand, the union—non—union relative wage, and the regression coef-

ficients   r1 and r2 are all measured with error. It is well known

that measurement error In the exogenous variables of a regression

equation leads to inconsistent parameter estimates, and nullifies stan-

dard inference procedures. Given the shortcomings of the data used to

estimate the industry variables, therefore, the parameter estimates and

inferences obtained from the cross—sectional estimation of equation (8)

must be interpreted cautiously.

     A second major issue In the estimation of equation (8) is selection

bias. A large fraction of union contracts contain no escalation

provisions.2.!! One   interpretation   of such fixed wage contracts Is as

indexed contract in which the optimal elasticity of nominal wages with

respect to aggregate prices is approximately zero. According to this

interpretation, estimation of equation (8) on a sample of indexed

contracts leads to biased parameter estimates, since the regression

function and the error term in (8) are correlated, given that the

contract Is indexed (i.e., given that the optimal elasticity of nominal

wages Is greater than 0).   If information on nonindexed contracts was

available, equation (8) could be corrected for selection bias in the

manner suggested by Heckman (1976). Since data on nonindexed contracts

are not readily available, however, such a correction is beyond the

scope of the present analysis.
                                   —24—


      On the other hand, the decision to index is based on several fac-

tors beside the deviation of the optimal elasticity of indexation from

zero. Other things equal, indexation is more valuable, the greater the

variance in the aggregate price level, and the greater the precision of

the conditional inferences of market specific prices, given the aggre-

gate price level.-' To the extent that the indexation decision Is

Influenced by factors other than the magnitude of the optimal elasti-

city of indexation, selection bias in the estimation of equation (8)

over the subset of indexed contracts is lessened.

      Before turning to full—fledged estimates of equation (8), it is

useful to consider estimates of some simple linearized versions of the

model. If interindustry differences in the elasticities of labor

demand and the gap between contractual and alternative wages are

ignored, then equation (8) is just a linear regression on the parame-

ters r1 and r2 .      Furthermore, the regression coefficients are
interpretable as estimates of the coefficients c1 and c2 in

equation (7), and the constant term in the regression Is interpretable

as an estimate of c3r3    .   The results of this regression are recorded

In column (1) of Table 1. The estimated coefficients are very preci-

sely determined, and remarkably consistent with the theoretical model.

In particular, the coefficient of r1 Is posItive, the coefficient of

r2 is negative, and their ratio (which Is an estimate of —(+ii)/n )

Is   of the correct order of magnitude.- For the risk—neutral specifi-

cation of firms' and workers' preferences, these estimates imply an

estimate of the Inverse elasticity of labor supply Cc) of about .03

(setting demand elasticities at their industry average values).
                                  —25—


Assuming that the coefficient c3 is positive, these estimates also

imply that the correlation of aggregate price shocks and innovations in

alternative real wages Is negative.

     The second column of Table 1 extends the list of regressors to

include the industry—specific elasticities of labor demand and the

industry—specific relative wage. While higher union—non—union relative

wages apparently reduce the elasticity of indexation, neither of the

demand elasticities adds significantly to the regression. On the other

hand, equation (8) is highly nonlinear in the elasticities of labor

demand, and their impact on the marginal elasticity of indexation may

not be adequately captured by a simple linear regression.

     The third and fourth columns of Table 1 report the same

regressions as the first two columns, with fixed effects for the

signing dates of the contracts included as exogenous variables. While

the signing date effects improve the fit of the regressions, they have

only a minor impact on the estimated coefficients of the industry

variables. This reflects a more or less even Industry distribution of

contract signings across the sample period.

     Table 2 presents nonlinear least squares estimates of equation

(8), utilizing the functional forms for c1 ,        and c3 recorded In
                                               c2
equation (7). The first column of the Table contains estimates of

equation (8) under the assumption that the marginal cost of contractual

employment is constant at the alternative wage, I.e., that     = 0   in

the union utility function (3). The parameter estimates imply that

workers are substantially more risk averse than owners, although the

assumption that owners are risk neutral is rejected by a conventional
                                     —26—


test.-' The estimated coefficient of relative risk aversion of

workers is 2.45 —   very   close to the estimate obtained by Farber (1978)

in modelling wage determination in the coal industry. The estimate of

the parameter r3 is —.40, which Implies that a one percent innovation

in the consumer price index is associated with a .4 percent reduction

in alternative real wages available to employees in union contracts.

In the aggregate Canadian labor market, the regression coefficient of
                                                   35/
real wage shocks on price level shocks is about —.65.— Thus the

fact that average elasticities of indexation are something less than

unity Is consistent with the short run fixity of nominal wages rates

elsewhere In the economy.

     Rows 8. through 10. of Table 2 contain measures of the goodness

of fit of the various specifications of equation (8). The risk averse

version of the model in the first column of the Table explains about 15

percent of the intercontract dispersion in elasticities of indexation.

Relative to the benchmark of a regression on industry fixed effects,

however, it does somewhat better. In fact, the test statistic against

this general specification (In the tenth row of the Table) has a marginal

significance level of one percent. In view of the parsimonious nature

of the model, this Is not an unreasonable standard of performance.

     The second column of Table 2 presents estimates of a risk neutral

specification of equation (8). In this formulation, the only parame—

ters are c , the inverse elasticity of labor supply to the contract,

and the coefficient           As the R2 statistics Indicate, the risk

neutral specification fits less well than the risk averse version of

the model. This should- not be surprising, however, given that the risk
                                    —27—


neutral specification excludes the relative wage variable z from the

elasticity formula, and the fact that in linear form, at least, higher

relative wages have a significantly negative impact on the elasticity

of indexation. The parameter estimates imply that the supply schedule

of workers to the contract is fairly elastic, but not flat.

Furthermore, the estimate of r3 is negative, although somewhat

smaller in absolute value than the estimate obtained under the assump-

tion of risk aversion.

      Some further insight into the differences between model specifica-

tions is provided by the average values of the coefficients   c1 ,
and   c3 ,   recorded in lines 5. through 7. of the Table. The average

values of c1 and c2 are similar between specifications. However,

under risk neutrality, the average value of the coefficient   c3 is
.95, while under risk aversion, the average value is .59. Since,

roughly speaking, the estimate of r3 is selected so that the average

value of c3r3 fits the mean of the dependent variable, the difference

in estimates of r3 between specifications is understandable.

      The final column in Table 2 reports estimates of a combined model

that includes both the risk averse and risk neutral specifications of

the union utility function as special cases. The estimate of the risk

aversion parameter for workers is essentially the same as that in

column (1) of the Table. Allowing for increasing marginal costs of

employment, however, the estimate of owners' relative risk

aversion is larger than in the pure risk specification, and less pre-

cise. The estimate of the inverse elasticity of supply is .04,

although this estimate is not different from 0 at conventional signi—
                                      —28--



ficance levels. Generally speaking, the combined model represents only

a minor improvement over the risk averse specification, and there is no

strong basis to choose between them.

     These same conclusions emerge from estimates of equation (8) when

year—specific fixed effects are included in the regression equation.1-"

Results for this procedure are summarized in Table 3. The addition of

a set of fixed effects for the signing dates of the contracts has very

little impact on any of the estimated parameters. Furthermore, the

relative performance of the three alternative specifications of union

preferences is the same in the presence or absence of signing date

effects, and the test statistics comparing the explanatory power of the

model to a general industry fixed effects scheme are virtually iden-

tical in Tables 2 and 3.

     Text statistics for the joint significance of the year effects are

presented in the eleventh row of Table 3. Across all three specifica-

tions of union preferences there is evidence of time—varying elastici-

ties of indexatlon. The estimated year effects indicate a trend toward

higher marginal elasticities over the 1968—1975 period, although the
                  37/
trend is irregular.—

     One   explanation   for this trend is an increase in the variability

of the aggregate price level over the sample period. As the variance

of the consumer price index increases, holding constant the variances

of real price movements, the coefficients r1 ,
                                                    r2 and r3 tend
toward zero, and the elasticity of indexation given by equation (8)

tends toward unity. Since most marginal elasticities are less than

one, this translates into a trend toward higher marginal elasticities,
                                  —29—


over the sample period. Many observers, and simple time series models,

attribute a higher residual variance to the aggregate price level in

the mid—1970's relative to the previous decade.' If this increase in

variance was recognized by contract writers at the time, they may have

consciously adjusted their marginal elasticities during the sample

period. A careful investigation of this hypothesis, however, requires

time varying estimates of the covariances between industry and aggre-

gate prices, and is beyond the scope of this paper.

     A comparison of the nonlinear regressions in Tables 2 and 3 with the

simple linear regressions in Table 1 reveals that the latter fit about as

well as the former, when the industry—specific demand elasticities and

relative wage variables are included in the linear regressions. On the

other hand, the results in Table 1 suggest that the industry—specific

labor demand elasticities are insignificant determinants of the margi-

nal elasticity of indexation. While this may reflect the inherent

nonlinearity of the true relationship between the escalation elastici-

ties and the demand elasticities, an alternative explanation is that

measurement error in the estimated elasticities of labor demand is

large relative to the cross—sectional variation in these two variables.

In the context of equation (8), a simple test of this hypothesis is

obtained by fixing the elasticities of labor demand across industries

and then re—estimating the equation, using only the interindustry

variation in the parameters r1 and r2 and the relative wage

to identify the parameters of the model. Results for this procedure,

when the demand elasticities are set equal to their average values

across all industries, are displayed In Table 4. For all three speci—
                                     —30—


fications of union preferences, the parameter estimates and the fit of

the model are similar to the corresponding results in Table 2. Neglectv

   any interindustry variation in the estimated elasticities of labor

demand has only a small impact on the fit of equation (8), and affects

none of the major conclusions from Tables 2 or 3. As it happens, the

estimates in Table 4 are highly robust to the values of the elastici-

ties of labor demand inserted in equation (8), and the fits of the

model are largely unaffected by alternative choices for these two
              39/
parameters.—
        Several conclusions emerge from the empirical analysis in Tables

1—4. In the first instance, the basic insight of the theoretical model

is confirmed. Marginal escalation elasticities are higher in industries

with higher correlations between output price shocks and aggregate price

shocks, and lower in industries with higher correlations betweeninput

price shocks and aggregate price shocks. Secondly, the fact that escala-

tion elasticities average something less than unity is attributed to the

behavior of wage rates outside the contracts. In this regard the evi-

dence from the indexed contract sample is consistent with the observed

relationship between aggregate real wages and consumer prices. Thirdly,

while according to the model firm—specific elasticities of labor demand

are important determinants of the elasticity of indexation, there is no

strong evidence for this hypothesis in the contract data. On the other

hand, the estimated elasticities of labor demand may simply contain too

much measurement error to provide a meaningful test. Fortunately, the

performance of the model and the parameter estimates are fairly robust to

alternative assumptions on the cross—sectional pattern of these elastici-

ties.
                                  —31—




     The contract data do, however, provide evidence of a negative corre-

lation between relative contractual wage rates and the marginal elasti-

city of indexation. In the context of the theoretical model, this is

interpreted as evidence of risk aversion on the part of union members.

In the presence of risk aversion, the model suggests that the elasticity

of indexation is drawn closer to the elasticity of alternative wages with

respect to aggregate price shocks, the larger Is the gap between contrac-

tual and alternative wages. Since alternative wages respond negatively

to upward movements in aggregate prices, the implied correlation of

marginal escalation elasticities and relative wages is negative.2J

     Finally, although the interindustry pattern of the coefficients that

link industry—specific prices to the CPI and the union—non—union relative

wage explain only a moderate share of the dispersion in escalation

elasticities across contracts, the relationship between observed escala-

tion elasticities and the Industry variables is remarkably consistent

with the simple model of union preferences and firm behavior developed In

this paper. Overall, the data seem to favor a model of coinsurance bet-

ween workers and owners, in which workers receive some protection from

shocks to alternative wages at the same time as owners receive some pro-

tection from shocks to profits. The data also show a trend toward higher

marginal elasticities over the sample period. Whether or not this trend

is consistent with the model, however, remains unanswered.


Summary and Conclusions


     This paper develops and tests a model of Indexation In long term

labor contracts. Starting from observed labor contracts, a measure of
                                  —32—


the elasticity of indexation is derived, and its pattern across a sample

of indexed contracts is presented. Of particular interest are two facts

about measured elasticities of indexation: their wide dispersion, and

their large industry—specific component of variance.

     In the second section of the paper, a simple one period contract

model is developed under the assumption that the contractual wage rate is

linked to the aggregate price level. The implications of several alter-

native specifications of workers' preferences are derived for the elasti-

city of contractual wages with respect to consumer prices. The

elasticity of indexation is shown to depend on the parameters of the

firm's production function, the parameters of workers' and owners' uti-

lity functions, and the relationship between firm—specific prices and the

aggregate price index.

     The model does not explain a number of interesting and important

aspects of cost of living allowance clauses in collective bargaining

agreements. First, no attempt is made to justify index—linking solely to

consumer prices. Second, the model gives no insights into the prepon-

derance of Indexation clauses that yield the same absolute wage increases

to all workers in a given contract. Finally, the model does not explain

the presence of both non—contingent deferred increases and index—linking

arrangements in escalated contracts.

     In the third section of the paper, the model is tested as a

description of the distribution of escalation elasticities across

contracts. Estimates are provided for some of the variables in the

model, by three digit industry, and the remainder of the variables are

treated as constant across all industries. The estimation results
                                   —33.-



reveal a significant role for the industry variables in explaining the

intercontract distribution of escalation elasticities, although an

hypothesized relation between industry specific elasticities of labor

demand and the indexation formula is not confirmed. The parameter esti-

mates Imply that union preferences can be represented by a simple

expected   utility of employment function. They also imply that firms
display some   aversion to the risks of profit variability. The estimated

relative risk aversion of workers is about 2.5, while the estimated rela-

tive risk aversion of the owners of firms is about .10.

     In spite of Its simplicity, the model enjoys a reasonable degree of

success in describing the interindustry pattern of escalation elastici-

ties. The contract data provide strong support for the basic premise of

the model, that the response of index—linked wages to aggregate price

increases depends on the information that aggregate prices convey for the

market specific prices of interest to the bargaining parties.

                                 FOOTNOTES



1.   See Davis (1983). Unfortunately, no information Is available on the

     coverage of Indexation clauses in smaller union contracts (less than

     1,000 workers), or in the nonunion sector. It is generally

     believed that escalation provisions are rare in the nonunion

     sector——e.g., Douty (1975). On this basis, perhaps no more than

     10 percent of all U.S. workers are covered by cost of living

     provisions.


2.   This latter aspect of escalation clauses Is emphasized by Gray

     (1976) and Fisher (1977).


3.   Indexed wage rates were instituted In the iron Industry around

     Pittsburgh in the 1860's. Wages were linked to the price of pig

     iron, with a one percent increase in iron prices leading to

     approximately a .5 percent Increase in wages. See      Taft   (1945).


4.   Carbarino (1962) describes the origins of the GM—UAW contract and

     Its impact on subsequent collective bargaining arrangements.


5.   Virtually all present day escalation clauses link wages to the con—

     s.nner price index. n interesting variant occurs in the automobile

     Industry, where wages are linked to a weighted average of the U.S.

     (.90)   and CanadIan (.10) indexes.     Approximately 95 percent of

     Indexed agreements in the U.S. and Canada link absolute (as opposed

     to percentage) wage increases to absolute price changes. Douty
                                    —40—


     (1975), p. 41, states that this percentage remained roughly

     constant in the U.S. between 1963 and 1975. Formulas that link

     percentage Increases in wages to percentage Increases in prices,

     while rare in the manufacturing industries, are more widespread in

     the government sector and the service Industries in Canada.


6.   This is true of about 55 percent of the indexed contracts written

     in the Canadian manufacturing sector between 1968 and 1975.


7.   If wages are linked to price increases after a certain date r

     then     =   p(T)   is just the price level at that date (and is

     uncertain at the signing of the contract.)


8.   For example, an analysis of the wage rates of the highest and

     lowest paid workers in 281 indexed contracts written between 1968

     and 1975 in Canada reveals that indexation provisions reduced the

     relative wages of the highest paid workers in the contracts by some

     2.5 percent per year, on average. See Card (1983).


9.   Non—contingent deferred increases are ignored. In contracts with

     indexation clauses that take effect immediately after the start of

     the contract, non-contingent deferred increases are typically

     small: 2—3 percent per year In the case of many automobile

     industry contracts, for example.


10. This wage—price formula is also equivalent to one that links wage

     increases to the difference between the realized price level and

     the expected price level, provided that the wage rate at the start

     of the contract Is suitably chosen.
                                        —41—


11. Consider a delay in indexation until prices are pt , coupled with

    a non—contingent wage increase that gives a wage rate w(t) at the

    start of indexation. Once indexation is underway, the wage rate is


         w(t) =   w(r)   + cz(p(t) —   pT)
              = w(0) +     ct(p(t) —   p(O))
                           — w(O)              p(0) pT — p(0)
              + w(0) 1w(r)
                     L
                                  —
                              w(0)           (0) p(0)
12. In Canada during the early 1970's, for example, the United

    Automobile Workers wrote many contracts with no delay in indexation

    and relatively small non—contingent increases. The United

    Steelworkers, on the other hand, wrote many contracts with long

    delays in indexation and relatively large non—contingent deferred

    increases. See Card (1983), Table 2.


13. The most widely used summary statistic for describing escalation

    clauses is the ratio of contingent wage increases over the contract

    period to the growth in the price level over the same period.

    Obviously, however, this ratio understates the degree of inflation

    protection intended by the contracting parties for contracts with

    delayed escalation clauses.         En such contracts, some fraction of

    expected price level growth during the contract period is incor-

    porated into the non—contingent deferred increases in the contract.


14. The data were drawn from individual contract extracts reported in

    various issues of The Collective Bargaining Review, published by

    Labour Canada. I am grateful to David Wilton for making available

    the contract extracts. From October 1967 to October 1975 there
                                  —42—


     were 1405 major contracts (with more than 500 employees) signed in

     the Canadian private sector. Among these, 385 contained cost of

     living allowance clauses. Excluding norunanufacturing contracts and

     contracts with incomplete data, there is a usable sample of 189

     contracts drawn from 44 3—digit manufacturing industries. Of

     these, 108 contracts were written by firms with two or more

     contracts in the sample.


15. The contract extracts report only the highest and lowest wage rates

     in each contract. Furthermore, they give no information on the

     skill—composition of the contractual labor force. Skill propor-

     tions were inferred from three—digit industry data. The propor-

     tion of workers earning the highest wage rate (usually a rate paid

     to skilled tradesmen) was set equal to the industry—wide propor-

     tion of craftsmen In the total employment of craftsmen, operatives,

     and laborers.


16. 10 percent of the contracts had a marginal elasticity for the

     average wage rate in excess of unity.


17. An F—test for the significance of firm fixed effects, controlling

     for three—digit Industry effects, has a marginal significance level

     of just over 5 percent. The within—industry distribution of esca-

     lation elasticities is also uncorrelated with the length of the

     contract, the identity of the union, whether or not the escalator

     is a new provision in the collective agreement, or the unemployment

     rate at the signing date of the contract.
                                     —43—


18. It is well known that unilateral employment determination by the

     firm does not generate wage—employment pairs on the contract curve

     between the union and the firm: see Leontlef (1946) for example.

     An alternative framework is to assume that wages and employment are

    jointly determined. For recent attempts to test between these com-

     peting paradigms, see Ashenfelter and Brown (1983) and MaCurdy and

     Pencavel (1983).


19. In one recent contract between 3M Corporation and the Oil Workers

    union, wage increases are linked to average wage increases reported

     in a survey of comparable workers.


20. AccordIng to (3), the marginal utility of contractual wages is

    Lu'(w) ,   while    the marginal utility of contractual employment is
    u(w) —                   The function (3) is quasi—concave for all
             u(a)(—)     .



    w, a, and L such that the marginal utility of contractual

    employment is positive.


21. This simplifying assumption implies that the covariance of log 0

     and log q arises solely from their joint covariance with log p.

    Formally, it requires cov[log 0,log q] =         cov[log   0,log p] cov[iog

    q,log p] /   var   [log P1.


22. These formulas follow from the formula in Appendix A.


23. Equation (6) represents a generalization of the indexation formula

    analyzed by Blanchard (1978).


24. Note that (7) implies (6) if I =        =0   ,    as required by the risk

    neutrality hypothesis.

25. See Footnote 17.


26. The share of labor costs in the value of shipments is (—l)(+n),

    while the share of materials costs in the value of shipments is

    n/(+n). The value—added data pertain to 1971: data sources are

    listed in Appendix C.


27. These elasticities are necessarily larger in absolute value than

    the constant output elasticities typically estimated In the

    literature. The Cobb—Douglas functional form implies that the

    output—constant elasticity of demand for labor with respect to

    wages is —l ,   while   the output—constant elasticity of demand for

     labor with respect to materials prices is 0. Most aggregate stu-

    dies show that the output—constant elasticity of demand for labor

    with respect to wages is less than 1 in absolute value: See

     Hamermesh (1976).


28. Micro—data estimates of the union relative wage gap by industry are

     unavailable for Canada. As an alternative, I used the following

     method to obtain crude estimates of the union markup by industry,

     based on 1971 industry wage data. Assume that the logarithm of the

     average wage rate of unskilled workers in an industry at a par-

     ticular location (Toronto, Montreal or Vancouver, depending on the

     industry) is a weighted average of the nonunion and union wage

     rates, where the weight on the union wage is the fraction of

     unionized workers In the industry. Suppose further that nonunion

     wage rates for unskilled workers are identical across industries
                                      —45—



     (at   a particular location) and equal to 90 percent of the average

     wage rate across all industries. Then the industry—specific union

     wage markup is the difference between the log of the average

     industry wage, and the log of the average nonunion wage, divided by

     the percent of unionized workers in the industry. The data source

     for the industry wage rates is listed in Appendix C.


29. The individual contract data do not reject this simplifying assump-

     tion. Holding constant industry fixed effects, contract length

     dummy   variables   are insignificant in a regression equation for

     the marginal elasticity of indexation.


30. Unfortunately, the sample period includes the 1973—4 episode of

     dramatic increases in raw materials prices. To the extent that

     the pattern of these increases was extraordinary, data from 1973—4

     represent outliers which should be discounted in estimation. Some

     experimentation revealed that the estimates of r1 and r2 were

     fairly sensitive to inclusion or exclusion of the 1973—4 data.


31. In 1982 for instance, only 22 percent of the major agreements

     signed in Canada included indexation clauses. In the same year,

     57 percent of workers covered by major contracts in the U.S. had

    index—linked wages.


32. The relationship between the variance of the aggregate price level

    and the indexation decision is described by Ehrenberg, Danziger and

    San (1983). As an empirical matter, most of the changes over time

    in the proportion of indexed contracts seems to be correlated with
                                    —46—


     aggregate price level uncertainty. For example, in 1958 the pro-

     portion of workers in major union contracts in the U.S. covered by

     indexation provisions stood at 50 percent. This fraction fell

     steadily through the early 1960's, reaching 20 percent in 1966.

     Then, in the late 1960's and early 1970's, there was a sharp

     resurgence in indexed contracts. See Douty (1975) Table 1, page

     12. Coverage by escalation provisions reached 60 percent in 1978,

     and has fallen only slightly since then. See Davis (1983).


33. The contract—weighted average value of .—      is   .53. Using the

     estimates in column (1) of Table 1, the restriction that the

     regression coefficient of r2 is —.53 times the regression

     coefficient of r1 yields a t—ratio of 2.46.


34. In the presence of measurement error in the industry variables

    however, conventional significance levels may be inappropriate.


35. This estimate is obtained from the correlation of the residuals

    from a second order vector autoregressive representation of the

    logarithms of annual real average hourly earnings in manufacturing

    and the consumer price index.


36. Since equation (8) does not include an unrestricted intercept, the

    parameter estimates are not invariant to the choice of a basis year

    from which to measure the year effects. Arbitrarily, 1971 was

    selected as a basis year. The mean elasticity among contracts

    signed in 1971 is very close to the mean elasticity over all years.

    Alternative choices for the basis year mainly effect the estimate

    of r3
                                         —47—


37. The mean elasticities of indexation by signing date of the contract

     are:


                           1967     —   .65    (    3 contracts)
                           1968     —   .70    (    7 contracts)
                           1969     —   .75    (10    contracts)
                           1970     —   .77    (14    contracts)
                           1971     —   .83    (27    contracts)
                           1972     —   .72    (11    contracts)
                           1973     —   .73    (22    contracts)
                           1974 —       .87    (62    contracts)
                           1975     —   .87    (33    contracts)

38. Riddell and Smith (1982) fit a time—varying autoregressive moving

     average model to the Canadian CPI and find increasing residual

     variances in the 1970's.


39. For example, setting the wage elasticity of labor demand at —.70

     and the input price elasticity of labor demand at —.60, the para-

     meter estimates and their estimated standard errors are as follows:

     for the pure risk specification (column 1 in Tables 2—4) 5 =

     2.49(.63),     y =   .200(.06l),    r3 =       .745(.063),     standard error of the

     regression =    .1746; for the risk neutral specification (column 2 in
     Tables 2—4) c = .0741(.018),              r3 = —.249(.015)      ,   standard error of
     the regression = .1786; for the combined specification (column 3 in

     Tables 2—4)      =   2.47(.66),     y =       .608(.223)   ,
                                                                     =   .566(.33l)   ,


         = —.677(.088)         standard error of the regression = .1733.
    r3                     ,




40. An alternative explanation for the negative correlation between

    industry relative wages and industry escalation elasticities is

    that contract negotiators tend to mimic indexatlon provisions in

    other recent contracts. If low wage industries adopt the same
                             —48--



indexed wage increase per point increase in the CPI as other

Industries, they induce a negative correlation between industry

wage rates and marginal escalation elasticities.

      This appendix presents an expression for E[Xa I y] , when                                x and

y have a joint lognormal distribution.

      Suppose log x and log y are jointly normally distributed with means

The expectations can be evaluated using the formula in Appendix A,

assuming that the conditional distributions of (0,r,a) ,             given    p

are independent. Let

                                          —53—
