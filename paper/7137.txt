     Much of the debate in macroeconomics turns on the stickiness

of nominal prices, to which one part of the literature ascribes

monetary non-neutrality and the propagation of demand-side business

fluctuations. Although whether micro level stickiness must lead to

substantial nominal rigidity at the aggregate level remains an open

question, certainly a prerequisite of the `New-Keynesian' approach

is that such rigidity exists at the micro level.1

     I document a high degree of nominal rigidity in apartment

rents. Over the period of 1974-1981, twenty nine percent of the

apartments in my sample from the Annual Housing Survey (AHS)

National panel had no change in nominal rent from one year to the

next.       About half of that fraction can be attributed to grid

pricing; the rest I interpret as downward rigidity.

     The incidence varies with observable determinants in clear,

and intuitive, patterns.    Nominal rigidity is higher in years and

in cities that have a low median nominal growth rate.       Across

years the incidence is nearly perfectly ranked with the median

growth rate.      Units that turn over have a lower, though still

substantial, incidence than those units in which the tenant stays

an additional year; however, most, and perhaps nearly all, of the


        1
      Generally, the relevant theoretical literature adopts a
menu cost approach. Caplin and Spulber (1987) show that when
firms adopt an Ss type policy in price adjustment (which
Sheshinski and Weiss had shown to be optimal), and inflationary
shocks are all positive, that money is neutral. Neutrality fails
when monetary shocks can be both positive and negative, as in
Caplin and Leahy (1991).

                                                                  1
incidence for turnover units can be ascribed to grid pricing.         The

incidence of nominal rigidity is also higher for units located in

smaller buildings.

     Others have shown evidence of nominal price rigidity before,

although only for goods that represent a tiny share of consumer

expenditure.   Thus Cechetti (1986) showed that even in the high

inflation decade of the 1970s, the newsstand price of magazines

remained unchanged for three and a quarter years, on average.

Kashyap (1995) followed the prices of several items, such as

chamois shirts, and fishing rods in the L. L. Bean, Orvis and

R.E.I.   semiannual   catalogues,   and   found   that   nominal   prices

typically lasted for more than a year.      Lach and Tsiddon, working

with Israeli data on 26 products - principally wine, fish and meat

-, showed that from 1978 through mid 1979, when the average monthly

inflation rate was 4 percent, the average duration         of a nominal

price quotation was nonetheless 2.5-3 months.            Evidence of a

different sort is provided by Levy, Bergen, Dutta and Venable

(1997) who in a recent article report for a small sample of

supermarket chains that only 70-80 percent of prices are changed in

response to wholesale price changes.

     For Ball and Mankiw (1994), that the individual goods examined

are small budget items is to be expected.         "For this theory, the

most important prices are for those goods bought with money, since

the price of goods bought with credit do not directly affect the



                                                                        2
demand for money.    Goods bought with money tend to be small retail

items, such as newspapers and haircuts."       (p. 131)

     One suspects, nonetheless, that the authors would be glad to

find nominal rigidity in a good that is not a "small retail item".

Indeed, housing is perhaps the one large consumer item that is not

paid with credit.     For the renters of the units in my sample,

housing expenditures constitutes 20 to 30 percent of their yearly

income.   Aside from the importance of this sector to the economy,

it is especially interesting to find nominal rigidity in a good

whose asset prices are known to be quite volatile.

     The manner of price determination in the rental housing market

also distinguishes this good from those examined in prior research.

Unlike the market for magazines or L. L. Bean chamois shirts, where

a single seller of a homogenous good sets a price common to many

consumers, who may purchase at will, the market for rental housing

consists of heterogenous goods for which negotiation typically

attends each   transaction.     Few     apartments   are    rented   in    the

anonymous manner of "small retail goods". Price may be tailored by

the landlord to the particular tenant, or it may be determined in

bargaining between the two.    Even when a landlord follows a fixed

rent policy,   the   opportunity   to    deviate   from    that   policy    is

costlessly available, for a new contract must be produced for each

new tenant and at each lease renewal regardless of price.            To use

the metaphor of "menu costs", a new menu necessarily attends every

transaction. Given this, the observed nominal rigidity must be the

                                                                             3
result of some phenomenon other than menu costs, which is the

leading explanation for nominal rigidity in the earlier studies.2

     Indeed, the distribution of nominal rent changes suggests a

form of nominal rigidity more like that of downward price rigidity

than what would be produced by menu costs.         Although small price

increases   and   decreases   are   relatively   rare,   as   a   menu   cost

argument would predict (for a single product firm), it is the

scarcity of large negative changes that it is most striking.

Because the rarity of small absolute changes can also be explained

by grid pricing, and, as argued above, the nature of transactions

make the menu cost argument untenable, I reject the menu cost

explanation.

     Of course, to speak of a certain type of price changes as

"missing" one must have a notion of what the growth of rents would

look like in the absence of nominal rigidity.                 In very high

inflationary periods, as in Israel during the period examined by

Lach and Tsiddon, or the Argentina of Tomassi, any change in the

real frictionless real price would typically be swamped by the

effects of inflation.    The primary goal of a price setter in these

circumstances is to keep up with inflation, and so the natural

     2
      Kashyap notes that a price change requires that the
relevant catalogue page be recomposed, with the attendant costs.
Levy et al is quite explicitly about menu costs, which they
measure directly. The exception is Cechetti - every magazine
issue has a new cover and so could have a new price costlessly!
Cechetti ascribes the nominal rigidity to coordination problems
in collusion of the sort that Sweezy’s (1939) kinked demand curve
is meant to capture.

                                                                            4
benchmark    to   which   to    compare       nominal    price       changes   is   the

inflation rate itself.         In our case, inflation was moderately high

while real rent was declining.                Over the 1974-1981 period, the

consumer price index rose 84 percent while the median nominal rent

increased by 44.5 percent - or 9.2% and 5.4% annually.                     Thus some

benchmark other than simply the inflation rate is needed.

     In constructing the counterfactual rent growth distribution,

I assume that the observed distribution is the outcome of censoring

of an underlying unobserved distribution in which some negative and

some small positive proportional increases in rent are replaced by

a zero increase in the observed data.             Following Card and Hyslop’s

(1996) work on wage rigidity, I assume, additionally, that (a)

there is no censoring above the median, and (b) the underlying

distribution is symmetric.         Together, this allows me to construct

the counterfactual distribution from that part of the observed

distribution above the median.

     In the following section, I document how nominal rigidity

depends upon the median growth rate in nominal rent, turnover

status and building size.         In section 2, I show that these results

reflect nominal rigidity across different contracts and do not

result from within lease interviewing.              Section 3 discusses grid

pricing, which, in this market, is the tendency to set prices that

are multiples of certain dollar amounts.                Sections 4 and 5 attempt

in various ways to determine the contribution of grid pricing to

nominal     rigidity.      Section        4    constructs        a    counterfactual

                                                                                      5
distribution function which is used, first, to provide an upper

bound for, and then to explicitly calculate, the contribution of

grid pricing.      In Section 5 I estimate a probit regression, thus

providing     a   multivariate   analysis   of   nominal    rigidity.      The

regressors include a set of dummy variables for the grid point of

the previous year’s rent.        Section 6 considers whether adjustments

along other margins substitute for nominal price adjustments.

Section 7 concludes.



I     The Incidence Level, Turnover and Building Size

IA.   Some Basic Facts

      The Annual Housing Survey, National Sample (1974-1981) is a

panel of housing units, based on the 1970 Census.3                   It is an

unbalanced sample, principally because samples of newly constructed

units are added each year, other units are demolished, and a few

interviews are not completed.         I restrict the sample to units in

SMSAs     (Standard   Metropolitan   Statistical    Areas)    with    no   rent

control restrictions over the 1974-1981 period.4           (The AHS gives no


      3
      The 1973 survey cannot be matched to the        later ones. Since
1981 the survey has been conducted biannually,        so that AHS now
stands for the American Housing Survey. A new         sample, based on
the 1980 Census, was drawn in 1985, and a 1990        Census based
sample drawn in 1995.
      4
      SMSAs with rent control are identified primarily by
National Multihousing Council (1981 and 1982), as well as Baar
(1983), Downs(1988), Gilderbloom and Applebaum (1988),
Gilderbloom and Friends (1981), Capek and Gilderbloom (1992),
Block and Olsen (1981), Niebanck (1985), Rydell et al (1981), and

                                                                              6
location information below the state level for units outside

SMSAs.)   Those cities are listed in Table 1.          Of the three largest

American cities, New York City is absent as it has had rent control

of some sort or another over the post-war years, and Los Angeles is

absent since rent control was imposed in 1979, leaving Chicago the

largest city represented.       Only units for which rent is paid

monthly and is recorded (rent above $1999 per month is top coded,

and I drop such units), and which are neither in public housing nor

are occupied by tenants whose rent is partly subsidized by the

government are included; these conditions are required to hold for

the year and the previous year.        There are 11,418 observations,

each   constituting   a   housing   unit   and   two    adjacent   years   of

completed interviews.

       I measure a unit's nominal growth rate by dr / lnRt - lnRt-1 ,

where Rt is the nominal rent in year t.          It is obtained from the

answer to the question "What is the monthly rent?" in the year t

interview. Figure 1 displays the empirical cumulative distribution

function of dr, by year.      Almost all of the dispersion reflects

differences in growth rates within the SMSAS.                In 1981, for

example, the overall variance of dr was .08, while the variance of

the mean dr across SMSAs was a mere .007.

       The fraction of units with no nominal rent change is measured

by the length of the vertical line at zero.            Clearly, there is a



The Report to Congress on Rent Control (1991).

                                                                            7
large degree of nominal rigidity in all years.               There is no

evidence of real rigidity, that is, a growth rate equal to the

inflation rate, as zero is the only "mass point" in any of the

years.

     Some summary statistics of the distributions are presented in

Table 2, also by year.         The incidence of nominal rigidity varies

between 23 and 34 percent, with an average of 29 percent across all

years.

     Table 2 also shows that the incidence of nominal rigidity is

positively correlated with the inflation rate.             This is to be

expected:     a fixed nominal price is harder to sustain in an

inflationary environment. The incidence is more closely associated

with the median growth rate of nominal rent, with which it is

nearly perfectly ranked.        (I choose the median as the indicator of

location, for it is natural to view zero nominal changes as

replacing what would otherwise by decreases or small increases in

the nominal rent, and the median, unlike the mean, is unaffected by

such censoring.)

     The incidence of positive nominal growth is also nearly ranked

with the median.      But, interestingly, the incidence of a nominal

decrease    is not.   This is perhaps due to the rarity of this event,

which subjects it to a greater sampling variance.                But it also

suggests    that   much   of   the   negative   growth   rates    represents




                                                                           8
measurement errors.5   Note that classical measurement error in

responses to questions about the rent level would lead to a

downward bias is measuring nominal rigidity.   The table also shows

that the dispersion, measured as the difference between the median

and the 75th percentile, is relatively constant across years.    I

use this measure rather than the standard deviation, because the

former is unaffected by censoring below the median.

     The relationship between the incidence of nominal rigidity and

the overall growth rate can be explored at the SMSA level as well.

Figure 2 plots the two against each other, by year.       When the

incidence is sufficiently high, the complication of a zero median

arises, although this occurs for small SMSAS sample sizes only.

Table 3 summarizes these graphs by the regression of the nominal

incidence on the median growth rate.   This can either be regarded

as merely a representation of the data, or, under the censoring

interpretation, as casual.    In any case, the first column shows

that a one percent increase in the median growth rate decreases the

incidence of nominal rigidity by 1.4 percent - and predicts (out of

sample) that a median growth rate of 17 percent will exhibit no

nominal rigidity at all.   Interestingly, Card and Hyslop also find

a one percent increase in inflation decreases the incidence of

nominal wage rigidity by 1.4 percent.     Conditioning on SMSA or


     5
      Akerlof, Dickens and Perry (1996)have similarly argued that
most observed individual negative wage growth (within jobs) is
measurement error.

                                                                 9
year, as in Columns (2) and (3), reduces the effect of median

growth rate, but the coefficient remains significant, both here and

in the remaining columns, which restrict the sample to non-zero

median rents.



IB    Turnover Status

      Nominal rigidity also varies with turnover status.       A unit is

identified as having turned over between the two interviews if the

interviewer checked "Yes" to the statement "Household head moved

here during the last 12 months", after having posed the question:

"When did ... (head) move into this house (apartment)?", which is

answered in the year and month.6      Table 4 presents some statistics

on turnover status.     The first row shows that about one-third of

all units turn over every year.       The remaining rows pertain to a

subsample in which the turnover status for the previous three years

is   ascertainable.     They   show   that   the   turnover   hazard   is

decreasing: half of all units change hands after a year; of those

in which the tenant remains, one-third turn over in the year after,

with declining fractions for subsequent years.

      Table 5, columns (1) through (3), displays the proportions of

units that experienced a nominal decline, nominal increase and no

      Tn the data for the 1979, 1980 and 1981 surveys,        the Bureau
computes a variable, HHOLD, which keeps a count of the        number of
different households since the 1974 survey. Increases         in HHOLD
correspond to the turnover classification described in        the text
96 percent of the time.

                                                                       10
nominal change, by tenure status and year.               Overall, some 36

percent of units in which the tenant remains the same experience no

change in nominal rent, against 14 percent of units in which there

is a new tenant. The incidence of nominal rent rigidity among

continuing tenants is much greater than the fifteen percent that

Card and Hyslop report for nominal wage rigidity among their sample

of non-job changers for 1979-1992 from matched CPS data, or the

seven percent that Kahn reports for her similar, but earlier 1979-

1988 sample from the PSID.       In columns (4) - (6) of the same table,

the sample is restricted to units that obtained a new tenant in the

previous year.     The general pattern is always the same.

        Tables 2 and 4 present two different, but related aspects of

the behavior of rental growth rates.          For a complete picture, one

requires the empirical cumulative distribution function, which

Figure 3 displays, by year and by tenure status, for those units

that had turned over in the previous year.         The more lightly shaded

curve represents the distribution of turnover units.             There are

five noticeable aspects of this figure:         (i)   There is a large mass

at zero nominal change, larger for the non-turnover units but still

substantial for the turnover units.            (ii)   Above zero, the two

distributions differ in location only.         The median growth rate for

turnover units is about four percent greater than for other units.

Notwithstanding the greater nominal rigidity of the latter units,

the mean growth rate differential is also about four percent.

(iii)      Near   and   above   zero,   the   distributions   flatten   out,

                                                                          11
indicating few small positive changes.                (iv)    The lower tail of the

distributions are indistinguishable, except for the first two pairs

of years.       (v)     The non-turnover distribution is more stable over

time:      variations        in    the    location      differential    of    the    two

distributions is due to shifts in the turnover distribution.

       My interpretation of the differential in median growth rates

according to tenure is that when tenants remain a second year in

the    unit,        there   is    ex-post     surplus    in   the    tenant-landlord

relationship, so that the negotiated price differs from the market

price.    Furthermore, last year's nominal price represents a focal

point in       bargaining.         As    an   explanation     for   overall   nominal

rigidity this explanation is perhaps incomplete, as it appears not

to explain nominal rigidity among turnover units.                      But one would

expect bargaining there, too, (once landlord and potential tenant

meet there may be some ex-post surplus because of saved search

costs) and it is not unlikely that a new tenant will know last

year's price (as when the new tenant is acquaintated with the old).

Furthermore, we will see that most, and perhaps nearly all, of the

nominal rigidity among such units can be explained by grid pricing.

       Admittedly, an efficient turnover view of the housing market

undercuts the macroeconomic significance of a finding of nominal

rigidity.       For under this view, using last year’s rent for this

year     has        only    distributive,       and      no   allocative      effect.

Nevertheless,         one   suspects     that   if    individuals     allow   nominal

concerns       to    determine     distributional        outcomes,    which    are    as

                                                                                      12
important     to     them    as     allocative     ones    are,       that    nominal

considerations will affect allocative outcomes as well.

     An alternative explanation is that low rents are associated

with continuing tenants because existing tenants have the first

right of refusal on the offer.           Thus, according to this view, rents

determine turnover status.               Discriminating between these two

explanations is the concern of another paper, but I will briefly

indicate     why    I   think     the    alternative      explanation        is   less

convincing. Consider the simplest story along these lines that one

can tell about the first renewal discount:                 the landlord sets a

price equal to the area wide rental growth rate, plus some random

component.       We can think of this componenet as the landlord's

mistake;    an     equally   good    interpretation       is   that    it    reflects

differing discount rates or search costs among landlords.                     Tenants

lucky enough to have a landlord who sets a low price are more

likely to remain in the apartment.

     The story falters on the dynamic effects of the observed

tenure discount.        Not only is the rental growth rate 4 percent less

when the tenant continues on into a second year, it is another 5

percent less when he continues on into a third year - so that at

his second renewal date, a continuing tenant pays nine percent less

than the `market’ level.            Label the random component of the rent

level set by the landlord y and the tenant’s disutility of moving

x.   Assume that y is i.i.d., with distribution G, and that the

equilibrium      distribution       of   x   for   (potential)    first       renewal

                                                                                    13
tenants, F1, either stochastically dominates or is dominated by the

distribution of disutility from moving for (potential) second

renewal tenants, F2.     Thus either F1(x) # F2(x)for all x, or F1(x)

$ F2(x) for all x.     A tenant will stay if and only if y < x.     As

Table 4 showed, half of all tenants remain a second year, and two

thirds of those remain for a third year.     Thus by the alternative

hypothesis, IG(x)dF1(x) - IG(x)dF2(x) = .5 - .67 < 0, so, by my

assumption, F2 stochastically dominates F1.     The expected rent for

a type a tenant who stays after i years is EG[x | x # a]dFi(a), so

that the differential rent between second year tenants and third

year tenants is     EG[y | y # x]d{F1(x) - F2(x)}.   By the assumption

on stochastic dominance, this term must be negative.          But the

opposite is true for, as I said above, third year tenants pay 5

percent less than second year tenants.



1C.   Building Size

      Finally, the degree of nominal rigidity also varies with the

number of "living quarters, both occupied and vacant, ..., in [the]

house (building)".     Table 6 shows the incidence by building size.

We see that units in smaller buildings have a greater incidence of

nominal rigidity.     It is natural to associate the number of living

quarters in the building with the number of units owned by the

landlord.   A very natural explanation for this finding, then, is

that small landlords are less "professional" than large ones, so



                                                                    14
that nominal rigidity is a manifestation of “irrationality”.                That

grid pricing is also more prevalent in smaller buildings provides

some support for this interpretation.7

       Alternatively, one might argue that large landlords simply do

not bargain with their tenants, thus eliminating the old nominal

price as a possible outcome due to its role as a focal point.

Tenants do not bargain with large landlords for the same reasons

that       consumers   do   not   bargain    with   large   department   stores,

although they might with a small retailer, or in the shuk.                (These

reasons might include a strategic commitment to a price, or a

principal’s regulation of its agents, i.e., salespeople.)                If this

explanation for the differential behavior of large and small

landlords is the correct one, the finding has obvious implications

for the changing sensitivity of economies to nominal shocks as they

develop and large retailing units become more prevalent.



2.     Contractual vs. Non-Contractual Rigidity

       To what extent does the observed nominal rigidity reflect

fixed prices within a contract?             Clearly, none at all for turnover

units; the two reported rents are, by definition, from different



       7
      For example, among single detached homes, rents that are
not multiples of 5 are quoted only 5 percent of the time,
compared to 26 percent of the time among units in buildings of 50
or more units. The probit analysis in Section 6 shows that the
dependence of nominal rigidity on building size remains, even
when grid pricing is controlled for.

                                                                              15
contracts.   For non-turnover units, whether the quoted monthly

rents originate from different contracts or not is not observable.

Unfortunately, the AHS reports neither the term of the lease - or

even if there is a lease - nor the date of the interview.

     The Property Owners and Managers Survey (POMS), which was

administered to the owners or managers of a sample of units drawn

from the 1993 American Housing Survey sample, does report the term.

The POMS sample differs from the sample I use from the AHS not only

because of the difference in years, but also because, as the POMS

does not reveal the city, I cannot restrict the sample to the SMSAs

of the principle sample.    However, I do drop from the POMS sample

all units not in MSAs, and units under rent control or receiving a

government subsidy.

     Table 7 shows the distribution of lease terms, by building

size. Very few leases are for more than a year.8     A substantial

fraction, about fifteen percent, of units have no lease at all.   Of

the remainder, about half of all leases are for a year, and half

are for less a year.       Units in larger buildings are much more

likely to have a lease, and, conditional on having a lease, are




     8
      Hubert's (1995) adverse selection model suggests one
explanation for why there are so few leases longer than one year.
In this model, the term of the lease is used as a screening
device, since good tenants will be more willing to accept shorter
term leases - or even "tenant at will" status -, at lower rents,
than bad tenants.

                                                                  16
more likely to have a year-long lease.9

     If one could be sure that the AHS interview dates were a year

apart then, given the distribution of lease terms, one could

conclude that the quoted rents were almost surely from different

contracts.   Table 8, however, shows that the AHS is conducted in

the fall of the year over more than a one month period.   It is thus

conceivable that the interviews for a given unit were conducted

less than one year apart, and so, even with a one year lease,

within the same contractual period (although it is not conclusively

so, because the Census Bureau might have surveyed the units in the

same sequence in both years, and one suspects that most of the

interviewing is concentrated at the beginning of each period).    A

difference of less than one year between the two interview dates

would not alter the finding of nominal rigidity, only how much of

it can be ascribed to fixed nominal contracts.

     And yet the timing of interviews does not seem to be the

reason for the nominal rigidity finding.     First, note that the

reported interview periods for the 1974 and 1975 surveys overlap in

October only, whereas all the remaining pairs of years have a three

or four month overlap.     If a substantial part of the nominal

rigidity were due to less than full year interview gaps, we would

expect to see a much greater degree of nominal rigidity, twice or

     9
      Since units in larger buildings are more likely to have the
same lease covering both interviews, any bias resulting out of
the timing of the interviews cannot explain why they also have a
lower incidence of nominal rigidity.

                                                                 17
three times as much, in 1975-6 and subsequent years than in 1974-5.

Yet 1974-5 growth rates look very much like the rest.

     Second, our earlier result showing that nominal rigidity was

decreasing in the SMSA median growth rate can be used to bound any

bias.     There is no reason to suppose that the incidence of two

interview dates within the same lease period is at all dependant on

the median growth rate.    Thus the degree of nominal rigidity at the

highest median growth rate is an upper bound to the contribution of

within lease interviewing to observed nominal rigidity.          A glance

of Figure 3 shows that figure to be about 7 percent.

        That upper bound is far too high, however.         In columns (7)

through (9) of Table 5 the sample is restricted to units in which

the previous year's tenant originally moved in during the months of

January through July.      If leases are indeed yearly, or shorter,

then interviews for these units in the Fall will capture different

contracts.     Yet these columns display no reduction in nominal

rigidity.    In fact, none of the results change with the restricted

sample.

        The fourth piece of evidence on this point comes from the

micro level data that the Bureau of Labor Statistics collects in

constructing the CPI rent index.        The BLS uses a panel of housing

units for this, returning every six months to record the apartment

rent.     I have 1988-1992 data.      Over those years, the degree of

nominal    rigidity   measured   at   eighteen   month   intervals   is   37



                                                                          18
percent,10 which is higher than the 29% incidence that we document

here.

     Finally, one also observes nominal rigidity at two year

intervals in the AHS.          Ten percent of non-turnover units have the

same nominal rent in year t as in year t-2.             This is more than the

seven        percent   one   expect   were   nominal   rigidity    in    one   year

independent of nominal rigidity in the next.             Since only 3 percent

of leases are for more than a          year, most of these occurrences must

reflect rigidity across different contracts.

     Taken together, all these arguments suggest very strongly

that interview gaps of less than a year are not a serious concern,

and that one may safely assume that the reported rents originate

from different leases.



3.      Grid Pricing

        It is sometimes asserted that observed nominal rigidity is the

outcome of the restriction to pricing on a grid:                  that if prices

are rounded to the nearest multiple of ten, for example, then small

underlying shocks that would otherwise lead to a change in prices

of four dollars, say, will result in no nominal change.                 Since what

consequences this would have for monetary neutrality appears to be

an open question, it is important to determine the extent to which

        10
      Unfortunately, those data do not record building size and
the tenure status variable lumps together all duration longer
than six months, making further analysis of the data along the
lines of this paper impossible.

                                                                                 19
grid pricing is responsible for the incidence of nominal rigidity.11

     Grid pricing is clearly present. Columns (a) and (b) of Table

9 shows the distribution of the modulus terms in reported rents in

1975 and 1981, respectively.   For example, in 1975, 7.0 percent of

units had rents that were multiples of $100, and 8.4 percent had

rents that were multiples of $50, but not $100. I have ordered the

grid points in what seems a natural hierarchy; for example, where

there is a tendency to price at $10 intervals, there is also a

tendency to price at $25 intervals, but not necessarily vice versa.

Predictably, there is a shift in the distribution over time as

nominal prices and rents increase.    Whereas in 1975, 12.8 percent

were not multiples of $5, in 1981 only 8.2 percent were.

     Columns (a) and (b) overstate the extent of grid pricing. For

example, some fraction of units priced at $10 intervals reflect a

tendency to price at $5 intervals, not $10.     Columns (c) and (d)

adjust for that .12   We see that almost 65 percent of rents in 1975

     11
      Unfortunately, I have been unable to find any published
discussion of this issue. It seems to be a matter of oral debate
only.
     12
      Let p be the vector of data in column (a), and define the
matrix A = {   1 1/2     1/4 1/12 1/20 1/100
               0 1/2     1/4 1/12 1/20 1/100
               0    0    2/4 2/12 2/20 2/100
               0    0      0 8/12 8/20 8/100
               0    0      0     0 8/20 8/100
               0    0      0     0    0 80/100    }
Then column (c) is the solution to p=Ab. To understand A,
consider row 4 of A, which distributes prices on the $10 grid
among the three rounding rules that could yield such an observed
modulus of $10. These are the rule of rounding to the nearest $1
(of which the $10 grid provides 8 of its 100 points), a rule that

                                                                 20
were priced according to a $5 grid, and that pricing on a grid

coarser than $25 was quite rare.

     Grid pricing is associated with nominal rigidity.           Table 10

shows the incidence of nominal rigidity by grid point.                  The

incidence is increasing in the hierarchy: only 12 percent of units

on a $1 grid point $1 in 1974 had zero nominal growth over 1975-4,

compared to 39 percent of units on a $100 grid point.                  This

difference is, of course, understated, given the comment in the

above paragraph.

     Could grid pricing explain all of the price rigidity in this

market?   The answer must be no.      Grid pricing is relevant only to

small desired changes, and it is equally effective in turning both

desired increases and decreases into zero nominal changes.             The

comparison   between    the      empirical     and   the   counterfactual

distribution in the next section will make that argument clearer.



4.   Counterfactual Rent Growth Distributions

     In   this   section,   I   construct    counterfactual   rent   growth

distributions in order both to examine how rents would look without

nominal rigidity, and to ascertain how much of the rigidity is due



rounds to the nearest $5 (of which the $10 grid provides 8 of its
20 points) and a rule that rounds to the nearest $10 or $25 (of
which the $10 grid provides 8 of 12 points - under the assumption
that $25 is ranked above $10 in the hierarchy).



                                                                         21
to grid pricing.

     As noted in the introduction, the counterfactual distribution

is based on an assumption that the uncensored distribution is

symmetric.13         Symmetry can be justified on two grounds, as Card and

Hyslop point out.             First, most parametric distributions that one

might     use       are    symmetric,   such   as   the   normal.   Second,   the

distribution of changes are likely to be symmetric even when the

distribution of the levels is not; if Rt and Rt-1 have the same

distribution up to a location parameter, than the distribution of

dr will be symmetric.

     Using symmetry and the assumption of no censoring above the

median, I construct the counterfactual distribution Fc as

     FC(x)=               1 - FE(2med - x),    x < med

                =         1 - FE(x)      ,     x $ med

where FE is the empirical distribution and med=Fe-1(0).

     The first use of FC is to allocate the incidence of nominal

rigidity between units whose nominal rent would otherwise have

increased, which is XP / FE(0+)-FC(0) of the population of units, and

those whose rent would have decreased, which fraction is XN / FC(0)-



     13
      Khan (1998) assumes, in contrast, that uncensored
distributions from different years differ only in a location
parameter. This allows her to uses the location-corrected
distribution of a year with small nominal rigidity as a
counterfactual. The method is less useful here, since nominal
rigidity is high in all years and as I need a “continuous”
counterfactual distribution to predict the extent of grid
pricing.

                                                                               22
FE(0-).   Figures 3a and 3b overlay Fe (in bold) with Fc for 1975 and

1981, respectively. XP      is the length of the vertical line at 0

above FC(0), while XN     is the length of the line below FC(0).        The

results for all years are collected in Panel (a) of Table 11.

Column (1) shows FC(0), Column (2) presents the total observed

incidence, while Columns (3) and (4) shows XP and XN, respectively.

These two columns sum to column (2).          The table shows that while

some units with nominally rigid prices would otherwise have had

increased rents, in most cases the rent would have declined.

Overall, about two-thirds of the nominally rigid units would

otherwise have decreased in rents.

      How much of the nominal rigidity derives from grid pricing and

how much from downward rigidity?         Twice XP provides an upper bound

for the contribution under the following conditions: (a) a given

absolute desired price change leads to no nominal change because of

grid pricing with the same likelihood, regardless of the direction

of   change,    (b)   downward   rigid   prices   replace   desired   price

reductions only, and (c) the counterfactual distributions are

unimodal.      Given the figures just reported, this indicates that,

overall, at most two-thirds of the observed incidence is due to

grid pricing.

      A more precise estimate is possible, without assuming uni-

modality and using the counterfactual rent growth and the initial

rent level distribution, as well as the distribution of modulus


                                                                         23
terms from columns (c) and (d) from table 9. Let h(x;y) denote the

closest value on a y-dollar grid to x.               Then the observed rent

growth rate on a y-dollar grid, when the initial rent level is R

and the desired percentage growth rate is dr, is g(R,dr;y) =

ln[h(Redr ;y)] - lnR.         Calculate Fgpt,y(x)/ Prob{g(R,dr;y) # x} =

II1(g(R,dr;y)#    x}    dFct(dr)dGet(R),    where        Get    is   the    empirical

distribution of period t (level) rents.                    (I thus ignore any

dependence of dr on R).       Then the distribution of growth rates that

would be observed according to the prevalence of grid pricing,

given the counterfactual, is Fgpt(x) / 3B(y;t)Fgpt,y(x), where B(y;t)

is the adjusted probability of each grid point, as described in

footnote 12, and illustrated in Columns (3)-(4) of Table 9.

       Figures 4a and 4b add Fgp1975 and Fgp1981 (in bold) to Figures 3a

and 3b, respectively.         The 1980-81 results are appealing.                  Above

zero, and below the median, Fgp1981 comes quite close to reproducing

the empirical distribution. This is to be expected if grid pricing

is the only mechanism by which otherwise positive rent growth is

censored to zero.      Below zero, Fgp1981 falls below the counterfactual

distribution for values greater than -.05, and thereafter falls on

the    counterfactual.    The   1974-75    results       are     less   attractive,

because grid pricing indicates more censoring of otherwise positive

rent    growth   than    is     inferred   from      a         comparison    of     the

counterfactual and empirical distributions.               One suspects that the

relative low rates of rent increase is responsible for that, that



                                                                                     24
is, censoring occurs above the median.

     The predicted nominal rigidity from grid pricing alone is then

Fgpt(0+)-Fgpt(0-), which is shown in Column (5) of Table 11.   Column

(6) subtracts Column (5) from Column (2); this is the incidence of

nominal rigidity, net of the predicted amount from grid pricing.

We see that, overall, of the 29 percent incidence, only 11 percent

can not be explained by grid pricing.   This is somewhat higher than

the lower bound of nine percent obtained from subtracting twice XP

from Column (2).

     If one conditions on turnover status, an interesting pattern

emerges.   Panels (b) and (c) of Table 11 restrict the sample to

units that turned over in the previous period.   Panel (b)’s sample

is further restricted to units which did not turn over in the

current period, while panel (c) includes the units that did turn

over. Net of predicted rigidity due to grid pricing, the incidence

of nominal rigidity is 21 percent of the continuing units, while

only 3 percent among the turn over units.     In other words, grid

pricing can explain somewhat less than half of the nominal rigidity

observed among turnover, while it can explain almost all of it

among continuing units.



5.   Multivariate Analysis

     The single variate analysis thus far begs the question of

whether any of these relationships are spurious.        Because the


                                                                  25
sample size is not large enough to form cells of an adequate number

of observations in all cases, I consider the ad hoc expedient of a

probit analysis of nominal rigidity.

     Estimates from the probit regressions are presented in Table

12. The dependent variable takes the value 1 if the nominal growth

in rent is zero.     All the regressors are dummy variables, with the

dummy variables for a $1 grid point, a 50 or more unit building,

1980-1   and   a   turnover   unit    serving   as   the   omitted   dummies,

depending on the set of dummies included in each regression.             Each

of these values correspond to the cell with the lowest nominal

rigidity, as indicated in the previous tables.                Jointly, they

define a baseline case, whose probability of nominal rigidity is

given by the row labeled M(constant).

     The first three columns use the whole sample.               Column (1)

considers only the effect of the modulus t-1 rent.           Column (2) adds

dummy variables for the building size.          We see that both sets of

variables effect nominal rigidity.         Column (3) adds year dummies.

     The remaining columns restrict the sample to units that turned

over in the previous year.           Columns (4)-(6) repeat the earlier

analysis for the restricted sample.             Column (7) adds a dummy

variable for units that did not turn over.            The constant term in

that Column indicates that (i) in 1981 (when median rents were

increasing at 7 percent), a unit (ii) in a 50 plus unit building

(iii) which turned over that year, and (iv) for which the previous

year’s price was set on a grid no coarser than one dollar, had only

                                                                           26
a two percent probability of having an unchanged nominal rent.

Given that none of these variables should be correlated with within

lease interviewing, we can once more conclude that observed nominal

rigidity is not an artifact of within term interviewing, along the

lines of the second point in Section 2.

     If the unit was detached, instead, the probability of nominal

rigidity would increase to 12 percent; if it did not turn over, the

probability would be six percent more than the baseline case.    A

unit that was both detached and did not turn over, would have an

incidence of nominal rigidity of 28 percent.   If, in addition, the

previous year’s price was set on a $100 grid, the probability would

double to 56 percent.   Thus, we see that the previous findings are

not the results of spurious correlations.      Each factor effects

nominal rigidity in the same way that was demonstrated earlier,

even when controlling for the others.

     Finally, we can use the probit estimates to predict the degree

of nominal rigidity we would observe in the absence of grid

pricing.   This approach has the advantage over constructing a

counterfactual distribution with grid pricing, in that it places

grid pricing and any remaining determinants of nominal rigidity on

an equal footing.   In Table 11, in contrast, nominal rigidity that

would have arisen both because of grid pricing and because the unit

was in a small building, say, is allocated to grid pricing.

     To get the predicted incidence of nominal rigidity, net of

grid pricing, I sum over the predicted probabilities obtained when

                                                                27
the grid point dummies in Table 12 are all set equal to zero, and

all other variables set to their actual values. The mean predicted

incidence is presented in the last rows of the table.   As expected,

these are somewhat higher than the values shown in Column (6) of

Table 11.    Over all years, we see that the predicted net incidence

is 16 percent in the whole sample (compared to 11 percent from

Table 11).     On the sub-sample of units that turned over in the

previous period, it is 20 percent among the continuing units and,

and 7 percent among those that turned over, (compared to 19 percent

and 3 percent from Table 11).



6.   Other Margins

     The rent is not the only means by which the overall terms of

trade between tenant and landlord might be altered.     They are also

determined by the assignment of responsibility for payment of

utilities.     As an instrument for splitting the surplus between

landlord and tenant, this is a poor substitute for the rent, of

course.     Not only is it coarser than a change in the rent itself

can be, but efficiency considerations will dictate their own

assignment. In an efficient contract, which party pays the heating

bill will depend on the monitoring cost, the price of the fuel and

the elasticity of the demand for heating.    The rent is the natural

instrument to distribute the surplus.    Nonetheless, there are two

grounds on which to investigate whether these provisions are used



                                                                  28
as well.       First, were nominal rigidity in the rent accompanied by

offsetting changes to other terms of the contract between the

landlord and the tenant, its macroeconomic consequences might be

altered. Second, it would be useful to know if such inefficiencies

arise out of nominal rigidity.           Where there is nominal illusion,

there may be inefficient contracts as well. Nominal illusion might

lead to inefficiency in this way.14

       Table 13 (14) shows the proportion of units in which the

tenant pays the electricity (gas) bill according to whether the

nominal rent changes or not, and according to which party bore the

responsibility in the previous year.            The rows titled “All Units”

show that there is little year to year change in the assignment of

responsibility for paying the fuel bills.           The greater likelihood

of a transition from the landlord paying the utility bill to the

tenant than vice versa can be explained by the increase in fuel

prices during this period, as well as the fact that installing

monitoring equipment is a sunk investment.

       When the tenant was previously responsible for the electricity

bill, the total real housing cost to the renter can be reduced by

more    than    the   inflation   rate   when   keeping   the   nominal   rent

       14
      The quality-adjusted price can also be changed by altering
the level of maintenance. Likewise, as long as the quality of
the unit is not a perfect substitute for “other goods” (money),
there will be an efficient level of maintenance. I consider
changes in the assignment of responsibility to pay utilities but
not changes in quality, because the former is an objective,
whereas the latter, as reported by the tenant, will be very
subjective.

                                                                            29
unchanged by levying the electricity bill on the landlord instead.

But the left panel of Table 13 shows that reallocation occurring in

a mere half a percent of the cases in which the nominal rent is

unchanged; furthermore, that is fewer than the proportion of cases

when the nominal rent does change, which is one and a half percent.

Likewise, when the electricity bill was previously paid by the

landlord, the total real housing cost to the renter can be reduced

by less than the inflation rate, or even increased, when keeping

the nominal rent unchanged by levying the electricity bill on the

tenant instead.      That is done in only six percent of the relevant

cases; again, this is less often than when there is a nominal

change.

     In this discussion, I have described Table 13 only, but the

reader can see that the assignment of responsibility to pay gas

bills follows the same basic patterns.               These results clearly

indicate that changes in the assignment of responsibility to pay

the utility bills do not compensate for nominal rigidity, and, if

anything, are complementary to it.



7.   Conclusion

     This    paper   has   shown   that     there   is   substantial   nominal

rigidity    in   apartment   rents,   and    that   it   varies   in   definite

patterns. This finding gives credence to macroeconomic models that

rely on such rigidities to explain aggregate economic fluctuations.



                                                                             30
About half of the incidence can be attributed to grid pricing.   It

is an open question whether the macroeconomic consequences of

nominal rigidity are dependent on grid pricing or not.

     Although I have motivated this paper by the macro literature

on price stickiness, there are obvious microeconomic issues as

well.   Even if grid pricing does not lead to price rigidity at the

macro level, it is still interesting at the micro level as a

manifestation of “irrationality”.    Also at the micro level, the

difference between the incidence levels among new and continuing

tenants suggests that the old nominal price is a focal point in

bargaining.   This implies that nominal values have distributive

consequences. They will have allocative consequences as well, when

bargaining is not efficient.

Since the median growth rate in nominal rent for 1974-75 and 1975-76 was zero
for continuing units, no counterfactual and so no allocation among otherwise
positive or negative rents and no calculation of grid pricing incidence was
possible.
