                                           ABSTRACT

Using an original data set of both scientific articles and patents pertaining to alternative energy
technologies, this paper provides new evidence on the flows of knowledge between university,
private sector, and government research. Better understanding of the value of knowledge from
these institutions can help decision makers target R&D funds where they are most likely to be
successful. I use citation data from both scientific articles and patents to answer two questions.
First, what information is most useful to the development of new technology? Does high quality
science lead to commercial success? I find that this is the case, as those articles most highly cited
by other scientific articles are also more likely to be cited by future patents. Second, which
institutions produce the most valuable research? Are there differences across technologies?
Research performed at government institutions appears to play an important translational role
linking basic and applied research, as government articles are more likely to be cited by patents
than any other institution, including universities. Universities play a less important role in wind
research than for solar and biofuels, suggesting that wind energy research is at a more applied
stage where commercialization and final product development is more important than basic
research.

1. Introduction

        Developing new and improved clean-energy technologies is an important part of any

strategy to combat global climate change. For example, generation of electricity and heat is the

largest source of carbon emissions, accounting for 42 percent of carbon emissions worldwide in

2012 (IEA 2014). Meeting the climate policy goals currently under consideration, such as

European Union discussions to reduce emissions by 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030 or the

U.S. Clean Power Plan goal of reducing emissions from the electricity sector by 32 percent by

2030, will not be possible without replacing much of the current fossil fuels-based electric

generating capacity with alternative, carbon-free energy sources.

        Because clean energy technologies are usually not competitive with fossil fuels without

policy support (Greenstone and Loney, 2012), a large academic literature has emerged evaluating

the role of environmental policy for fostering clean energy innovation. Much of this research

focuses on the private sector, showing that both higher energy prices and targeted support for

renewable energy, such as feed-in tariffs or renewable portfolio standards, lead to increases in

clean energy patents. 1

        Even when environmental regulations encourage private sector innovation, firms will

focus research efforts on technologies that are closest to market (Johnstone et al. 2010). Yet, one

challenge facing many climate-friendly innovations is the long time-frame from the initial

invention to successful market deployment. Consider, for instance, the case of solar energy.

Despite research efforts that began during the energy crises of the 1970s, solar is still only cost

competitive without policy support in niche markets, such as remote off-grid locations. This

leaves a role for government-sponsored R&D to fill in the gaps, particularly in the case of

climate change, where a diversified energy portfolio will be necessary to meet currently

proposed emission reduction targets. Recognizing this need, during the December 2015 Paris

climate meetings, a coalition of governments pledged to double their renewable energy R&D

budgets to $20 billion over the next five years (Davenport and Wingfield, 2015).

         While many studies have looked at private sector energy R&D, fewer papers address the

effectiveness of public sector clean energy R&D. Those that do typically find a positive effect of

public R&D on patenting (e.g. Johnstone et al 2010, Verdolini and Gaelotti 2011, Dechezleprêtre

and Glachant 2014, Nesta et al. 2014). However, these studies typically include just a single

lagged value of energy R&D, raising questions about what is truly identified. 2

         To better ascertain the effectiveness of public energy research, Popp (2016) links data on

scientific publications to public energy R&D funding. For evaluating public research funding

efforts, publication data provide a more appropriate outcome measure than patents. By looking

at the effect of public R&D funding on scientific articles, Popp (2016) isolates the effect of

public R&D to shed light on the process through which public R&D helps develop scientific

knowledge. As the ultimate goal of government energy R&D funding is not an article, but rather

a new technology, Popp uses citations to link these articles to new energy patents. While public

funding does lead to new articles, lags in both the creation of a new publication and the transfer

of this knowledge to applied work mean that public R&D spending takes several years to go

from new article to new patent.

         While Popp (2016) focuses on the time it takes for the results of public R&D to be cited

by a new patent, this paper extends that work by providing more detail on the knowledge flows

between published and patented clean energy research. Given recent calls for more public


2
 A partial exception is Peters et al. (2012), who state that they test multiple lags and stocks of public R&D in
unreported results.

                                                                                                                   2
energy R&D efforts, such as the aforementioned pledges at the December 2015 Paris climate

meetings, identifying the investments most valuable to further advancing energy research can

help decision makers target R&D funds towards both the technologies and institutions where

they are most likely to be successful. This paper uses citation data from both scientific articles

and patents to answer two questions:

       1) What information is most useful to the development of new technology? Does high

quality science lead to commercial success? That is, are scientific articles cited frequently by

other articles also more likely to be cited by patents, or are the types of articles cited by patents

different from those cited by articles? Popp (2016) argues that there is room to expand public

R&D budgets, as there is little change in either the quantity of published research or the quality,

as measured by citations, after large increases in public energy R&D. But, are citations within

the published literature an appropriate measure of the relevance of this published research for

applied work? In Section 3, I show that highly cited journal articles do receive more citations by

patents, suggesting that counts of journal-to-journal citations are a good indicator of the ultimate

value of an article for technology development.

       2) Which institutions produce the most valuable research? Are there differences across

technologies? Using patent and article citations as a measure of knowledge flows, in section 4 I

ask which institutions provide the most useful building blocks for future researchers. Do

collaborations between public and private research organizations increase flows of knowledge

among groups? As governments prepare to expand renewable energy R&D, such evidence can

inform where public research funds can best be targeted. While government research efforts are

often criticized as wasteful, I find that government patents are cited more frequently by

researchers than other patents, and that government research articles are more likely to be cited



                                                                                                        3
by future patents. Thus, government research does appear to play an important translational role

linking basic and applied research. Universities play a less important role in wind research than

for solar and biofuels, suggesting that wind energy research is at a more applied stage where

commercialization and final product development is more important than basic research.



2. Data

        In this paper, I use scientific articles to represent trends in more basic upstream research

and I use patents to represent trends in more applied downstream research and product

development. The article data come from the Thomson Reuters Web of Science Core Collection

database. Using a series of keyword searches of article titles, abstracts, and keywords, provided

in Appendix Table A1, I identified journal publications for each of three technologies: biofuels,

solar energy, and wind energy. 3 I focus on publications in scientific journals by dropping

articles such as reviews, editorials, or news items. I do include proceedings papers that are

included in the Web of Science Core Collection database. The article data run from 1991-2011,

as complete records of titles, abstracts, and keywords are first available in 1991.                      Having

identified appropriate keywords, Thomson Reuters provided a custom database containing all

articles from 1991-2011 for each technology. The database includes descriptive information on

each paper, including the date of publication and addresses for each author, which I use to assign

articles to each country. For each technology, articles are aggregated by year of publication and

country. In the case of articles with multiple authors from multiple countries, I use weighted

counts, assigning articles proportionately by the number of countries represented. For example,

an article with 2 US authors and 1 Japanese author counts as 0.67 for the US and 0.33 for Japan.

3
 The choice of technologies follows from Popp (2016). There, a key factor limiting relevant technologies was the
availability of a sufficient time series of public R&D spending on each technology. In addition, given concerns
about climate change, the research focuses on alternative energy technologies rather than fossil fuels.

                                                                                                                   4
In addition, the database also includes descriptive data on each article citing these energy

articles.

        When developing keyword searches, there is a tradeoff between using broad searches that

identify as many relevant articles as possible but also include some irrelevant articles or using

narrower searches that filter out irrelevant articles but may miss some relevant ones. I devised

searches that would be narrow, so as to avoid irrelevant articles. As such, my database does not

necessarily include, for example, every article related to wind energy published since 1991.

However, as long as there is no change in the share of relevant articles identified over time, my

results will still be an unbiased indicator of the effect of trends in alternative energy research.

This simply requires assuming that the searches consistently identify a fixed percentage of wind

articles published in any given year. In contrast, using broader search terms that identified more

wind articles but also included irrelevant articles would require assuming that the irrelevant

articles responded in the same way as actual wind publications included in the sample.

        As the ultimate goal of clean energy research is a new technology, I link my publication

data to patent data, which reflect the output of applied research efforts. Patents contain citations

to scientific articles, allowing direct linkages to be made. Moreover, recent work by Roach and

Cohen (2013) shows that references to non-patent literature (NPL) such as journal articles are

better measures of knowledge flows from public research to patents than are citations to other

patents. Sorenson and Fleming (2004) compare forward patent citations received by patents that

cite or do not cite published materials. Those patents citing previously published non-patent

literature receive more citations and are cited more quickly than other patents. Thus, focusing on

the flow of knowledge between articles and patents highlights research contributing to the most

influential patents.



                                                                                                  5
       The major challenge for this analysis is linking the article data to patents. Due to data

constraints, the patent citation analysis focuses on citations made by U.S. patents. Using the

International Patent Classification (IPC) system to identify patents pertaining to specific

technologies, I identify patents related to biofuels, solar energy, and wind. Appendix Table A2

presents the list of IPC technologies used. Data on relevant patents come from the on-line

database provided by Delphion (http://www.delphion.com/). I obtained both patent and NPL

references for these patents, identifying those patents referencing journal articles. As there is no

standard form for citing articles in a patent, matching articles and patents was done manually.

To be consistent with the article data, I track patenting trends over time using the grant year of

the patents.

       [FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE]

       [FIGURE 2 ABOUT HERE]

       Figures 1 and 2 show the overall trends in patents and scientific articles, respectively.

Both have increased over time, due in part to increased public energy R&D funding (Popp 2016)

and new renewable energy policy mandates (Johnstone et al., 2010). For biofuels, counts of

articles have grown faster than patents, while the opposite is true for wind. Appendix Figures

A1-A6 present trends for the top five countries in each technology. The increase in solar energy

patents during the early 2000s is due to an increase in solar energy patents in Japan, which is

second to only the US for total solar energy patents. Table 1 shows the ten countries with the

most patents and articles for each technology. For patents, the top ten is dominated by high

income countries, with just a few exceptions (India for biofuels, albeit with just 7.25 patents, and

Taiwan for solar and wind). In contrast, emerging countries appear more frequently on the list of

top scientific article sources. China is second to only the US in both biofuels and solar energy



                                                                                                  6
articles, and sixth for wind. India is third for biofuels and sixth for solar. Brazil is fourth for

biofuels. Thus, these emerging economies are performing research on renewable energy, but this

research appears less likely to translate into patentable end use technologies, at least for

innovations of sufficient value to be patented in the United States.

       [TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE]

       [TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE]

       Table 2 provides basic summary statistics for the number of citations received by each

patent or article. The top section provides data on article-to-article citations, the middle section

on patent-to-patent citations, and the bottom on patent-to-article citations. Note that there are

many more articles than patents for each of the technologies. Thus, not surprisingly, the average

number of article-to-article citations is also largest. Interestingly, while there are twice as many

solar energy articles as biofuels articles in my sample, the average number of citations received

is similar. Note as well that citations are highly skewed. For both article and patent citations,

the mean citations is larger than the median, and is comparable for biofuels and solar to the 75th

percentile. Many patents receive no citations, with the median being 0 for biofuels, and just one

for solar and wind.

       Articles receiving citations from renewable energy patents occurs much less frequently.

Thus, in the bottom section, I provide descriptive statistics for both all articles and for the subset

of articles that do receive at least one patent citation. Just 0.66% of all biofuels articles, 1.31%

of solar articles, and 1.14% of wind articles receive even one patent citation.            Moreover,




                                                                                                    7
conditional on receiving a citation, the median article receives just one patent citation. The

average number of citations received is two or less. 4



3. Do highly cited articles generate applied technology?

         Does high quality science lead to commercial success? While researchers commonly

used citations as a proxy for article quality, are scientific articles cited frequently by other

articles also more likely to be cited by patents? Or, are the articles that inventors of new

technology find useful different from those that other academic researchers find useful? For

example, might there be “intermediary” publications that link the results of basic science to

applied technologies but are not highly cited by other journal articles?                          To address these

questions, in this section I ask whether highly cited scientific articles (e.g. those more likely to be

cited by other articles) are also more likely to be cited by future patents.

         As many articles have had only a few years to be cited, truncation of the data is a

concern. Because of these truncation issues, and because most articles are only cited by a patent

once, I use a hazard model to focus on the probability of an article ever receiving a patent

citation. To allow time for articles to be cited, I only consider articles published in 2009 or

earlier. The patent data extends through 2011. The main variable of interest is the total number

of citations each potentially cited article received through 2011 from other journal articles. This

variable tests whether the same articles are cited by both journals and patents. To control for

other factors affecting the probability of citation, the model also includes the citation lag

(calculated using the publication year of both the cited article and citing patent), a set of country

by cited year fixed effects (denoted YCi,t in the equation below), which control for the different

4
  Low citation rates occur partially because many articles appear at the end of the sample, so there is less time for
them to be cited. However, even for articles published earlier in the sample period, citation rates are less than ten
percent (Popp 2016).

                                                                                                                        8
opportunities for future citations available to articles from different countries and from different

times, and a dummy variable to control for articles with authors from multiple countries. As I

explicitly model the effect of time using the citation lag, I use an exponential baseline hazard to

model the probability of article i receiving a citation in year t:

(1)      ℎ(𝑖, 𝑡) = exp(𝛼0 + 𝛼1 𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑙𝑎𝑔 + 𝛼2 𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑙𝑎𝑔2 + 𝛼3 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 +

𝛼4 𝑚𝑢𝑙𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑦 + 𝛄𝐘𝐂𝐢,𝐭 )

In each regression, standard errors are clustered by article.

         While the intent of the country-by-year dummies is to control for changing citation

opportunities, a possible concern is that the total citations received is nonetheless endogenous.

For example, both alternative energy articles and patents are likely to appear shortly after major

policy changes that promote alternative energy. As a result, opportunities for receiving citations

both from other articles and from patents will increase. To address this possibility, I also

consider a two-step procedure. First, I use a negative binomial regression to predict the total

citations received by each article. Second, I replace totalcitations in equation (1) with a quality

index derived from this regression, as described below.

         To predict the total citations received by each article, I use a negative binomial regression

that includes publication year fixed effects, a dummy variable for articles with authors from

multiple countries, and the cumulative number of publications in the country of article i’s origin

between the article’s publication year and 2011. Since citations are more likely between articles

from the same country, this value proxies for the citation opportunities available for article i. 5

For each article i from country j published in year t, I model total citations as:. 6

(2)      𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑖,𝑗,𝑡 = 𝑓(#𝑑𝑜𝑚𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑝𝑢𝑏𝑙𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑗,𝑡 , 𝑚𝑢𝑙𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑦, 𝐘𝐄𝐀𝐑 𝐅𝐈𝐗𝐄𝐃 𝐄𝐅𝐅𝐄𝐂𝐓𝐒)

5
 Note that the year fixed effects account for remaining citing opportunities from foreign publications.
6
 Note that I do not also include a cumulative count for publications from other countries, as these are controlled for
by the year fixed effects.

                                                                                                                     9
where #domesticpublicationsj,t represents the cumulative number of publications in the country

of origin between the publication year t and 2011. There is a separate observation for each author

country represented on an article. I use weighted regression to weight each observation by the

share of authors from that country, so that articles with multiple authors do not receive more

weight than other articles.

          Using equation (2), for each article I then calculate the probability that the predicted

citations are less than or equal to the actual citations received, which I multiply by 100 to create

a quality index for each article. 7 This quality index can be interpreted similarly to an error term

from a linear regression, with the advantage that it is bounded by 0 and 100. In the second step

of my two-step procedure, I replace the actual count of total citations in equation (1) with this

quality index.

          Table 3 provides descriptive statistics on both the actual journal article citations receive

and the quality index, which helps illustrate the intuition of the quality index. An article with

more citations than expected given its characteristics (publication year and future citation

opportunities from articles in the same country) will have a quality index close to 100, whereas

an article receiving fewer citations than expected will receive a quality index close to 0. For

each technology, the mean quality index is near 50. Actual citations are skewed, with a median

value about half of the mean for each technology. Similarly, the median quality index is also

lower than the mean, but by a much smaller amount. The table also shows actual citations and

the quality index for various percentiles. At each percentile, the quality index is generally

similar in value to that percentile (e.g. the median quality index is close to 50). Consistent with

the skewed nature of the data, the 25th percentile of the quality index is slightly larger than 25,

and the 75th percentile of the quality index is slightly lower than 75.

        [TABLE 3 ABOUT HERE]

        Finally, to allow for possible non-linear effects of article quality on NPL citations, I also

run regressions replacing the actual number of citations received (or the quality index) with a set

of dummy variables for whether the actual citations (or quality index) are in the (1) 50th-75th

percentile, (2) 75th-90th percentile, (3) 90th-95th percentile, or (4) 95th-100th percentile.

        Table 4 presents results for the regressions using actual values, and Table 5 the results

from regressions using percentile dummy variables. For the exponential hazard model, exp(β)-1

gives the marginal effect of either one additional citation (columns 1-3) or a one-unit increase in

the quality index (columns 4-6). Table 4 shows that articles receiving more citations from other

journal publications are also more likely to be cited by subsequent patents. An additional journal

citation raises the probability of receiving a patent citation by 0.2% (solar) to 1.7% (wind). The

larger magnitude for wind is primarily due to wind articles receiving fewer article citations on

average than biofuels or solar. Similarly, a 10 percent increase in the quality index of an article

(a bit less than one-half of a standard deviation of each index) increases the probability of

receiving a patent citation by 22% (wind) to 33% (solar).

        [TABLE 4 ABOUT HERE]

        [TABLE 5 ABOUT HERE]

        Table 5 shows that the effects of article quality on receiving a patent citation are non-

linear. Compared to articles with citations or a quality index below the median, those in the 50th-

75th percentile are generally 60-80% more likely to receive a patent citation, but results are

statistically significant at a 5 percent level only for solar energy articles. Beyond the 75th

percentile, results are statistically significant at the five percent level for all technologies, with

the exception of the quality index for wind articles. There, it is not until the 90th percentile


                                                                                                   11
quality index that I observe a statistically significant impact on the probability of receiving a

patent citation. Most importantly, in the highest percentiles, the increased probability of citation

is large. Articles in the 90th-95th percentile for either actual publications or the quality index are

292-569 percent more likely to be cited by a patent. In the 95th-100th percentile, articles are 480-

799% more likely to be cited by a patent.

         These results suggest that the same articles that are perceived as important by other

authors of journal publications (as indicated by larger citation counts from other articles) are also

perceived important by inventors, who cite these articles more frequently on related patents.

Given that many articles are never cited by patents, the skewed nature of the results in Table 5

are of particular interest, as it is indeed the highest quality articles (as perceived by other authors)

that are also cited by patents. Since the ultimate goal of research on alternative energy sources is

to develop new technologies, these results indicate that counts of journal-to-journal citations are

a good indicator of the ultimate quality of an article. 8



4. Knowledge flows across institutions

         Having validated the use of citation data as a measure of article quality, I now use these

citation data to examine both the quality of articles and patents across different research

organizations and the flow of knowledge across these institutions. The key assumption is that

institutions producing more widely cited research output are generating research of greater value




8
  A possible concern is that being cited by a patent changes the probability of being cited by other articles (Murray
and Stern, 2007). To check for this possibility, I also ran regressions using the cumulative citations received through
year t-1, rather than total citations received. The results for citations and the quality index were similar to those
presented above, suggesting that changing citation behavior is not a problem in my sample. However, unlike the
results presented here, the citation lag coefficients change when using predicted, rather than actual citations. Since
cumulative citations are growing over time, this result suggests that using cumulative citations also picks up a time
effect.

                                                                                                                   12
to future researchers. 9 I consider five types of research organizations: universities, governments

(e.g. government laboratories), research institutes, private companies, and other organizations

(including individual inventors). 10 To assess whether collaborations between different types of

institutions encourage additional technology transfer, I classify collaborations between two or

more institution types as a separate category. To further focus on technology transfer from the

public to private sector, I distinguish between collaborations that include a private firm as one of

the institutions from collaborations between two or more non-private institutions (e.g., academic

and government). As organizations are identified based on author affiliations and patent

assignees, the focus is on organizations performing research, not funding research. For example,

government research only includes publications with government organization affiliates, such as

U.S. Department of Energy laboratories. Research funded by governments and performed at

universities are considered university research. The data provide evidence as to where public

R&D funds can be targeted to best encourage the transfer of knowledge from more basic science

to applied technology work.

4.1. Descriptive data on research institutions

         Before evaluating citations between research institutions, it is important to know where

both patented and published energy research comes from. Figures 3 and 4 show the breakdown

of scientific articles and patents by organization. Appendix Figures A7-A12 provide separate

breakdowns for US and foreign publications. Not surprisingly, universities account for most


9
  Jaffe, Fogarty, and Banks (1998) investigate the validity of this assumption, using evidence from patent-to-patent
citations made to NASA patents. They conclude that, although there is noise in the citation process, aggregate
citation patterns represent knowledge spillovers, although the spillover may be indirect. Jaffe and de Rassenfosse
(2016) provide a recent review of the literature using patent citations as a proxy for the economics value of patented
research.
10
   Organizations for articles are based on the affiliations of each author listed on the paper. Articles with multiple
authors are weighted in the same way as described earlier for country affiliation. For patents, the organization is the
patent assignee. Organization coding used a combination of text-based logic (e.g. “University of…”) and Internet
searches to identify organization types not clear from the organization name.

                                                                                                                    13
scientific articles, providing between 60 and 66% of articles for each technology. Universities

patent renewable energy technologies less frequently. However, university patents are relatively

more prevalent for biofuels, perhaps indicating the importance of genetic research to new

patentable biofuel technologies. 12.4% of biofuel patents are assigned to universities, compared

to just 2.5% for solar and 1.5% for wind. As shown in Appendix Figure A8, this is almost

entirely due to U.S. university patenting activity. 17.3% of biofuel patents assigned to US

inventors come from universities, whereas just 3.6% of patents assigned to foreign inventors

come from universities. Similarly, for both biofuels and wind (Table A11), while the share of

US patents assigned to universities is somewhat lower than the share of foreign patents, the share

of collaborative patents is higher. Technology transfer between research institutions appears

more successful in the U.S. than elsewhere. This is consistent with earlier research on energy

patents in the U.S. suggesting technology transfer improved after policy efforts such as the Bayh-

Dole Act (encouraging university patenting) and the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1980

(Popp 2006, Jaffe and Lerner 2001).

       [FIGURE 3 ABOUT HERE]

       [FIGURE 4 ABOUT HERE]

       Private companies are the primary source for patents, although with a much larger range

(55% for wind, compared to 72% for solar). In contrast, companies author just two to three

percent of all scientific articles. However, collaboration is more common for scientific articles,

as another six to nine percent of articles are collaborative efforts that include a private company

author. Collaborations never make up more than 1.5% of patents for any technology.

       The importance of government authors and inventors varies by technology. For scientific

articles, government authors provide 3.8% (wind) to 6.4% (biofuels) of all articles. For patents,



                                                                                                14
the range is much larger, with just 1.5% of wind patents assigned to the government, compared

to 5.1% for solar and 11.6% for biofuels. Finally, for wind, just over 40% of patents are not

assigned to any organization type. Most of these are patents assigned to an individual inventor.

       Table 6 breaks down the share of articles receiving a patent citation by organization type.

The left columns consider all citations, whereas the right columns exclude self-citations.

Articles written by corporate authors are most likely to be cited by both solar and wind patents,

even after removing self-citations. Government articles are next most likely to be cited by a

patent, and are most likely to be cited by biofuel patents. Interestingly, despite being the most

common source of articles, the share of university articles cited by a patent is always below the

average for all articles, even after removing self-citations.

       [TABLE 6 ABOUT HERE]

       Finally, Tables 7 and 8 provide descriptive data on the number of article-article and

patent-patent citations by organization type. For biofuels and wind, government articles receive

the most citations per article. For solar, it is collaborations including a private sector author that

receive the most. Interestingly, company articles receive the second most citations per article in

solar energy, whereas company articles receive less citations than average in biofuels and wind.

Not surprisingly, given the large number of university articles, citations per article for

universities are near the overall mean for each technology. I observe similar trends for patents,

with government patents receiving the most citations per patent for biofuels and wind, while

company patents receive the most citations in solar energy.

       [TABLE 7 ABOUT HERE]

       [TABLE 8 ABOUT HERE]




                                                                                                   15
4.2. Regression Analysis

         While these descriptive data provide an initial indication of both the level of research

activity and the importance of research emerging from different institutions, they do not control

for other factors that may influence citations. For example, Appendix Figures A13-A18 show

how the distribution of organizations has changed over time. For all three technologies, the

share of university articles increases in the second half of the sample. As this is also the time of

greatest publication activity, many university articles have thus had fewer opportunities to be

cited than other articles. Thus, to study flows of knowledge across institutions, it is important to

control for the opportunities a publication has to be cited. 11

         Following Jaffe and his co-authors (Caballero and Jaffe 1993, Jaffe and Trajtenberg

1996, 1999), I create groups of publications based on the year of publication, the organization(s)

represented on the publication, and the country of origin. This allows me to study flows of

knowledge across pairs of cited/citing publication categories. Using the subscripts CTD and

CTG to represent the cited and citing cohorts, respectively, the probability of citation, p, for

publications within each citing/cited cohort pair is:

                                                       cCTD ,CTG
(3)                                   pCTD,CTG =                     .
                                                    (nCTD )(nCTG )

Here, n represents the number of publications in a cohort and c the total number of citations

between publications in each cohort pair.

         To estimate the likelihood of citation for various groups of publications, I use the model

developed by Jaffe and his co-authors to control for factors affecting the likelihood of citation.

The probability that a publication in potentially cited cohort CTD receives a citation from a


11
  For ease of exposition, I use “publication” to refer to either the publication of a US patent or of a scientific article,
as the citation model is used to analyze both article and patent citations.

                                                                                                                        16
publication in potentially citing cohort CTG is a function of the characteristics of the citing and

cited publication groups, α(CTD,CTG), and the time that has passed since the initial publication.

Using β1 to represent the rate of decay of knowledge as it becomes obsolete, and β2 for the rate at

which newly produced knowledge diffuses, the probability of citation is written as:

(4)      p(CTG,CTD) = α(CTD,CTG)exp[-β1(tCTG-tCTD)][1-exp(-β2(tCTG-tCTD+1))]+ε.

         α(CTD,CTG) represents the effect of various publication cohort characteristics on the

citation probability. Adding one to the lag between citing and cited patents for the rate of

diffusion ensures that patents can possibly be cited in the first year. I control for the following:

             •    the technology category (biofuels, solar, or wind)

             •    the organization of both the cited and citing publication

             •    the country of origin of the cited and citing publication 12

             •    the year of publication of the citing cohort 13

         For example, one possible citing-cited cohort includes citations made by US solar energy

patents assigned to corporations and granted in 2010 to US solar energy patents assigned to

universities and granted in 2005. Another such cohort would include citations made by US solar

energy patents assigned to the government and granted in 2008 to Japanese solar energy patents

assigned to corporations and granted in 2000.

         In this paper, the effect of the citing and cited organization is of primary interest. Note

that α enters the model multiplicatively, so that the null hypothesis of no effect corresponds with


12
   The countries considered vary by publication type to focus on those countries most prevalent in the data. For
patents, country categories include Canada, Japan, the U.S., Denmark, Germany, Great Britain, Spain, other
European Patent Office members, and all other countries. For articles, country categories are Canada, China, Japan,
the US, Denmark, Germany, Spain, Turkey, other European Patent Office members, and all other countries. For
patents citing articles, I only distinguish between US and foreign articles and patents. Due to the smaller number of
article/patent citations, most cohort pairs include zero citations if finer distinctions of the data are used.
13
   As the model also includes the lag between citing and cited documents, I do not separately include the publication
year of the cited document, since that is a function of the lag and the citing year.

                                                                                                                  17
a value of 1, not 0. For purposes of identification, one α parameter of each type is normalized to

1. Thus, for any cohort characteristic, an estimate of α(CTD,CTG) greater than one means a

citation is more likely (compared to the normalized base category) when a publication with

characteristic j is part of the citing/cited cohort. Similarly, an estimate of α(CTD,CTG) less than

one means a citation is less likely. I estimate equation (4) using non-linear least squares.

Because the data are grouped, I weight each observation by        (nCTD )(NCTG )   to avoid problems

with heteroskedasticity.

       [TABLE 9 ABOUT HERE]

       I estimate separate models for article-to-article, patent-to-patent, and patent-to-article

citations. Table 9 shows the result of my main specification. Columns 1-3 provide results

excluding self-citations, and columns 4-6 include self-citations. Column 1 shows results for

article-to-article citations, column 2 for patent-to-patent citations, and column 3 for patent-to-

article citations. The pattern repeats for columns 4-6. In all cases, university articles or patents

are the base category. Recall that, since the model is multiplicative, the base category is

normalized to one. For example, looking at cited institutions, the coefficient of 0.858 for

government articles in column 1 means that government articles are 14.2 percent less likely to be

cited than university articles. Similarly, in column 2, government patents are 13.6 percent more

likely to be cited than university patents. In general, the results with and without self-citations

are similar. The main exception is for patents citing scientific articles (columns 3 and 6). Except

for collaborations, the coefficients for cited organizations fall between 25 and 50 percent when

including self-citations. Since this is relative to the base category of university articles, this

suggests that university patent-to-publication citations are more likely to be self-citations. Since




                                                                                                 18
my main interest is knowledge flows, I focus on the results excluding self-citations below except

when exceptions arise.

         Looking first at articles (columns 1 & 4), university articles are both more likely to be

cited and are more likely to cite other research, as the coefficients for all other organizations are

less than one. This is consistent with the notion that most basic research comes from a university

setting. 14 The one exception is that company collaborations are 3 percent more likely to be cited,

but only when self-citations are included. Similarly, when including self-citations, non-company

collaborations are 2.1 percent more likely to cite other work. As these results only hold for self-

citations, they suggest collaborations help expose the research partners to each other’s articles.

         The relative importance of institutions changes when looking at patent-to-patent citations

(columns 2 & 5). I find two important results here. First, research performed by government

institutions is highly valuable. Government patents are 13.6 percent more likely to be cited than

university patents.        Second, collaborative research enhances the flow of knowledge across

institutions. Non-company collaborations are 30 percent more likely to be cited than university

patents, although the result is only significant at the ten percent level. Note that this excludes

self-citations between any of the participating organizations. Thus, rather than it simply being the

case that collaborations enhance technology transfer within the group, this result suggests that

the patents resulting from collaborations make novel contributions that are more valuable to

future researchers. Indeed, note that these collaborations are not more likely to be citing other

patents, further emphasizing that it is not simply an increased propensity for cross-citation




14
  Note that this differs from the raw descriptive data, where university articles received fewer citations on average
than government articles. As government articles were more prevalent early in the sample, they have had more
opportunities for citation, thus illustrating the need to control for citation opportunities to properly assess citation
counts across organization types.

                                                                                                                       19
generating this result. Moreover, note that patents from other institutions are no less likely to be

cited than university patents.

         The primacy of research performed in government laboratories continues when looking at

patent-to-article citations (columns 3 & 6). Government articles are 14 percent more likely to be

cited by a patent than other research.             Thus, government research does appear to play an

important translational role linking basic and applied research. However, university articles are

still important, as they are cited more frequently than non-government articles. Finally, when

excluding self-citations, non-company collaborations are 60 percent more likely than university

patents to cite other articles, providing further evidence that these collaborations expose research

partners to a wider range of knowledge than they would obtain on their own.

         Separating the results by technology yields a few interesting differences. As the results

are similar with and without self-citations, I present only the results excluding self-citations in

Table 10. 15     For article-to-article citations in biofuels and solar energy, university articles

generally remain the most valuable. However, company collaboration articles are 10 percent

more likely to be cited than university articles. For wind energy, things are quite different.

Here, company and government articles are more important. Company articles are 62 percent

more likely to be cited, and government articles are 80 percent more likely to be cited. Similarly,

both company and non-company collaborations are 115 percent and 74 percent more likely to be

cited, respectively. Wind is a more mature technology and is approaching cost competitiveness

with fossil fuels in ideal locations. As such, these results suggest that wind research is moving

towards a more applied stage where university research becomes less significant.

         [TABLE 10 ABOUT HERE]


15
  Because of the smaller number of patent-to-article citations, that model does not converge for individual
technologies.

                                                                                                              20
         As before, for patent-to-patent citations, government biofuel and wind patents are more

likely be cited. However, government solar energy patents are 10 percent less likely to be cited

than university patents. Emphasizing the role of the private sector, company patents in biofuels

and solar energy are 9 and 22 percent more likely to be cited than university patents. Company

patents in these two technologies are also 70-75 percent more likely to cite other patents. 16

         Finally, Figure 5 illustrates the impact of decay and diffusion.                       It shows how the

probability of citation varies over time for articles, patents, and patent-to-article citations. The

probability of article-to-article citations peaks first, just 3 years after publication. 17 In contrast,

patent-to-patent citations are more durable.                While the probabilities for article and patent

citations start at similar levels, the probability of patent citations continues to increase for up to 9

years after the patent was granted. 18 Note that the probability of citation does not fall as quickly

for patents as it does for articles. Finally, knowledge flows between articles and patents are both

less frequent and take longer to occur. For patents citing articles, the probability peaks 15 years

after the article was published. 19

         [FIGURE 5 ABOUT HERE]



16
   The regressions also include controls for the citing and cited countries. While they are important controls, they
provide less interesting information. Both US articles and patents are the most commonly cited. The next most
commonly cited countries are other English-speaking nations: the UK and Canada. Articles and patents from most
other countries are cited about 30-40 percent less frequently than US articles. Within scientific articles, Chinese
publications are 13 percent more likely to have citations, and Turkish articles are 27 percent more likely to have
citations, suggesting work from those countries may be more derivative of earlier research. Finally, since the patent
data includes only patents granted in the US, not surprisingly US scientific articles are cited about three times as
often on these patents as are foreign articles. Appendix Table A3 provides complete regression results for the
pooled model excluding self-citations, including country coefficients.
17
   One comparable study looking at citations across publications in other fields is Adams and Clemmons (2013).
They find slightly longer mean citation lags of about 6 years. However, they find the fastest lags within physics, a
field very relevant for energy research. There, the mean lag is a similar 3.5 years.
18
   Popp et al. (2013) finds similar duration for energy patents in a study looking at differences across energy
technologies. Patent citations to energy patents appear more durable than for other technologies, as most previous
studies find citation probabilities peaking 3-4 years after grant (e.g. Jaffe and Trajtenberg, 2002)
19
   For comparison, in a broader study of NPL citations, Branstatter and Ogura (2005) find that patent citations to
scientific publications begin shortly after article publication, and that the probability of citation peaks about eight
years after article publication.

                                                                                                                    21
4.3. Discussion

       The regression results have several possible implications for energy R&D policy. While

a full discussion of the ideal role for government energy R&D is beyond the scope of this paper,

here I outline some general guidelines based on the existing literature and discuss how my results

inform future energy R&D decisions. First, earlier studies do find instances where government

energy R&D crowds out private R&D efforts, particularly when government funding targets

applied research topics (Popp 2002). If one of the objectives of government policy is to avoid

duplicating and potentially crowding out private research efforts, government R&D will be most

effective if it focuses on breakthrough technologies that are not yet close to market.

       With this in mind, the results for wind energy suggest that additional public R&D support

for wind is of less value than for solar or biofuels. For wind energy, the most valuable scientific

articles are coming further downstream in the research process. Government and company

articles are more frequently cited than university research, as are multi-institution collaborations.

While my data do not allow me to identify public R&D support that these private sector research

projects may have received, the results demonstrate that wind energy R&D has reached a more

mature phase, where the focus should be on product development, rather than basic scientific

advances. Much of this work will be carried out in the private sector. Recall from Figure 1 that

the greatest growth in patenting among the technologies in this paper was in wind, and that wind

patents increased at a faster rate than wind articles.       To create demand for wind energy

innovation, other policy mechanisms will need to be in place, such as carbon pricing or

renewable energy mandates (e.g. Popp, 2010).           However, if governments wish to avoid

duplicating private R&D efforts, public energy R&D investments would be better spent on



                                                                                                  22
technologies that complement private sector wind energy investment, such as enhancing energy

storage, than on duplicating what the private sector will do on its own.

       Government research can also help new technologies overcome roadblocks to

commercialization (Mowrey et al. 2010, Weyant 2011). Nonetheless, government R&D is often

portrayed as wasteful and inefficient in public policy debates.        Cohen and Noll’s (1991)

Technology Pork Barrel provides the classic academic treatise on this viewpoint, arguing that

political realities influence funding decisions in ways that may prolong unsuccessful projects.

However, I show here that research on renewable energy sources produced by government

institutions has been particularly helpful moving alternative energy research to an applied stage.

Patents assigned to government research institutions more likely to be cited than those from other

institutions. More importantly, scientific articles from government institutions are more likely

than other articles to be cited by patents. Although government articles are not more likely to be

cited by other scientific articles, these government articles appear to be important links between

basic and applied research. Further research to uncover the value of the patents inspired by

government research would be a useful next step.

       Finally, the long lags between patent-article citations pose a political challenge.

Policymakers face political constraints making it difficult to support policies with little short

term payoff. While ideally government funded R&D funding should focus on riskier projects

less likely to be performed in the private sector, the long lags between an initial publication and

the ultimate technology development from such projects may make it difficult to sustain political

support for research on these long-term projects. Thus, a second-best solution may be for

governments to develop a diverse portfolio of projects that includes some low-risk projects likely

to have relatively quick returns. While these may result in some crowding out of private R&D,



                                                                                                23
such success stories will help build public support for a continuous, steady stream of public

energy R&D funding. Funding agencies will need to weigh the cost of such crowding out

against the potential gains of political support for a portfolio of research that also includes the

necessary risker, but less politically popular, R&D projects.



5. Conclusions

       Expansion of government energy R&D budgets is likely to continue to be a key

component of climate policy. Using an original data set of both scientific articles and patents

pertaining to alternative energy technologies, this paper provides new evidence on the flows of

knowledge between university, private, and government research. The paper makes three key

contributions to both the study of energy research and to energy R&D policy.

       First, using scientific articles to represent more basic, upstream research and patents to

represent more applied downstream research, the paper provides new descriptive data on the

flows of basic and applied research across institutions. There are notable differences in the

importance of different institutions across technologies. For example, university patents are

relatively more prevalent for biofuels, perhaps indicating the importance of genetic research to

new patentable biofuel technologies. Similarly, wind research has moved to a more applied

stage, where the most valuable inventions come from downstream institutions such as the private

sector, rather than from universities.

       Second, using non-patent literature references to link articles and patents, I show that

highly cited academic literature is also valuable to the creation of applied technology (e.g.

patents). The results are highly skewed. Few articles are ever cited by patents, and those that are

cited by patents are amongst the most highly cited articles by other research articles. This result



                                                                                                24
indicates that not only are journal article citations a good indicator of the usefulness of the

research to other academic researchers, but also provide information on the value of published

research for potential technology development.

       Finally, analysis of citation flows across institutions highlights the high value of research

performed at government institutions. Patents assigned to governments are more likely to be

cited than other patents. Moreover, government articles are more likely to be cited by patents

than any other institution, including universities.    Thus, research performed at government

institutions appears to play an important translational role linking basic and applied research.

Funding agencies may wish to expand the role of government research facilities as they increase

public energy R&D budgets.
