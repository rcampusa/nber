Wealth Transfers and Net Wealth at Death: Evidence from the Italian Inheritance Tax Records
1995­2016

                                           ABSTRACT

In this paper we describe a novel source of data on the full record of inheritance tax files in Italy,
covering up to 63% of total deceased. The work documents a substantial rise in the total value of
inheritance and gifts as a share of national income, from 8.4% in 1995 to 15.1% in 2016.
Consistent with the increasing role of total personal net wealth in the economy, the weight of
inheritance and gifts in Italy appears relatively high by international standards. Over the same
period, total wealth left at death has also become increasingly concentrated. The estates valued at
least one million Euro were worth 18.7%of total estate in the mid 1990s and 24.8% in 2016. This
paper also documents that revenues collected from the inheritance tax underwent a threefold
decline from 0.15% to 0.05% of total tax revenue between 1995 and 2016. Data also allow a
disaggregated analysis by demographic and geographic characteristics.

Introduction
Wealth transfers, including bequests, inheritances, and gifts between living persons (i.e. inter
vivos gifts), are crucial economic resources for households and their accumulation of wealth.
In rich countries, their scale relative to the total national income has increased substantially
over recent decades. The ground-breaking work by Piketty (2011) documents the evolution
of annual wealth transfers as a share of total national income in France since 1820, showing
that their estimated share has increased threefold since 1950, from a level of 5%, to 15% in
2010. Atkinson (2013), Atkinson (2018), and Alvaredo et al. (2017) estimate corresponding
series indicating a similar trend towards an increasing relative weight of inheritances and gifts
in other economies, such as the UK, Germany, Sweden, and the U.S.

    In Italy, the stock net wealth owned by households is equivalent to six years of national
income and almost eight years of household disposable income as of 2016. This makes Italy one
of the countries with the highest wealth-to-income ratio in the world.1 Very little attention has
been devoted to understanding whether this rise in the wealth-income ratio led to an increase in
bequests and transfer from one generation to the next. Several questions remain unanswered.
What is the empirical importance of inheritance and inter vivos gifts in Italy? More broadly,
how are inheritances distributed among the population? In a context of an incresing aggregate
personal wealth as a share of national income (Piketty and Zucman, 2014, 2015), it is crucial
to assess the nature of intra- and inter-generational wealth transfers, their distribution across
demographic groups as well as across income and wealth ranks, and their effects on wealth in-
equality and mobility. Similarly, it is important to understand how existing institutions and tax
policies may affect the pattern and evolution of wealth transfers over time and across countries.

    We make use of a newly assembled micro-data set from the inheritance tax records which
provides a direct measure of the flows of bequests (e.g., wealth-holding of decedents), and has
not been systematically exploited so far. The dataset assembles the inheritance tax forms filed
with the Italian Revenue Agency on behalf of decedents from 1995 to 2016. The Italian inher-
itance tax data also have a very good coverage of the upper end brackets, despite the claims
of avoidance and evasion that are typical of tax systems. This is the result of the combination
of the very high home-ownership rate, with a key administrative feature of the tax, which is
connected to the upkeep of the real estate cadastral register: all inheritances involving the
transfer of real estate property are obliged to file a return, even when no tax is due. As a
consequence, the coverage rate is high by international standards, as it remains above 50% of
decedents throughout the period and reaches a peak of 63% in 2014.

    This source of data is typically used to derive direct measures of wealth concentration
through the application of the mortality multiplier method (see Atkinson and Harrison, 1978,
Lampman, 1962). Analysis of the distribution of estates at death has received very little atten-
tion in economic literature. However, this source of data provides direct, relevant information
about the aggregate magnitude as well as the concentration of bequests (and, indirectly, in-
heritance) and can be the object of independent scrutiny (Alvaredo et al., 2018).

      This work makes a series of contributions. First, we derive a new series of total annual
  1

                                               2
inheritance flow of all assets (tangible and financial assets, net of financial liabilities) transmit-
ted at death or through inter vivos gifts from 1995 to 2016. We find that the share of annual
wealth transfers in household disposable income almost doubled during the past 20 years, from
approximately 9.6% in 1995 to 18.5% in 2016. Meanwhile, wealth accumulated via savings
dropped from 16% of annual disposable income in 1995 to 3.2% in 2016. This is an important
indication that, other things being equal, `self-made' wealth (i.e., savings) has been declining
as compared to inherited wealth. Second, we provide a detailed account of estate, inheritance,
and gift taxation in the country, which underwent substantial changes throughout the period
of analysis. We also document the decline in tax revenues arising from wealth transfers, which
is partially due to a fall in the number of wealthy estates that are subject to taxation. Third,
we provide a detailed analysis and description of wealth left at death across demographic and
geographic dimensions. Similarly, we describe the importance of looking within wealthy groups
to uncover heterogeneity in the estate composition: for example, financial assets become the
most important holdings at the very top. Finally, the evidence also suggests that bequests
are becoming more concentrated. Reported estates of at least A      C1 million were worth almost
15% of total net estate value (including an estimated of total estates unreported to the tax
authorities), and this share increased to 25% by 2016. Estates left at death by the richest
0.01% of decedents (individuals with a declared total estate greater than A        C17 million) as a
share of total estates, was approximately 1% at the end of the 1990s. By 2016, the top 0.01%
estate share almost tripled to approximately 3%. The increase in the estate concentration is
less pronounced if we take the mid-1990s as a reference. A growing concentration of estates
left at death may also imply a growing concentration of inheritance over time.

   The work is organized as follows. We begin the paper with a description of total net
wealth of the household sector in Italy, followed by a detailed account of its wealth transfer
taxation. In the third section we describe the main features of the inheritance data. New
measures of the relative share of total inheritance and gifts, as share of national income and
household disposable income, are derived in section four. In the fourth section we provide
detailed analysis of bequeathed wealth in Italy across demographic and geographic dimensions
as well as a details estate portfolios across the distribution of estates. In the fifth section, we
document the concentration of estates at the top of the distribution and its evolution over
time. Our last section concludes.


1    The growing relevance of personal wealth in Italy
According to the national balance sheets, Italian households are, on average, among the wealth-
iest and least indebted amongst all rich economies. In 1966, the average net wealth per capita,
taken as the sum of all financial and real assets minus all liabilities, was A
                                                                             C21,000 (2016 prices),
and experienced an eightfold increase to A  C167,000 at the end of 2006, just before the onset of
the great financial crisis. Since then, as shown in Figure 2, personal net wealth per capita has
dropped to AC141,000 in 2016. Italy and Spain were the only advanced economies to experience
a sharp decline (16% for Italy) in per-capita net wealth.

    The concept of personal net wealth refers to the current value of all assets, tangible and
intangible, that are under the control of the household sector, provide economic benefits to the
holders, and over which property rights can be exercised. The assets may be financial, such as


                                                  3
current or savings accounts, stocks, bonds and insurance reserves, or real assets, such as land,
houses, and unincorporated self-employment businesses. This is the definition of personal net
wealth that is used in the national balance sheet according to the System of National Accounts
(SNA 2008) and the European System of Accounts (ESA 2010).2 This definition is grounded
in conventional economic theory, in which wealth represents reserve of value that can be ex-
changed for present and future consumption.

  World Inequality Database for the pre-1995 period, and ISTAT, and Bank of Italy for the
  post-1995 period. Data refer to the household sector only, excluding the non-profit sector
                                     serving households

    A substantial fraction of personal wealth is composed of housing and land assets, the shares
of which increased from 51% to 54% over the 50 years from 1966 to 2016. The weight of direct
holding of equities, investment funds, and indirect holding of financial securities via life insur-
ance and private pension funds increased from 11% to 24% over the same period. Saving and
current accounts, currency, and bonds decreased from 30% to 19%, as did business assets and
other non-financial assets, from 3% to 1.5%. Italian personal debt amounts to approximately
A
C15,000 per capita in recent years, one of the lowest levels currently recorded among rich
   2
     The assets recorded in the balance sheets are economic assets, which are defined as "a store of value
representing the benefits accruing to the economic owner by holding or using the entity over a period of time.
It is a means of carrying forward value from one accounting period to another" (ESA 2010, p.170).

countries.

    Italy is also one of the countries with the highest incidence of aggregate private wealth as a
share of national income. Since 2005, more than six years of national income and nearly eight
years of households gross disposable income would be required to accumulate the net worth of
the household sectors, as compared to two years worth of income around 1970. The ratio of
private wealth (household sector plus nonprofit institutions serving households) and national
income is close to 6 in some rich countries like France, Japan, and the UK, or nearer to 5 and
4 as is the case of the U.S. and Germany.3



2       The inheritance and gift tax in Italy
The tax (Imposta sulle successioni e le donazioni ) is applied to all worldwide taxable assets,
net of liabilities and deductible expenses, inherited from a deceased person residing in Italy.
Strictly speaking, the tax system is an inheritance tax (on the amount received by each heir),
and not an estate tax (on the amount of total wealth left at death) such as the transfer taxes
currently levied in the U.S. and the UK today.4

    Different rates apply depending on the degree of kinship. For spouses and direct descen-
dants or ascendants the rate is 4% above any inheritance share with a net value of A  C1 million
or higher. For siblings, the rate is 6% above A
           5                                    C100,000. For relatives within the fourth degree,
immediate relatives by marriage and extended it is 6% on all bequests with no exemption
threshold; a rate of 8% applies to all other parties with no exemption threshold. The same
rates and structure apply to inter vivos gifts.6 Until 2016 the exemption threshold was reduced
by an amount equal to the capitalized lifetime donations received by each heir from the same
deceased. This provision (called coacervo ) limited the scope for avoidance of the tax by means
of gifts by partially integrating the taxation of gifts and inheritance.7

    The administration of the tax is linked to the upkeep of the real estate cadastral register,
as other taxes are due on transactions of real estate rights (e.g., registration duty as well as
mortgage and cadastral taxes).

    3
      The comparison with other countries is done using the private sector and not the personal sector of the
national account (households only), as it not always possible to disentangle the household sector and the
nonprofit institutions serving households.
    4
      The inheritance tax is calculated only on the net value of assets located in Italy in the event a person is not
deemed to be domiciled in Italy for fiscal reasons.
    5
      In the presence of a disabled heir the tax exempt threshold is A      C1.5 million.
    6
      As mentioned in the work by Jappelli et al. (2014), which also provides a useful description of wealth transfer
taxation in Italy, one exception applies for the years 2000 and 2001 when gift flat tax rates were 1 percentage
point lower than the inheritance tax rates.
    7
      It is not yet clear if this provision is still in force, as the supreme court (Cassazione ) in the period 2016­2019
issued non-unanimous judgments on the topic. A system purely based on lifetime capital receipts, irrespective of
the identity of the donor, would be more effective in reducing tax avoidance. Indeed, currently a single heir can
receive different inheritances and still pay zero taxes as long as each inherited share is below the tax exemption
threshold. It is also important to note that in case the coacervo is definitively abandoned by the jurisprudence,
tax avoidance schemes of inheritance tax through inter vivos gift would be substantially easier.

Tax-exempt assets. A variety of exemptions permit the reduction of the effective tax bill
beyond the statutory description. The tax-exempt status implies, in many cases, that such
holdings are not reported in the tax returns.

     Full exemption is granted to private pension and life insurance funds, postal saving bonds
(i.e., Buoni Fruttiferi Postali ), and a number of national and extra-national government securi-
ties.8 Albeit exempted, the reporting of government bonds is often advised by tax accountants
and frequently occurs in cases where securities are bundled with other assets within investment
funds (e.g. banks and other financial intermediaries are required to provide detailed description
of investment funds and accounts following death of a legal owner). Such investment bundles
can be fully reported on the inheritance tax form, and the tax authority would then compute
the relevant tax deductions. Exempted assets also includes cars and vehicles in the national
vehicle registry, credits towards the state, properties listed as cultural and historical heritage,
and all family businesses and control shares of companies that are transferred to direct descen-

Changes in the taxation structure. The period under investigation coincided with sub-
stantial changes in the tax code. Three major reforms were enacted in 2000, 2001, and 2006.

     There are now 134 countries whose tax authorities have "adequate" exchange of information with Italy.
As a result these countries are included in the so-called "white list," which is necessary to get access to more
favourable tax treatment.

     The tax exemption status is valid under the condition that the business is run and the control share is
maintained for at least 5 years following the wealth transfer. Nonetheless, the value of business assets has to
be reported in the inheritance tax returns. The remaining exempted assets are generally not reported on tax
records. Inherited or donated assets of any kind may be fully exempted if the recipient belongs to one of these
categories: religious entities, NGOs, political parties, state, regional or local authorities, or research institutions.

Before 2000, the tax was a mix of a progressive estate tax (levied on the total estate left at
death) with marginal rates ranging from 3% to 27%, and an inheritance tax (levied on the
share received by the heir or beneficiary) with a further graduation in marginal rates of up to
33%. The latter applied only to recipients other than the spouse and direct relatives. In 2000,
the tax was transformed into a pure inheritance tax without the estate tax component. The
exemption threshold was unique before 2000 and increased from A     C125 thousand from 1995
to 1999, to A C175 thousand in 2000. As explained in the previous section, the new tax had
differential proportional tax rates and exemption thresholds for spouses, direct descendants,
ascendants, and beneficiaries with certain disabilities. Such structure has continued to-date,
although the exemption thresholds have been much more generous since 2006 (e.g., A  C1 million
for spouses and offspring).

   The inheritance and gift taxes were abolished in 2001 but reintroduced in 2006. Despite six
years repeal, inheritance tax form filing remained compulsory for estates including housing or
land wealth. In this period, therefore, the declared information about housing and land assets
remain reliable, whereas little information is provided about other wealth holdings.

The inheritance tax revenue and its coverage.
The tax revenue collected from estate and inheritance taxes experienced a threefold decrease
from approximately 0.15% of total fiscal revenue in 1995 to 0.05% in 2016. This happened as
a result of changes in the tax structure. The total revenue generated from the inheritance tax
to individuals who died in 1998 was A  C100 million. The estate tax revenue was five times as
big, A
     C500 million in the same year (see 6(c) 6(b) and Table 7). In 2016, there was no estate
tax revenue but the inheritance tax brought in approximately A C400 million. The official figure
of the Ministry of Economy and Finance for the inheritance tax revenue is A   C558 million for
2016 but is measured at the year of account and not at year of death.10 An additional A   C183

   Although an official measure of the tax gap does not exist for the inheritance tax, the tax authority,
Agenzia delle Entrate, runs audit programs. The results of this activity should be visible from the field "Ruoli"


                                                       7
million came from the taxes levied on inter vivos gifts.

    Only a small fraction of estates are subject to estate or inheritance tax. In the mid-1990s,
between 8% and 9% of recorded estates were taxed, and the average amount paid was approx-
imately AC20­25 thousand. By 2016, the share of estates subject to inheritance taxation rose
slightly to just above 10%, whereas the average tax paid per estate was more than halved, to
approximately A  C10 thousand (cfr. Tables 6 and 7).

    It may seem counterintuitive that under the current tax regime, the share of estates subject
to taxation increased despite a substantial increase in the tax exemption threshold, especially
for transfers of wealth to spouses and children. However, many smaller estates are now sub-
ject to taxation due to the fact that minimum-value exemptions were eliminated for wealth
transfers occurring beyond the fourth degree of kinship. Even small inheritances are, therefore,
subject to taxation if received from donors outside the direct family sphere.

Generale dello Stato (http://www.rgs.mef.gov.it). At pages 303/142 and 303/144 one can observe that the
ordinary amount of inheritance tax receipt is around 640 million, whereas the extraordinary receipts through
"ruoli" amounts to 9 million (cash value). The share total value of "ruoli" receipts and ordinary receipts is
approximately 1.4%. This is slightly higher than a similar ratio for personal income tax­the so called "IRPEF"

3         The inheritance tax data
Data used in this paper come from inheritance tax returns, referred to as "successions," opened
between 1995 and 2016 (evaluated at year of death).11

    The analysis of net estates, namely total net wealth and possessions left at death, is of
intrinsic interest to economists as it relates to the amount of wealth that is transferred, via
inheritance, from deceased individuals to designated heirs. Our data refer to the total net
wealth of deceased individuals represented in the tax records, independent of how the assets
are subsequently distributed.

         Net wealth is determined by adding all reported financial and real assets and subtracting
    11
     The paper tax form digitized by the Ministry of Economy and Finance to collect the data used in this paper
is the so-called "Modello 4."


                                                                                                                                                                                    9
all liabilities. We also add the market value of assets sold within six months of the deaths
reported between 1990 and 2000; this is typically negligible and does not affect the results.
Individuals are then ranked from the smallest to the largest value of their net estate. The
micro-data are then transformed into detailed tabular form by the statistical office of the
Ministry of Economics and Finance and shared with us. The main tabulations have 34 net
wealth ranges, from negative values to the highest range worth A    C20 million or more. The
demographic information is provided by seven age groups (i.e., under 20, 20 to 40, 40 to 50, 50
to 60, 60 to 70, 70 to 80, and over 80), three gender groups (i.e., males, females, and gender
not stated), and three Italian macro areas (i.e., south and islands, north, and center).

3.1    Main advantages of the data
The inheritance data at hand cover more than 50% of decedents for every year under investi-
gation, even when the inheritance tax was abolished between 2001 and 2006. This is the direct
result of high home-ownership rates in the country combined with the administrative features
of the Italian inheritance tax, linked to the upkeep of the real estate cadastral register as well
as the administration of taxes on land and housing transactions. The coverage rate reached
63% in 2014, the highest on record, and 62% in 2016. The coverage rate dropped to 61% in
2015, due to an unexpectedly high mortality rate in that year.12

within twelve months of death and is then submitted to the office of the revenue agency (Agen-

     Total deaths in 2015 amounted to 648,000, approximately 40,000 greater than the average deaths in 2012,
2013, 2014, and 2016. The relative decline of the coverage rate after 2014 may also be due to a change in
legislation (passed at the end of 2014) which increased the non-filing threshold from 50,000 Italian Lira (i.e.,
A
C25,823) to A C100,000 (the threshold defining the net value above which the filing is required for those estates
without any real estate properties or rights).



                                                                           10
zia delle Entrate ) in the province where the deceased had residence.13 . A dedicated official at
the local branch of the tax authority processes the returns in order to assess the tax liability.
At the same time, legal proof of ownership and third-party assessments of asset valuation are
often required, enhancing the accuracy of the information and reducing the scope for tax eva-
sion. For instance, banks and financial institutions need to certify the balances of any checking,
savings, or investment accounts; the cadastral office certifies the cadastral value of buildings,
land or dwellings; a certified copy of the most recent balance sheets needs to be attached to
prove the book value of any company; and the official certification of ownership of quoted
stocks should be provided. Similarly, all the expenses and liabilities that are deducted need to
be appropriately documented.


3.2    Main disadvantages of the data
The use of tax data, however, does come with substantial costs. First, the valuation of real
estate has to be corrected to bring cadastral values reported for taxation purposes in line with
market prices. Second, not all assets are taxable, and their reporting may not be mandatory.14
Third, not every death is represented in the tax records and allowance should be made for
the wealth of the unidentified population in the tax data. Moreover, only real properties were
reported between 2001 and 2006, when the inheritance and gifts taxes were abolished. Fourth,
underreporting may be pervasive due to tax avoidance and evasion, or, more simply, due to
lack of incentives to fully disclose assets and possessions on inheritance tax records (e.g., com-
pleting in detail the complex tax form on the nature and composition of the estate might be
regarded as an unnecessary burden when the resulting inheritance shares are below the taxable
threshold).

The valuation of real estate. The value of land, buildings, and dwellings is reported at
cadastral values for tax purposes; this nominal value generally underestimates market prices.15
In order to overcome this problem, we have applied, with the support of the statistical office of
the Ministry of Economy and Finance, a proportional adjustment to bring the cadastral values
in line with market values. As we detail in the Appendix A, the yearly adjustment factor is
defined as the ratio of (average) market price to cadastral valuation at the national level.

The wealth of "non-filers." Inheritance tax returns are only mandatory if the rights of any
real estate are transferred at death, or if the net value of the estate of the deceased is above
A
C25,822.16 Hence, only a fraction of total deaths are observed in the tax records: in 2013,
  13
     The time limit was set to 6 months up to 2003. The last data update in this paper was obtained in May
2020. A set of 2,600 tax returns presented in 2018 with the new electronic form, but related to deaths that
occurred in 2016, were included in the data. In principle there could be later submission/revision of very few tax
returns even 10 or 20 years after death as more precise information about the estate come to notice, but these
amendments are not taken into account in the statistics. Every year-specific database becomes consolidated for
our purposes if two years have passed since the year of death.
  14
     In a few cases the tax administration suggests reporting the assets (e.g., government bonds) despite their
total tax-exemption status. Moreover, the values of family business assets need to be reported even if they are
exempted.
  15
     This is particularly the case with older buildings whose values have typically not been updated for many
decades. The likely sell-up value is reported only for those buildings under construction or for those for which
no cadastral rent has been attributed yet.
  16
     The threshold was expressed in 50 thousand Italian Lira, converted into Euros using the official conversion


                                                       11
365,000 estates out of 600,000 deaths. Although incomplete, such a coverage rate, more than
60%, is high compared to data from other rich countries: in the UK, the coverage rate is just
below 50%, whereas in the U.S. it is lower than 1%.

    Our data are representative of living adults with estates values and arrangements that
warrant the attention of the tax authority in the event of their death, approximately 60% of
decedents in our case. Although this does not generally affect the top of the distribution, the
need to estimate the amount of wealth held by non-filers or the so-called "missing population"
is necessary to assess the full cross-sectional distribution of estates for the entire decedent
population every year.

Inter vivos gifts . Tax planning may be used to reduce the tax liability at death if assets
are donated in life. According to official data from the Ministry of Economy and Finance, the
value of total annual reported gifts increased from A C10 billion in 2007 to A
                                                                             C24 billion in 2016
(see column B1 in Table 8).

    To tackle aggressive avoidance of taxes via careful estate planning, the tax schedule on
inter vivos gifts is fully unified with the estate and inheritance taxation. In other words, gifts
are subject to the same exemption thresholds and marginal tax rates. Moreover, donations
and gifts received in life from the same donor are fully integrated with the value received at
death. In fact, tax forms also report the value of all inter vivos gifts done at any time before
death by the deceased capitalized to the date of death.17 Also, keeping track of donations and
transfers of assets during life is necessary to compute the `reserved' share of total estate (e.g.
share of total estates that must be allocated to heirs according to legal provisions) guaranteed
by the Italian civil law to spouses or to civil partners (only since 2016), direct descendants,
and ascendants of the deceased, depending on circumstances.18

    As reported in Table 7, the total amount of lifetime donations reported in the tax records
more than tripled from A  C260 million in 1995 to AC990 million in 2016. However, the share
of total estates reporting lifetime donations dropped from 3.2% in 1995 to 2.2% in 2016 (cfr.
Table 6).

Trusts . Trusts are by definition not taxable under the inheritance tax, as the property of the
settled assets is transferred from the settlors to the trustees. Very little is known about the
amount of wealth held in trusts in Italy. To have a better understanding of the phenomenon,
we have consulted the universe of income tax files in 2012 and have capitalized the reported
capital income from trusts (Redditi da capitale imputati ai trusts ) using similar rates as in
rate of 1,936.27 Lira for AC1. The filing exemption threshold was then increased to A C100 thousand at the end of
2014. It is too early to assess how this change will affect the nature of inheritance tax statistics in the future.
   17
      The self-reported gifts and donations done in life concur to erode the inheritance tax-exempted thresholds
if the heir belongs to the degree of kin for which an exemption threshold is contemplated by the tax legislation.
   18
      The reserved share (so-called "quota legittima") of a single child is a half, whereas in the case of multiple
children, the children are entitled to two thirds of the total estate in equal shares. If there is a spouse and one
child, the reserved portion is two thirds split equally between the spouse and the child. If there is a spouse and
more than one child, the spouse has one quarter and the children one half. If there are only ascendants, the
reserved portion is one third. In case there are only ascendants and a spouse, the reserved portion of the spouse
is half of the estate and that of the ascendants is a quarter. Finally, the spouse always reserves the right to
inhabit the family home, even if not owned fully or partially, and the right to use the furniture in it.

Kopczuk and Saez (2004) for the U.S. and in Alvaredo et al. (2018) for the UK, getting an
estimate of total wealth held in trusts of A
                                           C200­300 million.19 This estimate is rather small in
magnitude, suggesting that the use of trusts in Italy may indeed be not as widespread as in
the U.S. or the UK.20

Liabilities. The concept of net worth used in this paper subtracts all liabilities from real
and financial assets. However, it is expected that very high tax exempt thresholds, as for
the current inheritance tax in Italy, reduces the incentive of detailed reporting of liabilities
for most (non-taxable) estates. A further limitation of tax records is linked to the fact that
liabilities can be reported with deductible expenses. The expenses include the costs of funeral
or medical treatment, paid by the heirs during the last six months of the deceased person's
life. Although the amount of these expenses may be negligible (e.g., only a small fixed amount
of funeral costs can be deducted for tax reasons but no specific threshold is specified for health
related costs), it is not possible to appropriately add deductible expenses back to the value of
the individual estate.



4        The growing relevance of inheritance and gifts
The total annual flow of bequests declared on tax records increased from A  C38.2 billion in 1995
to A
   C112.26 billion in 2016 at current prices, ranging from 4.6% to 8.1% of total national income
(see column A1 in Table 8 and Table 9). This measure provides information about the transfer,
made at death, of tangible and intangible wealth and possessions, such as real estate, financial
securities and cash.

    Wealth transfers from one generation to the next or, more simply, from one person to
another, can also be made inter vivos, via gifts and donations. Gift tax data list the total
gift value recorded every year. In 2016, total gifts amounted to A  C24.15 billion (see column
B1 in Table 8). This total does not fully represent the total value of gifts at market prices,
as donated real properties are reported at the cadastral value. Even without adjustments to
transform cadastral valuations into market prices, the estate figures would increase by 21%.
This adjustment is substantially higher than the 10% proportional adjustment to estate data
series applied in the UK after the year 1979 in Atkinson (2013, 2018). This is consistent with
the fact that existing provisions and reporting requirements about gift taxes results in Italian
data on gifts being more complete than other countries, for instance, in the UK, where only
gifts within seven years from death are reported and taxed. Making an allowance for the
market prices of transferred rights on real properties would increase total estate value by 36%.
Total adjusted estates and gifts were worth A C153.63 billion in 2016 (see column D1 in Table
8).21
    19
     The rate of return used in the capitalization exercise is 5.6%.
    20
     It is, nonetheless, possible that such estimate is likely to be substantially underestimated due to the fact
that that several sources of capital income are not directly observed on income tax records in Italy, as they are
taxed at the source.
  21
     The derivation of market prices of the amount donated and declared on gift tax forms is obtained by
multiplying the value of donated real properties as declared on the tax records at cadastral values by the
proportional adjustment factor as described in 2. Data on reported gifts and their composition are taken from
an official Ministry of Economics and Finance publication, namely the "Analisi statistiche - Atti del registro,"


                                                       13
   However, in order to derive a more complete measure of the annual total gross flows of
wealth transfers, at death and inter vivos, further allowances are needed for the wealth of the
missing population (i.e., "the non-filers") as well as for the missing wealth due to unreported
exempted assets or due to underreporting of assets linked to mis-valuation of assets, tax avoid-
ance, and tax evasion.

    A related paper by Acciari et al. (2020) made use of the so-called estate multiplier method,
on the same set of estate data described here, to estimate the total wealth and its distribution
among the living population, estimated applying the estate multiplier method on the inheri-
tance tax record (e.g. the population of decedents is treated as a sample of the living, selected
with probability equal to the mortality rate by age, gender, and location groups). The total
identified wealth from the tax records using the estate multiplier method is compared to the
total in the official balance sheet in the National Accounts (NA). Here we use this relative dis-
crepancy between the two series and assume it applies also between the observed total estate
from the tax records and the "true" unobserved total estate we need to estimate. The same is
done to the observed series of inter vivos gifts.

    The distribution of wealth of the decedents, provided by the inheritance tax data described
above, is conceptually different from that of the wealth of the living. Yet, the use of estate
data has a very long tradition in economics and statistics for the derivation of wealth of the
living population, through a re-weighting process of the decedent population. This happens
insofar as we consider death as a way to "sample" the living population. The nature of the
sample is clearly non-random (e.g., older people and men have, all else being equal, a higher
mortality rate than younger people and women, respectively) so that detailed mortality rates
are required to re-weight the decedent population.

    The work by Acciari et al. (2020) used detailed mortality tables, published by the Italian
Statistical Institute (ISTAT), available for each age, gender, and geographical location. Given
the large share of decedents covered every year (over 60%), the re-weighting of inheritance
records allows the estate mortality method to account for a substantial share of the living
adult population and personal net worth. The population identified from the tax records ac-
counts for more than 50% of the adult population throughout the period, whereas the identified
wealth accounts for a minimum of 59% to a maximum of 86% of total personal wealth in the
NA (cfr. column H in Table 8). The coverage rate increases from a minimum of 64% to a
maximum of 94% of total personal wealth if we remove tax exempt assets from the NA total
(cfr. column G in Table 8). Multiplying the values of estates and gifts reported on the tax
records by the inverse of the coverage rate of total wealth, we obtain a more complete mea-
sure of total estate at death. This rough adjustment indirectly accounts for different types of
underreporting and missing wealth in the inheritance and gift tax data, including the estate
value of non-filers. The corrected gross flows of inheritance and gifts increased from 8.5% of
national income in 1995 to 15% in 2016 (see Table 9).22 One could also use a different denom-
focusing on the lines related to "Atti traslativi a titolo gratuito." The statistics are downloaded directly from
the MEF website at finanze.gov.it/finanze3/registro.
  22
     This approach differs from the approach used in the literature and described in work by Piketty (2011).
Here, one could derive an alternative compelling measure of total inheritance (not gifts) from National Accounts
data without using the fiscal data. This measure can be compared to the direct estimate through the fiscal


                                                       14
inator, moving from national income (equal to the gross domestic product excluding capital
depreciation and including net foreign factor income) to household disposable income (national
income minus taxes plus cash transfers), or even to total net wealth of households. As dis-
posable household income accounts for between 81% and 86% of national income, the relative
increase of inheritance and gifts since the mid-1990s, using household disposable income as
denominator, appears to be even more pronounced, going from 9.7% to 18.5%. The increase of
total inheritance and gifts as a share of total personal net wealth was less pronounced but still
salient, increasing from 1.7% to 2.4% from 1995 to 2016 (see Table 9). A similar increasing
trend in the total flows of annual inheritance has been estimated in the work of Luigi and
Giovanni (2018) simulating inheritance receipts by applying mortality tables to the reported
wealth in the Survey of Income and Wealth. The total value of inheritance flows as a share of
total net worth increased from 0.99% in 1995 to 1.52% in 2016.

    Household disposable income (HDI) can be used here to directly compare the inheritance
to income ratio to relevant macroeconomic statistics that use HDI as denominator. For in-
stance, the share of inheritance in 2016 is almost six times higher than the share of household
disposable income that is accumulated through savings. According to OECD data, the house-
hold saving rate in Italy was the highest among OECD countries in 1995, around 16%, and it
dropped to 3.2% in 2016 (see Figure 8).

    The relative weight of Italian inheritance and gift flows is slightly higher than other coun-
tries for which similar estimates are available. The last direct estimate from tax records by
Piketty (2011) that is available in 2006 amounts to 11% (Appendix Table B1), whereas in
Italy it is 11.8%. In the UK, for the same year, the share of total transfers in total income
appears lower at 8.2% (Table 2 in Atkinson, 2013). The relative high weight of inheritance in
countries like Italy was predicted by Piketty (2011), who wrote that "[i]n countries with low
economic growth and projected negative population growth, such as Spain, Italy, or Germany,
inheritance is bound to matter a lot during the twenty-first century. Aggregate inheritance
flows will probably reach higher levels than in France" (p. 1077).

    Although the rise of the aggregate size of inheritances and gifts does not necessarily have
automatic direct consequences for the distribution of wealth or income, economists and social
scientists care about the role of earned versus inherited wealth. The main reason lies in the
fact that a growing role of inheritance in the economy has direct consequences on the extent of
intergenerational wealth mobility. Consistent with our findings, works based on the analysis
of the Italian Survey on Household Income and Wealth found that the levels of education,
income, and wealth of parents are good predictors of education, income, and wealth levels
of children.(Bloise, 2018, Cannari and D'Alessio, 2018). In other words, intergenerational
mobility in Italy appears to be relatively low by international standards. Recent research
emphasizes the powerful role of parents' wealth in shaping their offspring's standard of living.
Boserup et al. (2016), using Danish administrative data, found an almost linear relationship
between parents' and children's wealth rankings. Killewald et al. (2017) summarized the
data to obtain an indication about tax evasion, avoidance, and missing wealth that cannot be accounted for in
the tax data. One would simply need to apply the following equation: Bt /Yt = µt mt Wt /Yt , where Bt is the
annual inheritance flow, Yt is the national income, Wt is the aggregate private wealth, mt is the annual mortality
rate = (total number of decedents)/(total living population), and µt is the ratio between average wealth of the
deceased and average wealth of the living.

a range of outcomes among their children, including educational and cognitive achievement,
employment outcomes, and transitions to homeownership.

4.1   Wealth left at death: a detailed description
The demographic composition of reported estates changed substantially throughout the period
under analysis. In 1995, 30% of declared estates belonged to individuals who died aged 80 or
older; the number grew to 60% in more recent years. In 1995, only 6% of total reported estates
belonged to individuals aged 50 or under, and this figure dropped to 2% in 2016. The gender
composition of estates was more unbalanced in the mid-1990s when 60% of total reported es-
tates belonged to men. For 2016, this relative share is approximately 52% (see Table 4). Yet
men are not overrepresented in all age groups. Reported estates belonged to men in 45% of
cases for the group of 80 years old and above, whereas the share increases to 60­70% for other
age groups (see Figure 11(a)). The composition of reported estates also differ by geograph-
ical location. The "north" of the country represents throughout approximately 50% of total
reported estates, with a slight increase starting in 2007. The relative share of the "center"
and the "south" (including the islands), remained roughly constant at around 20% and 30%
of total estates, respectively (see Figure 11(b)).

    The average size of total estates has substantially increased over time and its patterns
differ across age, gender, and geographical dimensions. Total wealth left at death averaged
A
C210,000 in the mid-1990s and increased gradually to A   C330,000 in 2007 at the onset of the
great financial crash, plateaued till 2013 before dropping to A
                                                              C290,000 in 2016 (cfr. Figure 9).
Estates of every age group gained from the mid-1990s to 2007 and, similarly, all lost ground
between then and 2016, especially age groups below 70 years old (see Figure 10).

    Not surprisingly, average net estate value left at death generally increases with age. The
value of wealth and possessions declared on behalf of individuals who died young (20 years old


                                                                                            17
or younger) was worth A C90,000 on average in 2016. For the group of 80 years old and above, the
average value is more than three times as high in the same year. A gender gap in the average
value of declared net estate also exists and persists at a relatively constant rate throughout the
period. Estates owned by women are worth on average 80% of that reported by men (cfr Table
5). The gender gap is close to zero in 2016 for most of the age groups, except the oldest ones
above 70 years old. On the other hand, the gender gap in the total net estate value declared in
the tax records starts to widen for groups of 50 years old and above in 1995 (cfr. Figure 12(a)).

    The geographic heterogeneity of total net estate value is also substantial, and estates in
the southern regions have a systematically lower value than those in the center and north of
the country. Throughout the years under analysis, the average estate left at death by residents
in the south of Italy is worth between 64% to 71% of that declared in the north and 60% to
67% of the average in the center. Although the relative gap by macro areas appears to be
stable over time, the absolute gap, measured in 2016 Euros, increased over time from A C80,000
to A
   C120,000 on average. The gap by macro areas persists across all age groups, although it is
larger for older groups (see Figure 12(b)).

One may also wonder what the shares of total estates held by different groups in the population
are and how these have evolved over time. In order to estimate measures of estate concen-
tration, such as the evolution of top estate shares, we need to derive a consistent measure of
total estate in the economy. However, as mentioned above, the inheritance tax returns are
not always mandatory and a fraction of small estates will not observed in the tax records, and
some of the assets may not be fully disclosed. We need, therefore, a measure of total estate
held by the non-filers and a correction for underreporting. The derivation of total inheritance
and gift flows described in Section 4 is useful here. In particular, we can use column E1 of
Table 8 as the value of total estate. Different from the total estate reported on the tax record,
the value accounts for the estates of non-filers and different forms of underreporting, with the
exception of those linked to tax-exempt assets.23

   Estates bigger than A    C1 million accounted for 1.2% of total deaths in 1995 and 2.5% in
2016. The share of millionaire estates to total estate value (adjusted for estates of non-filers)
was 18.7% in 1995 and grew to 24.8% in 2016 (cfr. Figure 13 and Tables 10-13). These fig-
ures, it is worth recalling, do not adjust for any underreporting of total assets in the tax records.

    Focusing on fixed groups of the population allows for a better analyse of the dynamics of
estate concentration over time. In particular, we can compute population percentiles as the
number of estates as a fraction of total decedent population in any given year (as derived from
the official national mortality records) and not as a share of the total decedents appearing in
the tax records. We can interpolate ranges of total net estate of the estate tabulations via the
mean-split histogram approach to derive the estate share of the particular population groups
in which we are interested in.

    Table 1 shows values of estate shares over time at different cutoffs of the upper-end estate
distribution, namely the share of total net estate held by the richest decedents (e.g., top 10%,
top 1% or even top 0.01%). The estimates show that estate concentration declined during the
mid-1990s for a few years but increased gradually from then to 2012, when it started declining
again. Discounting these sub-period trends, the long-run dynamics of estate concentration
appears more muted and stable across the period under analysis. The share of total estates
held by the richest 1% of the decedent population (e.g., individuals with at least A
                                                                                   C1.6 million),
held 17.5% of total estates in 1995. The share declined to 13.8% in 1998 and then increased
to 18.3% by 2012. From 2012 to 2016 the top 1% estate share, as reported on tax records,

     We could also follow an alternative approach used in the literature by Alvaredo et al. (2018), deriving
the estimates of missing estates by applying the average mortality rate to an estimate of total wealth of the
missing living population, namely those people whose possessions are likely not to come to the notice of tax
authorities when they die. Following the description of the inheritance tax code, this happens in Italy only if
estates exclude any housing or land and if the total value of net estate is below the reporting threshold (e.g.,
A
C26,000 approximately until 2014 and A   C100,000 since then). A recent work by Acciari et al. (2020) derives this
exact measure of missing wealth using data from the Italian Survey of Household Income and Wealth (SHIW).
The wealth of the missing population can be derived as the sum of net financial and real assets (excluding
housing) that is held by non-homeowner adults (individuals at least 20 years old) with total net wealth below
the inheritance tax-reporting threshold described above. One limitation of this approach is that only the wealth
of the non-filers is accounted for, and this might create a trend bias if underreporting has changed substantially
over time.

declined by 5 percentage points. Concentration at the very top of the estate distribution fol-
lowed a similar path, but here there is no sign of declining concentration in recent years. The
wealthiest 0.01% almost tripled its share of total estate from 1.04% in 1998 to 2.67% in 2016.

 Note: The table shows the value of estates held by selected top estate groups (derived as a fraction of total
 decedent population in any given year) as a share of total estate value in any given year. Total estate value
                                   includes the estates of the non-filers.


5.1     The composition of estates
The wealth data obtained from digitized tax returns are grouped in four categories: real estate;
business assets, equity and debt securities; other assets (including current and saving deposits,
valuables, etc.); and liabilities and deductible expenses.24 The data, therefore, lump together
privately held business assets (classified as a form of real assets in the national balance sheets)
with financial assets.

     In view of the high prevalence of homeownership in Italy, the number of inheritance tax
filers who declare real estate assets is above 90% on average every year. Similarly, the total de-
clared net estate value is also mostly composed of real estate assets, ranging from 90% in 1995
to 78% in 2016 (cfr. Table 7). This is substantially higher than the relative share of housing
and land assets reported in the national balance sheet data, which amounts to 51%­54% of
total personal wealth (total net wealth of the household sector excluding nonprofit institutions
serving households). The high share of real estate wealth in the tax records also depends on
the extensive tax exemption of a number of financial assets. Similarly, the existence of a very
high tax exemption threshold provides very little incentive for a full disclosure of assets other
than housing and land for the lower segments of the wealth distribution. As shown in Figure
14, this argument was pushed to the extreme, when the inheritance tax was abolished from
2001 to 2006. In this period, land and housing were the only assets whose reporting continued
to be mandatory, and they constitute almost 100% of total estate value.
  24
    Starting from 2017, the paper module for the inheritance tax returns has been gradually dismissed and
substituted by an electronic form that has a considerable amount of additional details about the composition
of the estates.

    Nevertheless, our data preserve heterogeneity of portfolio composition across the distribu-
tion of total estate. On one hand, share of estates reporting land and housing assets changes
across the distribution. On the other hand, the relative composition of declared portfolios
changes drastically depending on the size of the estate. As shown in Figure 15, the richer
the estate, the higher the relative share of reported financial and business assets. In 2016,
only 10% of total gross estate is composed of housing and land for the group of richest 0.01%
of total decedents, a group whose total declared net estate is at least A C17 million. For this
group, nearly 90% of total gross estate value is held in financial securities and privately held
business assets. Meanwhile, for estates below the 99th percentile, housing and land account for
at least 75% of total gross estate value. Such variation in estate portfolio also underlines the
importance of acknowledging the existing heterogeneity within the upper estate brackets.

  Notes: Between October 2001 and October 2006 the inheritance tax was abolished but the reporting of
housing and land assets remained compulsory. Total estate as reported in the tax records. Housing and land
 assets value is adjusted to transform the cadastral valuation for taxation purposes into market valuation.

Inheritance is one of the key determinants of wealth accumulation. In a context of slowing
economic growth, concern has risen about a potential return to "patrimonial capitalism" in
which wealth and its associated power of influence and control over productive resources are
increasingly concentrated, and parental wealth is key to determine life chances and opportu-
nities Piketty (2014).

    This paper systematically analyzes for the first time the full set of inheritance tax decla-
ration forms in Italy, from 1995 to 2016. The work documents a substantial rise in the share
of inheritance and gifts as a share of national income, from 8.4% in 1995 to 15.1% in 2016.
The strong rise in the weight of personal wealth as share of national income in Italy, therefore,
does appear to follow from an increasing weight of life-cycle savings (e.g., people are expecting
to spend longer or more in retirement). Over the same period, total wealth left at death has
also become increasingly concentrated. Millionaire estates were worth 18.7% of total estate in
the mid-1990s and almost 24.8% in 2016. Although the share of total estate left by the richest
1% of decedents slightly declined from 1995 to 2016, it grew by approximately 5 percentage
points between the end of the 1990s and 2012. By contrast, the total estate share left by
the wealthiest group under analysis (i.e., top 0.01%) slightly increased from 1995 to 2016 and
almost tripled between the end of the 1990s and 2016.

    The distribution of estates has seldom been under extensive scrutiny as it typically served
as the main building block for the application of the mortality multiplier method to derive the
distribution of wealth of the living. Yet recent research has highlighted that the concentration
of estates also provides, in and of itself, compelling information about the evolution of the
concentration of wealth (Alvaredo et al., 2018). The ongoing work by Acciari et al. (2020), in
a companion paper, shows that estate tax data in Italy can be very fruitful in the estimation of
reliable series of wealth concentration. Similarly, historical tabulation of the Italian inheritance
tax records may be used to derive historical series of wealth concentration, in periods where

                                                                                      25
little evidence exists about distribution of economic resources among the population (Gabbuti
and Morelli, 2020).

    The information about the concentration of estates left at death can be highly correlated
with the concentration of inheritances received. This can have profound implications for in-
tergenerational wealth mobility as well as the perceived equity of the current distribution of
wealth. As recalled in a recent work by Cannari and D'Alessio (2018) "a society that registers a
significantly higher possibility of economic success depending on inherited family wealth tends
to generate discontent and is a source of possible tensions on the part of the disadvantaged
population." In his concluding remarks, Atkinson (2013) wrote that "[i]f inheritance is return-
ing, then we need to look again at its role as a basis for taxation." In stark contrast with this
vision, this paper also documents how revenues collected from inheritance experienced a three-
fold decline from 0.15% to 0.05% of total tax revenue between 1995 and 2016. The declining
weight of the inheritance and gift taxes documented in this paper have, above and beyond other
economic and fiscal factors, favoured the accumulation of wealth through interpersonal wealth
transfers. This may well have had repercussions for the evolution of the wealth distribution
too. As suggested by Cowell et al. (2018), wealth transfer taxes are very important for "the
long-run distribution of wealth, reducing equilibrium inequality (the `predistribution' effect)
by a much larger amount than what is apparent in terms of the immediate impact of the tax
(the `redistribution' effect)."

A       Adjusting the value of real estate in the inheritance tax
        records
Real estate assets are declared using a notional valuation (i.e. cadastral value) for inheritance
tax purposes, rather the current market value. As Italian real estate cadastral values are typ-
ically well below market values, the use of unadjusted amounts declared in the inheritance
tax returns will lead to distorted distributional information as well as an underestimation of
the value of personal wealth. Ideally, one would want to substitute the cadastral value for
its equivalent market price for every building recorded within tax data. However, this would
require an extremely refined and sophisticated set of data which is not possible to access. To
overcome this problem, instead, we multiply the cadastral values by an annual adjustment
factor derived as the share of average national nominal house price and cadastral value.

   The derived ratio of average market price to cadastral value of housing is observed to be
constant over the years 2009-2012 and equal to 3.3. In the following years, and following the
reduction of housing prices, the ratio declined to 3.2 in 2013, 3.0 in 2014-2015 and 2.9 in 2016.
The detailed time series of adjustment factors applied to our data for 2009-2012 is shown in
table 2.

    Average annual market value of properties for the years 2009-2016 is obtained from the
"Osservatorio del Mercato Immobiliare - OMI", published by the Revenue Agency/Nomisma.
Similarly, data on the average annual cadastral rent of houses owned by physical persons are
derived from the internal data of the Revenue Agency and the Ministry of Economics and
Finance, "Analisi Patrimonio Immobiliare - API", used for the annual publication by the Min-
istry of Economy and Finance "Gli immobili in Italia.

    The average cadastral values are then derived multiplying average cadastral rents by tax
coefficients used for the inheritance tax base. For owner-occupying houses the coefficient equals
100 up to 2003 and 110 since 2004, and since 1997 an additional flat re-valuation of cadastral
value of 5 percent is applied for tax purposes.25

  25
    The cadastral value for year 2013, as an example, would therefore be derived as the cadastral rent in 2013
times 110 times 1.05.

   Average cadastral value was relatively stable at around A
                                                           C56 thousand between 2009 and
2016, whereas the average marked value declined, over the same period, from A
                                                                            C186 thousand
to A
   C162 thousand.

    Unfortunately, for the years before 2009 we could not resort to the publication "Gli im-
mobili in Italia" and we had to estimate the ratio of market price to cadastral value. To do
so, we estimated the average market value by using the observed yearly variation of housing
prices (using the Bank of International Settlements - BIS - estimates of nominal growth rate of
house price index based on the published figures by the Bank of Italy for more recent years).
Similarly, we made use of the average yearly percentage change of average cadastral rent over
the period 2007-2013, to estimate the average cadastral value between 1995 and 2009. Cadas-
tral rents increased, on average, by 0.4 percent every year. As explained above, allowance for
changes in the tax legislation affecting the cadastral values should also be made. As detailed
in table 3, the derived yearly adjustment factors applied to the cadastral values range between
1.9 in 1995 to 3.3 in 2013.

    The use of a yearly national adjustment factor for cadastral values may have a series
of shortcomings. First, the use of a national multiplier ignores disaggregated geographical
heterogeneity. This may affect estimates of wealth concentration as long as such unobserved
geographical heterogeneity correlates with wealth rankings. Similarly, we adopted a unique
adjustment factor across cadastral classes. However, different cadastral classes has different
cadastral adjustment coefficients to be applied to the cadastral rent for tax purposes. As
written above, as of January 2004, 110 is the multiplier applied to the main owner-occupied
housing (the so called `prima casa', falling within the cadastral classes A/1 to A/11 with the
exception of A/10). The coefficient, as of mid 2004, is 120 if the house is not the main residence.


                                                                     29
These coefficients apply to regular dwellings, to castles, villas, and historical building alike.
If most secondary houses were concentrated only in the hands of wealthy individuals, the use
of a constant adjustment factor to house cadastral rents, may create a bias. Other things
being equal, this may result in a upward bias for our estimates of wealth concentration, as the
reported value of a secondary house in the inheritance tax return is 9% higher than the owner
occupied house (120/110). However, the final effect on the wealth shares cannot be entirely
known in advance as second homes may also have a larger systematic undervaluation of market
value. Cadastral multiplier vary according to the type of real estate, 120 also applies to many
buildings in the C cadastral categories such as covered car parks, cellars, stores, laboratories
and small businesses, with the exception of shops (cadastral category C1), in this case the
coefficient is 40.8. On land rents the coefficient is 90 and on offices rent (cadastral category A10)
the coefficient is 60. Other cadastral categories mainly apply to public spaces and buildings
and may not be relevant for personal ownership of real estates. As a systematic assessment of
the market value of all different cadastral categories is not available, it is not possible to assess
how the adjustment factor based on the owner-occupied houses we used fits with the degree of
underestimation of cadastral values of other real estate categories. Unfortunately, we could not
obtain the information about cadastral types from our individual data but we could observe
the share composition of different types of buildings owned by different individuals across the
income distribution. Although not precise this exercise provides informative results. Indeed,
real estate different from housing represent less than 10% of household real estate wealth and
is distributed quite evenly across income classes. Despite some existing heterogeneity, the
share of houses and apartment structure remains quite high even for the highest income class
(86%). Therefore, unless the cadastral heterogeneity is systematically correlated to unobserved
geographical variations, allowing for different adjustment factors should not produce large
biases in our estimates.
