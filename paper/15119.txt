                                                ABSTRACT

This paper evaluates whether the cyclical pattern of fiscal policy can affect growth. We first build
a simple endogenous growth model where entrepreneurs can invest either in short-run projects or in
long-term growth enhancing projects. Long-term projects involve a liquidity risk which credit constrained
firms try to overcome by borrowing on the basis of their short-run profits. By increasing firms' market
size in recessions, a countercyclical fiscal policy will boost investment in productivity-enhancing long-term
projects, and the more so in sectors that rely more on external financing or which display lower asset
tangibility. Second, the paper tests this prediction using Rajan and Zingales (1998)'s diff-and-diff methodology
on a panel data sample of manufacturing industries across 17 OECD countries over the period 1980-2005.
The evidence confirms that the positive effects of a more countercyclical fiscal policy on value added
growth, productivity growth, and R&D expenditure, are indeed larger in industries with heavier reliance
on external finance or lower asset tangibility.

1     Introduction

Standard macroeconomic textbooks are generally divided into two largely separate parts: the analysis of

long-run growth, which at best is linked to structural characteristics of the economy (education, R&D,

openness to trade, …nancial development); and the short term analysis, which emphasizes the short-term

e¤ects of productivity or demand shocks and the e¤ects of macroeconomic policies (…scal and/or monetary)

aimed at stabilizing the economy. Yet, recently the view that short-run stabilization policies should have

no signi…cant impact on long run growth, has been challenged by several empirical papers, notably Ramey

and Ramey (1995) who …nd a negative correlation in cross-country regression between volatility and long-

run growth.1 More recently, using a Schumpeterian growth framework, Aghion, Angeletos, Banerjee and

Manova (2008) (henceforth AABM) have argued that higher macroeconomic volatility a¤ects the composition

of …rms’investments and in particular pushes towards more pro-cyclical R&D investments in …rms that are

more credit constrained.

    This paper goes one step further by analyzing the e¤ect of a more countercyclical …scal policy on in-

dustry growth, depending upon the …nancial constraints faced by the industry2 . Our basic purpose is two

fold. It is …rst to show that the link between volatility and growth is not only structural: macroeconomic

policies that a¤ects the former also a¤ect the latter. Second, we want to argue that even if the impact of

a countercyclical …scal stimulus policy on aggregate GDP may be limited in the short-run, there may be

economically signi…cant gains from such a policy in terms of long-run growth.

    Our analysis proceeds in two steps. First, we build a simple model to illustrate how the cyclical component

of …scal policy can a¤ect growth in sectors that are more or less …nancially constrained. Second, we use cross

industry/cross-country panel data to test our main theoretical predictions, and provide empirical evidence

of a more positive and signi…cant impact of stabilizing …scal policy on industry growth in more …nancially

constrained industries.

   1 Additional evidence can be found in the work of Bruno (1993) on in‡ation and growth, of Hausman and Gavin (1996) for

Latin American countries, or more recently Imbs (2007)
   2 Showing that a more countercyclical …scal policy has a signi…cantly positive e¤ect on industry growth in more …nancially

constrained industries, would also point to a welfare e¤ect of such a policy that should go well beyond the welfare improvement
pointed out by Lucas (1987): in his model with exogenous growth, the welfare gains from stabilization only, are welfare
equivalent to a very modest increase in long-run growth.



                                                              2
    In our model, …scal policy impacts on long-run growth by a¤ecting how much more investment is di-

rected towards productivity enhancing activity. More speci…cally, as in AABM, …rms choose to direct their

investment either towards short-run projects that do not increase the stock of knowledge in the economy, or

towards productivity enhancing long-term projects. The completion of long-term innovative projects is in

turn subject to a liquidity risk: namely, such projects can only implemented if the …rm overcome a liquidity

shock that may occur during the interim period. Consequently, credit constrained …rms may also choose to

invest in the short-run project in order to generate cash-‡ow revenues which will subsequently help them

overcome the liquidity shock. The aggregate business cycle interferes with …rms’decision whether to invest

more in long-term innovative projects, through a market size e¤ect: namely, the market size for both long-

term and short-term projects is lower during a recession than during a boom. Current market size does

not a¤ect the allocation of investment between long-run and short-run projects as much as expected future

market size a¤ects long-term investment.3 This, together with the assumption that a recession is more likely

to occur tomorrow if it is already occurring today, implies: …rst, that …rms will engage less in long-term

productivity-enhancing investments during recessions than during booms; second, that a policy which com-

mits to increase market-size by the time long-term projects are to be completed, induces …rm to increase

long-term investment. This e¤ect is stronger the lower the market-size prior to government intervention

and also the more credit-constrained …rms are. Consequently, a countercyclical policy increases productivity

growth, the higher the share of investment …nanced through external capital (which in the model is proxied

by the size of the liquidity shock) and the lower asset tangibility.

    In the second part of the paper we test the main prediction of the model, namely that a countercyclical

…scal policy increases productivity growth, the higher the share of investment …nanced through external

capital (which in the model is proxied by the size of the liquidity shock) and the lower asset tangibility.

    A simple approach to assessing the impact of countercyclical economic policies on growth, would be

to regress growth outcomes (e.g output or labour productivity growth) on some indicator which re‡ects

   3 A higher market size today, has two counteracting e¤ects on investment composition. On the one hand it encourages

higher short-term investment since these will yield higher short-run pro…ts. On the other hand, it encourages higher long term
investment since the higher cash-‡ow induced by the increased market size in the short run, will also help credit-constrained
…rms overcome interim liquidity shocks and thereby complete their long term projects.



                                                              3
the degree of countercyclicality of …scal policy and the interaction between this indicator and a measure

of credit constraints. Everything else remaining equal, such an approach should tell us for example about

how much extra growth can be expected from moving say from a more to a less procyclical …scal policy.

However, there are at least three important issues that preclude a proper interpretation of this type of

straightforward exercise. First, the cyclicality of (…scal) policy is typically captured by a unique time-

invariant parameter which only varies across countries. As a result, standard cross-country panel regression

cannot be used to assess to the e¤ect of the cyclical pattern of …scal policy on growth in as much as the

former is perfectly collinear to the …xed e¤ect that is traditionally introduced to control for unobserved

                                    4
cross-country heterogeneity.            Second, the causality issue -does a positive correlation between …scal policy

countercyclicality and growth re‡ect the e¤ect of …scal policy cyclicality on growth or the e¤ect of growth on

the cyclical pattern of …scal policy- cannot be properly addressed while maintaining the analysis at a pure

macroeconomic level.5 But then, how can we use the results from the regression analysis to estimate the

                                                                                                                                     6
growth gain/loss from a change in the cyclical pattern of …scal policy and then draw policy implications?

A …nal concern is identi…cation: a cross-country panel regression, particularly one which is restricted to a

small cross-country sample, is unlikely to be robust to the inclusion of additional control variables re‡ecting

alternative stories. Thus, even if cross-country panel regressions may point at correlations between the

cyclical pattern of …scal policy and growth, the channel through which this correlation works is not likely to

be well identi…ed by a pure country level analysis.

    The approach we follow in this paper allows us to address each of the above issues. More speci…cally,

we follow the methodology developed in the seminal paper by Rajan and Zingales (1998) and use cross-

industry/cross-country panel data on a sample of 17 OECD countries over the overall period 1980-2005, to

test whether industry growth is positively a¤ected by the interaction between …scal policy cyclicality (which

   4 To solve this issue, Aghion and Marinescu (2007) introduce time-varying estimates of …scal policy cyclicality. While this

helps controlling for unobserved heterogeneity, it comes at the cost of loosing precision in the estimates of …scal policy cyclicality.
   5 One particular reason for this, is that …scal policy cyclicality is used in growth regressions as a right hand side variable

meanwhile the estimation of time-varying …scal policy cyclicality requires using the full data sample. See Aghion and Marinescu
(2007).
   6 One answer to this problem would be to use instrumental variables. However cross-country panel IV regressions typically

use internal instruments, i.e. lagged values of right hand side variables. In the case of time-varying estimates of …scal policy
cyclicality, this boils down to using forward information as instruments, in which case instruments cannot be exogenous.




                                                                  4
is computed at country level for all countries in the sample) and industry level external …nancial dependence

or asset tangibility (which are computed for each corresponding industry in the US). That this approach

helps us overcome the three issues stated above, follows from the following considerations: …rst, even though

we estimate the countercyclicality of …scal policy at country level by a time-invariant coe¢ cient (which we

derive for each country by regressing various indicators of …scal policy on the output gap in this country over a

given time period), and therefore …scal policy countercyclicality in each country is collinear to that country’s

…xed e¤ect, the interaction between the country level measure of countercyclicality and the industry level

variable is not. Second, the interaction term helps solve the identi…cation issue to the extent that by working

at cross-industry level we have enough observations that our results withstand the introduction of country

…xed e¤ects plus a whole set of structural variables as additional controls. Finally, this approach helps us deal

with the causality issue: in particular, to the extent that macroeconomic policy should a¤ect industry level

growth whereas the opposite - industry level growth a¤ecting macroeconomic policy- is less likely to hold,

…nding a positive and signi…cant interaction coe¢ cient in the growth regressions, is informative as to whether

the cyclical pattern of …scal policy indeed has a causal impact on growth.7 However, there is a downside

to the industry level investigation: namely, our di¤erence in di¤erence analysis has little to say about the

magnitude of the macroeconomic growth gain/loss induced by di¤erent patterns of cyclicality in …scal policy.

At best, our empirical estimates provide qualitative evidence of the growth e¤ect of countercyclical …scal

policy.8

    Our empirical results can be summarized as follows. First, …scal policy countercyclicality - measured

as the sensitivity of a country’s total or primary …scal balance (relative to GDP) to time variations in

its output gap - has a positive signi…cant and robust impact on industry growth, the higher the extent

to which the corresponding industry in the US relies on external …nance, or the lower asset tangibility of

   7 Fiscal policy cyclicality could be endogenous to the industry level composition of total output if for example industries that

bene…t more from …scal policy counter-cyclicality do lobby more for counter-cyclical …scal policy. However, to the extent that
there are decreasing returns to scale (which is likely to be the case in the manufacturing industries featuring in our empirical
analysis), this would rather imply a downward bias in our estimates of the positive impact of …scal policy counter-cyclicality
on growth. Hence controlling for this possible source of endogeneity would only reinforce our conclusions by reducing this
downward bias.
   8 Extrapolating from our results to derive more aggregate numerical conclusions, is further complicated by our focusing on

the growth for manufacturing industries while the total share of manufacturing industries in total value added is about 40%
not more. In particular, assessing the global macroeconomic e¤ect of …scal policy cyclicality would require an assessment of the
impact on the service sector.


                                                                5
the corresponding sector in the US. This result obtains whether growth is measured by real value added

growth or by labour productivity growth. Using the regression coe¢ cients one can assess the magnitude of

the corresponding di¤-in-di¤ e¤ect: that is, how much extra growth do we generate when say …scal policy

countercyclicality and external …nancial dependence move from the 25% to the 75% percentile. The …gures

happen to be relatively large, especially when compared to the equivalent …gures in Rajan and Zingales

(1998). This in turn suggests that the e¤ect of a more countercyclical …scal policy in more …nancially

constrained industries, is economically signi…cant. Second, we show that our baseline result is robust to: (i)

distinguishing between industries with positive …nancial dependence and industries with negative …nancial

dependence; (ii) removing particular countries from the regression exercise; (iii) adding control variables such

as …nancial development, in‡ation, and average …scal balance interacted with the industry level variables

(external …nancial dependence or asset tangibility); (iv) instrumenting …scal policy cyclicality with economic,

legal and political variables. Third, we decompose …scal policy between its revenue side and its expenditure

sides. We then obtain two somewhat surprising results: …rst, countercyclicality in total government revenues

has approximately the same e¤ect as countercyclicality in total government expenditures. Second, when

focusing on primary government expenditures and revenues, the empirical evidence shows that the e¤ect

of countercyclicality in primary government expenditures (interacted with industry …nancial dependence or

asset tangibility), is about twice as large as the impact of countercyclicality in primary government revenues.

    Our analysis contributes to at least three ongoing debates among macroeconomists: 1) is there a (causal)

link between volatility and growth?; 2) what is the optimal design of intertemporal …scal policy? 3) what are

the e¤ects of a countercyclical …scal stimulus on aggregate output? That the correlation between long-run

growth and volatility is not entirely causal, is stressed by Acemoglu and Zilibotti (1997) who point to low

…nancial development as a factor that could both, reduce long-run growth and increase the volatility of the

economy. More recently, Acemoglu, Johnson, Robinson and Thaicharoen (2003) and Easterly (2005) hold

that both, high volatility and low long-run growth do not directly arise from policy decisions but rather

   9 As it turns out, over the most recent period, countercyclicality in government revenues appears to have had little e¤ect on

industry real value added and labour productivity growth.


                                                               6
from bad institutions. However, …scal policy cyclicality varies a lot even among OECD countries (Lane

(2003)) which share similar institutions. Thus, the …nding of signi…cant correlations between growth and

countercyclical …scal policy in a sample of OECD countries may say something after all as to the growth

e¤ect of cyclical …scal policy, over and above the e¤ect of more structural variables. As mentioned above,

AABM defend the view that higher volatility should induce lower growth by discouraging long-term growth-

enhancing investment particularly in more credit constrained …rms. Aghion, Bacchetta, Ranciere and Rogo¤

(2006) build on that insight when analyzing the relationship between long-run growth and the choice of

exchange-rate regime.10

    The case for a countercyclical …scal policy was most forcefully made by Barro (1979): a countercyclical

…scal policy helps smooth out intertemporal consumption when production is a¤ected by exogenous shocks,

thereby improving welfare. Another justi…cation for countercyclical …scal policy stems from a more Keynesian

view of the cycle: namely, to the extent that a recession corresponds to an increase in the ine¢ ciency of the

economy, appropriate …scal or monetary policy that raises aggregate demand can bring the economy closer

to the e¢ cient level of production (see Galí, Gertler, López-Salido (2007)).11 The e¤ect of …scal policy in our

model is di¤erent: …scal policy a¤ects growth through a market-size e¤ect: e.g by increasing expenditures,

the government can induce …rms to devote more investment to long-term projects, as innovations will then

pay out more.12

    Finally, an extended literature looks at the - short-run - output response to an exogenous increase in

government spending or to a tax cut. Importantly in these papers, GDP is usually detrended, so that all

long-run e¤ects are shut down. Although most economists would agree on the fact that a …scal shock should

increase short-run output, there is no consensus on the magnitude of the e¤ect.13 In particular, papers

  1 0 See Aghion and Banerjee (2005) and Aghion and Howitt (2009, ch14) for more complete literature reviews on the link

between volatility and long-run growth.
  1 1 Consequently, government purchases needs to remain above the level implied by the optimal provision of public good, as

their role is dual: providing a public good, and increasing the e¢ ciency in the economy (Galí J. (2005)).
  1 2 In Barro (1990)’s AK model however, growth decreases with utility-type expenditures and it increases only initially with

productive government expenditures. Let us also mention political economy explanations for why …scal policy often fails to be
countercyclical (for instance Alesina, Campante, and Tabellini (2008))
  1 3 Skeptical views on the importance of the e¤ect of …scal shocks include Mountford and Uhlig (2008) who defend tax cuts

over government spending increases, or Perotti (2005) who shows, based on a sample of 5 OECD countries, that government
spending multipliers larger than 1 can be seen only in the US pre-1980 period, but who does not …nd that tax cuts works
better than government spending increases. On the other hand, Fatas and Mihov (2001b) …nd that an increase in government
spending (especially government wage expenditures increase) induces increases in consumption and employment. All the above



                                                              7
that introduce rational expectations and long-run wealth e¤ects, will typically predict a lower value of the

multiplier (based on the idea that consumers anticipate that an increase in government spending today is

likely to result in an increase in taxes tomorrow).14 We move beyond this debate by looking only at the

long-run e¤ect of a more countercyclical …scal policy: even if the short-run e¤ect of a more countercyclical

policy was more in line with the prediction of low multipliers, our results point to economically signi…cant

long-run e¤ect.

    The remaining part of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 develops the theoretical model and

derives the main predictions to be subsequently tested. Section 3 details the econometric methodology and

presents the data sources used in our estimations. Section 4 presents our baseline results. Section 5 presents

the robustness checks, in particular whether the growth impact of countercyclical …scal policy is robust to

the inclusions of additional structural characteristics. Section 6 looks at the composition of …scal policy into

its expenditure and revenue components. Finally Section 7 concludes.




2     Cyclical …scal policy and growth: a toy model

2.1     Basic setup

The environment The model builds on Aghion, Angeletos, Banerjee and Manova (2008), henceforth

AABM. We consider a discrete time model of an economy populated by a continuum of two-periods lived

entrepreneurs (…rms). Each …rm starts out with a positive amount of wealth W = wT , where T denotes

the accumulated knowledge at the beginning of the current period, and w denotes the …rm’s knowledge

mentioned papers use VAR analysis, Blanchard and Perotti (2002), uses a mixed VAR - event study approach to show that both,
increases in government spending and tax cuts have a positive e¤ect on GDP; they also …nd - like Alesina, Ardagna, Perotti
and Schiantarelli (2002) - that …scal policy shocks have a negative e¤ect on investment; note that this does not contradict
our theory which points at investments being directed towards more productivity enhancing projects as the channel whereby
long-run growth is enhanced by a more countercyclical …scal policy.
   Somewhat closer to the analysis in this paper, Tagkalakis and Athanasios (2008) shows on a panel of 19 OECD countries
from 1970 to 2002 that the e¤ects of …scal policy changes on private consumption is higher in recessions than in expansions.
Interestingly, they explain this phenomenon by the presence of more liquidity constrained consumers in recessions, and show
that the e¤ect is more pronounced in countries characterized by less developed consumer credit markets.
  1 4 For example Cogan, Cwik, Taylor and Wieland (2009) use the Smets-Wouters (2007) model and compute the e¤ect of a

permanent increase by 1% of GDP of government expenditures as of 2009: by 2011 Q4, they …nd that the increase in GDP is
only equal to 0.44%, whereas Romer and Bernstein (2009) …nd a 1.57% increase. Finally, based on narrative records (political
speeches, Congressional reports, ...) Romer and Romer (2007) …nd that - exogenous - tax increases are highly contractionary.

adjusted wealth. Initial wealth can be invested in two di¤erent projects: a short term investment project

that generates output in the current period and a long term innovation project which, when successful,

generates production with higher productivity next period. The short term investment project may involve

maintaining existing equipment, or expanding a business using the same kind of technology and equipment,

or increasing marketing expenses. The long term project may consist in learning a new skill, learning about

a new technology, or investing in R&D. Investing in the long term project increases the stock of knowledge

available in the economy next period, whereas investing in the short term project does not contribute to

knowledge growth.

   Both, short term and long term pro…ts are proportional to market demand (see Acemoglu and Linn

(2006)). More speci…cally, by investing capital K = kT in the short term project, where k denotes the

knowledge adjusted short-run capital investment, a …rm generates short-run pro…ts



                                           1 (K; Pj )   =T    1 (k; Pj );




where

                                               1 (k; Pj )   = Pj k


is the knowledge-adjusted short-run pro…t, Pj is proportional to the private component of demand, and

j denotes the aggregate state of the economy. The realization of state j 2 fL; Hg capture an aggregate

trade (or market size) shock P; which can take two value PH > PL and follows a Markovian process with

probability p of remaining in the same state in the next period. As is often done in the literature on real

business cycles, we assume that p > 1=2; i.e that the aggregate shock on P displays some positive degree of

persistence over time.

   Now, consider …rms’long term investments. As in AABM, we shall assume that after the R&D investment

Z = zT has been incurred, where z denotes the knowledge-adjusted long-term innovative investment, the

…rm faces an idiosyncratic liquidity shock C = cT; where c is uniformly distributed on the interval [0; c].

Only those …rms that are able to raise enough money to pay their liquidity cost, will be able to produce in



                                                        9
the second period.

      Given that all …rms start out with same initial wealth W = wT; there is no borrowing and lending in

equilibrium at the beginning of a period. However, once the idiosyncratic liquidity shocks are realized, …rms

with low liquidity shocks will typically lend to …rms facing higher liquidity shocks.15

      As in AABM, we assume that due to ex post moral hazard considerations16 …rms cannot borrow more

than             1 times their current cash ‡ow in order to overcome the liquidity shock. We can interpret

as a proxy for the tangibility of the …rm’ assets: more tangible assets are typically associated with lower

monitoring costs for potential creditors, and therefore to a higher value of the credit multiplier                            : The

parameter c re‡ects for example the extent to which the …rm depends upon external …nance: the higher

c; the less likely it is that the …rm will be able to cover its liquidity shock using only its retained earnings

T     1 (k; Pj ):   In fact, given the uniformity of the distribution of liquidity costs, long-term investments will

survive the liquidity shock with probability

             constraints prevent …rms from achieving full insurance against these idiosyncratic liquidity shocks.

          Aghion, Banerjee and Piketty (1999).
  1 7 Following Aghion, Banerjee and Piketty (1999) or AABM, we take        to be constant over time. Alternative formulations, for
example Holmstrom and Tirole (1995) based on ex ante moreal hazard, would generate a credit multiplier which is negatively
correlated with the interest rate., and therefore typically procyclical. A procyclical would only reinforce the optimality of
countercyclical …scal policy established later in this section.
  1 8 The model is built in order to illustrate the empirical results that the more externally …nancially dependent …rms are the

one that bene…ts the most from contracyclicality. Hence we want to abstract from other factors that will favor contracyclicality,
which is why we use linear technologies.


                                                                 10

Government policy Unlike private agents, the government has access to costless and unbounded access to

international credit each period before the state of the world is revealed.21 Government’s policy is determined

each period before the current state j of nature is revealed, but can be dependent on the previous state of

                                                                                     x
nature (denoted by x). Government policy therefore consists of a 4-uple sxL ; sxH ; gL    x
                                                                                       ; gH ; where sxj denote

the subsidies/tax that a …rm must pay before initiating its investments, and gjx denotes the government

expenditures next period, if the current state is j and the state last period was x. The timing of government

intervention, can be described as follows: (i) at the beginning of each period, before the state of nature j for

that period is realized, the government chooses its policy (sxj ; gjx )j=L;H which depends upon the state of the

world x at the end of last period; (ii) once the current state of nature j = H; L is realized, the government

implements the policy (sxj ; gjx ):

  1 9 Our analysis encompasses the case where tomorrow’ s private revenue is proportional, not equal to the expected private

market size E (Ph jj) : This just involves reinterpreting the multiplier :
  2 0 In AABM we consider a variant of this model where only successful innovators (those who overcome the liquidity shock)

contribute to knowledge growth. Below we discuss how our results would be modi…ed if we adopt this alternative speci…cation.
  2 1 We shall assume that the government can credibly commit to a budget limit. This, in turn, is consistent with the assumption

that the government can borrow more and at lower cost than private agents. Here, we also refer the reader to Homstrom and
Tirole (1998) on private versus public provisions of liquidity.




                                                               11
Timing of events The overall timing of events within each period, is as follows: (i) the state of nature

j is realized; (ii) …rms make their investment decisions, given their correct anticipations about government

policy (sxj ; gjx ); (iii) liquidity shocks are realized and …rms lend to or borrow from one another; (iv) …rms

that can overcome their idiosyncratic liquidity shocks innovate and thereby generate a pro…t next period.



2.2       A …rm’s maximization problem

In this subsection we take government policy as given and analyze …rms’ optimal investment decisions.

Given that …rms are ex ante identical, there exists a symmetric equilibrium where all …rms make the same

investment decisions, and we concentrate attention on this particular equilibrium. For simplicity we take the

discount factor between two periods to be equal to 1. Then, once the current state of nature j is realized,

a representative …rm in state j chooses knowledge-adjusted investments (k; z) to maximize the expected

present value, that is current pro…ts plus expected future revenues:


                                                                         Pj k
                                            max Pj k + z min                  ; 1 Ehjj Ph + gjx
                                                                         c

                        subject to :        k+z       w + sxj :



   One can …rst establish:


Lemma 1 If there is always a positive probability of unsuccessful innovation, the manager chooses zj =

max( 12    w + sxj           c
                                            ; 0).
                        (Ehjj (Ph )+gjx )

   In particular when
                                                                                     !
                                        1                              c
                                   zj =        w+   sxj                                  > 0;
                                        2                         Ehjj (Ph ) + gjx

then government taxes/subsidies sxj do not a¤ect the di¤erence between the long term innovative investment

z and the short term capital investment k: a higher s increases the amount of cash available for …rms to

invest, however it does not a¤ect the relative pro…tability of long versus short term investments. Increasing gjx

will instead a¤ect the market size for successful innovators tomorrow and therefore the relative pro…tability



                                                             12
of long term innovative investment compared to short run capital investment.


Remark 1 The fact that government expenditures are targeted towards long term projects is not the driving

force behind this last conclusion. To see this, suppose instead that government expenditures decided at t                                   1,

also a¤ ect the market for short term projects at t: This has two e¤ ects on …rms born in period t: on the one

hand, investing in short term projects becomes more attractive because market size is increased in the short

run; on the other hand, …rms now have more cash in hand to overcome the potential liquidity shock. As long
                                                                              (Pj +gx )k
as we are in an interior solution case (with z > 0 and                           c         < 1) these two forces turn out to exactly

o¤ set each other.22


Remark 2 Whether pro…ts of short term investments are linear in k (as it is the case here) or proportional

to k    (as it is the case in AABM) does not a¤ ect our results: in the latter case, we would then get zj =

 1                                 c
1+     w + sxj                                   -

2.3      Growth e¤ect of increasing the countercyclicality of government spending

The main conjecture we consider in the empirical part of the paper, is that a more countercyclical …scal

policy, and particularly more countercyclical government expenditures, are more growth-enhancing in sectors

that are more dependent on external …nance or in sectors with more intangible capital. Here, we show how

our toy model generates this prediction.

                                                                                                         1                    c
     More formally, consider the case where in both states of the world zj =                             2   w + sxj                         .
                                                                                                                        (Ehjj (Ph )+gjx )

  2 2 Indeed   the representative …rms then choose k, z such that
                                                                                 (Pj + gx ) k
                                           max       (Pj + gx ) k + z min                     ; 1 Ehjj       Ph + gjx
                                                                                    c
                                                                  k

                                                              c

so the interior solution is still given by
                                                        0                                       1

Then, the expected growth rate is simply equal to



                                                   E (zjx) = pzx + (1           p) z   x




or equivalently

    Now consider the growth e¤ect of moving from an acyclical policy whereby gxx = g x x = g x to the

                        x
countercyclical policy gL = g x + (1                       x

                   x           x
consumption, with gL          gH = ".

    We have:

  2 3 We can see from the above expression that if  was procyclical the bene…t from countercyclicality would be higher. Indeed,
in this case, under laissez-faire …rms would cut long term investments by more during slumps.




                                                                      14
Thus the more …rms depend upon external …nance (that is, the higher c), the more positive is the growth

response to a more countercyclical expenditures policy.

      Similarly
                                                  @ 2 E ( zjx)

      So the tighter …rms’credit constraints, for example because of higher asset intangibility (that is the lower

 ), the more growth bene…ts from countercyclical policy.

      A mean preserving spread of sj on the contrary has no impact on growth, since the equilibrium R&D

intensity z is linear in the amount of initial wealth available for investment. Hence:


Proposition 2 When optimal investment is an interior solution, a mean preserving spread in government
                                                                                               j               j
expenditures towards more countercyclicality increases long-term investment in R&D as long as gL              gH

(2p     1) (PH    PL ) : Moreover, this e¤ ect is increased when c is higher or    is lower. On the contrary, a

change in sjL     sjH does not have any long-term growth e¤ ect.


      Thus, a smaller expected market size for long term projects reduces the amount of knowledge augmenting

investment. Given that the credit constraint induces a concavity in the …rm’s pro…t function (since more

long term investment also means a lower probability to overcome the liquidity shock), more countercyclical

expenditure policy will increase expected growth. The probability that long term projects do not carry

through, is increasing in z, and all the more so when c is higher or        is lower. This in turn explains why

R&D incentives and therefore growth will be enhanced by a more countercyclical policy, all the more in …rms

which depend more upon external …nance or in …rms with less tangible assets.

      One can show that the growth-maximizing level of countercyclicality is obtained for " = (2p    1) (PH    PL )

(as long as this translates into positive government spending in both states of the world), that is for expected

long term projects with market size equalized across states of nature.


Remark 3 One could go further and derive the growth maximizing policy subject to the constraint that the

budget must be balanced in expectation - and also subject to some upper limit on the allowed government

to increase the market size for long term investments up to the point where the marginal bene…t of government

expenditures (which is to increase the share of entrepreneurial wealth devoted to long-term investments) is

equal to its marginal cost (which is to reduce the entrepreneur’s ex ante wealth because of taxation). This

                                   c
optimal market size is given by      : in other words, since the expected private market size is smaller when

the economy is currently in a slump, government expenditures should be higher in a slump than in a boom in

order to maximize RD incentives and thereby knowledge growth. Finally, letting the government smooth its

budget over the cycle makes it possible to have a countercyclical policy in government expenditures without

requiring a procyclical policy in taxes.


    To summarize the main predictions of the model: (i) countercyclical government expenditures are more

growth-enhancing for …rms that are more dependent upon external …nance or in …rms with less tangible

assets; (ii) it is the countercyclicality of government expenditures, more than that of government tax or

subsidies, which matter for growth in economies with such …rms. We now confront these predictions to the

data.




3       Econometric methodology and data

The left-hand side (henceforth, LHS) variable of our main estimation equation, is the average annual growth

rate of real value added or alternatively labour productivity in industry j in country k for a given period of

time, say [t; t + n] . Labour productivity is de…ned as the ratio of real value added to total employment.24 On

the right hand side (henceforth, RHS), we introduce industry and country …xed e¤ects f               j;   kg   to control for

unobserved heterogeneity across industries and across countries. The variable of interest (icj )                f pct;t+n
                                                                                                                    k     , is

the interaction between industry j’s characteristic (namely, external …nancial dependence or asset tangibility)

and the degree of (counter-) cyclicality of …scal policy in country k over the period [t; t + n]. Finally, we

not productivity per hour as measurement error is more likely to a¤ect the latter than the former.

the LHS variable is labour productivity growth, then yjk is the initial labour productivity in industry j in

country k whereas ykt is the average labour productivity in the manufacturing sector in country k. Letting

    Following Rajan and Zingales (1998) we measure industry speci…c characteristics using …rm level data

in the US. External …nancial dependence is measured as the average across all …rms in a given industry of

the ratio of capital expenditures minus current cash ‡ow to total capital expenditures. Asset tangibility is

measured as the average across all …rms in a given industry of the ratio of the value of net property, plant

and equipment to total assets. This methodology is predicated on the assumptions that: (i) di¤erences in

…nancial dependence/asset tangibility across industries are largely driven by di¤erences in technology; (ii)

technological di¤erences persist over time across countries; (iii) countries are relatively similar in terms of

the overall institutional environment faced by …rms. Under those three assumptions, the US based industry-

speci…c measure is likely to be a valid interactor for industries in countries other than the US.25 Now, there are

good reasons to believe that these assumptions are satis…ed particularly if we restrict the empirical analysis

to a sample of OECD countries. For example, if pharmaceuticals require proportionally more external

…nance than textiles in the US, this is likely to be the case in other OECD countries. Moreover, since little

convergence has occurred among OECD countries over the past twenty years, cross-country di¤erences are

likely to persist over time. Finally, to the extent that the US are more …nancially developed than other

countries worldwide, US based measures of …nancial dependence as well as asset tangibility are likely to

provide the least noisy measures of industry level …nancial dependence or asset tangibility.

    We now focus attention on how to measure …scal policy cyclicality over the time interval [t; t + n] ; i.e

  2 5 Note however that this measure is unlikely to be valid for the US as it likely re‡ects the equilibrium of supply and demand

for capital in the US and therefore is endogenous.



                                                                     17
how to construct the RHS variable f pct;t+n
                                      k     . Our approach is to measure …scal policy cyclicality as the

marginal change in …scal policy following a change in the domestic output gap. Thus we use country-level

data over the period [t; t + n] to estimate the following country-by-country "auxiliary" equation:



                                               defk =     k   + f pct;t+n
                                                                    k     zk + u k ;                                              (2)



where: (i)      2 [t; t + n] ; (ii) defk is a measure of …scal policy in country k in year                    : for example total

…scal balance, primary balance, total government expenditures, or government revenues, as a ratio of GDP;

(iii) zk measures the output gap in country k in year , that is the percentage di¤erence between actual and

potential GDP, and therefore represents the country’s current position in the cycle; (iv)                     k   is a constant and

uk is an error term.

    Equation (2) is estimated separately for each country k in our sample. For example, if the LHS of (2)

is the ratio of …scal balance to GDP, a positive (resp. negative) regression coe¢ cient (f pct;t+n
                                                                                             k     ) re‡ects a

countercyclical (resp. pro-cyclical) …scal policy as the country’s …scal balance improves (resp. deteriorates)

in upturns.

    Moreover, as robustness checks, we consider the case where …scal policy indicators in regression (2)

are measured as a ratio to potential and not current GDP. This alternative speci…cation helps make sure

that the cyclicality parameter f pckt;t+n captures changes in the numerator of the LHS variable -related to

…scal policy- rather than in the denominator -related to cyclical variations in output-.26 Furthermore more

elaborated …scal policy speci…cations could also be considered. In particular, following Gali and Perrotti

(2003), a debt stabilization motive as well as a control for …scal policy persistence could be included. Thus,

letting bk denote the ratio of public debt to GDP in country k in year , we could estimate …scal policy

  2 6 When data is available, we also measure …scal policy using cyclically adjusted variables. In this case, the cyclicality of …scal

policy results more directly from discretionary policy. Put di¤erently, cyclicality stemming from automatic stabilizers is purged
out. Unreported results -available upon request- show very similar to the case where …scal policy indicators are not cyclically
adjusted.

where zk is as previously the output gap in country k in year , defk                              is the …scal policy indicator in

country k in year         1 and "k is an error term. Following Rajan and Zingales (1998), when estimating our

main equation (1) we rely on a simple OLS procedure, correcting for heteroscedasticity bias whenever needed,

without worrying much further about endogeneity issues. In particular, the interaction term between industry

speci…c characteristics and …scal policy cyclicality is likely to be largely exogenous to the LHS variable, be

it industry value added or labour productivity growth. First, our external …nancial dependence variable

pertains to industries in the US while the growth variables on the LHS involves other countries than the US.

Hence reverse causality whereby industry growth outside the US could a¤ect external …nancial dependence

or asset tangibility of industries in the US, seems quite implausible. Moreover, in some of our regressions

the LHS variable is measured over a post 1990 time period whereas the …nancial dependence indicator is

always measured on a pre 1990 period, which further reduces the possibility of reverse causality. Second,

…scal policy cyclicality is measured at a macro level whereas the LHS growth variable is measured at industry

level, which again reduces the scope for reverse causality as long as each individual sector represents a small

share of total output in the domestic economy. Yet, as an additional exogeneity test, we produce additional

regressions where we instrument for …scal policy cyclicality.28

    Our data sample focuses on 17 industrialized OECD countries plus the US. In particular, we do not include

Central and Eastern European countries and other emerging market economies. Industry-level data for this

country sample are available from the period between 1980 and 2005, from which we consider three di¤erent

time spans: 1980-2005, 1985-2005, and 1990-2005. The 1990-2005 time period allows us to include Germany

in the regression exercise.29 Our data come from four di¤erent sources. Industry level real value added and

4     Results

4.1    Main estimations

We …rst estimate our main regression equation (1), with real value added growth as LHS variable, using

…nancial dependence (table 1a-1) or asset tangibility (table 1b-1) as industry-speci…c interactors, and where

…scal policy cyclicality is …rst estimated using the ratio of total …scal balance to actual or potential GDP as

LHS …scal policy indicator in regression (2).



                                                   Insert table 1a-1 here

                                                   Insert table 1b-1 here



As announced above, we consider three di¤erent time periods, and for each time period the …scal policy

cyclicality is derived from estimating (2) over the same time period. The empirical results show that real value

added growth is signi…cantly and positively correlated with the interaction of external …nancial dependence

(table 1a-1) or of asset tangibility (table 1b-1) with …scal policy countercyclicality: a larger sensitivity to

the output gap of total …scal balance to GDP (actual or potential) raises industry real valued added growth,

and the more so for industries with higher …nancial dependence or for industries with lower asset tangibility.

   Three remarks are worth making at this point. First, the estimated coe¢ cients are highly signi…cant -in

spite of the relatively conservative standard errors estimates which we cluster at the country level- and also

they are relatively stable across di¤erent time periods. Second, the pairwise correlation between industry

…nancial dependence and industry asset tangibility is around       0:6 which is signi…cantly below     1. In

other words, these two variables are far from being perfectly correlated, which in turn implies that the two

tables (table 1a-1) and (table 1b-1) are not just mirroring each other, but instead convey complementary

information. Finally, the estimated coe¢ cients remain essentially the same whether the LHS variable in

equation (2) is taken as a ratio of actual or potential GDP, so that the correlations between f pct;t+n
                                                                                                  k     and

industry growth indeed capture the e¤ect of …scal policy rather than just the e¤ect of changes in actual

GDP.

   We now repeat the same estimation exercise, but taking labour productivity as the LHS variable in our

main estimation equation (1). Comparing the results from this new set of regressions with the previous

tables, in turn will allow us to decompose the overall e¤ect of …scal policy countercyclicality on industry

value added growth into employment growth and productivity growth.



                                              Insert table 2a-1 here

                                              Insert table 2b-1 here



As is shown in table 2a-1 and 2b-1, labour productivity growth is signi…cantly a¤ected by the interaction

between …nancial dependence/asset tangibility and …scal policy cyclicality: a larger sensitivity to the output

gap of total …scal balance to -actual or potential- GDP raises industry labour productivity growth, and the

more so for industries with higher …nancial dependence or lower asset tangibility. Decomposing real value

added growth into labour productivity growth and employment growth, regressions with external …nancial

dependence as the industry interactor show that about 75% of the e¤ect of …scal countercyclicality on value

added growth is driven by productivity growth, the remaining 25% corresponding to employment growth.




                                                     21
   Finally, we repeat the …rst estimation exercise, but using the ratio of primary …scal balance, not total

…scal balance, to GDP as the LHS variable in the auxiliary equation (2). The di¤erence between these two

indicators is that the primary …scal balance does not include net interest repayments to/from the government.

The results are qualitatively similar in both cases: industries with larger …nancial dependence and/or lower

asset tangibility tend to bene…t disproportionately from a more countercyclical …scal policy in the sense of

a larger sensitivity of the primary …scal balance to variations in the output gap.



                                              Insert table 1a-2 here

                                              Insert table 1b-2 here



   This same conclusion obtains when using labour productivity growth as the LHS variable in (1). However,

the estimated coe¢ cients are smaller in absolute value when …scal policy is measured through primary …scal

balance. This is related to the fact that the cross-country dispersion in the cyclicality of primary …scal

balance is larger than the cross-country dispersion in the cyclicality of total …scal balance, over any of the

three time periods we consider.

4.2    Magnitude of the e¤ects

How large are the e¤ects implied by the above regressions? To get a sense of the magnitudes involved in these

regressions, we compute the growth gain implied by above tables for an industry moving from the bottom

to the top quartile (i.e from the 25% to the 75% percentile) in …nancial dependence in a country where

…scal policy countercyclicality would also move from the 25% to the 75% percentile. Similarly, we compute

the growth gain for an industry whose asset tangibility would move from the 75% to the 25% percentile of




                                                     22
the corresponding distribution.33 As shown in Table 3 below, the approximate growth gain in terms of real

value added growth is between 1:1 and a 2:4 percentage points per year while the growth gain in terms of

productivity growth is between 1 and 1:7 percentage points per year.

          Table 3: Growth gain from a change in industry characteristics and …scal policy cyclicality


    These magnitudes are fairly large especially when compared to the corresponding …gures in Rajan and

Zingales (1998). According to their results, the gain in real value added growth from moving from the 25%

to the 75% percentile, both in a country’s level of …nancial development and in a industry’s level of external

…nancial dependence, is roughly equal to 1 percentage point per year.

    However, the following considerations are worth pointing out here. First, these are di¤-and-di¤ (cross-

country/cross industry) e¤ects, which are not directly interpretable as country-wide e¤ects. Second, we

are just looking at manufacturing sectors, which represent no more than 40% of total GDP of countries in

our sample. Third, there is a high degree of dispersion in …scal policy cyclicality across countries in our

sample. Hence moving from the 25% to the 75% percentile in the countercyclicality of primary …scal balance

relative to GDP, corresponds to a radical change in the design of …scal policy along the cycle, which in

turn is unlikely to take place in any individual country over the time periods we are considering. Fourth,

this simple computation does not take into account the possible costs associated with the transition from

a steady state with low …scal countercyclicality to a steady state with high …scal countercyclicality. Yet,

  3 3 Given our di¤erence in di¤erence speci…cation , it is impossible to infer the economic magnitudes of the estimated coe¢ cients

di¤erently. In particular, the presence of industry and country …xed e¤ects precludes investigating the impact of a change in
…scal policy cyclical pattern for a given industry or conversely the e¤ect of a change in industry characteristics (…nancial
dependence or asset tangibility) in a country with a given cyclical pattern of …scal policy. Both these e¤ects are absorbed with
our country and industry dummies.



                                                                23
the above exercise suggests that di¤erences in the cyclicality of …scal policy is an important driver of the

observed cross-country/cross-industry di¤erences in value added and productivity growth.




5     Robustness tests

5.1    Alternative auxiliary regression

Here we check the robustness of our results to replacing our auxiliary equation (2) by the alternative spec-

i…cation (3) where, on the RHS of the equation, we add the one-period lagged …scal policy indicator to

control for possible auto-correlation as well as the ratio of gross or net government liabilities to GDP on the

RHS to control for debt stabilization motives. On the LHS of (3), we consider both total and primary …scal

balance as a ratio of actual or potential GDP. Finally in the main speci…cation (1), we consider labor pro-

ductivity growth as our dependent variable. Results show that in spite of relatively lower levels of statistical

signi…cance -which we attribute to the smaller data sample for estimating this alternative speci…cation-, the

estimated coe¢ cients are quite close to those obtained when using the benchmark auxiliary equation (2).

Also interestingly, we …nd no signi…cant di¤erence between the estimated coe¢ cients for total and primary

…scal balance countercyclicality.

5.2    Positive versus negative external …nancial dependence

A further robustness test is to account for the existence of industries with negative …nancial dependence.

These are industries for which capital expenditures have been lower than internally generated funds over the

1980-1990 period in the US. For such industries, a more countercyclical …scal policy translates into a more

negative (not more positive) interaction coe¢ cient. Indeed, a positive value of the interaction coe¢ cient

for a sector with negative …nancial dependence, would imply that a more countercyclical …scal policy is



                                                      24
growth reducing, not growth enhancing. To check the validity of this point, we decompose the interaction

term in two components: an interaction between …nancial dependence and …scal policy countercyclicality for

industries with positive external …nancial dependence and an interaction term for industries with negative

external …nancial dependence. If a more countercyclical …scal policy is growth enhancing for all sectors, we

should obtain a positive coe¢ cient when …nancial dependence is positive but a negative coe¢ cient when

…nancial dependence is positive.

                                               Insert table 1a-5 here



Table 1a-4 and table 1a-5 essentially show that once we split the interaction term in two components,

respectively for sectors with positive and negative …nancial dependence, the interaction term is positive only

for sectors with positive external …nancial dependence, whereas it is negative for industries with negative

…nancial dependence. Moreover, the magnitude and statistical signi…cance of the estimated coe¢ cient is

larger for the positive component of the interaction term whereas the negative component is not always

signi…cant. This in turn may re‡ect both, the fact that industries with a negative …nancial dependence

represent a small share of the overall sample, and that industries with negative …nancial dependence are

unlikely to be credit-constrained and therefore sensitive to changes in the cyclicality of …scal policy. Finally

as is shown in table 2a-4 and 2a-5 below, the same results hold when looking at labour productivity growth

instead of real value added growth as the LHS variable in the main estimation equation (1).

5.3    Outliers driving the results?

A third test is to make sure that our empirical results are not driven by one particular country in the sample.

To check this point we remove countries one by one and show that the interaction between industry level

…nancial dependence or asset tangibility and the cyclicality of …scal policy, is always signi…cantly correlated

with industry-level real value added growth. Moreover, the interaction coe¢ cients remain relatively stable

across all regressions, which con…rms that no particular country in the sample is driving the results, neither

the statistical signi…cance nor the economic magnitude of the e¤ects. After all, this is not too surprising

given the relatively homogeneity of the set of countries in our sample. And the same conclusions carry over

when looking at labour productivity growth as the LHS variable in the regressions: no single country in

the sample is responsible for the positive e¤ect of …scal policy countercyclicality on industry-level labour

productivity growth in more …nancially dependent industries (or in industries with lower asset tangibility).

5.4    Competing stories

How robust is the e¤ect of countercyclical …scal policy on industry growth, and to what extent are not

we picking up other factors or stories when looking at the correlation between industry growth and the

cyclicality of …scal policy? In this subsection, we choose to focus on a few potentially relevant alternative

explanations.




                                                      26
5.4.1    Financial development


First, a more countercyclical …scal policy could re‡ect a higher degree of …nancial development in the

country.34 And …nancial development in turn is known to have a positive e¤ect on growth, particularly

for industries that are more dependent on external …nance (Rajan and Zingales (1998)). To disentangle

the e¤ects of countercyclical …scal policy from the e¤ects of …nancial development, in the RHS of the main

estimation equation (1) we control for …nancial development and its interaction with external …nancial

dependence. Columns 1-3 in Tables 1a-10; 2a-10; 1b-10; and 2a-10 below show that controlling for …nancial

development and its interaction with …nancial dependence or asset tangibility - where …nancial development

is measured either by the ratio of private credit to GDP, or by the ratio of …nancial system deposits to

GDP, or by the real long term interest rate35 - does not a¤ect the interaction coe¢ cients between …nancial

dependence and the cyclicality of …scal policy. In other words, the magnitude of the e¤ect of …scal policy

cyclicality on industry growth, remains una¤ected once …nancial development is controlled for. Moreover,

these estimations suggests that …nancial development is a signi…cant determinant of growth but only when

measured by the volume of …nancial system deposits: the more funds are made available by the …nancial

system, the faster value added or labour productivity growth will be in industries with higher …nancial

dependence or lower asset tangibility. However, neither the level of private credit to GDP nor the real cost

of capital appear to have any signi…cant e¤ect on value added or labour productivity growth once we control

for the cyclicality of …scal policy and its interaction with …nancial dependence or asset tangibility.


5.4.2    In‡ation


Second, in‡ation may also impact on the e¤ect of …scal policy particularly in more …nancially dependent

sectors. In particular, in‡ation is widely perceived as having a negative impact on the allocative e¢ ciency

of capital across sectors, the idea being that higher in‡ation makes it more di¢ cult for outside investors

to identify high productivity projects: then, the higher the in‡ation rate, the less e¢ ciently should the

  3 4 For example Aghion and Marisnecu (2007) point to a positive correlation between …scal policy counter-cyclicality and

…nancial development.
  3 5 The two …rst indicators measure the availability of external capital, the third one measures its cost.




                                                           27
…nancial system allocate capital across sectors. And to the extent that the sectors that should su¤er more

from capital misallocation are the more …nancially dependent sectors, in‡ation is more likely to have a

negative e¤ect on value added/productivity growth for industries with more reliance on external …nance.

In contrast, in industries with no or low …nancial dependence, this negative e¤ect of in‡ation is less likely

            36
to hold.         Columns 4-5 in Tables 1a-10; 2a-10; 1b-10; and 2a-10 indeed show that the interaction of

in‡ation and …nancial dependence is never a signi…cant determinant of industry real value added or labour

productivity growth. The same applies to the interaction between in‡ation and industry asset tangibility.

Finally, we investigate whether this absence of any signi…cant e¤ect of in‡ation could be related to the level

of central bank policy rates, given that central banks tend to determine their policy rates depending on

in‡ation. However, we …nd that even after controlling for central bank policy rates the interaction between

…scal policy cyclicality and industry …nancial dependence remains signi…cant. This suggests that the positive

e¤ect on industry growth of stabilizing …scal policies is largely unrelated to average in‡ation in a country: for

given in‡ation rate, raising the counter-cyclical pattern of …scal policy raises growth more in industries with

higher …nancial dependence or with lower asset tangibility. These results however do not imply that high

average in‡ation is not costly: in particular, a higher level of in‡ation is likely a¤ect the local government’s

ability to carry out a stabilizing …scal policy.


5.4.3    Fiscal discipline and size of government


Third, if the cyclical component of …scal policy does signi…cantly a¤ect industry value added growth or labour

productivity growth, it is also likely that the structural component of …scal policy should play a similar role.

In fact it could be the case that countercyclical …scal policy is positively correlated with industry growth

not so much because countercyclicality per se is growth-enhancing but rather because a more countercyclical

…scal policy simply re‡ects better designed …scal policy or higher …scal discipline over the cycle. In the

same vein, the cyclicality of …scal policy might be a proxy for the relative size of government: thus it could

  3 6 A reinforcing consideration is that increases in short term interest rates by central banks in response to higher in‡ation or

higher expected in‡ation, should also have a negative e¤ect on industry value added and productivity growth that is larger for
industries with higher …nancial dependence or lower asset tangibility.




                                                                28
just be that larger governments are less countercyclical by nature, in which case our empirical results would

simply re‡ect the view that a smaller government is good for growth and the more so in industries with

lower asset tangibility or higher …nancial dependence. To address this potential objection, we consider three

di¤erent measures of …scal institutions: average …scal balance, average government expenditures, average

government revenues. The …rst measure captures …scal discipline, the second and third measures capture

the relative size of government. Columns 6 to 8 in Tables 1a-10; 2a-10; 1b-10; and 2a-10 below show that

in the horse race between the cyclicality of …scal policy and those three measures of structural …scal policy,

countercyclicality in primary …scal balance is a signi…cant determinant of industry growth irrespective of

the average primary …scal balance. Moreover, the ratio of average primary …scal balance to GDP does not

appear to carry any signi…cant explanatory power of its own in the growth regressions. This does not imply

that …scal discipline, for example as re‡ected through a moderate average …scal de…cit, does not matter for

industry growth: tighter …scal discipline should actually make it easier for a government to implement a more

countercyclical …scal policy whereas large average …scal de…cits should make it harder for any government

to stabilize the economy in downturns, particularly if the government, as any other agent in the economy,

also faces a borrowing constraint.

5.5    Instrumental variable estimation

An important limitation to the empirical analysis carried out in this paper, is that the countercyclicality of

macroeconomic policies cannot be directly observed: instead, it can only be inferred through an auxiliary



                                                     29
regression. This in turn raises a number of problems. Among those lies the fact that countercyclicality is

measured with a standard error, so that our OLS estimations su¤er from the fact that we do not observe

the “true” value of countercyclicality but only a “noisy” signal of this value. One approach to deal with

this problem, is to perform instrumental variable estimations.37 Thus here we instrument …scal policy

countercyclicality using a set of instrumental variables which share two basic characteristics. First, these

variables are directly observed, none of them is inferred from another model or regression. Second, these

variables are all predetermined: that is, the period over which the instrumental variables are observed,

is anterior to the time periods over which the auxiliary regressions that determine our countercyclicality

measure, are run.

    More precisely, we carry out two alternative sets of IV estimations. In the …rst set of IV estimations we

use "economic variables" as instruments, for example GDP per worker, the ratio of imports to GDP, CPI

in‡ation, nominal long term interest rate, private credit to GDP. In the second set of IV estimations, we use

legal and political variables as instruments: legal origin (English, French, German, Scandinavian), district

magnitudes, a dummy variable for federal political system, an index for government centralization (ratio of

central to general government expenditures).

    Tables 1a12-1a13 (resp. 1b12-1b13) show our IV estimations results when real value added growth is the

  3 7 In other words, the instrumental variable estimations we perform in this subsection are meant to rule out the possibility that

our above …ndings about the interaction between …nancial dependence and …scal policy counter-cyclicality being a signi…cant
determinant of industry level growth, might simply re‡ect the fact that the standard errors around the estimates of …scal policy
counter-cyclicality have not been properly taken into account in the estimations.




                                                                30
LHS variable while …scal policy countercyclicality is instrumented using economic variables and interacted

with industry …nancial dependence (resp. asset tangibility). Three main results emerge from this exercise.

First, whether it is with …nancial dependence or with asset tangibility, a more countercyclical …scal policy

signi…cantly improves industry growth, and the more so in industries with larger degree of external …nancial

dependence or with lower asset tangibility, in the IV regressions. Second, the e¤ects implied by the IV

estimations, are of comparable magnitude to those implied by the above OLS regressions: the interaction

coe¢ cients are at least as large and often larger (in absolute value) in the IV estimations than in the OLS

estimations. Finally, the Hansen test for instrument validity is generally accepted at the 5% level, although

some regressions appear to be borderline in this respect. Similar conclusions can be drawn from tables

2a12-2a13 and tables 2b12-2b13 where the dependent variable is industry labour productivity growth.

   Next, we consider the case where …scal policy cyclicality is instrumented using legal and political variables.

Tables 1a14-2a15 (resp. 1b14-1b15) show the IV estimations results when real value added growth is the LHS

variable. Again, we …nd that the instrumentation does not a¤ect the signi…cance or the magnitude of the

interaction coe¢ cients between external dependence (or asset tangibility) and …scal policy countercyclicality

in the growth regressions.

However, there is one case in which The Hansen validity test is not passed by legal and political instruments

(we …nd a p- value at 1% in Table 1a-15, for the estimation period 1980-2005), whereas the test is always

passed when using "economic" instruments. However, legal and political variables always pass the instrument

validity test when labour productivity growth is the dependent variable: namely, the hypothesis that these

instruments are valid, is always veri…ed both at 5 and 10% levels (Tables 2a14-2a15 and 2b14-15).

6     Opening the …scal policy box: expenditures and revenues

In this section, we push the analysis one step further by investigating the relative importance of the gov-

ernment expenditures and the government revenues components of …scal policy in the overall e¤ect of a

more countercyclical …scal policy on industry growth. For this purpose, we replace the baseline equation (1)

by one in which, on the RHS, we interact industry …nancial dependence or asset tangibility with both, the

countercyclicality in government revenues and the countercyclicality in government expenditures.38 39 Tables

1a-7 and 1b-7 show the results from this decomposition when the LHS variable is industry real value added

growth.



                                                      Insert table 1a-7 here

                                                      Insert table 1b-7 here



We see hardly any di¤erence both in the signi…cance and the magnitude of the interaction coe¢ cients

associated with these two measures of …scal policy.

    Using labor productivity growth as the LHS variable in the growth regressions (Tables 2a-7; 2b-7) yields

a similar picture: both components of …scal policy interact signi…cantly with (industry) external …nancial

  3 8 From a statistical point of view, this decomposition boils down to relaxing the assumption that estimated coe¢ cients for

expenditures and revenues should be equal in absolute value since …scal balance is simply the di¤erence between revenues and
expenditures.
  3 9 Following the OECD decomposition for government accounts, government expenditures are the sum of government con-

sumption, government investment, net capital transfers, property income, government subsidies, social security expenditures
and other expenditures. Government revenues are the sum of total direct taxes, indirect taxes, social security revenues, property
income and other current revenues.




                                                               32

                                             Insert table 2b-7 here



As shown in these tables, we obtain similar results whether we take the ratios of government revenues and

government expenditures over actual GDP versus potential GDP.

   Now, to gain further intuition on this set of results, we focus on primary government expenditures and

primary government revenues, i.e. we abstract from government interest payments and government interest

revenues. Then the picture becomes somewhat easier to interpret. Indeed the interactions of external

…nancial dependence or asset tangibility with both, primary expenditures and primary revenues, come out

signi…cant. However, the impact of countercyclicality in primary government expenditures is on average

about twice as large as that of countercyclicality in primary government revenues.

                                             Insert table 2b-8 here



   Overall, these …ndings suggest that the positive e¤ect on industry growth of …scal balance countercycli-

cality, involves both the expenditure and the revenue sides of …scal policy. That the estimated interaction

coe¢ cient for primary expenditures be twice as large as the interaction coe¢ cient for primary revenues, is

consistent with the notion that …scal policy over the cycle a¤ects industry growth at least partly through a

market size e¤ect: indeed, the cyclicality in government expenditures has a more direct e¤ect on the demand

for …rms’products than the cyclicality in government revenues which a¤ects demand only indirectly through


                                                    33
its impact on agents’budget constraints. This intuition is reinforced by our …nding of more signi…cant inter-

action coe¢ cients between …nancial dependence and the countercyclicality of government expenditures when

looking at primary expenditures instead of total expenditures. Total expenditures embed interest payments

from the government, which have no direct impact on aggregate demand. In the model developed in Section

2, countercyclical government expenditures have a stabilizing e¤ect on the returns to productivity enhancing

investments by stabilizing market size over the cycle. Anticipating this, entrepreneurs raise their investments

in long term productivity enhancing projects. In contrast, the potential e¤ect of countercyclical government

revenues operates only indirectly through tightening or relaxing agents’credit constraints.



6.1    R&D spending and …scal policy countercyclicality

To con…rm the empirical result that …scal policy counter-cyclicality tends to be more e¤ective in raising

growth through expenditures than through revenues we extend our analysis to R&D spending. Recall that

in our model a more countercyclical …scal policy has a positive growth e¤ects on more credit-constrained

…rms because it encourages them to pursue long-term innovative investments. In this subsection we look at

whether a more counter-cyclical …scal policy has any impact on the growth in R&D spending at industry

level over the estimation period 1987-2005 . To this end we run the regression

                                                                                                !

of industry R&D spending; and then decompose …scal policy into …scal revenues and expenditures.

   Two main …ndings emerge from this exercise. First, the countercyclicality of total …scal balance to GDP

has a signi…cant e¤ect on the growth rate of R&D spending. This conclusion holds whether we look at ratios

of …scal balance to actual or potential GDP. Second, when decomposing …scal balance between expenditures

and revenues, we …nd that the positive e¤ect of a more countercyclical …scal balance on industry R&D is

mostly driven by the countercyclical pattern of government expenditures, not that of government revenues

                                                            34
whose estimated coe¢ cient is not signi…cantly di¤erent from zero. This we see as further evidence of a

market size channel lying behind the positive impact of countercyclical …scal policy on industry R&D and

thereby on industry growth.

7     Conclusions

In this paper, we have analyzed the extent to which macroeconomic policy over the business cycle can

a¤ect industry growth, focusing on …scal policy. Following the Rajan-Zingales (1998) methodology, we have

interacted credit constraints (measured either by external …nancial dependence or by the negative of asset

tangibility in US industries) and the cyclicality of …scal policy at country level, and assessed the impact

of this interaction on value added or productivity growth at industry level. Using this methodology which

helps address potential endogeneity issues, we provided evidence to the e¤ect that a more countercyclical

…scal policy enhances output and productivity growth more in more …nancially constrained industries, i.e in

industries whose US counterparts are more dependent on external …nance or display lower asset tangibility.

This result appears to be survive a number of robustness tests, in particular the inclusion of structural

macroeconomic variables such as …nancial development, in‡ation, average …scal de…cits, to which one could

also add openness to trade or the net current account position.40 This in turn suggests, either that the growth

impact of the cyclical pattern of …scal policy is of comparable (or even greater) importance to that of more

structural features, or that the e¤ect of these structural features operates at least partly through their own

e¤ects on the cyclicality of …scal policy.

    The results suggests at least three avenues for future research. A …rst avenue is to engage in a more

systematic assessment of the interactions that exist between growth and the business cycle, particularly those

operating through the …nancial channel. A second question that emerges naturally from the analysis in this

paper, is whether the above analysis of the e¤ects of …scal policy countercyclicality on industry growth, can

be transposed from the …scal to the monetary sphere of the economy. A positive answer to this question

would be all the more important that presumably monetary policy can be more easily modi…ed over time

than …scal policy, although transmission lags may be larger for monetary policy former than for …scal policy.

Finally, comes the question of the determinants of countercyclical …scal policy and especially the institutional

features or arrangements that foster or prevent countercyclicality. Answering this question will shed new

light on the ongoing debate about the relationship between growth and institutions.

    First notice that the solution cannot feature         c      > 1, indeed if it were the case then the program would

be linear in z, so as we assumed Pj            E (Ph jj), the …rm’s owner would pro…tably deviate by increasing z

Note: The dependent variable is the average annual growth rate in real value added for the period 1980-2005 in each column for each industry in each country.
The country code in each column represents the country withdrawn from sample estimation. Initial Share in Manufacturing Value Added is the ratio of beginning
of period industry real value added to beginning of period total manufacturing real value added. Positive (resp. Negative) Financial Dependence is the fraction of
capital expenditures not financed with internal funds for US firms in the same industry for the period 1980-1990 when this fraction is positive (resp. negative) and
is zero otherwise. Primary Fiscal Balance to potential GDP Counter-Cyclicality is the coefficient of the output gap when primary fiscal balance to potential GDP is
regressed on a constant and the output gap for each country. The interaction variable is the product of variables in parentheses. Estimated coefficients are in
percentage. Standard errors -clustered at the country level- are in parentheses. All estimations include country and industry dummies. Significance at the 1%

Note: The dependent variable is the average annual growth rate in labor productivity for the period 1980-2005 for each industry in each country. The country code in
each column represents the country withdrawn from sample estimation. Initial Relative Labor Productivity is the ratio of industry beginning of period labor
productivity to total manufacturing beginning of period labor productivity. Asset Tangibility is the fraction of assets represented by net property, plant and equipment
for US firms in the same industry for the period 1980-1990. Total Fiscal Balance to potential GDP Counter-Cyclicality is the coefficient of the output gap when total
fiscal balance to potential GDP is regressed on a constant and the output gap for each country. The interaction variable is the product of variables in parentheses.
Estimated coefficients are in percentage. Standard errors -clustered at the country level- are in parentheses. All estimations include country and industry dummies.
Significance at the 1% (resp. 5%; 10%) level is indicated by *** (resp. **; *).

Note: The dependent variable is the average annual growth rate in R&D spending for the period 1987-2005 for each industry in
each country. Initial Share in Manufacturing R&D spending is the ratio of beginning of period R&D spending at the industry
level to total manufacturing beginning of period R&D spending. Financial Dependence is the fraction of capital expenditures not
financed with internal funds for US firms in the same industry for the period 1980-1990. Total Fiscal Balance to (resp. potential)
GDP Counter-Cyclicality is the coefficient of the output gap when total fiscal balance to (resp. potential) GDP is regressed on a
constant and the output gap for each country. Total (resp. Primary) Gov. Expenditures to (resp. potential) GDP Pro-Cyclicality
is the coefficient of the output gap when total (resp. primary) government expenditures to (resp. potential) GDP is regressed on
a constant and the output gap for each country. Total (resp. Primary) Gov. Revenues to (resp. potential) GDP Counter-
Cyclicality is the coefficient of the output gap when total (resp. primary) government revenues to (resp. potential) GDP is
regressed on a constant and the output gap for each country. The interaction variable is the product of variables in parentheses. Estimated coefficients are in perce
