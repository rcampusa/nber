         Policy    Decentralization and Exchange Rate
          Management in Interdependent Economies

                          ABSTRACT


     The paper provides a theoretical framework for analysing
policy formation among independent authorities operating in an
interdependent environment. This is then applied to the analysis
of optimal monetary policy in a stochastic two—country model with
rational expectations. The main conclusions are 1) OptImal
monetary policy requires a finite response of the money supply to
the exchange rate (which is the only contemporaneously observed
variable.) Neither a fixed nor a freely floating exchange rate is
likely to be optImal. 2) Output stabilizing monetary policy may
well require 'leaning with the wind' in the foreign exchange
market, expanding the money supply when the home currency depreciates,
thus increasing the volatility of the exchange rate. 3) The ability
of the monetary authorities to influence real variables is due to
the assumption that the private sector does not make exchange rate—
contingent forward contracts.4) There are likely to be gains from
policy co—ordination.

 1.      Introduction
         The demise of Eretton Woods ahd of the short-lived Smithsonian
 agreement has raised questions about exchange rate management by monetary
 authorities    acting in isolation from one another.    For instance, will individual

 monetary authorities have an incentive to stabilise the exchange rate?          To what

 extent will monetary actions abroad disrupt domestic monetary policy?       What are

 the gains from co—ordinating monetary policy?


      The problems that arise when different agents pursue independent policies

in interdependent economies have been explored by a number of authors.           Aoki

 (1976), Cooper (1969), Hamada (1976), Allen and icenen (1980), McFadden (1967),

Patrick (1973) ,   Kydland (1976) and Pindyck (1976), among others, have made
significant contributions.       Different authors have focused on different aspects

of decentralized policy formation.       One purpose of this paper is to provide a

general discussion of decentralization.       In part 2 we provide a

theoretical framework for analysing policy formation among independent authorities

operating in an interdependent environment.       We distinguish three dimensions of

the problem and discuss, by way of example, the Mundell (1962)     assignment problem
in terms of our typology.       We show that instability in Mundell's context does

not arise because different authorities are assigned different and inappropriate

targets, but because they fail to formulate strategies in a co—operative way.


      A second purpose of this paper    is to analyse the optimal design of monetary
policy   in interdependent economies. Previous analytic discussion of policy
decentralization has been based on deterministic models. Furthermore, with the
exception of Hamada     (1976),who considers the problem in a classical, full—

employment   context, these models incorporate the traditional neo—Keynesian
assumption   of fixed prices.    Studies incorporating stochastic elements have also

used a neQ—Keynesian framework and rely solely on simulation analysis     (Pindyck

(1976) and Kydland (1976)).      None of the studies incorporates recent contributions

to the theory of aggregate supply and expectations formation associated with the
                                       —2—

"New Classical Macroeconomics".

       We consider      two monetary authori ties pursuing domestic targets in two

economies connected both by trade in real goods and in national monies.

The model is presented in section 3.          Each economy is characterised by

a supply function of the Lucas type in which deviations of output from

its natural level occur only because of deviations of the domestic price

level from the value that was anticipated in the previous period.           The

natural level is itself stochastic.          Agents in each economy hold domestic

money for transactions purposes but may speculate on exchange rate movements

by holding domestic or foreign money.          We assume that money demands are also

stochastic.        The two economies are linked by a stochastic purchasing power

parity relationship between the two price levels and the exchange rate.


       Throughout, we assume that the only contemporaneous variable observed

by the two monetary authorities and the private sectors is the exchange rate.

Incomes and price levels are observed only with a one—period lag.          Each

monetary authority's problem, then, is to infer from the observed current

exchange rate the type of shocks affecting the economy and to set the current

money supply to offset these shocks, taking into account the response of the

foreign monetary authority to its actions.


       In   section 4   we assume that each country's monetary authority pursu& the

objective      of stabilizing output around the average Or 'OX ante", natural      level

of   output.     In section 5 we modify the objective to one of stabilizing income
around   the actual but unobserved natural rate.        This second objective is

equivalent to niinimising price forecast errors and is more likely to lead to

a policy of exchange rate stabilization.         In section 6, we introduce exchange

rate stabilization as an additional, independent goal.
                                    —3—

        Throughout, we derive the policy rules which obtain when the monetary

authorities pursue distinct targets independently.          In sections 4 and S the

optimal policy rules are not affected if, instead, authorities pursue a

common objective cooperatively.        This result does not extend to more general

models such as the one considered in section 6.


        A main purpose of the model we develop in sections 3 through 6 is to

provide insight into the design of optimal policies for dirty floating.

Models in which current policy can only respond to past information must

implicitly assume that either the exchange rate or the money supply is fixed

within    the period: exchange rates are either fixed ox the float is clean
within the period [see Buiter l979a3.        Our model,   however, allows for a
contemporaneous money supply response to the current exchange rate
Setting the money supply to fix the exchange rate or ignoring the exchange
rate    in setting the money supply constitute special cases of our model.
Indeed,      we find that optimal monetary policy can involve   exacerbating
exchange      rate movements.-"



2.     Alternative Definitions of Folicy Decentralization and Coordination

       The   question of policy decentralization arises in interdependent systems
in which distinct agents, whom we call authorities, have the ability to
set    instruments in the pursuit of possibly independent objectives.      For

simplicity, consider a system with two authorities.         At time t the first

authority      seeks to maximize an objective function of the form
                                            —4—

 (2.1) w nE[E(dl)T tVl(                 ,   2, x) I1J              0         <   1


 where y represents a vector of state variables in period T and x' a set

 of levels of the instrument variables under the control of authority 1.

       is   the 1th authority's set of information about the state of the economy

 in period t.


         A second authority may be maximizing an objective function of the form



 (2.2) w E[                (2)t_tv2(y       )(l ?)                 o <       <




 Let   us assume that the state variables y evolve according to



 (2.3) t             't—l x, xt;                     E(yQ).

                                              u)                   j <   t
                                                              3/
If the authorities adopt time—consistent policies• we can define their

optimizing behaviour recursively as in (2.4) and (2.5)



 (2.4)       Wi     wax E [V1(y, x, x) + W11JI2')
                   xtEXt

                           E [Vt(Y; xtf xt) +
                   XtEXt


Here         and    represent the sets of feasible values of x and x respectively.

If agents are pursuing mernoryless Nash strategies (see Kydland (1976)) then

   is set taking agent l's future behaviour and agent 2's current and

future behaviour as given and similarly for agent 2.                   We thus define

                                                               and x =
                                                                         2     2
                                                                                   ..-'   2
                             ' T'' "'t—l'
      •'    &, ...) r > t+l as the values of x and x which attain                               and

       respectively.           within   this framework         we identify   three types of
decentralization and coordination.

           (1)   Target decentralization            occurs when the two authorities have different

objective functionals, i.e. when w1                      w2.     Full coordination of targets
requires that the authorities adopt a common objective functional w. This
does not necessarily imply that authorities maximize w with respect to the same

information,          i.e.         may not equal Q. Furthermore, even though authorities

have a coirunon set of objectives, they need not play a cooperative game in the

formal sense; i.e. no binding pre—play agreements                        on the choice of             and

may have been established.

           (2) Decentralization of nonstrategic                information occurs when authorities
have access to different information sets concerning the state of the economy
      y 2) .          Full coordination of such information requires that the authorities
share this information.               Each authority will then form expectations and policy
in period        t on    the basis of      Li
                                                Q.       This type of coordination need not imply
that authorities adopt common objectives or that they formulate                               and

cooperatively.
           (3) Finally,      decentralization of strategic           information arises whenever
      and        are chosen independently.              This type of decentralization could even

arise in situations where authorities shared objectives (w1 = w2) and

information about              state of the economy (c = Q) but the optimal
                             the

cooperative        strategy is non—unique. It is analogous to the decentralization
problem faced by an American foothfll team which has snapped the ball without
having called a play in the huddle.                     Coordination of stragegic information
means that authorities make             binding,       "pre—play" agreements on their choice
of         and ,        which, they   ma' do even thouqh their tarqets and information
about the state of the economy may differ.


           Mundell's (1962) assignment problem                 seems to represent this last type of

decentralization.              Consider Mundell's two equation model of an open economy:
                                             —6—

(2.6)     Y   =           +             <     2 > 0
                  a1r         a2G

                                              2 < 0
(2.7)     B =
                  1r+         S2G    S1 >

where Y denotes income, r the interest rate, G government spending and fl the

balance   of payments.              The objective of policy is to stabilize Y and B; that
is,   to assure asymptotic convergents of I and B to target levels which we set

without loss of generality at I = B =              0.       Policy is restricted to finite

instantaneous rates of change of C and r which are linear functions of authorities'

information sets.


        Mundell constrains his analysis to policies which assign one instrument,

r,    to one authority and C to another.               The monetary authority responds only
to B according to the rule.

(2.8)     r=

while   the fiscal authority responds to Y according to


(2.9)     C       yl


Mundell then shows that if the authorities choose 6 C                 0 and y < 0   —   the   natural

"leaning against the wind" rules —              then   if   Ia1/a2I$1/52I'
                                                                              i.e. instruments
are   wt assigned according to "comparative advantage", the system represented
by    (2.6) —     (2.9)       is unstable.


        Printi facie, this problem might be interpreted as one of either

decentralized non—strategic              information   (each authority knows only       one of the
two state variables, I and r, as well as                the values of the structural parameters
a. and 5.,        i=l, 2 or at least the relative strengths of the effects of the

instruments        on the targets) or one of decentralization of strategic
information        (each authority chooses its response function independently).

In    fact, it can only represent a failure to choose response functions jointly.
        To show this, consider the two necessary and sufficient conditions for

stability:



 (2.10) 6112 —

and

 (2.11)                    <0.
For any values of the structural parameters there exist values of 6                        and y

(not    necessarily the leaning against the wind values), which satisfy (2.10)

and (2.ll).' Therefore, authorities can attain their objective without

sharing information about Y and r.                     They need only cooperate by jointly

choosing appropriate values of 6 and y.



        Without such cooperation, sharing information on Y and r will rtt

guarantee stability.             Under full nonstrategic information sharing, the two

authorities'     response functions take the more general form:

(2.12)      C=         +
                 y1B


(2.13)      r=         +
                 61B       62y

In this case stability obtains if                 and only if

(2.14)     11S1 + y2aJ +         612   +
                                           62a2
                                                   C 0


and


(2.15)      (1261 — 6211)        "l2 —     a2S1)
                                                   >   0

Without   knowing the parameters of the fiscal authority's response function,
      and 2' there are no values of                    and   62 which the   monetary authority could

select to ensure stability.                1n equivalent problem faces the fiscal authorities.

Even though both authorities have full information about the                       state of the
economy, they cannot be sure of attaining their objective if one authority does
not   know what the other is doing.                Thus the assignment problem arises not
because authorities have been arbitrarily assigned target variables but
because   they do not determine jointly how they                  will respond to these variables.

3.     A Two—Country Model of Monetary Policy and Exchange Rate Determination

       We now turn to a model in which tcwget and strategic       infornrztion
decentralization both arise.         Two national monetary authorities pursue separate

objectives but have access to the same information about the state of the world.

Each authority sets its money supply in response to the current exchange         rate


between the two    monies,   taking the other authority's response as given.


        We derive optimal money supply rules in a model of considerable simplicity.

Firstly, we consider two economies in which the deviation of actual output from

its   long—run normal level is proportional to the percentage deviation of the
actual price level from the price level anticipated in the previous period.
In the home country we have

 (3.1) y         ttIt—l +

while abroad

 (3.2)     '       ttt-l       +



Here       denotes the deviation of home—country output from the full employment

 level and Pt the logarithm of the home—country price level; titl denotes

 the expectation of Pt based       on information available in period t—l and u
 denotes   a aussian white noise disturbance tern with variance a uy

 Equivalent magnitudes in the foreign country      are denoted with an asterisk.
                                                   n      *n obtain when
 The actual or ex—post natural levels of outputs, y and     ,


                       *                             n = y and *n = *y
 Pt =
                  *
             and Pt =
         tIt—l
                             respectively, that is
                         tIt—l                                u             u
 Ex ante, the expected natural levels are simply zero.
         Justification for output supply equations of the form (3.1)     and (3.2)


 is provided by Lucas (1972) and Sargent and Wallace (1975).          output equations

                                                            contracts are formed one
 of the form (3.1) and (3.2) would arise also if wage

 period in advance.      Wages in period t, it is assumed, cannot be modified by

 information that is not available before period t7" Other motivations of
                                                    —9—

 (3.1) and (3.2) involve imperfect observation of the contemporaneous

 aggregate price' level.


         Secondly, we assume that citiiens in each, country must hold domestic

 money for transactions purposes but may speculate by holding foreign money.

 Overall money demand is thus given by a set of currency substitution money

 demand    functions:

                —        =        —                                              > 0.
                             aY                                            a,
                    Pt                 S(e+1I_e) + u                   .




            *        *         **           *                               *    *

     By permitting money supplies to respond to the contemporaneous exchange

rate but precluding the possibility of exchange—rate contingent money wage

contracts, known monetary rules will affect real output.                                         In this model

policy makers set money supplies via transfers and taxes.                                         Direct exchange

market intervention provides another mode which is consistent with our

specification if the other country sterilises the effect of exchange market

intervention on its own money supply via transfers and taxes.

4.      Optimal Monetary Policy: The Nash Solution
        We first consider the optimal design of monetary policy when each monetary

authority follows a meinoryless Nash strateyy; that is, each monetary authority

sets its money supply as a function only of the contemporaneous value of the

state variables, taking as given the other monetary authority's money supply

rule.

Substituting       (4.13) into (4.1) and (4.2) it is clear, since               u and
and therefore u and u1, are orthogonal, that policies for which y. and y. are

non—zero increase the minimum expected loss.                  Such policies introduce additional

randomness, in the form of the unobserved (as of last period) component of last

period's disturbance into the current period price forecast error.                      We thus

restrict ourselves to monetary policies which do not respond to



     If, in fact, y.               0, then policy responds only to currently observsi

components of the current disturbances.               Since these can only be observed via
                                                                                                  e.
policy can only respond to e. We thus restrict ourselves to policies of the form

a. and a,.             For example a policy rule which sets a. = 0,j                       + O,and   a0   a0

objective by responding only currently to current information (e) that it can
achieve by responding to this information at later dates. It is interesting to
note that even if the government were to have inferior information to the private
sector in the sense that they learn e at a later date, they can achieve their
objectives equally well.                      Turnovsky (1980) provides another example of this
phenomenon.                (See also Buiter, 1980c).             For convenience,          we restrict ourselves

to   current response only.                   We thus assume a. =
                                                        j + 0. This restriction = 0

uniquely has the virtue of yielding time consistent policies. A monetary policy
which responds in period t to e1, I Ct, does not affect     by this response, but only
          Since   y is at period t a bygone, time—consistent monetary authorities will

not stabilize output via expectations of future policy.                                We thus consider policies

of   the form

(4.17)            =

         Since rn and m respond only to               all endogenous variables in our model

depend, given expectations, only on current disturbances.                      Taylor (1977) has

shown that while models such as ours, which               incorporate current or past expectations
of    ftsLur   endogenous variables, have an infinite number of solutions in which

current endogenous variables depend on lagged exogenous variables, in the minimum

variance solution such lagged variables do not enter.                      We restrict our analysis

to this minimum variance solution.
                                                Thus e, '' ' Pt and Pt depend linearly

Since y and          do not depend on mandm fort + T, the authorities' problem

reduces to one of choosing a to minimize E(yIet) for the home country and a to

minimize E(Y Jet) for the foreign country in each period t.



       ach country will optimally choose its monetary policy rule, taking as

given the rule of the other country.                Considering the home country first,

minimisation of E(y2Ie) is equivalent to choosing a money supply rule such

that E(yI e) = O—1"given the rule followed by the foreign authority.

        Note from (4.22) and      (4.23)that the domestic money supply responds

negatively to the money supply airoad.                    An increase in the foreign money

supply    causes an appreciation of the exchange                 rate, creating expectations of

depreciation which reduce the demand for domestic currency.                            To    prevent   the

reduction in demand for domestic currency from raising the domestic price level, an

accommodating reduction in domestic money supply must occur.                            Note also that

given    the money supply in the foteign country:the optimal domestic
money supply in general responds to expectations of all types of shocks, both

domestic and foreign and both monetary and real.                        Using (3.Be), (3.Bf) and (4.5)

and noting that the optimal (least squares) predictor of some variable z given

          is the (absolute value of the) elasticity of demand for domestic

 money with respect to the expected proportional rate of depreciation of the
                                       *
 domestic currency and —S                  the corresponding elastLcity for the foreign

 currency.        In a currency substitution framework they can be viewed as the

 exchange rate speculation elasticities of home and foreign currency respect-

 ively.      The first terms of (4.27) or (4.271) and (4.28) or (4.28') therefore

 suggest that monetary policy accommodates changes in the demand for

 money due to unanticipated changes in the exchange rate, thereby neutralising

 the effect of unanticipated exchange rate changes on the price level.                          This

 policy insulates the economy from real effects of unanticipated exchange rate

 changes.     Remember that since et!tl =                       0, a monetary rule contingent on e
 is a monetary rule contingent on the deviation of the actual exchange rate

 in period t from the exchange rate for period t anticipated in period t—1.

As all disturbances are ii.d and there are no other sources of inertia in the

model (specifically mtjt l 0), rational expectations are regressive.L"



     To the extent that monetary policy does accommodate swings in speculative

demand, monetary authorities "lean with the wind", in the foreign exchange

market, i.e. expand the money supply when the price of domestic currency is
                                                                                    *
lower than had been expected and conversely, i.e. a > 0 and a < 0.                           Such a

policy will exacerbate movements in the exchange rate, as can be seen from

equation (4.29), the reduced form expression for the exchange rate.

     The denominator of the second term on the right—hand side of (4.27') and

(4.28') is positive.              Thus an increase in the variability of the demand for

            money (02) will reduce the degree to which the authorities lean with

the wind and may even reverse this policy.                          An expected increase in the demand

for domestic money will be associated with an unanticipated appreciation of

the home currency.            Rather than contracting the money supply as would be optimal

if the main sources of uncertainty were foreign, optimal monetary policy will at

least in part accommodate the unexpected increase in the demand for money by
                                       — 22 —


expanding the money supply.


     The variability of foreign money demand has no effect on optimal domestic

monetary policy, however.       This result may seem surprising since, from (4.7)

and (4.), foreign monetary shocks do affect domestic income and, from (4.9) and

 (4.10), domestic monetary policy, given foreign monetary policy, does respond

to perceived shocks in the demand for foreign money.       If foreign monetary

authorities pursue an optimal monetary policy, however, they minimize the effect

of their own monetary disturbances.       Domestic monetary policy can then ignore

such disturbances.


     An increase in the variance of domestic income shocks raises the optimal

degree to which monetary authorities should lean with the wind.       A positive income

shock raises the demand for money and appreciates the exchange rate.       To offset

the effect of a positive income shock authorities should contract the money supply.

Hence when exchange rate variation is caused in large part by instability in the

supply of domestic output, monetary authorities should act to augment exchange rate

changes.


     The variability of foreign output shocks, unlike the variability of foreign

monetary shocks, does affect the optimal intervention policy.       A positive foreign

output shock will tend to depreciate the exchange rate and engender a foreign

monetary action which further depreciates the exchange rate.       (In contrast, a

foreign monetary disturbance engenders an offsetting foreign monetary action)

Foreign output shocks thus create exchange rate variability which is unrelated to

domestic disturbances.      Any response designed to offset the effects of domestic

shocks, as perceived through exchange rate variation, on domestic targets will be

diminished.   As a       rises, optimal domestic policy is aimed increasingly at
                     y
offsetting speculative behaviour.
                                     — 23 —


     For the same reason increased variability in shocks to the purchasing power

parity relationship also reduce the extent to which monetary policy can offset
                                                          2
the effects of domestic shocks on income.      As a       e
                                                              rises, then policy should
                                                      U
increasingly isolate the domestic price level from the effects of exchange rate

speculation.


     It is interesting to consider monetary policy in four special cases of the

model.



(a) No domestic shocks


     When a2 = a2 = 0, there are no domestic sources of disturbances in
                  m
          Uy    U
the home country.      The only shocks it faces are exchange rate disturbances

resulting either from the stochastic nature of the purchasing power parity
                  2                                                              2
relationship (a e > 0) or from uncertainty in the rest of the world (                *m'
     > 0)       In this case (4.27') reduces to a =   $.       If   there were noUsources

of disturbances internal to the foreign country (a2*y =                = 0) (4.28) re-
duces to a* =   —.      The money supply rule is entirely accommodating.              When

the exchange rate depreciates unexpectedly, the money supply expands.                 in the

absence of changes in the money supply a depreciation of the exchange rate

creates expectations of appreciation (since e+i, =            0).   These expectations increase

the speculative demand for home country money which would lower the home country

price level and therefore income.      To offset this, the monetary authority

acts so as to accommodate exactly the higher money demand with a higher supply.

Therefore, a country lacing shocks largely from abroad through the exchange

rate will adopt a monetary rule that exacerbates the exchange rate changes

in order to stabilise real income.
                                          — 24 —



(b)   No domestic shocks ard no currency substitution

       If there are no domestic shocks and         if   the demand for domestic currency
                                                                             2         2 =
is inelastic with respect to exchange rate changes (i.e. if a                    a                 = 0)
                                                                        u'       urn


then the optimal money supply is independent of the exchange rate (a = 0)                    -     Thus,
except in the improbable event that the various components of (4.27') cancel

exactly, a policy of free floating is optimal if and mly if (1) the demand for

money is interest inelastic and (2) there are no domestic disturbances.                          Even

if the demand for money does not depend on the expected change of the exchange rate

(i.e. if 1= 0) exchange rate changes signal in part domestic shocks to which the money

supply should respond.        This result is analogous to Poole's (1970) finding that in

the closed economy IS—LM model the optimal money supply is invariant to the interest

rate if and only if (1) the demand for money is interest inelastic and (2) the

economy is not subject to a variable demand for money


(b)   No real or purchasing power parity shocks
      When the only source of uncertainty is in the demand for either currency
(i.e. when 0y2 =       a2 = a2     = 0)   then policy makes the supply of money perfectly

elastic.        The exchange rate is pegged.       This result is analogous to Poole's

finding that for a closed economy a policy of fixing the interest rate is optimal

when the only source of disturbances is in the demand for money.                 Thte that if

pegging the exchange rate is the optimal policy for one country, it is so for both.

Unless the two countries peg at the same level, however, the model become

inconsistent.


(d) Infinitely elastic currency substitution

      If individuals view domestic and foreign currency as perfect substitutes then
      *
  =3      =   o and a policy of pegging minimizes income variability even if the economy

is subject to real disturbances.          If the authorities fail to peg the exchange rate,

exchange rate changes will subject both economies to wide swings in the demand for

money.        These will create large price changes which will in turn destabilize

income.       lkgain, consistency requires that monetary                       authorities      peg to the sante


exchange rate.



5.      Optimal Exchange Rate Management when Minixnising the Price Forecast Error
        is the Objective

        So far we have assumed that the policy makers objectives are to minimise

output variation around the cx ante expected natural rates (7.
                                                                                                =           = 0).

One   might   assume, instead, that policy makers are concerned with the deviation
                                                                                                    =   *

are unobserved contemporaneously.                        Such an objective is equivalent to mini

mising price forecast errors since


(5.1)
                  —
                          = Pt—
and

              *       y*           *     *           *

         The alternative specification of objective functions as

is plausible if one believes that price forecast errors themselves, rather than

output fluctuations, are a primary sorce of inefficiency.                                  If       such    a

specification is adopted, optimal policy rules are                             derived   for the home country

by choosing a such that E(y —
                               ulfl) = 0, given a* and forthe foreign country
by choosing a* such that E(y —
                               u I) = 0, given a. This yields
              a = S —

       Supply uncertainty now contributes toward the optimality of a policy of ex-

change rate stabilisation (leaning against the wind in the exchange market)

rather than the opposite.                        The reason is that an unanticipated increase in
                                      — 26 —


output,    ceteris paribus, will increase money demand, lower the price level and

cause the currency to appreciate.      To eliminate the unanticioated nrice decline

money    expansion is now appropriate, dampening the exchange rate change.

     The variability of foreign    shocks, regardless of whether they are monetary
or real    in origin, has no effect on optimal domestic monetary policy.           The

domestic effects of foreign shocks of either type are minimized by optimal foreign

monetary policy.      Each monetary authority, in other words, acts to offset the

effects of local shocks on both itself and the other country.


     Regardless of the variability of money demand or output supply shocks in either

economy, if the purchasing power relationship is non—stochastic a policy of pegging

the exchange rate is optimal.      In this case if the exchange rate is fixed then so

are prices.



6.   The Cooperative Pareto—Optimal Solution


     So far we have assumed that each monetary authority acts independently

 to attain a domestic policy objective, taking the monetary policy of the

 other country as given.      In this section we compare such policies with those

 that would arise if the two monetary authorities were to cooperate in setting

 monetary policy to attain a mutual objective.      To derive the set of Pareto—

 optimal policies we assume that policy makers jointly set monetary policy in

 period t to minimise an objective of the form


                                                            w,w* > 0

         As section 4 demonstrated, however, current values of         and       do not

 affect values of yaM y for r> t.         Choosing m to minimise

model, then, the Nash solution is also the unique Pareto—optimal solution.

This result is not surprising since, in our model, each country has one in-

dependent instrument, its money supply, and one independent target, the level

of its income.             In such a context there are no gains from policy coordination.

        To show that the equivalence of the Nash and Pareto—optimal solutions

does not generalise to systems in which there are more targets than instruments

consider a system in which one or both countries also have exchange rate sta—

bilisation as another goal, i.e. in period t the home country seeks to minimise.

 7.     Conclusion

        This study of optimal monetary policy or exchange rate         management in

interdependent economies has abstracted from many real—world complications to

obtain a transparent structure.             Nevertheless, a number of results are likely

to be robust under further generalisations of the model:


       1) .     Neither    a fixed nor a freely—floating exchange rate is likely to be

optimal.  Optimal monetary policy in general requires a finite response of
the money supply to the exchange rate.

       2). Output stabilising monetary policy may well require "leaning with
the wind" in the foreign exchange maUcets, expanding the money supply when the
home currency depreciates, thus increasing the volatility of the exchange rate.


       3)   .    authorities can stabilise real variables when private and
                Monetary
public opportunity sets differ. In our model the monetary authorities are
able   and willing to establish (one period ahead) contingent forward contracts
making the money supply in period t a known function of the contemporaneously—
observed exchange rate.            The private sector is assumed not to make exchange—rate
contingent forward contracts.            This asynnetry creates an opportunity for
output stabilising (or destabilising) current exchange rate—contingent monetary
policy,

       4) . There    are likely to be gains from policy coordination.

     Earlier versions of this paper were presented at the Ninety—Second Annual

     Meeting of the 1aTLerican Economic Association, Atlanta, Georgia, December

     1979 and at the First Annual Conference of the Society for Economic Dynamics

     and Control in Cambridge, England, June 1979 .        Stanley   Black, Paul Krugrruan,

     Marcus Miller and Douglas Purvis made useful comments.



1/ In this respect our model resembles that of Boye (1978) and Roper and

     Turnovsky (1980)     .    They, however, consider a single open economy

     characterized by Keynesian unemployment.         In a closed economy setting the

     current response issue has been stiñied by         C. Woglom (1979) and

     McCallum and Whitaker (1979)


2/ In a very different model Canzoneri (1979) obtains a similar result.



3/ A time—consistent policy or plan is a sequence of rules, one for each period,

     which specifies policy actions contingent on the state of the world in that

     period.       Each rule has the property of being optimal given the subsequent

     elements in the sequence.        When the current state depends on anticipations

     of future states, such"optimat time—consistent policies may fail to take

     account of the impact of future policy measures on the current state through

     the changes in current behaviour induced by anticipation of these future

     policy measures.         In such models, the optimal plan in subsequent periods

     may therefore not be the continuation of the first—period optimal plan over the

     remainder of the planning period, i.e. the optimal plan will not be time—

     consistent.       See Kydland and Prescott (1977), Fischer (1980), Buiter (1980

     a, b).


4/ If i >      t   for some i, that is if the current state is a function of current

     or past anticipations of a future state then the tine inconsistency problems

     referred to in the previous footnote may arise.         In the model developed in
      sections 3 through 6, the time—consistent policy is also the optimal

      policy even though expectations of the future exchange rate influence

      the current exchange rate.


5/ In the modern theory of optimal policy design in stochastic models,

      achievement of convergence has been replaced by the more general objective

      of   minimizing deviations of target variables fran their desired values
      over some finite or infinite time horizon.              Nevertheless, the distinctions

      we   have made about different forms of decentralization extend to the
      Mundellian problem.

6/ Trivial exceptions arise when           =
                                               a2
                                                    =   0   or when a2 l = "1      2 In
      this   case the model is in neutral equilibrium irrespective of policy.


7/ contracts which do not allow wages to respond to contemporaneous data might

      arise because such data are   not   available symmetrically to workers and

      employers, leading to problems of moral hazard.              See Eaton and Quandt (1979)

      for a discussion.


8/    Barro (1978) also assumes that the    demand          for money   responds to expected

      exchange rate changes in his model of monetary policy in a small open economy.


9/ We assume away all problems of non—uniqueness through extraneous information.

      The information sets of all agents are therefore limited to variables which

      appear in the structural model, given expectations, that is to market

      fundamentals   in the sense of FlOod and Garber (1979) .              See also Taylor

      (1977).


10/   Kydland (1976) provides a discussion of optimal stabilisation policies

      in   a two-country, multi—period context.
