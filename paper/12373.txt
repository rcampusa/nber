                                            ABSTRACT

As China has become an increasingly important part of the global trading system over the past two
decades, interest in the country and its international economic policies has increased among
international economists who are not China specialists. This paper represents an attempt to provide
the international economics community with a succinct summary of the major steps in the evolution
of Chinese policy toward international trade and foreign direct investment and their consequences
since the late 1970s. In doing so, we draw upon and update a number of more comprehensive
book-length treatments of the subject. It is our hope that this paper will prove to be a useful resource
for the growing numbers of international economists who are exploring China-related issues, either
in the classroom or in their own research.

    I.       Introduction

    This essay summarizes China’s progressive opening to foreign trade and investment in the

years since 1978. These reforms led China’s foreign trade to soar from $21 billion in 1978, when

China at best was a marginal player in global trade, to more than $1.1 trillion in 2004, when

China became the world’s third largest trading economy (National Bureau of Statistics 2005, 161;

World Trade Organization 2005, 16). We will briefly review the history of Chinese trade and

investment policy from 1978-2001 and note the impact of important policy changes on expansion

of trade and investment. Because accession to WTO marked an important watershed in the

evolution of Chinese policy in this realm, we will also include a discussion of the key features of

the agreement under which China joined the WTO and an assessment of the progress China has

made to date in implementing its obligations. The WTO accession agreement opens up important

components of the service sector of the Chinese economy, and these will receive special emphasis.

We will also address the high-profile debate over China’s currency regime and discuss the

implications of China’s expanding trade and foreign investment for the rest of the world.

         In providing this overview, we will be emphasizing several themes. First, China

achieved a greater degree of openness to foreign trade in manufactures prior to WTO accession

than is generally acknowledged, even in much of the best recent scholarship. In fact, the drive to

liberalization of trade and FDI regimes seems to have dramatically accelerated in the late 1990s.1

Second, the additional openings mandated under China’s WTO accession agreement will likely

make China’s economy the most open of any large developing country, and, to date, China has

made reasonable progress toward meeting her obligations. Third, developments in Chinese trade

and investment have generally conformed to patterns of Chinese comparative advantage, yielding

important benefits to China and her trading partners. Fourth, China’s current exchange rate

regime is no longer compatible with macroeconomic fundamentals. In addition to laying out the

study.


                                                                                                             3
key features of this issue, we discuss policy options and steps the government has taken so far.

Finally, China’s growth as a trading nation has recently reached the point where developments in

China have global impact. China’s impact is particularly strong in East and Southeast Asia, but

the degree to which this impact is on balance a positive one depends on the relative development

of the trading partner in question.

II.     The Move to Freer Trade Prior to WTO Accession

The Pre-Reform Trade Regime

        Up through the 1970s, Chinese trade took place within the context of a planned economy

and therefore nearly all trade was subject to very exacting quantitative guidelines. The State

Planning Commission’s import plan covered more than 90 percent of all imports. The export

plan was similarly comprehensive, specifying the physical quantities of more than 3,000

individual commodities. Prior to 1978, a handful of foreign trade corporations owned and

controlled by the Ministry of Foreign Trade were responsible for carrying out the import and

export plans. In this context, neither exports nor imports were sensitive to exchange rates or

relative prices.2 Furthermore, the composition of Chinese trade had little connection to Chinese

comparative advantage, with capital-intensive goods, including refined petroleum products,

playing a large role in Chinese exports well into the early 1980s. As a consequence, the volume

of Chinese trade, relative to world trade, declined sharply from 1.5 percent in 1953 to 0.6

percent in 1977 (Lardy 1994, 2).

Trade Liberalization

        China gradually reformed its trade regime over the 1980s and 1990s. However, progress

was neither simple nor straightforward. As the authorities phased out the direct quantitative

planning of imports and exports, they began to rely more heavily on a complicated welter of

Lardy (1992, 1994).


                                                                                                     4
alternative trade policies, including conventional tools such as tariffs and quotas, and less

conventional instruments, limiting trading rights and tougher commodity inspection requirements.

        The government actually raised import tariffs on most commodities in the early years of

the reform period. By 1982, the average statutory tariff rate was a relatively high 56 percent.

The government reduced this level to 43 percent in 1985, but then maintained that level

throughout the next seven years. Beginning in 1992, however, tariff levels fell in a series of

adjustments that brought the average tariff level down by two-thirds, to roughly 15 percent on the

eve of WTO accession (Lardy 2002, 34). In addition to tariffs, the government restricted trade in

a wide range of commodities by quotas and import licenses. This range of commodities actually

expanded over the course of the 1980s – by the end of the decade, nearly half of Chinese imports

was regulated by licenses or quotas. However, these restrictions were also dramatically cut in the

1990s. The share of imports they regulated fell to about 18 percent by 1992, and by 2001 it had

fallen further to about 8.45 percent (Lardy 2002, 39).

        Throughout the reform period, the government restricted the right to engage in foreign

trade. Nevertheless, there was a rapid and substantial expansion in the number of domestic firms

granted trading rights, as show in Table 1. From the initial 12 firms directly controlled by the

Ministry of Foreign Trade, this expanded to about 800 firms by 1985. A decade later, the number

of trading firms stood at 12,000. By 2001, this has expanded further to 35,000. With such a large

number of potential suppliers of trading services, it is likely that the market for such services had

become reasonably competitive by the mid-1990s (Lardy 2002, 40-42).

The Export Processing Regime

        China’s openness to imports expanded even faster than the decline in formal barriers

might suggest. A major reason has to do with the special privileges extended to firms involved in

export processing, which were set up in 1979. Initially, this legal framework provided various

incentives for the processing of raw materials for export and the assembly of imported goods to

produce finished goods for export. In 1987, the government expanded these incentives to provide


                                                                                                    5
for duty-free import of all raw materials, parts, and components used in the production of goods

for export. Also joint ventures and wholly foreign-owned companies have generally been

allowed to import capital goods duty-free throughout the reform period. As an increasingly open

FDI regime brought in more foreign investment, this allowed a larger and larger fraction of

China’s imports to escape the formal trade barriers. Finally, in the second half of the 1990s, the

Chinese government began to exempt certain categories of domestic firms and other

organizations from import duties (Lardy 2002, 36; Naughton 1996, 307).

          By the first half of 2000, less than 40 percent of imports were subject to any tariff. Thus,

actual tariff revenues have been far lower than the average statutory rates would suggest. As

shown in Figure 1, tariff revenues as a share of the value of imports peaked in the 1980s at about

16 percent of import values and fell steadily thereafter, reaching a low of about 3 percent by 1994.

A substantial portion of this decline reflects the enormous expansion of foreign direct investment,

the increasing importance of export processing, and the exemption of selected industries and

organizations from import tariffs altogether. It also reflects widespread violations of Chinese

trade laws (Lardy 2002, 36-38).

China’s Porous Protectionism in the 1990s3

          In principle, by the mid-1980s, China had two trade regimes – a very open one for

foreign firms and domestic enterprises engaged in export processing, and a more restrictive trade

regime for all other enterprises. Feenstra (1998) called China’s trade regime an example of “one

country, two systems,” and claimed that the maintenance of special privileges for export

processing firms was contrary to both the letter and the spirit of WTO rules.

          A dualistic trade regime of this type could, in principle, generate two sets of problems.

The first is akin to the problem of “trade diversion” in the economic analysis of customs unions.

Domestic Chinese enterprises in some industries might have a comparative advantage at

exporting a particular commodity or producing a certain good for the domestic market with

                                                                                                      6
imported components. They might nevertheless be supplanted by FIEs due to the FIEs’ legislated

advantages. In theory, welfare is reduced relative to what would have prevailed under a more

even-handed trade regime, even one with a higher level of overall effective protection, because

production is undertaken by a set of producers with higher social costs. (Naughton 1996, 298-

315). The second potential problem is that a large segment of the Chinese economy could remain

effectively protected from foreign competition, but this is masked by the overall trade statistics,

which largely reflect the success of the export processing regime. The notion that large swathes

of the Chinese economy were effectively closed off to foreign competition provided the

intellectual foundation for the belief that credible implementation of China’s WTO commitments

would generate destabilizing shocks.

         In practice, it is clear that the authorities have never been able to separate China’s two

trade regimes as completely as the letter of the law would suggest. Substantial quantities of parts

and components imported on a duty-free basis have been illegally sold in the domestic market,

and there have been substantial illegal sales in the domestic market of goods embodying duty-free

imports. In addition to “leakage” into the domestic market of goods imported under the export

processing regime, there has been a significant degree of outright smuggling, much of it via Hong

Kong.4

         Lardy (2002) notes that despite China’s virtual ban on imports of U.S. citrus products,

U.S. oranges and other fruits were widely available from vendors on street corners in cities

throughout China in the 1990s. The value of oranges smuggled into China via Hong Kong

annually was a minimum of $43.5 million and more likely several times that amount. Hong Kong

re-exports of cigarettes (another banned item) and 35mm film to China were $242 million and

$159 million in 1998 – these numbers were large multiples of the amount of imports from Hong

4
   China’s customs service launched a crackdown in 1998, leading to a large increase in the recorded
imports of high-tariff items. The campaign eventually resulted in the arrest of high-level officials and an
80% increase in the absolute value of recorded tariff revenue in 1999. In 2000, tariff revenue increased an
additional 30%, but did not keep pace with the 36% increase in import volume recorded in 2000. Tariff
revenue as a fraction of import value remains at a very low level. See Lardy (2002, 37-38)


                                                                                                          7
Kong recorded by Chinese trade statistics.5 Hong Kong was America’s fourth largest market for

U.S. pork in 1999, but more than half of that product subsequently made its way into China.6

Fisman and Wei (2004) conduct an interesting systematic study of the discrepancies between

Hong Kong and mainland Chinese trade statistics, which they term the “evasion gap.” Their

estimates suggest that an increase in the total import tax rate of 1 percent increases the evasion

gap by 3 percent!7

        “Leakage” of goods and components into the domestic economy via the export

processing regime and outright smuggling increased the de facto level of openness in the

economy as a whole. Furthermore, measurable developments in Chinese trade in the latter half of

the 1990s suggests some decline in the “dualism” of China’s trade regime in these years.

Between 1995 and 2000, what the Ministry of Commerce classifies as ordinary imports grew 130

percent, from $43.7 billion to $100.08 billion. Over the same period, the sum of imports of duty-

free parts and components used in processing and the duty-free imports of capital goods of joint

venture firms grew only 37 percent, from $78.33 billion to $107.32 billion. Growth in ordinary

imports has continued to be quite rapid since WTO accession, although it may slow in coming

years, as the current unsustainable investment boom subsides. Growing linkages between firms

engaged in export processing and local firms caused the ratio of value added in export processing

to double over the 1990s (Lardy 2002, 9, 38, 180). This reflected both the displacement of

imported parts and components by locally produced parts and rising wages. This suggests that

the view of the export sector as an enclave with little connection to the local economy became

increasingly out of date by the eve of China’s accession to the WTO.

Hanson (2004).


                                                                                                         8
Foreign Exchange Reform and Tax Policy

         The expansion of foreign trade was also abetted by changes in foreign exchange and tax

policy. Prior to reform, the regime maintained an overvalued exchange rate in order to subsidize

the import of capital goods that could not be produced domestically. Overvaluation led to excess

demand for foreign exchange, necessitating an extensive system of rigid exchange controls. Key

elements of this control system included a 100 percent foreign exchange surrender requirement

for exporters, tight limitations on the rights of individuals to hold foreign currency, and strict

controls on the outflow of foreign capital.

         Over the course of the reform period, the government relaxed all of these restrictions.

The authorities devalued the official exchange rate in stages, from RMB 1.5 to the dollar in 1981

to 8.7 in 1994. Following a modest appreciation, the government effectively fixed the excahange

rate at RMB 8.3 to the dollar in 1995, a rate that was not changed until the summer of 2005. The

IMF estimates that the Chinese currency lost about 70 percent of its value against the dollar in

real terms over the period from 1980 and 1995, substantially enhancing the international

competitiveness of China-based export operations.8 In addition to substantial real devaluation,

Chinese exporters were allowed to retain part of their foreign exchange earnings, individuals were

allowed to hold foreign exchange, and capital outflow restrictions were relaxed.

         Over the course of the reform period, China has come to increasingly rely on indirect

taxes to fund government expenditures. The World Trade Organization allows the rebate of

indirect taxes to exporters, in order to eliminate the disadvantage exporters in such countries face

relative to those based in countries that rely on direct taxes on income. The system of indirect

taxes in the 1980s was complex and a rebate program for exporters was correspondingly difficult

to administer effectively. As the value-added tax, which had only two basic rates, became more

 This change was measured on the basis of the real effective exchange rate, i.e. on a trade-weighted basis
and adjusted for the rate of inflation in China relative to its major trading partners (International Monetary
Fund 1996, 50a)


                                                                                                                 9
important as a revenue source, the export tax rebate became easier to administer in some respects,

but the government still encountered difficulties.

        The system was subject to extensive fraud as firms claimed rebates for goods that were

never exported. In addition, the government lacked the revenue to rebate all taxes and fell

considerably behind in rebate payments to exporting firms. The central government clamped

down on corruption and cut the rebate rates for exporters in 1995 and 1996. The export

slowdown experienced in the wake of the Asian financial crisis prompted the government to

reverse course, raising the amount of the tax rebated to 100 percent for some commodities and

accelerating the actual payment of rebates due. This arguably helped promote the extremely high

rates of export growth recorded after the Asian crisis began to abate, but it exacerbated the central

government’s financial problems.

International versus Intranational Trade

        A number of studies have documented the existence and importance of interprovincial

protectionism in China (Wederman, 2003). Young (2000, 1091-1135) goes so far as to suggest

that China’s internal market has become substantially less integrated over the reform period, as

local governments have sought to shield local producers from competitors based elsewhere in

China.9 This assertion is undermined by extensive evidence. Naughton (1999) demonstrates that

interprovincial trade flows were quite substantial, even in the early 1990s. The level of

interregional trade implied by Naughton’s data is hard to reconcile with provincial autarky. Bai

et al. (2004), using more recent and more disaggregated data on the province-level industrial

composition, find evidence of increasing specialization in industrial structure over the course of

the 1990s, a direct contradiction of Young’s finding. They concede that there is clear evidence of

local protectionism, but conclude that it has substantially diminished over time. Huang and Wei


9
   Branstetter and Feenstra (2002) present estimates of a formal political economy model in which
provincial governments are presumed to protect locally based firms from both foreign competition and
competitors outside the province. These estimates suggest a substantial decrease in the protectionist
tendencies of the government through the mid-1990s.


                                                                                                        10
(2001) have examined the speed of convergence towards the law of one price for identical

products in different cities in China over the 1990s and found that it is comparable to what

Parsley and Wei (1996) or O’Connell and Wei (2003) found for the United States. Finally,

foreigners who have traveled widely within China in recent years cannot fail to note both the

massive program to build major inter-provincial highways and the increasing visibility of both

foreign and domestic brand names with virtually nationwide distribution and advertising.

International integration appears to be proceeding together with intranational integration.

III.             The Opening to FDI Prior to WTO Accession

Liberalization of Foreign Direct Investment

        Despite rising interest in foreign direct investment in China after the 1972 visit of U.S.

President Richard Nixon, a number of severe restrictions on FDI remained in place – including a

ban on external financing of FDI projects – such that there was very little inward investment until

policies were dramatically changed in 1979. In that year a new Law on Joint Ventures was

passed, providing a basic framework under which foreign firms were allowed to operate.

Restrictions on external debt and equity finance were relaxed, and, as has been already indicated,

restrictions on foreign trade were reduced. Provincial and local governments were allowed

considerable freedom in regulating the joint ventures that were established within their

jurisdictions. In the same year, four “special economic zones” were established in which foreign

firms were offered preferential tax and administrative treatment and given an unusually free hand

in their operations.10

        These “experiments” in attracting foreign direct investment were quite successful. In

1984, the government, in a bid to attract FDI, granted similar exemptions from taxes and

administrative procedures to 14 additional administrative units, mostly municipalities on China’s

Pacific coast. This granted units, known variously as “Opened Cities” or “Export and

10
   These SEZs included Shenzhen (across the border from Hong Kong), Zhuhai (across the border from
Macau), and Shantou (on the Guangdong coast facing Taiwan) and Xiamen (directly across the Taiwan
Straits from Taiwan).


                                                                                                     11
Technology Development Zones,” the authority to approve FDI projects under $30 million (a

threshold later raised to $50 million) at the local level.

        The next major regulatory change in FDI came in 1986, with the implementation of a

legal regime change that Feenstra (1998, 6) has dubbed the “22 Regulations.” These changes

represented a major liberalization that applied throughout China. “Foreign invested enterprises”

were made eligible for reduced business income tax rates regardless of location, and were given

increased managerial autonomy. Tight controls on the remittance of profit in foreign currencies

were lifted. Finally, and most importantly, the 22 Regulations designated two categories of

foreign investments as being eligible for additional special benefits – “export oriented” projects

(defined as projects exporting 50 percent or more of their production value) and “technologically

advanced” projects (defined as projects which upgrade domestic production capacity through the

use of ‘advanced’ technology).

        The 22 Regulations also set up an approval process for foreign direct investment projects

which remained in place until WTO accession, albeit with some modification. While the formal

regulatory framework implies substantial centralization of power over the approval process and

subsequent regulatory oversight of FIEs, there is considerable debate as to how much the central

government intervened in the oversight of FIEs after they are established. In practice, there

seems to be a considerable degree of de facto local autonomy in regulating FIEs. Investments

below a certain threshold size required only local approval, and this lead to the partition of large

numbers of FDI projects into sub-projects that fell below the threshold, in order to streamline and

accelerate the approval and negotiation process.11

The Rise, Fall, and Rise of FDI since 1989

        The next major shift in FDI in China marked not so much a regulatory shift as a change

in the composition of foreign investors. FDI in China slowed briefly after the Tiananmen

11
    See Rosen (1999, 56-59) for a discussion of the threshold and evidence supporting the view that such
partitions took place. Huang (2004, 260-302) regards the small size of many FDI projects in China as a
reflection of distortions in the economy.


                                                                                                           12
Incident, but the inflows resumed and quickly grew in the 1990s.12 Whereas FDI in China in the

1980s had been overwhelmingly dominated by Hong Kong and Taiwan-based investors seeking

to exploit relatively low cost labor in the SEZs for export processing, in-flows diversified in the

1990s. Hong Kong and Taiwan-based investors continued to play an important role, but Japanese,

American, and European firms also increased their FDI into China, much of it focused on the

domestic market. Figure 2 illustrates the growth over time in contracted FDI and actual foreign

investment. Figure 3 shows variation over time in the number of FDI contracts approved and in

the nature of the entity created. Of particular interest is the growth in wholly-owned foreign

enterprises relative to equity joint ventures. Figure 4 breaks down growth in actual investment

flows by the nationality of the investing country.13

         As Figure 2 shows, contracted FDI peaked in the early 1990s and declined sharply for the

rest of the decade.14 These contracts contained multi-year business plans, so it is not surprising

that there is a lag between the approval of a contract and the actual investment associated with it.

Nevertheless, the sharp divergence in these two time series hints at some problems that foreign

investors, particularly Western firms with little previous experience in China, encountered as they

rushed to enter the market in this period.15 The FDI boom began when China was in the midst of




12
   Barry Naughton (1996, 278-280), among others, suggests that there was a de facto loosening of the
official regulations on foreign direct investment which allowed multinationals to skirt the official export
requirements. Essentially, export requirements were increasingly ignored or the definition of a
“technologically advanced” project was broadened to allow even not particularly technology-intensive
firms to set up plants to serve the Chinese market.

    Because of official restrictions on direct Taiwanese investment in the mainland, some Taiwanese FDI
gets routed through Hong Kong or through “tax haven” nations such as the Cayman Islands. Such “tax
haven” jurisdictions are a prominent component of the “other nations” category shown in Figure 4.
14
    In 1994, foreign-invested enterprises collectively accounted for about 17% of all fixed asset investment,
prompting some scholars such as Huang (2003, 1-62) to refer to the “dependency” of Chinese investment
on foreign firms. By 2000, the ratio of FIE investment to total investment had fallen to 10%. By 2003,
even in the context of a substantial increase in FDI, the share of FIEs in domestic investment had fallen
further, to 7%.
15
    It is likely that the contracted amounts were subject to some over-reporting, as local officials vied to
take credit for bringing FDI to their jurisdictions. However, the existence of a likely systematic upward
bias in these numbers makes their decline in the mid-to-late 1990s all the more striking.


                                                                                                          13
an unsustainable expansion, brought on in part by rapid credit creation.16 Demand growth was

rapidly outstripping supply, leading to a surge in inflation that peaked in 1994, when consumer

prices shot up by one-fourth. Zhu Rongji, then serving as vice premier and governor of the

central bank, initiated contractionary monetary and fiscal policies that reduced aggregate demand

and moderated price inflation. By 1996, growth and inflation were down to more sustainable

levels. Then the Asian crisis hit, leading to yet slower growth in domestic demand, a dramatic

slowdown in export growth, and domestic price deflation. The scale and number of FDI projects

approved in the early 1990s appear to have been motivated in part by an extrapolation of the

(unsustainable) expansion of domestic demand observed in those years. Firms also appear to

have been unprepared for the barriers they encountered in attempting to distribute their goods

within China.17 In the context of the domestic demand retrenchment that followed, it is

unsurprising that many ventures proved to be spectacularly unprofitable.

         The speed with which FDI increased in the early 1990s also generated problems. Western

firms, primarily targeting the local market, were hoping to establish dominant market positions in

advance of their rivals. However, they were all competing for specialized resources (multilingual

Chinese managers, skilled labor, Western-style office space, etc.) whose supply was relatively

fixed in the short run. Predictably, costs for these scarce resources rapidly exceeded the

projections of some of these firms.18 Most foreign firms targeting the domestic market were

required to form a joint venture with a local Chinese firm, usually an SOE. The supply of well-

run, effectively managed SOEs was also quite limited. In their eagerness to set up operations,

16
    Debates about the true size of the Chinese economy in the early 1990s suggested that real domestic
demand was substantially larger than comparisons at market exchange rates would suggest. Some of the
adjustment factors then favored have since been rejected as overoptimistic. See Studwell (2002, 158-162)
for an account of how this academic debate was presented in the business press. Later research also
confirmed that Chinese statistics increasingly overstated the true rate of growth. See Lardy (2002, 11-14).
17
    Rosen (1999, 159-196) suggests, based on FIE manager interviews, that barriers to distribution arising
from the inadequacy of transport infrastructure, institutional constraints preventing FIEs from controlling
their own distribution channels, and the control of local governments over the important distribution
channels were among the most serious barriers to serving the domestic market in the latter 1990s.
18
    Again, Rosen (1999, 85-115) and Studwell (2002, 115-133) provide evidence of these cost increases.
While not solely driven by foreign investors, the commercial real estate markets in Shanghai and some
other major Chinese cities went through a pronounced “boom and bust” in the mid-to-late 1990s.


                                                                                                         14
many firms forged alliances with enterprises that turned out to be far less efficient, amenable to

Western direction, or politically connected than they thought. The survey and interview evidence

presented by Rosen (1999, 17-83) suggests that many Western investors were unprepared for the

cultural clashes, administrative difficulties, and operational inefficiencies created by their “forced

marriages” to Chinese SOEs.19 Figure 3 illustrates a sharp downturn in the number of contracts

signed and a striking shift toward wholly owned foreign enterprises, as this option became

feasible in an expanding number of industries and situations.

         The deep disillusionment harbored by some Western expatriates by the end of the 1990s

has been vividly captured by Studwell (2002, 137-153). Much of the reporting in the popular

press echoed this pessimism, stressing the difficulties multinational firms were having making

money in China.

         Even as actual FDI levels had begun to fall, reformers in the Chinese government were

negotiating terms for WTO accession that dramatically expanded the freedom with which foreign

firms could operate in China. Prior to the signing of the agreement, more categories of FIEs were

allowed to sidestep joint ventures entirely and set up wholly foreign-owned enterprises.

Interference in supply chain management, product development, and operations was scaled back.

The final bilateral agreement with the U.S., signed in November 1999, signaled a dramatic

change in the Chinese operating environment. Contracted FDI increased almost immediately, and

levels of actual utilization began to follow suit, as can be seen in Figure 2.

         A pickup in demand growth also spurred FDI. Chinese export growth rapidly expanded

as the regional economy recovered from the effects of the East Asian crisis.20         While the veracity

of the official GDP growth rates in the immediate aftermath of the East Asian crisis have been


19
    Some of the operational inefficiencies were related to the “performance requirements” then in place in
FIE contracts. Firms were often asked to meet targets for export of final output or localization of parts
procurement than ran counter to what profit maximization would dictate. See Rosen (1999, 69-75).
20
    Plans to eliminate the duty-free import of capital goods for export processing were abandoned, VAT
rebates for exporters were expanded and payments were accelerated, and the government seems to have
directed the banking sector to support export growth. See Lardy (2002, 18).


                                                                                                         15
questioned, even the most pessimistic views suggest that Chinese GDP growth was more resilient

than that of other large economies in the region, possibly inducing firms that might have invested

elsewhere to focus on China.21 The austerity regime put in place in the mid-1990s was reversed

after the Asian crisis, interest rates were cut several times, lending by state banks was expanded,

and the government also sought to use a sizable fiscal stimulus to boost domestic demand.22

Export growth slowed sharply again in 2001, with the worldwide slowdown generated by the

September 11 attacks, but rapidly rebounded in 2002. While difficult to measure with precision,

estimates of the profits of foreign enterprises provided in Figure 5 appear to be consistent with

this pattern as they declined steadily through 1998, then rebounded sharply thereafter.23

         Domestic demand was rapidly expanding again by the end of 2002 as investment

spending surged to high levels. Dramatic increases in the availability of consumer credit spurred

a sharp rise in purchase of automobiles, apartments, and other “big ticket” items. For firms such

as GM, that had rapidly built up technologically advanced production capacity in the mid-to-late

1990s under weak demand conditions, the surge in demand seemed to vindicate their aggressive

China expansion strategies.24 The impact of more expansionary monetary and fiscal policy on the

Chinese economy had been partially offset from 1998 through mid-2001 by a substantial

restructuring of state-owned manufacturing enterprises. Most small and medium scale state-

owned operations were sold off to their managers or to manager and worker investment groups,


21
    Rawski (2001) suggests that growth in 1998 might have been less than one-half of the officially
recorded level.
22
    The Wall Street Journal reported that American firms had lost money in China in the 1980s, received
minimal earnings on their Chinese affiliates throughout much of the 1990s, but earned much higher profits
on their China operations beginning in 1999. By 2003, American corporate earnings from China and Hong
Kong combined were roughly equal to their earnings from Japan – a much larger economy. See Andrew
Higgins, “As China Surges, It Also Proves a Buttress to American Strength,” Wall Street Journal Online,
January 30, 2004.
23
    These estimates aggregate together foreign enterprises primarily engaged in export processing and
foreign enterprises that primarily serve the domestic market. The profitability of the former is generally
thought to have been relatively high throughout the period, whereas the profitability of the latter is thought
to have fluctuated substantially. ROA is calculated on a pre-tax basis, using official statistics.
24
    Chinese automobile sales grew an average of less than 1% per year during the 1998-2001 period. Then
they surged 68% in 2002 and another 55% in 2003. Growth slowed sharply in 2004 and only partially
recovered in 2005. See METI (2003), the National Statistics Bureau web site, and Wonacott (2004).


                                                                                                           16
hundreds of state factories were shut down, and the larger remaining state-owned units began

laying off excess workers at an astonishing pace. When the dust settled the number of workers

employed in state-owned manufacturing establishments had fallen by about three-quarters, from

around 35 million in 1992 to less than 10 million in 2002, with most of the decline occurring in

the late 1990s (National Bureau of Statistics 2004b, 134). Once this period of retrenchment

waned, however, the economy began growing at a pace increasingly reminiscent of the boom of

the early 1990s. Even the uncertainty created by the outbreak of SARS, a previously unknown

and fatal respiratory ailment that rapidly spread throughout East Asia, failed to stall growth

momentum in 2003. By late 2003, however, the Chinese government was once again taking steps

to try to limit overinvestment and excessive growth, primarily through direct administrative

measures rather than higher interest rates or a revalued exchange rate.25 While these measures

appeared to have had some success, the scale of expansion in lending and investment suggested

that some of the progress made in scaling back non-performing loans in the late 1990s and early

2000s was likely undone in the investment boom of 2002-2004.26

Did Trade and FDI Drive Growth in the 1990s?

         The rapid growth of Chinese exports in the decade prior to WTO accession, the relatively

large share of GDP the export sector has come to represent, and the persistent and growing trade

imbalance with the United States might suggest that net exports, and the FDI that contributed to it,

has been an important driving factor in Chinese economic growth in the 1990s. Many

accusations of “neo-mercantilism” on the part of the Chinese government are predicated on this

view.



25
    An early casualty of these administrative controls was the automobile industry. The Chinese boom in
sales was a boon to the large multinational assemblers, such as Volkswagen and GM. However, as of July
2004, sales were just 3.7% over the previous year’s levels – a sharp decline relative to industry expectations
of 25-30% growth. Press reports suggested that production volumes, prices, and industry profits were all
dropping sharply. See Taylor (2004) and the National Bureau of Statistics.
26
   Similarly pronounced cycles of rapid growth followed by substantial slowdown can be seen in the trade
statistics and in measures of domestic investment. For one theory-based analysis of the macroeconomic
instability of the reform period, see Brandt and Zhu (2000).


                                                                                                          17
        In a narrow growth accounting sense, it is simply not true that net exports have been a

consistently important driver of growth in the 1990s, as is illustrated in Figure 6, using

components of the national income and product accounts taken from IMF International Financial

Statistics data. Growth in imports has broadly kept pace with growth in exports. In the eleven

years shown in this chart, net exports contributed positively to GDP growth in seven years and

detracted from it in four, but with few exceptions, the net impact was modest compared either to

capital investment or to private consumption. FDI, much of it export-related, has contributed to

capital formation, but as we have already noted, that contribution has also been relatively modest,

declining from a peak of 17 percent in 1994 to about 7 percent in 2003. Recognition of these

facts helps place useful bounds both on the degree to which recent growth can be ascribed to

trade and to the prospects for further “trade-driven” growth.

        That being said, there is no question that expanding trade and FDI have contributed to

Chinese living standards since the reform period began and particularly in the last decade.

Chinese consumers have benefited from price declines and an increase in the quality and variety

of goods consumed, and China has been able to alter its pattern of industrial production to

conform to its comparative advantage. These are the static gains stressed by classical trade theory.

While difficult to quantify with precision, they are certainly substantial. Moreover, these gains

are shared with China’s trading partners, who have also benefited from cheaper imports, export

sales to China, and returns from investment in Chinese enterprises.

        China’s increasing openness to trade and FDI also has fostered a much greater degree of

competition in Chinese product (and, increasingly, service) markets than would have otherwise

existed. This has provided a powerful disciplining force constraining the expansion of inefficient

enterprises, even when such enterprises received extensive support from other features of the

institutional environment, such as the problematic banking system. As foreign producers have

been allowed steadily greater freedom to operate in the Chinese market, this competitive pressure

has intensified, increasing the likelihood that market share gains are concentrated in the most


                                                                                                    18
efficient firms. This, in turn, arguably raises the marginal productivity of capital and labor

throughout the economy, although it is clearly difficult to quantify this impact.

        China has arguably gained in other dimensions as well, although these benefits are also

difficult to quantify. The ability to import technology embodied in capital goods and components

has certainly contributed to output expansion. Chinese workers and managers have also benefited

from training in foreign technology and management practices. While the Chinese economy as a

whole does not appear to exhibit exceptional performance in terms of total factor productivity

growth, it is clear that the relative labor productivity of Chinese workers has increased

substantially, particularly in the export sector. This has been partially reflected in wage increases

and will be eventually reflected in an appreciation of the real exchange rate. Given the level of

China’s openness to trade, the improvement in terms of trade that would result from such an

appreciation would confer nontrivial welfare effects.27

        Huang (2003) has suggested that the prominence of FIEs in Chinese production and trade

reflects systematic discrimination against indigenous private Chinese firms, making it difficult for

them to acquire capital, defend their property rights, and engage in foreign trade. We would not

contest the view that the repression of the private sector has generated welfare-reducing

distortions, and we agree that misallocation of capital by the Chinese financial system has created

serious problems (Lardy 1998). That being said, we do not regard the prominent position of FIEs

as simply reflecting distortions in the Chinese economic system. While it is possible that FIEs

would play a less prominent role in a counterfactual world in which these distortions did not exist,

we believe that even under these alternative circumstances, foreign investors would find China an

attractive place in which to locate export processing operations. The fundamental attractors of a

27
    Whalley and Xin (2006) estimate that the expansion of FIEs may have accounted for more than 40% of
Chinese GDP growth in 2003 and 2004 and that the absence of FDI inflows in those years would have
reduced growth by about 3.4 percentage points. They suggest that a slowdown in FDI inflows could cause
GDP growth to drop significantly. The growth decomposition on which this calculation is based rests on a
number of assumptions that can be called into question. (For example, foreign supplied capital is assumed
to be the only non-labor input to the FIE sub-economy.) We regard Whalley and Xin’s calculations as an
upper bound estimate of the impact of FIEs on China in recent years.


                                                                                                       19
large, low-cost labor force, relatively good export infrastructure, and the ability to purchase inputs

at world prices, would still exist under this counterfactual scenario. In addition, China’s internal

market might, if anything, be even more attractive, and growing even more rapidly, under a

counterfactual scenario in which the financial system was not burdened by a large stock of

nonperforming loans to state-owned enterprises. Despite recent rapid growth in the size,

investment, and legal recognition of the private sector in China, FIEs continue to play an

important role in mediating China’s foreign trade. We expect this to continue, at least in the

short-to-medium run.28

IV.      China’s WTO Accession Agreement and its Implementation

         A significant portion of the tariff reduction and other trade liberalization measures that

the Chinese government undertook in the 1990s were essentially part of China’s WTO accession

process. To gain credibility with its negotiating partners that it was seriously committed to

opening up its economy, China chose to unilaterally liberalize. Then in its key final bilateral

negotiations with the United States in 1999 China agree to additional market opening

commitments that were incorporated into China’s final WTO accession package. In this process

China agreed to a set of conditions that were far more stringent than the terms under which other

developing countries had acceded. Indeed, in certain respects China’s liberalization

commitments exceed those of advanced industrial countries. Why did China’s leadership agree to

such commitments, given that they were expected to entail substantial short-term adjustment

costs?

         The most plausible answer to this question was the one given by Premier Zhu Rongji at

the time of his visit to the United States in April 1999. On that trip Premier Zhu, perhaps for the


28
    Wells (1991) among others has pointed out that while the Asian NIEs were able to expand their exports
of labor-intensive manufactures under largely contractual arrangements, the growth of labor-intensive
manufacturing exports elsewhere in Asia, such as in the ASEAN countries, has been driven to a much
greater extent by FDI. Wells (1991) and the discussion contained therein provide a number of reasons why
FDI has been more important in the period since the mid-1980s, even in countries that lacked China’s legal
and institutional discrimination against private firms.


                                                                                                       20
first time, openly expressed the view that China’s membership in the WTO was an essential

element of his reform strategy. He had come to the view that more competition was an essential

source of pressure that would ultimately force state-owned enterprises and banks to take

additional structural reforms. In his joint press conference with President Clinton he stated “The

competition arising [from WTO membership] will also promote a more rapid and more healthy

development of China’s national economy.”29

        Premier Zhu and most of those around him came to believe that China had no viable

alternative to becoming even more deeply involved in the globalizing economy. Long Yongtu,

China’s chief WTO negotiator, clearly understood that a growing array of goods were being

produced in global rather than national production networks. He also had the insight to realize

that simply reducing import barriers was insufficient if China wanted to benefit from

globalization. Rather, he said “Countries with planned economies have never been part of

economic globalization. China’s economy must become a market economy in order to become

part of the global economic system, as well as the economic globalization process.”30 In short,

China’s top political leadership made extensive commitments to the WTO in order to advance

their domestic reform agenda.



        Here we briefly summarize the most important features of China’s WTO accession

agreement, and note the progress China has made in terms of meeting its commitments. A more

thorough treatment of the agreement is available in Lardy (2002). China’s commitments

regarding its service sector will be examined in the next section.

        China agreed in 1999 to lower its average tariff levels on industrial products to 8.9

percent. Most of these new tariff levels have already been phased in as of the time of this writing

in mid-2005, some even well in advance of the timetable required under WTO obligations.

Tariffs on some important classes of goods, such as information technology products, have

already been cut to zero. Even more significantly, China agreed to eliminate all quotas, licenses,

tendering requirements, and other nontariff barriers to imports of manufactured goods by 2005.

China has agreed to modify its import registration system to make it consistent with the WTO

Agreement on Import Licensing. By and large, these obligations have been met. Recent U.S.

criticism has focused on preferential VAT tax treatment for domestically produced fertilizer and

semiconductors, which constituted a de facto import tariff for foreign producers exporting to

China. These tax preferences were eliminated for semiconductors in 2004. China eliminated the

last import quota, that on automobiles, on January 1, 2005. However, China has the right to

maintain indefinitely a fairly high 25 percent import tariff on automobiles. This is expected to

limit growth in auto imports.

        China will retain the state monopoly on foreign trade for a small number of commodities,

which nevertheless includes critical imports such as crude oil, refined petroleum products,

fertilizer, cotton, grain, and vegetable oil, and key exports such as tea, tungsten, silk, cotton

products, and fossil fuels.31 Outside this narrow set of categories, China promised to abolish by

the end of 2004 the designated trading system, by which trade in a broader range of commodities

is limited to a small number of trading companies designated by the central government. More

generally, China agreed to provide the right to import and export to all firms active in China,

foreign and domestic. The USTR (2004, 2005), in its annual reports on foreign barriers to U.S.

trade, acknowledged China’s progress in meeting these obligations.




31
   China is not unique in mandating a state monopoly in trade for a limited range of products, and such
practices are not prohibited under the Uruguay Round Agreement.


                                                                                                          22
        Parties opposed to China’s WTO accession suggested that China would use

discriminatory product standards to keep out imports of industrial products. In December 2001,

the Chinese government promulgated a new, compulsory product certification system that

required domestic and foreign products in over one hundred product categories to obtain the

China Compulsory Certification (CCC) mark. The certification process involves on-site

inspection of foreign manufacturing plants, undertaken at producer expense. U.S. firms have

complained about the inconsistent and arbitrary enforcement of these rules, which has included

the blockage at the border of product samples intended for testing by Chinese government

officials. However, there is no evidence that these practices have become a major constraint to

trade in the affected categories (USTR 2004).

FDI in the Manufacturing Sector

        The pre-WTO regime regulating foreign direct investment contained explicit provisions

requiring some FIEs to achieve a certain degree of local content, balance their trade by offsetting

imports of components with exports of final products, or meet their foreign exchange

requirements through exporting. In addition, FIE approvals were often contingent on technology

transfer to domestic partners or the establishment of research centers in China. The WTO

Agreement on Trade-Related Investment Measures (TRIMs) explicitly precludes WTO members

from imposing restrictions on investment that create trade restrictions or distortions. The

measures that are precluded include local content requirements, trade balancing requirements, and

foreign exchange balancing requirements. China agreed to fully enforce the provisions of the

TRIMs agreement upon accession, and it also agreed not to enforce provisions of existing

contracts with foreign firms that are inconsistent with TRIMs. As we have already noted,

however, many of these provisions were not strongly enforced even prior to WTO, and the de

facto investment regime became steadily more open in the late 1990s.

        China agreed in principle to cease the practices of pressuring foreign firms to transfer

technology to local partners and to increase the domestic content of automobiles assembled in


                                                                                                   23
China. While TRIMs rules out forced technology transfer, there is an extensive set of practices

“encouraging” technology transfer that are arguably permissible under TRIMs, and many of these

practices appear to persist in China, drawing some criticism from foreign firms and the USTR.

State-owned firms are free to “request” technology transfers as part of a sales contract, and

international competition among vendors eager to expand in the Chinese market provides these

Chinese customers with extensive leverage.32 The National Development and Reform

Commission’s new plan for industrial policy in the automobile industry published in May 2004

continues to include provisions that discourage the import of auto parts.33 This has drawn some

criticism from foreign automobile firms.

         However, the most serious dispute over “forced technology transfer” since WTO

accession was recently resolved on terms favorable to foreign industry. In May 2003, China

issued two mandatory standards for encryption over Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs),

applicable to domestic and imported equipment containing WLAN (also known as Wi-Fi)

technologies. These standards, which were originally scheduled to become fully effective in June

2004, incorporate the WLAN Authentication and Privacy Infrastructure (WAPI) encryption

technique for secure communications. This component of the standards differed significantly

from the internationally recognized standards that U.S. companies have adopted for global

production. China sought to enforce the use of these standards by providing the necessary

algorithms only to a limited number of Chinese companies. Accordingly, U.S. and other foreign

manufacturers would have to work with and through these companies, some of which were their

competitors, and provide them with technical product specifications, if their products were to

    See Kranhold, “China’s Price for Market Entry: Give Us Your Technology, Too,” February 26, 2004,
Wall Street Journal Online Edition. The article details how GE’s power generation business was pressured
to transfer sensitive turbine technology in return for contracts with state-owned utilities. The willingness of
foreign competitors to transfer technology in return for business was a key factor in GE’s decision to do so.
No one suggests that this policy is in violation of China’s obligations under its WTO accession agreement.

government support in opposing this measure, viewing it as a TRIMs-inconsistent attempt to

force transfer of sensitive technology to competitors and as a WTO-inconsistent attempt to

misuse product standards to restrict trade. After several months of high-level consultation, the

Chinese government quietly dropped the proposed mandatory standards (Kennedy 2004).

        While foreign investors generally have viewed favorably China’s implementation of its

WTO obligations, an important exception is the area of intellectual property rights. In principle,

China is bound under the TRIPs agreement to enact and enforce adequate standards of intellectual

property protection. After bilateral negotiations with the United States, China enacted a patent

law in 1993, which would seem to be fully in compliance with TRIPs, but lack of enforcement

continues to be an issue for foreign firms. While central government officials regularly affirm

their commitment to better enforcement, foreign investors claim that local officials take a far

more permissive view of patent and trademark infringement.34

        As part of its pathbreaking commitment to open up the distribution services sector, China

also agreed to allow foreign firms much greater control over the advertising, distribution, and

after-sales service of their goods, both those produced in China and those imported from outside

the country. The increasing participation of foreign distributors in China is expected to improve

the efficiency of the sector, ameliorating one of the persistent problems faced by foreign firms

seeking to market goods outside the major cities.

Agricultural Trade

        China also agreed to significant liberalization of its agricultural markets. China pledged

to reduce the average statutory import tariff rate for agricultural products from 21 percent to 15

percent (Rosen, Rozelle, and Huang 2004, 8, 41). Prior to WTO accession, China, like many

34
    In September 2004, the American Chamber of Commerce in China issued a statement praising the
Chinese government for what was viewed as a largely faithful implementation of its WTO obligations. At
the same time, the chamber singled out intellectual property rights as a critical exception. See Charles
Hutzler and Phelim Kyne, “U.S. Businesses Urge China to Rein in Piracy,” September 17, 2004, Wall
Street Journal Online Edition.


                                                                                                      25
other countries, limited imports of sensitive agricultural commodities with quotas and other

nontariff barriers that created effective rates of protection far higher than the 21 percent average

statutory rate. Bound by the Agreement on Agriculture in the Uruguay Round, China is required

to eliminate nontariff barriers to the import of agricultural products and replace them with tariffs

that provide equivalent protection, as part of the goal of making agricultural protectionism more

transparent and setting a common basis among countries for negotiating future tariff reductions.

          The agreement requires countries to offer minimum “access opportunities” for

agricultural commodities subject to tariffication. These take the form of limited levels of imports

that are admitted at relatively low tariff rates, with all imports above that level subject to much

higher tariff rates. China is noteworthy in terms of the relatively large amount of imports that

will be admitted at lower rates and the very low tariff rates being charged on these levels. China

agreed to impose tariffs of only 1 percent on “minimum access” levels of imports for wheat, corn,

rice, and cotton. The minimum access levels are themselves considerably higher than the actual

level of imports of these products in 1998. On the other hand, even when fully phased in,

minimum access requirements would be a small share of projected domestic consumption, and

China’s commitments with regard to rice fall short of the standards specified in the WTO

Agricultural Agreement. China’s compliance with this agreement remains an area of contention

with its trading partners, particularly the U.S. 2002 trade data showed that quota fill-rates for

wheat, corn, and cotton were 7 percent, 0.1 percent, and 22 percent, respectively. However, U.S.

agricultural exports to China grew substantially in 2003. U.S. cotton exports increased by 430

percent and soybean exports increased by 218 percent over 2002 levels.35

          Health standards have been frequently employed as a de facto nontariff barrier to

agricultural imports. China agreed to be bound by the WTO Agreement on Sanitary and

Phytosanitary standards. Bilateral agreements with the United States prior to WTO accession

resulted in the removal of blanket bans on imports of citrus fruit, wheat, U.S. leaf tobacco, and

                                                                                                        26
meat from certain U.S. regions that had been justified on the basis of health standards.36 Since

joining the WTO, however, China has issued more than 100 new quality and health standards for

foods. U.S. exporters complain that many of these have not been publicly documented with the

WTO in detail, as WTO obligations require, and that they are both designed to block imports and

applied in ways that discriminate against imports. Phytosanitary barriers continue to block

imports of stone fruit, several varieties of apples, pears, fresh potatoes, and processed food

products containing certain food additives, according to the USTR. AQSIQ, the new agency in

charge of administering these quality standards, has de-listed four U.S. meat processing plants

and continues to hold up imports of citrus products from four counties in the State of Florida.

Imports of wheat from the Pacific Northwest, while permitted, are apparently singled out for

special treatment by quarantine officials, discouraging imports. U.S. soybean imports were

disrupted by the announcement of a ban on imports from four companies trading U.S. soybeans

due to detections of phytophthora sojae, which is ubiquitous in China. The suspension of imports

was delayed after high-level U.S. government intervention. U.S. exporters are also concerned

about new regulations on agricultural biotechnology, testing, and labeling. Transgenic soybean

imports have been formally approved, but approval was still pending on six corn varieties as of

late 2003.

        China also agreed to significant limitations on agricultural subsidies. China has agreed to

limit its domestic agricultural subsidies to 8.5 percent of the value of agricultural output and its

subsidies of any particular crop to no more than 8.5 percent of the value of that crop. The limit

for developing countries under the Agricultural Agreement is 10 percent. China is forced to

include investment subsidies and subsidies for inputs such as fertilizer in calculating total

agricultural subsidies, unlike most developing countries. China also agreed to eliminate export

subsidies for agricultural products upon accession, something that neither the United States nor

36
    However, as already noted, there was a substantial amount of smuggling of these “banned” products
into China via Hong Kong. The growth in legal exports to China is likely to be partially offset by the
decline in exports to Hong Kong.


                                                                                                         27
the EU has agreed to do. This was significant given that China employed export subsidies of

about $500 million per year in the base period used for negotiation in the Uruguay Round.

A Double Standard for China?

        Finally, China accepted an accession protocol that would allow Chinese trading partners

to impose restrictions on Chinese exports under conditions that are substantially weaker than

those WTO members must ordinarily meet before imposing import restrictions. Restrictions can

be imposed solely on Chinese exports, even when exports of the same product from other

countries have increased, and they can be maintained without an effective time limit, whereas the

WTO Agreement on Safeguards imposes an 8-year time limit. Furthermore, China has accepted

limitations on its ability to retaliate that are more stringent than the limitations contained in the

Safeguards Agreement. In addition to this transitional arrangement, China has agreed to a special

textile safeguard that would allow its trading partners to limit the growth of textile and apparel

products to 7.5 percent per year after the phase-out of the WTO Agreement on Textiles and

Clothing, the successor agreement to the Multifiber Arrangement negotiated under GATT. The

textile provision will remain in place until 2008.

        China has also agreed to accept discriminatory terms in its protocol of accession in

antidumping. Under U.S. trade law, China has for many years been treated as a nonmarket

economy in antidumping cases. That means that the U.S. Department of Commerce does not

compare prices of goods sold in the U.S. market to prices prevailing in China or in third countries,

because key inputs may be supplied to Chinese firms at below-market prices. Instead the

Department of Commerce calculates “normal value” by soliciting information from Chinese firms

on input quantities, using input prices of a third country where input prices are believed to be

market determined, then adding to these direct production cost calculations estimates of

“reasonable amounts” for administration, sales, other costs, and a profit margin. Alternatively,

the Department of Commerce can simply use as a standard for “normal value” the cost of

production in a third country. This creates a double standard that could easily be abused by


                                                                                                        28
domestic producers in competition with Chinese exporters. Nevertheless, the Chinese

government has allowed the U.S. and other trading partners to use the “nonmarket economy”

methodology in antidumping investigations for up to fifteen years after accession.37

WTO Accession: A Watershed, not a Sea Change

         While negotiations over China’s WTO entry were ongoing in the late 1990s, a number of

studies were conducted estimating the impact of WTO accession on Chinese trade, employment,

and growth. Some predicted that China would incur significant restructuring costs in meeting its

WTO commitments.38 Other studies forecast fairly dramatic increases in imports as import tariffs

were reduced. There was a tendency for these studies to overestimate the impact of WTO,

because many were based on conditions that existed in the mid-1990s, and did not take into

account the dramatic acceleration of reform in the years immediately preceding China’s WTO

entry.

         As we have already stressed, China cut tariffs, broadened trading rights, and liberalized

its FDI regime even prior to formal WTO accession. The Chinese government also launched a

major effort to restructure state-owned manufacturing industries, engineering a dramatic decline

in SOE manufacturing employment and an improvement in profitability. Steps were also taken to

eliminate or reduce import price differentials prior to WTO accession. The government

substantially cut the prices for wheat and corn in 1999, two years before WTO accession, driving

prices toward international levels, and starting the process of moving farmers out of grain and

into less land intensive crops.39 Steps were also taken to hasten the convergence of prices to

(1998).

world levels for petroleum products, transportation services, wholesale electricity prices, and

water and natural gas.40 Because the structural change and price convergence the WTO-

mandated liberalizations would generate were already underway prior to formal accession, the

impact of WTO per se, has arguably been smaller than some might have predicted.

        That being said, the combination of China’s pre-WTO and post-WTO reforms is making

it arguably the most open large developing economy. By 2005, China’s average statutory tariff

on industrial products will be 8.9 percent. For Argentina, Brazil, India, and Indonesia, the

respective percent figures are 30.9, 27.0, 32.4, and 36.9.41 China has agreed to bind all tariffs as

the new statutory rates are phased in, meaning that it has committed to not raise any existing

tariffs on industrial products above existing levels as some are reduced. India, in contrast, has

only bound two-thirds of its tariffs.42 China’s FDI regime is one of the most open and welcoming

of any country in the world, and China has made liberalization commitments in all of the service

industries covered by the WTO General Agreement on Trade in Services. Only a handful of

members come close to meeting this standard. Former U.S. Trade Representative Charlene

Barshefsky described China’s commitment to liberalize its distribution system as “broader

actually than any World Trade Organization member has made.”43 China also has made

relatively strong commitments to liberalize financial and telecommunications services.

        This high degree of openness is evidenced by the sharp increase in Chinese imports in

recent years, which, in turn, has had an increasingly powerful impact on the East Asian regional

economy and, indeed, on the global economy. However, important macroeconomic imbalances,

clearly not sustainable in the long run, are also playing an important role in driving this growth.

These issues are addressed in the next sections.

V.      China’s Liberalization in the Services Sector

        China made pathbreaking commitments in its accession to the WTO to open up its

service sector to foreign investment and competition. The promised openings were especially

significant in distribution, telecommunications, and financial services but commitments were also

made in professional, audiovisual, and construction services (Lardy 2002, 66-75).

        Prior to China’s entry into the WTO the Chinese government severely restricted the

ability of foreign firms to distribute goods in China. They could import inputs, equipment, and

other materials directly related to their manufacturing or processing operations. But to import

products made outside of China they had to use an agent and generally these goods could not be

sold in the same distribution channels these firms used to sell goods they made in China. Thus,

for example, it was cumbersome for companies like General Motors or Volkswagen to import and

distribute vehicles made outside of China.

        Complying with the terms of its entry, China by the end of 2004 had phased out all

geographic, ownership, and most other types of restrictions on wholesaling and retailing, as well

as related distribution services such as franchising, commission agents, and repair and

maintenance services.44 As a result, China is “in full compliance with its WTO commitments on

trading rights for all Chinese-foreign joint ventures, wholly foreign-owned enterprises and foreign

individuals (United States Trade Representative 2005, 75).

        China agreed to substantially open its market in banking, insurance, securities, fund

management, and other financial services. In banking many restrictions, such as the number of

cities in which foreign banks can operate, were lifted from the beginning of 2005. However, not

until five years after accession, at the end of 2006, will Chinese regulators have to offer full

44
  According to China’s distribution commitments, certain product restrictions will not be lifted until the
beginning of 2007 and China has denied in perpetuity the right of foreign firms to engage in the wholesale
distribution of salt and tobacco or the retail distribution of tobacco products.


                                                                                                        31
national treatment to foreign banks, meaning that any remaining restrictions that apply only to

foreign banks must be eliminated. Most importantly, at that time foreign banks will be able to

offer domestic currency services to Chinese citizens for the first time.

         Liberalization has resulted in a significant increase in foreign bank presence in China.

Even prior to China’s accession to the WTO foreign banks operated more than 150 branch banks

in more than 23 cities. They accounted, however, for only 1.5 percent of all bank assets in 2000

(Lardy 2002, 115-116). From the time China became a member of the WTO to the end of 2004

China authorized an additional 31 foreign branch banks to open for business.45 However, the

assets of foreign banks as a share of all financial institutions had increased to only 1.8 percent by

year-end 2004.46 The slow pace of penetration of the market reflects the remaining limitations on

the scope of business these banks can conduct and regulatory requirements that increase the cost

of providing banking services (United States Trade Representative 2005, 103).

         If foreign banks have made only slow progress in building their businesses through

opening branches, they have moved much more rapidly to invest in China’s domestic banking

institutions. This too got underway prior to China’s accession to the WTO but has accelerated

since. The Asian Development Bank and the International Finance Corporation (the investment

banking arm of the World Bank) paved the way for foreign ownership of Chinese banks by

investments that they made as early as 1996 (Lardy 1998, 67, 167). By 2005 about a dozen

foreign banks had taken stakes in various city commercial banks and national shareholding banks.

This process was facilitated by China’s unilateral decision in late 2003 to increase the limit on the

stake that could be held by a single foreign financial institution in a Chinese bank from 15 percent

to 20 percent (Chinese Bank Regulatory Commission 2003). Even more important, as part of the

restructuring and public listing of some of the large state-owned commercial banks, the state sold

off strategic stakes to foreign investors in the Construction Bank of China and the Bank of

China.47

         As in the case of banking, China by the beginning of 2005 had swept away geographic

restrictions on where foreign insurance companies can do business. In line with its prior

commitments, the government also has largely lifted restrictions on the types of products that

foreign insurers can provide, allowing these firms to offer property and casualty insurance, health

insurance, as well as group policies, pensions and annuities. However, foreign firms are

restricted to operating in joint ventures with Chinese partners with the foreign share limited to 51

percent in a nonlife insurance business and 50 percent in life insurance.48 Measured by premium

income China’s overall insurance market is growing rapidly, but the share of the industry

controlled by foreign firms remains relatively small at 2 to 3 percent (United States Trade

Representative 2005, 76).

         China’s liberalization of its securities and fund management sector is somewhat more

restricted than the opening in banking and insurance, since foreign ownership restrictions are

somewhat more severe.49 Moreover, joint venture securities firms are not allowed to trade in A

shares, the largest source of income in the Chinese securities industries. Nonetheless a number of

joint venture securities and fund management firms have been launched. In the fund management

business well known western firms such as UBS, JP Morgan, Credit Suisse First Boston,

Prudential Financial and Schroder Investment Management have all established joint ventures.

         In telecommunications China agreed to ease foreign investment restrictions and, more

importantly, agreed to embrace procompetitive principles such as transparent licensing, cost-

   Investors in the Construction Bank were Bank of America and Temasek, a Singaporean government
investment vehicle. UBS and Royal Bank of Scotland took strategic stakes in the Bank of China. It
seemed in mid-2005 that the process of selling stakes to foreign investors in the Industrial and Commercial
Bank of China, far and away China’s largest bank, were also well advanced though no specific transactions
had been formally confirmed.
48
   The sole exception is AIG. It received its first license to sell insurance as a wholly foreign-owned
company in 1992 and still wholly owns all of its life insurance operations.
49
   Foreign firms are limited to a maximum one-third ownership stake in joint venture securities businesses.
In fund management the foreign share was initially restricted to one-third but this was raised to 49 percent
beginning three years after accession in December 2004.


                                                                                                         33
based pricing, and the right of interconnection. While China did formally separate the regulatory

and operating functions of the Ministry of Information Industry, the successor to the old Ministry

of Posts and Telecommunications, and promulgated Regulations on Foreign-Invested

Telecommunications Enterprises, which provides the promised regulatory environment for

foreign investment in the sector, to date there has been practically no foreign participation in the

telecommunications market (United States Trade Representative 2005, 110-112).

        A number of East Asia’s earlier success stories, such as Japan and South Korea, have

been characterized as possessing a dual economy (McKinsey & Co, 1994; IMF, 2005). On the

one hand, there are export-oriented manufacturing sectors that have been forced to contend with

the best competitors in the world for decades. These sectors tend to have productivity levels that

compare favorably with those of the U.S. On the other hand, the domestically oriented service

sectors, in which competition has been muted by government regulations and restrictions on entry,

are much less competitive. The low productivity of these sectors drags down living standards for

the economy as a whole. China’s early opening to FDI in its service sector holds out the

possibility that its own service industries will be characterized by a considerably higher level of

competition and productivity than was true of Japan or Korea at a similar stage of development.

Early inroads by efficient foreign firms could ensure that only efficient domestic firms are able to

expand as the market develops. This will prevent the emergence of a dual economy or, at least,

will constrain the degree to which it constitutes a drag on living standards going forward.

        While we certainly believe the early opening of the service sector will be to China’s

benefit, the implementation of this opening is an ongoing process, there are important limits to

what China has promised in its WTO accession agreement, and the long-run effects are difficult

to predict. Large swathes of the service economy (education, health care, power generation) will

remain largely closed to participation by foreign for-profit enterprises, much as they are in many

Western countries. Even in the opened sectors, in the short-to-medium run, Western service

providers may find it challenging to translate their business models to a Chinese context in which


                                                                                                   34
the income level of the population, the economic geography of consumer purchasing power, and

the tastes of consumers are likely to be radically different from those found in the providers’

home markets. This will be particularly true in financial services, where important features of the

regulatory regime, including the closure of the capital account, will starkly limit the potential

profitability of foreign firms for the foreseeable future.

        Openness to FDI in services in Japan – which has existed in many service sectors for

some time – has not yet eliminated the dual economy. Although Japanese income levels are close

to American ones, many American firms have struggled to adapt to the different tastes of

Japanese consumers, constituting less of a threat to Japanese incumbents than one might have

hoped. Barriers to exit for uncompetitive enterprises have also been a factor inhibiting

productivity growth in the low-productivity sectors. Some of the barriers – such as government

credit subsidies to less efficient firms – are hardly unknown in China. Convergence of the

productivity of the Chinese services sector to American levels is likely to take many years.

VI.     The Structure of China’s Exports

        Does China’s rapidly growing trade conform roughly to its comparative advantage or

have supporting industrial and other government policies allowed firms to move up the

technology ladder much more rapidly than would occur for a market economy with factor

endowments similar to China? This question has been posed by both academic economists such

as Schott (2006) and Lall and Albaladejo (2004) and by trade and industry associations based in

Washington. Schott, for example, finds that over time Chinese exports exhibit rising

sophistication relative to countries with similar aggregate endowments and that it exports more

products in common with the capital and skill abundant members of the OECD than its peers.50

Preeg (2004, 9), a researcher with the Manufacturers Alliance, charges that China’s emergence as

a major supplier of information technology, communication, and electronic products is a


50
    However, Schott qualifies this finding by documenting a decline in the prices of Chinese exports
relative to OECD exports of similar products.


                                                                                                       35
consequence of policies described as “high tech mercantilism,” that poses a major challenge to

U.S. commercial and security interests. Similarly the American Electronics Association (2003)

has analyzed China’s growing exports of high tech products and pointed to the threat they

represent to US industry.

        There is no doubt that the structure of China’s exports has changed dramatically over the

past two decades. A decade and a half ago China’s leading exports were crude oil, refined

petroleum products and apparel. In a seemingly complete transformation China has emerged in

recent years as a major producer and exporter of electronic and information technology products,

such as consumer electronics, office equipment and computers, and communications equipment.

Globally it is now the second largest producer of these items, after only the United States. Its

global exports of these products soared from only $39 billion in 1999 to $142 billion in 2003.51

The U.S. is a major purchaser of such goods, with imports from China more than doubling from

$25 billion in 1999 to $59 billion in 2003. In 2000 China ranked behind Japan, Mexico, and the

EU as a supplier of high-tech goods to the United States, but by 2002 it had displaced all three to

become the single largest supplier (American Electronics Association 2003). Does this imply that

traditional notions of comparative advantage are useless in thinking about the evolution of

China’s trade structure?

        We strongly disagree, and this point merits a small digression. The “infant industry

argument,” the classic case for temporary protection of domestic industry in the hopes of

fostering economic development, dates back at least to Alexander Hamilton (1791), and was

endorsed, if cautiously, by some of the great nineteenth-century economists, notably including

John Stuart Mill (1848). The international economics literature of the 1980s produced rigorous

mathematical models in which temporary protection could, in principle, allow domestic firms to

acquire technological capabilities that would have been impossible for them to acquire without

government intervention, raising national welfare in the process.52 Recent work by Brandt,

Rawski, and Sutton (2005), with its strong implicit endorsement of China’s protectionist policies

in the automobile industry, appeals strongly to these ideas, if not to the formal models themselves.

        Yet, it is important to point out that the theorists who launched this intellectual revolution

within the discipline of international trade were not refuting the principle of comparative

advantage. Instead, they were extending it, by allowing the technical capabilities of domestic

firms – an attribute which could evolve over time – to influence comparative advantage. While

demonstrating the possibility that government intervention could lead to gains over time, they

remained remarkably unanimous in their skepticism that these gains were very large or that

government intervention in practice could actually achieve the gains suggested by theory, and

they remained sensitive to the potential costs of these interventions. The notion that the principle

of comparative advantage has been rendered obsolete by “dynamic” theories of international trade

has been flatly contradicted by the authors of these theories themselves (Krugman 1994, 245-280).

        In any case, the critique that Chinese industrial and other policies have allowed China’s

firms to leapfrog ahead and bend or even suspend the law of comparative advantage falls short on

three levels. First, most of the electronic and information technology products, which the

Manufacturers Alliance and the American Electronics Association classify as high technology or

advanced technology, should not be considered high-tech. The single biggest US import product

from China in the consumer electronics, office equipment and computers, and communications

equipment categories, respectively, is DVD players, notebook computers, and mobile telephones.

Each of these is a high volume, commodity product sold primarily by mass merchandisers of

electronic products. For example, in 2003 the United States imported more than 31 million DVD

players from China with an average unit cost of under $80, more than 7.5 million notebook

computers with an average unit cost of $550, and more than 20 million mobile telephones with an

average unit cost of less than $100.53 The huge volumes and low unit costs of these products

undermine the argument that these are high-tech products.

        Second, China is able to export huge quantities of electronic and information technology

products only because it imports most of the high value-added parts and components that go into

these goods. China, in short, does not in any real sense manufacture these goods. Rather it

assembles them from imported parts and components. For example, domestic value-added

accounts for only 15 percent of the value of exported electronic and information technology

products. All the rest is import content. In short, for many of these products it is doubtful that

China is supplying anything but the labor required to produce these goods. China’s provision of

relatively low-wage “assembly services” is completely consistent with its underlying comparative

advantage. Schott’s analysis of the growing relative sophistication of China’s export bundle

does not account for the importance of imported parts and components for a growing share of

China’s exports. On the other hand, Lall and Albaladejo’s analysis of China’s competitive threat

to East Asian manufactured exports does take into account China’s growing import of inputs for

export activities. This leads them to the view that even though China is the biggest gainer of

market share of exports of high tech products in the decade to 2000 that there is

“complementarity rather than competition between China and its neighbors” in the export of high

tech products.

        China’s dependence on imported parts and components is reflected in Figure 7, showing

both China’s exports and imports of electronic and information technology products. While

China exported $142 billion in electronic and information technology products in 2003, China’s

imports of these products, overwhelmingly parts and components rather than finished goods, were

over $127 billion. In short, China’s net exports of electronic and information industry products in

2003 were a relatively small $15 billion.

          Imported semiconductors and microprocessors constitute an unusually large share of the

imported parts and components that firms in China use in the assembly of electronic and

information industry products. Semiconductors and microprocessors are, of course, among the

most sophisticated components of electronic and information technology products. China’s

imports of microprocessors and semiconductors quadrupled from $12 billion in 1999 to over $47

billion in 2003. The entire global market for semiconductors in 2003 was $166 billion, meaning

that demand from China alone accounted for more than one-quarter of global output. The degree

to which China is an assembler of imported parts and components, rather than a true manufacturer

of consumer electronic and information technology products, is reflected in the modest volume of

China's domestic production of semiconductors and microprocessors compared to the value of its

imports of these products. Although domestic semiconductor production is growing rapidly, it is

from an extremely small base. In 2003 domestic production was only $4.6 billion, less than one-

tenth of the value of imports.54 Investment in domestic production of semiconductors has

increased significantly in recent years, which will provide the capacity for a further rapid rise in

domestic production. However, given the continued expansion of capacity in China for

manufacturing consumer electronics and information technology products, China is likely to

remain far and away the world's largest importer of semiconductors and microprocessors for

years to come.

          Third, most exports of electronic and information products are assembled not by Chinese-

owned firms but by foreign firms that are using China as an export platform. Taiwanese firms

that have relocated to the mainland dominate the production of electronic and information

technology products that are exported from China. The importance foreign firms play in China's

emergence, for example, as the largest supplier of computers to the US market, is confirmed by

both aggregate data and by the ranking of the top-200 export companies compiled by the Chinese

Ministry of Commerce. In 2003, for example, foreign firms accounted for 92 percent of China's

$41 billion in exports of computers, components, and peripherals and 74 percent of China's $89

billion in exports of electronics and telecommunications equipment (Gilboy 2004, 39).

        The dominance of foreign firms in these sectors is confirmed by firm level data on

China’s largest exporters. In 2003 Hong Fu Jin Precision Industry, a wholly-owned subsidiary of

Taiwan's Hon Hai Precision Industry Company (better known by its trade name Foxconn), with

exports of $6.4 billion, was China's number one ranked export company for the third successive

year. Hon Hai Precision Industry is Taiwan's largest contract electronics manufacturer, churning

out videogame consoles, mobile phones, and other electronics products for Sony, Apple, Nokia,

and many other brands. Coming in second was Tech Front (Shanghai) a subsidiary of Taiwan's

Quanta Computer Inc., the world's largest producer of notebook computers. Quanta is the single

largest supplier for Dell Computer Company. Tech Front's exports in 2003 were $5.2 billion.

Rounding off the top three exporting firms in China, with exports of $3.1 billion, was

Magnificent Brightness, owned by Taiwan's Asutek Computer, another global heavyweight in the

production of notebook computers. In all there are 28 Taiwan-owned firms on the list of China’s

200 largest exporting firms in 2003. All are electronics manufacturers.55

        In short, the rapidly changing commodity composition of China's exports does not appear

to constitute evidence that Chinese firms are leapfrogging ahead technologically, because these

exports are not primarily driven by the expanding “knowledge stock” or innovative capabilities of

domestic firms. Indeed there may be a growing technology gap between foreign firms operating

in China and domestic Chinese companies. In part this is because foreign firms in the electronics

and information technology space in China are almost entirely wholly foreign-owned companies

rather than joint ventures. Wholly foreign-owned firms have strong incentives to protect their

technology from competitors, both domestic and foreign, thus limiting the diffusion of technology

to indigenous firms. Furthermore, there is evidence suggesting that many indigenous Chinese

firms spend little on research and development to develop new technologies on their own (Gilboy

2004, 40). We do not discount the possibility that individual indigenous Chinese firms will, in

short order, emerge as important players in technology-intensive industries through the

development of proprietary technologies. However, the aggregate transition of the Chinese

economy as a whole from net importer of technology-intensive goods to net exporter is likely to

take many decades.

VII.      China’s Exchange Rate Regime: The Need for Further Change

          Dooley, Folkerts-Landau, and Garber (2003) have argued that China is similar to other

Asian countries that have long managed their exchange rates by intervening in foreign exchange

markets to limit appreciation of their currencies in order sustain growth-oriented trade surpluses.

Is China's currency undervalued? If so what is the appropriate Chinese response? What

difference would this response make to China’s global trade and its bilateral trade with the United

States?

          First, while China's currency is now almost certainly undervalued, it is worth underlining

that in contrast with Japan and several other countries in the region, this is a relatively recent

phenomenon. Moreover, to a considerable extent the recent very large build up of foreign

exchange reserves in China reflects short-term speculative capital inflows rather than a

fundamental disequilibrium.

          What is the evidence for the judgment that the currency is undervalued in recent years?

Between 1994, when China pegged its currency to the dollar, through 2001 China's current

account surplus averaged only 1.8 percent of its GDP. But this number rose to an average of 3.1

percent in 2002-03 and then 4.2 percent in 2004. And unlike its Southeast Asian neighbors, in the

five years since the Asian financial crisis (1999-2003) China also had a capital account surplus.

This surplus averaged 1.3 percent of GDP in 1999-2001. But it rose to an average of 3.2 percent

in 2002-03 and then 6.7 percent in 2004 (National Bureau of Statistics 2003, 17, 88; National

Bureau of Statistics 2004a, 17, 86; National Bureau of Statistics 2005, 18, 89). It must be noted


                                                                                                     41
that while China’s nominal exchange rate vis a vis the U.S. dollar was unchanged, from the

beginning of 2002 onward the trade weighted value of the renminbi depreciated significantly as

China’s current and capital account surpluses grew. 56

           Although China nominally maintains a relatively closed capital account, prior to 2001

unrecorded capital outflows largely offset these current and capital account surpluses. As a

result, China's build up of foreign exchange reserves was modest by Asian standards. But in

2001 these outflows shrank significantly and in 2002-2004 unrecorded capital inflows soared.57

To continue to keep the currency pegged at 8.28 yuan to the dollar, in the face of significant

surpluses on both the current and capital accounts as well as unrecorded capital inflows, China's

authorities since 2001 have had to purchase massive amounts of foreign exchange and reserves

have risen accordingly. For example in 2004 alone reserves increased by $206.3 billion an

amount equivalent to 12.5 percent of gross domestic product (National Bureau of Statistics 2005,

18, 89).

           The Chinese authorities, through their own actions, have implicitly admitted that the yuan

is undervalued. Until July 21, 2005 they chose to try to reduce the pressure on the currency

through a series of ad hoc measures, rather than making any change to their exchange rate.

Beginning January 1, 2004, for example, the government reduced by an average of 3 percentage

points the rate at which it rebates the value-added tax on products that are exported (United States

Trade Representative 2004, 63). That tends to make Chinese exports more expensive in

international markets. But, unlike a currency revaluation, lowering the rebate rate on the value-

added tax on exports does not lower the price of imports in the domestic market. The authorities

also have signaled an easing in the approval process for outward-bound foreign direct investment;


56
   This was the inevitable consequence of the depreciation of the dollar on a trade weighted basis over the
same period, largely as a result of the appreciation of floating currencies such as the Euro, the pound, and
the Canadian and Australian dollars.
57
   Unrecorded capital outflows average $15.1 billion in the three years 1998-2000. In 2001 outflows
dropped to $5.9 billion. In 2002 through 2004 unrecorded inflows were $7.8 billion, $18.4 billion, and
$27.0 billion, respectively (National Bureau of Statistics 2003, 88; National Bureau of Statistics 2005, 89).


                                                                                                           42
liberalized the regulations governing outbound Chinese tourism; and allowed one domestic

financial institution to issue dollar-denominated debt. In March and August 2004 the relevant

regulators announced that the national social security fund and domestic insurance companies

could invest in offshore markets. They are contemplating approving a qualified domestic

institutional investor (QDII) program that would allow individual Chinese investors to invest in

securities traded on foreign markets. Each of these measures tends to increase the demand for or

reduce the supply of foreign exchange, thus lessening the build-up in official foreign exchange

reserves.

        The United States policy of encouraging China to liberalize its capital account and adopt

a floating exchange rate system, first articulated by Treasury Secretary Snow in the fall of 2003,

is certainly appropriate as a long-term objective. The Chinese authorities over the years have

repeatedly expressed the goal of moving toward a convertible currency and a much more flexible

exchange rate regime. There is no debate on the long-term desirability of such a policy. A

flexible exchange rate regime would not only help to equilibrate China's international accounts

but would also give the authorities considerably more ability to use monetary policy to moderate

the cyclical character of domestic demand.

        In the short and medium run, however, a convertible currency with a floating exchange

rate is a risky option for China. Chinese households hold more than 12 trillion yuan (an amount

roughly equal to China's GDP) in domestic savings deposits. Very few Chinese savers have had

an opportunity to diversify the currency composition of their financial savings. Eliminating

capital controls could lead to a substantial move into foreign-currency denominated financial

assets, most likely held outside of Chinese banks. Given the well-known weaknesses of China's

banks, such a move could precipitate a domestic banking crisis. As a result, the authorities do not

anticipate relaxing capital controls on household savings until they have fully addressed the

solvency problems of the major state-owned banks. This process is well underway but is likely to

take a minimum of 3 to 5 years to complete.


                                                                                                  43
        If the renminbi continued to be undervalued for 3 to 5 years there would be substantial

adverse effects on China's trading partners and China's central bank would continue to be very

constrained in using interest rates as a macroeconomic policy tool. These competing risks

suggest that the best approach might be to revalue the currency in the short term and only much

later, after completing the transformation of the domestic banking system, move to eliminate

capital controls and, at the same time, float the currency. How large an initial revaluation of the

currency is called for? The tentative judgment of Goldstein and Lardy in 2003 was that the

renminbi was undervalued by an amount in the range of 15 to 25 percent. They estimated that a

revaluation in this range in 2003 would have led to an overall equilibrium in China’s balance of

payments, thus ending the build up of foreign exchange reserves. Goldstein and Lardy also

argued that at the same time the authorities revalue the currency they should take two additional

steps. First, they should significantly widen the band within which they permit market forces to

determine the value of the currency. Second, at the new parity the authorities should peg the

Chinese currency to a basket of currencies rather than solely to the US dollar (Goldstein and

Lardy 2003a; Goldstein and Lardy 2003b).

        The authorities went part way to meeting these objectives in July 2005 when they

announced a new managed floating exchange rate system that entailed an initial 2.1 percent

revaluation of the currency to a new parity of 8.11 to the US dollar; allowing the currency to trade

on the foreign exchange market vis a vis the US dollar in a range of plus or minus 0.3 percent on

an intraday basis; and a policy of setting the opening price in the market each day at the price

prevailing at the previous day’s close; and that the currency would not be pegged rigidly to the

dollar, but rather with reference to a basket of currencies (People’s Bank of China 2005).

        The significance of this announced reform will become clear only over time. The US

Treasury immediately advanced the view that the new system of managed floating would allow

the currency to move by the maximum of 0.3 percent per trading day or up to 6 percent per




                                                                                                   44
month.58 This interpretation seems dubious, however, for two reasons. First, the Chinese

authorities have described their exchange rate regime as a managed float since January 1994, so

this was not really new. Second, the plus minus 0.3 percent intraday trading range and the

provision to open each day’s trading at the prior day’s closing price has also been a feature of the

system since 1994.59 However, from the middle of 1995 through July 2005 the nominal exchange

rate barely moved. Since July 2005, there has been some additional appreciation, but it has been

quite modest and gradual.

        It will take time to make a judgment of the significance of the July 2005 announcement.

Perhaps it will usher in an era in which the value of the Renminbi is largely determined by supply

and demand in the market, as some of the language of the announcement by the People’s Bank

seemed to imply. That would lead to further appreciation of the currency and over time could

lead to greater flexibility in the currency as well, for example, if the band around the parity was

widened. Both would be highly desirable not only because they would contribute to the reduction

of global economic imbalances but also because they would allow the authorities greater

flexibility in the use of interest rate policy as a tool of macroeconomic management.

VIII.   China’s Impact on the World

        Surging import demand generated by the booming Chinese economy in 2003 and 2004

helped power an economic expansion throughout East and Southeast Asia.60 With China’s

imports from emerging East Asia rising much faster than its exports to the region, its trade deficit

with the rest of East Asia ballooned from $34 billion in 2001 to $47 billion in 2002 to $70 billion

in 2003. Growth in exports to China and Hong Kong accounted for 50 percent of overall export

growth in Korea and 66 percent of overall export growth in Taiwan. China was even credited

with helping revive the long-moribund Japanese economy. In 2003, Japanese exports to China

grew over 33 percent in 2003, accounting for nearly 44 percent of total export growth, and

helping to generate the highest real GDP growth since the mid-1990s.61

         While other countries in the region have eyed the rise of China as a trading power

somewhat warily, fearing that China’s export success and ability to attract FDI might be coming

at their expense, China was widely seen in 2003 as an increasingly important locomotive of

growth in the region. By the fall of 2004, the locus of concern had shifted from fear of an

increasingly dynamic Chinese competitor to fear that the Chinese import boom would grind to a

halt as government efforts to slow runaway economic growth unintentionally engendered a “hard

landing.” The tone of popular commentary in the Asian business press had shifted markedly from

a depiction of China as a “threat” to praise of a booming Chinese economy as an engine of

growth for all of Asia.

         On the other hand, in 2004, an election year, China’s growing trade surplus with the

United States and mounting fears over jobs lost continued to generate political pressure for

protection. The Bush Administration had already launched an antidumping investigation against

Chinese color TV exporters and levied quotas on textile in late 2003. In late 2004 the U.S.

government faced pressure from a coalition of industrial and textile groups seeking to force China

to change its exchange rate policy.62 The bilateral trade deficit with China had displaced the

deficit with Japan as America’s largest in 2000, and it continued to increase rapidly in absolute

value.

         However, China’s expanding trade surplus with the U.S. largely reflects a reallocation of

assembly activity from other East Asian countries to China. Much of this assembly is actually

undertaken by foreign-invested enterprises from the aforementioned economies, which continue

to source components from their home base. As a consequence, China’s expanding surplus with

the United States, and to a lesser extent, Europe, mirrors its large deficit with the rest of East Asia.

China’s emerging industrial structure is thus largely complementary with that of the more

advanced East Asian countries, and China’s continued export expansion represents, for the most

part, an opportunity rather than a threat. The implications of China’s advance for the less

developed ASEAN countries are less unambiguously positive in the short to medium run, a point

we shall also discuss.

        Figure 8, which shows US exports to and imports from China, illustrates the expansion of

the U.S. bilateral trade deficit with China. Beginning in 1990, exports of U.S. businesses to

China grew more rapidly than to any other large export market. 63 By 2003 U.S. exports to China

had increased five fold to almost $30 billion and China had become the 6th largest foreign market

for U.S. goods (Lardy 2004, 27).64 However, imports grew even more rapidly so the bilateral

trade deficit has continued to widen in absolute terms. By 2003 the ratio between imports and

exports was 5.4 to 1 meaning that U.S. exports to China have to grow by more than five times the

growth of imports to keep the trade imbalance from worsening further. Thus it is quite likely that

the bilateral US trade deficit with China will continue expand. Given the rapid growth in this

imbalance, it is easy to see how trade with China has become a lightning rod for protectionist

interests within the United States.

        The relative asymmetry of China’s trade flows with the U.S. is cast into even sharper

relief by a comparison with the evolution of the Chinese trade balance with the EU and Japan,

two other major export destinations, as in Figure 9. While the bilateral surplus with the EU has

expanded in recent years, trade with both economies is substantially more balanced than that of

the United States. The U.S. almost single-handedly accounts for China’s modest but robust

current account surplus. If one examines China’s trade with the rest of the world except the U.S.,

that is a large and growing deficit, as shown in Figure 10.

        To a great extent, American imports of manufactured goods, especially labor-intensive

products, from China have displaced American imports of manufactured goods from other

locations in Asia, notably Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea. As a result the combined

shares of the U.S. global trade deficit accounted for by the China, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan,

and South Korea fell from 52.3 percent in 1985 to only 39.4 percent in 2003 (Lardy 2005, 129).

The causes of this transformation are rising wages in non-China Asia and China’s liberalization

of its foreign investment environment. In the 1980s and 1990s, as wages in these countries rose

and China liberalized its foreign direct investment environment, Asian entrepreneurs moved a

growing share of their labor-intensive production to China. Figure 4 illustrates the continuing

importance of Asian firms in FDI in China. By 2003, China’s Asian trading partners collectively

accounted for about 70 percent of the cumulative foreign direct investment in China. As one can

see in the figure, Hong Kong and Taiwan firms have played a conspicuously large role. Unlike

U.S. or European firms that tend to invest in China in order to serve the local market, Asian firms

tend to use China as an export platform.

        They have been quite successful at this. At the end of the 1990s, the two most important

categories of goods the U.S. imported from China were baby carriages, toys, games and sporting

goods and footwear. The rapid growth of U.S. imports in these categories largely reflects the

displacement of alternative sources of supply in Asia. Figure 11 illustrates this truth for footwear.

From 1986 through 1988 almost 60 percent of U.S. footwear imports were from Taiwan and

South Korea; China was the source of only 2 percent of U.S. footwear imports. By 1999, the

relative importance of the two sources of supply had reversed completely. Figure 12 shows a

similar pattern for toys and sporting goods. The degree to which increases in imports from China

directly displaced imports from Hong Kong, South Korea, and Taiwan is quite striking.


                                                                                                  48
        To say that this production transfer has come at the “expense” of firms or workers in

Hong Kong or Taiwan is somewhat misleading. By and large, this transfer of production has not

created large losses, either for the investing economies or their firms.65 The relationship between

these economies and China has been, to a great extent, a complementary one. However, there is

also a set of goods in which these countries, as well as Japan and the United States, compete with

China. The technological ambitions of the Chinese government, and the desire to expand in

sectors such as contract semiconductor manufacturing, suggest that this margin of competition

may grow over time.

        As we have already indicated, a similar process of “export displacement” is now at work

with DVD players, computer peripherals, and laptop computers. In 2002, China became the

largest single source of U.S. imports of consumer electronics products and information

technology hardware (Lardy 2004). However, as we have already stressed, much of this export

growth is being spearheaded by foreign, particularly Taiwanese, companies. While these final

goods contain high-tech components, Chinese factories specialize in providing relatively low-

skill assembly services, importing the more sophisticated components from Taiwan, South Korea

or, significantly, Japan. In 2002, China ran a massive trade deficit of $25 billion in its trade with

Taiwan. Two-thirds of these imports are parts and components, subsequently assembled into

final goods in factories owned by Taiwanese firms and investors (Lardy 2004). In 2003, as China

ramped up its exports of IT products, imports of electronic components from Japan surged by 60

percent.66

        Recent economic analysis based on trade data and the use of simulation models also

suggests a complementarity between Chinese growth and the more developed Asian economies.


65
    In 1981, Hong Kong’s manufacturing sector employed more than 900,000 workers in Hong Kong. By
2000, Hong Kong-invested companies employed 5 million workers in China, many in Guangdong province.
In that year, Taiwanese firms employed an estimated 3 million workers on the mainland. See Lardy (2002,
56-57) for a discussion and Naughton (1998) for a discussion of these issues with particular emphasis on
electronics.

Much of the recent analysis has been undertaken in the context of forecasting the impact of

China’s WTO accession. Ianchovichina and Walmsley (2001) calibrate and simulate a multi-

country, multi-sector model of international trade, finding that China’s WTO access, while

improving that country’s imports, reduces the exports of Vietnam, the Philippines, Thailand,

Indonesia, and Malaysia. On the other hand, Japan and the NIES benefit, mainly due to increased

exports to China. Yang and Vines (2000), in the context of a different simulation model, also

find that Chinese export growth causes ASEAN exports to drop while those of Japan and the

NIES rise.67

         Eichengreen, Rhee, and Tong (2004) undertake a regression study using disaggregated

trade data over the 1990-2002 period. They attempt to account for the endogeneity of Chinese

exports while allowing for differential effects on different commodity types. They find evidence

of a crowding out of exports from Asian countries due to Chinese export growth, but this is

largely limited to consumer goods. In contrast, Chinese growth has a strong positive impact on

Asian exports of capital goods and equipment to China. On net, the advanced Asian economies

benefit from Chinese growth, while the ASEAN countries lose.68 This finding is consistent with

earlier work suggesting China’s comparative advantage is similar to that of its ASEAN

neighbors.69 While GDP growth eventually revived in most of Southeast Asia after the financial

crises of 1997-1998, the robust inward FDI flows of the pre-crisis years did not – although real




67
    An IMF study (2004) uses a computable general equilibrium model to capture the geographical and
sectoral structure of trade flows. This analysis finds that Chinese export growth generates small negative
effects on the exports and output of all regions, but the impact is stronger on the ASEAN countries than the
more developed Asian economies.
68
   This finding contrasts with the earlier work of Ahearne, Fernald, Loungani, and Schindler (2003). Using
aggregate trade data, these authors found little evidence of a statistically significant relationship between
Chinese exports and the exports of its Asian neighbors, although the estimated coefficients tended to be
positive.
69
   A comparison of correlation coefficients on revealed comparative advantage indices in 53 labor
intensive products for China and twenty-five other countries suggested significant positive correlations
between China and Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia. See Boltho et. al., (1994), “China’s Emergence:
Prospects, Opportunities, and Challenges,” Policy Research Working Paper 1339, the World Bank.


                                                                                                          50
FDI actually increased in China. Complaints among the ASEAN countries that China’s success

at attracting FDI came at their expense arguably held a grain of truth.70

          The observation that China’s rapid export growth has, to date, largely displaced export-

oriented assembly elsewhere might suggest that this process is bound to slow down in the near

future. After all, once China accounts for a large majority of global supply within a given

category, exports can only grow at something approximating the total growth rate of global

demand for the product, and that is likely to be considerably slower than the growth rates China

has registered in the recent past. A slowdown in growth of China’s exports of footwear and toys

and sporting goods is probably not far away. The transfer of production of consumer electronics

and IT hardware has proceeded so rapidly that a growth slowdown in this category may not be far

off either.

          However, China stands ready to benefit more than any other country from the abolition of

the WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing, the successor to the Multifiber Agreement

negotiated under GATT. Under this arrangement, textile and apparel exports from any one

country were sharply limited, allowing fledgling apparel industries in nations such as Bangladesh,

Saipan, and Mauritius to flourish. This agreement ended on December 31, 2004. Already, major

apparel importers in the United States are seeking to consolidate their production operations in a

smaller number of low-cost countries. With its low labor costs, relatively high productivity, and

excellent infrastructure, China is likely to dramatically increase its share of global apparel exports,

at the expense of other producers in Latin America, Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia.

China currently accounts for only 13.1 percent of American imports of apparel products. If

China-based producers were able to collectively achieve, over the next several years, a market

share in apparel similar to their current market share in footwear, this would guarantee years of

double-digit growth in a very broad category of manufactures.

         The expansion of China’s role as a mediator of Asian trade with the U.S. has, up to this

point, arguably served the interests of all parties. However, there are also limits to the continued

growth of this pattern of trade, at least in the long run. The sustainability of the U.S. current

account deficit is being increasingly questioned by policymakers, academics, and financial

analysts.71 U.S. trade with Asia is an important component of this deficit, and Asian central

banks, including China’s, have played an increasing role in financing it. The currency reform put

forward in the previous section is part of an inevitable and essential appreciation of the major

Asian currencies.72 However, the role of Japanese, Taiwanese, Hong Kong, and Korean

companies in China’s export flow also creates an interesting constellation of interests regarding

necessary changes in China’s exchange rate regime.

         On the one hand, there is a margin along which producers in these countries directly

compete.73 Producers within this zone of competition would tend to support a revaluation of the

renminbi.74 However, as we have already stressed, this zone of competition is limited. There is

another large set of producers in these countries that has, and continues to make, large

investments in export-oriented production capacity in China. A sufficiently large revaluation of

the renminbi could undermine the competitiveness of this capacity and reduce the profits for the

foreign investors.

         A recent survey by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun indicated that most large export-oriented

Japanese firms do not perceive a large renminbi revaluation to be in their interest, precisely

“global rebalancing” of demand. Well known investor Warren Buffet authored a stern warning about the
implications of the growing U.S. current account deficit in late 2003 in Fortune magazine.

    Attempts by China to encourage the development of capital and technology-intensive industries such as
semiconductor fabrication and telecommunications equipment manufacturing have received extensive
coverage in the popular press. On the former industry, see Jason Dean, “Long a Low-Tech Power, China

    In fact, a substantial renminbi revaluation would be a quid pro quo for their support of a revaluation of
their own currency. See Lardy and Goldstein (2003).


                                                                                                          52
because they have already exploited low-cost Chinese production sites as part of their global

network.75 This sentiment may be broadly shared throughout the developed economies of Asia.

The U.S. has made little headway in its efforts to get other countries in the region to pressure

China to revalue its currency. This partly reflects the divided interests of industrial producers in

these countries.76 That division extends to the United States. The National Association of

Manufactures did not endorse the filing of a trade complaint by a coalition of U.S., industrial, and

agricultural groups accusing China of manipulating its currency.77 Large-scale U.S.-based

retailers, such as Wal-Mart, which sourced 8 percent of its global purchases from China in 2002,

and bought an estimated $15 billion of Chinese merchandise in 2003, have a clear incentive in

minimizing the dollar-denominated production costs of their goods.78 Zhao and Xing (2003a,b)

use a formal model of production outsourcing to show how an advanced country can suffer a

welfare loss when its currency depreciates against that of a less developed country to which it has

outsourced production. The intuition behind this model is clear – cheap imports are good, and

making them more expensive lowers welfare and the profits of firms investing in China to serve

markets like the U.S. Unfortunately, the evidence increasingly suggests that the current exchange

rate arrangements are no longer consistent with macroeconomic fundamentals.

         If not remedied, this could contribute to a real misallocation of resources within China.

At the moment, a Chinese producer seeking to serve a customer in California is eligible for an

almost complete rebate of the value-added tax (15 percent), and he is able to convert dollars into a

domestic currency that could be as much as 25 percent undervalued. This creates a sizeable price

wedge between an export sale and a domestic sale of the same product to a customer in Xinjiang.

A de facto export subsidy of this magnitude, if maintained long enough, could distort the

76
    It also reflects the fact that other countries in the region, including Japan, have massively intervened in
foreign exchange markets to prevent revaluation of their own currencies.

industrial development of the Chinese economy. This is particularly true if we believe that, in at

least some product markets, titanic per capita income differences between the export markets and

the home market mean that the types of products that could sell well domestically are not

necessarily the same types of products that will sell well abroad, and vice versa. Japan, Taiwan,

and South Korea also resisted the appreciation of their own currencies. Is it possible that the

difficulty these countries have had weaning themselves from export-led growth since the 1980s

reflects an overdevelopment of the export sector that was, itself, a function of a long undervalued

exchange rate? The longer a currency’s undervaluation encourages an overexpansion of the

export sector, the greater the power of the lobbying groups that would seek to halt or limit

adjustment become, and the more economically costly that adjustment becomes. To the extent

that our reading of Asian economic history is correct, we can only hope that it is not repeated.

        IX.     Conclusions

        China’s adoption of one of the developing world’s most open trade and FDI regimes

stands as one of the most significant accomplishments of the reform era. China achieved a

greater degree of openness to foreign trade in manufactures prior to WTO accession than is

generally acknowledged, and the drive to liberalization of trade and FDI regimes seems to have

dramatically accelerated in the late 1990s. The additional openings mandated under China’s

WTO accession agreement will likely make China’s economy the most open of any large

developing country, and, to date, China has made reasonable progress toward meeting her

obligations. As we have noted, developments in Chinese trade and investment have generally

conformed to patterns of Chinese comparative advantage, yielding important benefits to China

and her trading partners.

        While it would be inaccurate to describe China’s growth as export-driven, given the

limited direct contribution of net exports to overall macroeconomic growth, China’s embrace of

globalization has increased the degree of competition in her product markets, raised the

productivity of factor accumulation, enhanced consumer welfare in China, and benefited


                                                                                                   54
consumers around the world. Some of China’s key leaders pursued this embrace with a

commendable mixture of pragmatism and courage, for which future generations will owe them

thanks.

          It is difficult to forecast with confidence the full impact of China’s opening of its service

sector to foreign direct investment, in part because there is so little precedent for a developing

country to offer such a degree of market access. The possibility of greater participation by the

world’s leading services firms holds out the promise of preventing the development in China of

the kind of dual economy seen in Japan and Korea. The extent to which this promise will be

realized remains to be seen, but we anticipate that the Chinese consumer and the overall economy

will benefit from this opening, which appears to be taking place in line with China’s obligations

under its accession agreement.

          The one area in which international economic policy has shown less progress in recent

years is the currency regime. In all fairness to the Chinese leadership, the undervaluation of the

currency only emerged since 2002. However, the costs of delaying significant revaluation of the

currency are escalating. And we do not refer here solely to the unprecedented accumulation of

foreign exchange reserves or the deterioration of relationships with key trading partners. So long

as the currency regime remains little changed, the PBOC will remain acutely constrained in its

pursuit of prudent macroeconomic policies to restrain excessive growth.

          It is also possible – indeed likely – that productive capacity that was built up in some

industries in the investment boom that got underway in late 2002 will not be viable at exchange

rates closer to long run equilibrium levels. While China’s embrace of globalization has arguably

tended to enhance the efficiency with which it has accumulated capital, the leadership’s

attachment to a fixed nominal exchange rate against a dollar that began to depreciate at the

beginning of 2002 tended to undermine that historically positive connection. The reforms

announced in the summer of 2005 are potentially an important watershed since the longer a




                                                                                                     55

misallocation.

Note: Contracted amounts refers to the total value of the approved investment project, where this
total is attributed to the year in which approval is conferred. In practice, of course, these
investments are often phased in over a series of years. Actual investment tracks the inflow of FDI
on an annual basis. Data are taken from publications of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation, which was later incorporated into the Ministry of Commerce.
