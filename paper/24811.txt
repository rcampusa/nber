The outcome of any important macroeconomic policy change is the net effect of forces operating
on different parts of the economy. A central challenge facing policy makers is how to assess the
relative strength of those forces. Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models are the
leading framework that macroeconomists have for dealing with this challenge in an open and
transparent manner. This paper reviews the state of DSGE models before the financial crisis and
how DSGE modelers responded to the crisis and its aftermath. In addition, we discuss the role of
DSGE models in the policy process.

1 Introduction

The outcome of any important macroeconomic policy change is the net effect of forces
operating on different parts of the economy. A central challenge facing policy makers is how
to assess the relative strength of those forces. Economists have a range of tools that can be
used to make such assessments. Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models are
the leading tool for making such assessments in an open and transparent manner.

To be concrete, suppose we are interested in understanding the effects of a systematic
change in policy, like switching from inflation targeting to price-level targeting. The most
compelling strategy would be to do randomized control trials on actual economies. But, that
course of action is not available to us. So, what are the alternatives? It is certainly useful to
study historical episodes in which such a similar policy switch occurred or to use reduced-form
time series methods. But, there are obvious limitations to each of these approaches. In the
historical approach, the fact that no two episodes are exactly the same always raises
questions about the relevance of a past episode for the current situation. In the case of
reduced-form methods, it is not always clear which parameters should be changed and which
should be kept constant across policy options. Inevitably, assessing the effects of a systematic
policy change has to involve the use of a model.

To be useful for policy analysis, DSGE models must be data based. As a practical matter,
macroeconomic data aren’t sufficient for discriminating between many alternative models
that offer different answers to policy questions. Put differently, many DSGE models are
observationally equivalent with respect to macro data. But modern DSGE models are based
on microeconomic foundations. So, microeconomic data and institutional facts can be
brought to bear on the design, construction and evaluation of DSGE models. Micro data break
the observational equivalence that was the bane of macroeconomists.

The openness and transparency of DSGE models is a virtue. But it also makes them easy to
criticize. Suspicious assumptions can be highlighted. Inconsistencies with the evidence can
easily be spotted. Forces that are missing from the model can be identified. The process of
responding to informed criticisms is a critical part of the process of building better DSGE
models. Indeed, the transparent nature of DSGE models is exactly what makes it possible for
diverse groups of researchers - including those who don’t work on DSGE models - to be part
of the DSGE project.

Some analysts object to working with DSGE models and prefer to instead think about policy
by working with small equilibrium models that emphasize different subsets of the economy,
labor or financial markets. This approach has a vital contribution to make because small
models help us build intuition about the mechanisms at work in DSGE models. But, this
approach cannot be a substitute for DSGE models itself because quantitative conclusions
about the overall economic impact of a policy requires informal judgment as one integrates
across individual small-scale models. The small-model approach to policy thus involves
implicit assumptions and lacks the transparency of the DSGE approach.

                                               2
To be clear, policy decisions are made by real people using their best judgment. Used wisely,
DSGE models can improve and sharpen that judgment. In an ideal world, we will have both
wise policymakers and empirically plausible models. But, to rephrase Fischer (2017)’s quoting
of Samuelson on Solow: “We’d rather have Stanley Fischer than a DSGE model, but we’d
rather have Stanley Fischer with a DSGE model than without one.”

In section 2 we review the state of mainstream DSGE models before the financial crisis and
the Great Recession. In section 3 we describe how DSGE models are estimated and evaluated.
Section 4 addresses the question of why DSGE modelers – like most other economists and
policy makers – failed to predict the financial crisis and the Great Recession. Section 5
discusses how DSGE modelers responded to the financial crisis and its aftermath. Section 6
discusses how current DSGE models are actually used by policy makers. Section 7 provides a
brief response to criticism of DSGE models, with special emphasis on Stiglitz (2017). Section 7
offers concluding remarks.




2 Before the Storm
In this section we describe early DSGE models and how they evolved prior to the crisis.


2.1    Early DSGE Models

As a practical matter, people often use the term DSGE models to refer to quantitative models
of growth or business cycle fluctuations. A classic example of a quantitative DSGE model is
the Real Business Cycle (RBC) model associated with Kydland and Prescott (1982) and Long
and Plosser (1983). These early RBC models imagined an economy populated by households
who participate in perfectly competitive goods, factor and asset markets. These models took
the position that fluctuations in aggregate economic activity are an efficient response of the
economy to the one source of uncertainty in agents’ environment, exogenous technology
shocks. The associated policy implications are clear: there is no need for any form of
government intervention. In fact, government policies aimed at stabilizing the business cycle
are welfare-reducing.


Excitement about RBC models crumbled under the impact of three forces. First, micro data
cast doubt on some of the key assumptions of the model. These assumptions include, for
example, perfect credit and insurance markets, as well as perfectly frictionless labor markets
in which fluctuations in hours worked reflect movements along a given labor supply curve or
optimal movements of agents in and out of the labor force (see Chetty et al. (2011)). Second,
the models had difficulty in accounting for some key properties of the aggregate data, such as
the observed volatility in hours worked, the equity premium, the low co-movement of
real wages and hours worked (see Christiano and Eichenbaum (1992) and King and Rebelo
(1999)). Open-economy versions of these models also failed to account for key observations
such as the cyclical co-movement of consumption and output across countries (see Backus
                                              3
et al. (1992)) and the extremely high correlation between nominal and real exchange rates
(see Mussa (1986)).

Third, because money plays no role in RBC models, those models seem inconsistent with
mainstream interpretations of various historical episodes. One example is Hume (1742)’s
description of how money from the New World affected the European economy. A different
example is the view that the earlier a country abandoned the Gold Standard during the Great
Depression, the sooner its recovery began (see Bernanke (1995)). A final example is the view
that the severity of the U.S. recession in the early 1980s was in large part caused by monetary
policy.

Finally, the simple RBC model is effectively mute on a host of policy-related questions that are
of vital importance to macroeconomists and policy makers. Examples include: what are the
consequences of different monetary policy rules for aggregate economic activity, what are the
effects of alternative exchange rate regimes, and what regulations should we impose on the
financial sector?

2.2     New Keynesian Models

Prototypical pre-crisis DSGE models built upon the chassis of the RBC model to allow for
nominal frictions, both in labor and goods markets. These models are often referred to as New
Keynesian DSGE models. But, it would be just as appropriate to refer to them as Friedmanite
DSGE models. The reason is that they embody the fundamental world view articulated in
Friedman’s seminal Presidential Address (see Friedman (1968)). According to this view,
hyperinflations aside, monetary policy has essentially no impact on real variables like output
and the real interest rate in the long run. However, due to sticky prices and wages monetary
policy matters in the short run.1 Specifically, a policy-induced transitory fall in the nominal
interest rate is associated with a decline in the real interest rate, an expansion in economic
activity and a moderate rise in inflation.

Models in which permanent changes in monetary policy induce roughly one-to-one changes in
inflation and the nominal rate of interest are said to satisfy the Fisherian property. Models in
which transitory changes in monetary policy induce movements in nominal interest rates and
inflation of the opposite sign are said to satisfy the anti-Fisherian property. The canonical New
Keynesian models of Yun (1996) and Clarida et al. (1999) and Woodford (2003) satisfy both
properties.

The basic intuition behind the anti-Fisherian property of the New Keynesian model is as

1
  For example, Friedman (1968, p. 10) writes that after the monetary authority increases money growth,
“... much or most of the rise in income will take the form of an increase in output and employment rather
than in prices. People have been expecting prices to be stable, and prices and wages have been set for
some time in the future on that basis. It takes time for people to adjust to a new state of demand.
Producers will tend to react to the initial expansion in aggregate demand by increasing output, employees
by working longer hours, and the unemployed, by taking jobs now offered at former nominal wages.”

                                                   4
    follows. Firms set their prices on the basis of current and future marginal costs. The future
    state of the economy is relatively unaffected by a transitory monetary policy shock. So, actual
    inflation responds relatively little to a policy induced transitory fall in the nominal interest rate.
    As a result, the real interest rate declines. Intertemporal substitution by households then
    induces a rise in current consumption, leading to a rise in labor income. That increase
    reinforces the contemporaneous rise in consumption and employment. The expansion in
    employment drives wages and marginal costs up. The latter effect drives inflation up. Since
    inflation and the nominal interest move in opposite directions, the model has the anti-
    Fisherian property. Less surprisingly, standard New Keynesian models satisfy the Fisherian
    property because its long-run properties are roughly the same as the underlying RBC chassis.

    Many researchers found New Keynesian models attractive because they seemed sensible and
    they allowed researchers to engage in the types of policy debates that RBC models had been
    silent about. A critical question was: what properties should quantitative versions of these
    models have? To address this question, the empirical literature focused on quantifying the
    dynamic effects of a shock to monetary policy. This type of shock has long been of interest to
    macroeconomists for a variety of reasons. For example, Friedman and Schwartz (1963)
    attributed the major portion of business cycle variations to exogenous shocks in the money
    supply. The recent literature finds these shocks interesting because they provide a potentially
    powerful diagnostic for discriminating between models. Perhaps the most extreme example
    is that a real business cycle model implies nothing happens to real variables after a monetary
    policy shock. In contrast, simple New Keynesian models imply that real variables do respond
    to a monetary policy shock.

    A monetary policy shock can reflect a variety of factors including measurement error in the
    real-time data that policy makers condition their actions on and the basic randomness that is
    inherent in group decisions. In a seminal paper Sims (1986) argued that one should identify
    monetary policy shocks with disturbances to a monetary policy reaction function in which the
    policy instrument is a short-term interest rate. Bernanke and Blinder (1992) and Christiano et
    al. (1996, 1999) identify monetary policy shocks using the assumption that monetary policy
    shocks have no contemporaneous impact on inflation and output.2 This set of identifying
    restrictions, like the entire New Keynesian enterprise, falls squarely in the Friedman world
    view. For example, in testimony before Congress, Friedman (1959) said:

       “Monetary and fiscal policy is rather like a water tap that you turn on now and that then only
       starts to run 6, 9, 12, 16 months from now.”

    In practice, this Friedman-style identifying strategy is implemented using a vector
    autoregression representation (VAR) with a large set of variables. Figure 1, taken from
    Christiano, Trabandt and Walentin (2010), displays the effects of identified monetary policy
    shocks estimated using data covering the period 1951Q1 to 2008Q4. For convenience we only
    show the response functions for a subset of the variables in the VAR. The dashed lines
    correspond to 95% confidence intervals about the point estimates (solid black line).

2
 Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans (1999) show that the results from imposing this assumption on monthly or quarterly
data are qualitatively similar. The assumption is obviously more compelling for monthly data.

     Notes: All data are expressed in deviations from what would have happened in the absence of the shock. The units are given in the titles of
     the subplots. % means percent deviation from unshocked path. APR means annualized percentage rate deviation from unshocked path.



Overall, the results are consistent with the view that an expansionary monetary policy shock
has the effects that Friedman (1968) asserted in his Presidential Address. Specifically, an
expansionary monetary policy shock corresponding to a decline in the U.S. federal funds rate
leads to hump-shaped expansions in consumption, investment and output, as well as relatively
small rises in real wages and inflation. Since the inflation rate moves very little in response to
a monetary policy shock, the responses in the real interest rate and the federal funds rate are
roughly the same.

A natural question is how robust the results in Figure 1 are to the various technical assumptions
underlying the statistical analysis. Here, we focus on sensitivity to the number of lags in the
VAR and to the start of the sample period. A VAR represents each variable as a function of the
lagged values of all the variables in the system. Denote the number of lags by n. The baseline
specification in Figure 1 assumes n=2. The Figure reports the results of redoing the analysis for
n=1,…,5. For each value of n, the Figure reports the results based on starting the sample period
in each of the dates 1951Q1, 1951Q2, …, 1985Q4. In this way, we generate 700 sets of results,
each of which is displayed by a thin solid grey line in Figure 1. Note that the basic qualitative
properties of the benchmark analysis are remarkably robust, although there are of course
                                                                      6
specifications of n and the sample period that yield different implications. It is interesting how
similar the shape of the confidence and sensitivity intervals are.

In recent years researchers have developed alternative procedures for identifying monetary
policy shocks. These procedures focus on movements in the federal funds futures rate in a
tight window of time around announcements made by monetary policy makers. See, for
example, Gertler and Karadi (2015) who build on the work of Kuttner (2001) and Gürkaynak,
Sack and Swanson (2005). Broadly speaking, this literature reaches the same conclusions about
the effects of monetary policy shocks displayed in Figure 1. In our view, these conclusions
summarize the conventional view about the effects of a monetary policy shock.


2.3     Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans’ Model

A key challenge was to develop an empirically plausible version of the New Keynesian
model that could account quantitatively for the type of impulse response functions
displayed in Figure 1. Christiano et al. (2005) developed a version of the New Keynesian
model that met this challenge. We go into some detail describing the basic features of that
model because they form the core of leading pre-crisis DSGE models, such as Smets and
Wouters (2003, 2007).

2.3.1   Consumption and Investment Decisions

Consistent with a long tradition in macroeconomics, the model economy in Christiano et al.
(2005) is populated by a representative household. At each date, the household allocates
money to purchases of financial assets, as well as consumption and investment goods. The
household receives income from wages, from renting capital to firms and from financial
assets, all net of taxes.

As in the simple New Keynesian model, Christiano et al. (2005) make assumptions that imply
the household’s borrowing constraints are not binding. So, the interest rate determines the
intertemporal time pattern of consumption. Of course, the present value of income
determines the level of consumption. Holding interest rates constant, the solution to the
household problem is consistent with a key prediction of Friedman’s permanent income
hypothesis: persistent changes in income have a much bigger impact on household
consumption than transitory changes.

To be consistent with the response of consumption and the interest rate to a monetary policy
shock observed in Figure 1, Christiano et al. (2005) had to depart from the standard
assumption that utility is time-separable in consumption. Generally speaking, that
assumption implies that after a policy-induced decline in the interest rate, consumption
jumps immediately and then falls. But, this is a very different pattern than the hump-shape
response that we see in Figure 1. To remedy this problem, Christiano et al. (2005) follow
Fuhrer (2000) by adopting the assumption of habit-formation in consumption. Under this
specification, the marginal utility of current consumption depends positively on the level of
                                               7
    the household’s past consumption. Households then choose to raise consumption slowly over
    time, generating a hump-shape response-pattern as in Figure 1. As it turns out, there is
    substantial support for habit persistence in the finance, growth and psychology literatures.3


    To be consistent with the hump-shape response of investment to a monetary policy shock,
    Christiano et al. (2005) had to assume households face costs of changing the rate of
    investment. To see why, note that absent uncertainty, arbitrage implies that the one-period
    return on capital is equal to the real rate of interest on bonds. Absent any adjustment costs,
    the one-period return on capital is the sum of the marginal product of capital plus one minus
    the depreciation rate. Suppose that there is an expansionary monetary policy shock that
    drives down the real interest rate, with the maximal impact occurring contemporaneously, as
    in the data (see Figure 1). Absent adjustment costs, arbitrage requires that the marginal
    product of capital follow a pattern identical to the real interest rate. For that to happen both
    the capital stock and investment must have exactly the opposite pattern than the marginal
    product of capital. With the biggest surge in investment occurring in the period of the
    monetary policy shock the simple model cannot reproduce the hump-shape pattern in Figure
    1. When it is costly to adjust the rate of investment, households choose to raise investment
    slowly over time, generating a hump-shape response-pattern as in Figure 1.

    Lucca (2006) and Matsuyama (1984) provide interesting theoretical foundations for the
    investment adjustment cost in Christiano et al. (2005). In addition, there is substantial
    empirical evidence in support of the specification (see Eberly et al. (2012) and Matsuyama
    (1984)).

    An important alternative specification of adjustment costs penalizes changes in the capital
    stock. This specification has a long history in macroeconomics, going back at least to Lucas
    and Prescott (1971). Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans show that with this type of
    adjustment cost, investment jumps after an expansionary monetary policy shock and then
    converges monotonically back to its pre-shock level from above. This response pattern is
    inconsistent with the VAR evidence.



    2.3.2 Nominal Rigidities

    In contrast to RBC models, goods and labor markets in Christiano et al. (2005) are not perfectly
    competitive. This departure is necessary to allow for sticky prices and sticky nominal wages –
    if a price or wage is sticky, someone has to set it.

    In Christiano et al. (2005), nominal rigidities arise from Calvo (1983) style frictions. In
    particular, firms and households can change prices or wages with some exogenous

3
 In the finance literature see, for example, Eichenbaum and Hansen (1990), Constantinides (1990) and
Boldrin et al. (2001). In the growth literature see Carroll et al. (1997, 2000). In the psychology literature, see
Gremel et al. (2016).

                                                        8
probability. In addition, they must satisfy whatever demand materializes at those prices and
wages.

Calvo-style frictions make sense only in environments where inflation is moderate. Even in
moderate inflation environments, Calvo-style frictions have implications that are inconsistent
with aspects of micro data (see for example Nakamura and Steinsson (2008) or Eichenbaum
et al. (2011)). Still, its continued use reflects two factors. First, Calvo-style frictions allow
models to capture, in an elegant and tractable manner, what many researchers believe is an
essential feature of business cycles: for moderate inflation economies, firms and labor
suppliers typically respond to variations in demand by varying quantities rather than prices.
Second, authors like Eichenbaum et al. (2011) argue that, for moderate inflation economies,
the Calvo model provides a good approximation to more plausible models in which firms face
costs of changing their pricing strategies.

2.3.3 A-cyclical Marginal Costs

Christiano et al. (2005) build features into the model which ensure that firms’ marginal costs
are nearly a-cyclical. They do so for three reasons. First, there is substantial empirical evidence
in favor of this view (see for example, Anderson et al. (2018)). Second, the more a-cyclical
marginal cost is, the more plausible is the assumption that firms satisfy demand. Third, as in
standard New Keynesian models, inflation is an increasing function of current and expected
future marginal costs. So, relatively a-cyclical marginal costs are critical for dampening
movements in the inflation rate.

The model in Christiano et al. (2005) incorporates two mechanisms to ensure that marginal
costs are relatively a-cyclical. The first is the sticky nominal wage assumption mentioned
above. The second mechanism is that the rate at which capital is utilized can be varied in
response to shocks.


2.3.4 Quantitative Properties

To illustrate the model’s quantitative properties, we work with the variant of the model of
Christiano et al. (2005) estimated by Christiano, Eichenbaum and Trabandt (2016). We re-
estimated the model using a Bayesian procedure that treats the VAR-based impulse
responses to a monetary policy shock as data. The appendix to this paper provides details
about the prior and posterior distributions of model parameters. Here we highlight some of
the key estimated parameters. The posterior mode estimates imply that firms change prices
on average once every 2.3 quarters, the household changes nominal wages about once a year,
past consumption enters with a coefficient of 0.75 in the household’s utility function, and the
elasticity of investment with respect to a one percent temporary increase in the current price of
installed capital is equal to 0.16.

The thin solid black lines in Figure 2 are the VAR-based impulse response function estimates
reproduced from Figure 1. The grey area depicts the 95% confidence intervals associated with

                                                9
those estimates. The solid blue line depicts the impulse response function of the estimated
DSGE model to a monetary policy shock, calculated using the mode of the posterior
distribution of the model’s parameters.

Four key features of the results are worth noting. First, the model succeeds in accounting for
the hump-shape rise in consumption, investment and real GDP after a policy-induced fall in
the federal funds rate. Second, the model succeeds in accounting for the small rise in inflation
after the shock. Third, the model has the property that real wages are essentially unaffected
by the policy shock. Finally, the model has the anti-Fisherian property that the nominal
interest and inflation move in the opposite direction after a transitory monetary policy shock.

We emphasize that the model’s properties depend critically on sticky wages. The red dashed
line in Figure 2 depicts the model’s implications if we recalculate the impulse responses
assuming that nominal wages are fully flexible (holding other model parameters fixed at the
mode of the posterior distribution). Note that the model’s performance deteriorates
drastically.



                                                                          10
In Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans (2005), sticky wages are sticky by assumption.
Christiano, Eichenbaum and Trabandt (2016) show that wage stickiness arises endogenously
in a version of Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans (2005), where there are labor market search
and matching frictions. The key feature of the model is that workers and firms bargain in a
way that reduces the sensitivity of the wage to macroeconomic aggregates. One advantage
of endogenously generating sticky wages in this way is that Christiano, Eichenbaum and
Trabandt (2016) can analyze the aggregate effects of various policies like unemployment
insurance.

Finally, we note that habit formation and investment adjustment costs are critical to the
model’s success. Absent those features, it would be very difficult to generate hump-shaped
responses with reasonable degrees of nominal rigidities.



3    How DSGE Models Are Estimated and Evaluated
Prior to the financial crisis, researchers generally worked with log-linear approximations to
the equilibria of DSGE models. There were three reasons for this choice. First, for the models
being considered and for the size of shocks that seemed relevant for the post-war U.S. data,
linear approximations are very accurate (see for example the papers in Taylor and Uhlig
(1990)). Second, linear approximations allow researchers to exploit the large array of tools
for forecasting, filtering and estimation provided in the literature on linear time series
analysis. Third, it was simply not computationally feasible to solve and estimate large,
nonlinear DSGE models. The technological constraints were real and binding.

Researchers choose values for the key parameters of their models using a variety of
strategies. In some cases, researchers choose parameter values to match unconditional
model and data moments, or they reference findings in the empirical micro literature. This
procedure is called calibration and does not use formal sampling theory. Calibration was the
default procedure in the early RBC literature and it is also sometimes used in the DSGE
literature. Most of the modern DSGE literature conducts inference about parameter values
and model fit using one of two strategies that make use of formal econometric sampling
theory.

The first strategy is limited information because it does not exploit all of the model’s
implications for moments of the data. One variant of the strategy minimizes the distance
between a subset of model-implied second moments and their analogs in the data. A more
influential variant of this first strategy estimates parameters by minimizing the distance be-
tween model and data impulse responses to economic shocks (examples of the impulse
response matching approach include Christiano et al. (2005), Altig et al. (2011), Iacoviello
(2005) and Rotemberg and Woodford (1991)).

One way to estimate the data impulse response functions is based on partially identified
VARs. Another variant of this strategy, sometimes referred to as the method of external
instruments, involves using historical or narrative methods to obtain instruments for the
                                             11
underlying shocks (see, Mertens and Ravn (2013)). Finally, researchers have exploited
movements in asset prices immediately after central bank policy announcements to identify
monetary policy shocks and their consequences. This approach is referred to as high
frequency identification (early contributions include e.g. Kuttner (2001) and Gürkaynak et al.
(2005)).

The initial limited information applications in the DSGE literature used generalized method of
moments estimators and classical sampling theory (see Hansen (1982)). Building on the work
of Chernozhukov and Hong (2003), Christiano et al. (2010) showed how the Bayesian
approach can be applied in limited information contexts.

A critical advantage of the Bayesian approach is that one can formally and transparently bring
to bear information from a variety of sources on what constitutes “reasonable” values for
model parameters. Suppose, for example, that one could only match the dynamic response
to a monetary policy shock for model parameter values implying that firms change their prices
on average every two years. This implication is strongly at variance with evidence from micro
data. In the Bayesian approach, the analyst would impose priors that sharply penalize such
parameter values so that those parameter values would be assigned low probabilities in the
analyst’s posterior distribution. Best practice compares priors and posteriors for model
parameters. This comparison allows the analyst to make clear the role of priors and the data
in generating the results.

As we just stressed the Bayesian approach allows one to bring to bear information culled from
micro data on model parameters. This approach allows one to bring to bear information
culled from micro data on model parameters. At a deeper level, micro data influences, in a
critical but slow-moving manner, the class of models that we work with. Our discussion of the
demise of the pure RBC model is one illustration of this process. The models of financial
frictions and heterogeneous agents discussed below are an additional illustration of how
DSGE models evolve over time in response to micro data (see sections 5.1 and 5.3).

The second strategy for estimating DSGE models involves full-information methods. In many
applications, the data used for estimation is relatively uninformative about the value of some
of the parameters in DSGE models (see Canova and Sala (2009)). A natural way to deal with
this fact is to bring other information to bear on the analysis. Bayesian priors are a vehicle for
doing exactly that. This is an important reason why the Bayesian approach has been very
influential in full-information applications. Starting from Smets and Wouters (2003), a large
econometric literature has expanded the Bayesian toolkit to include better ways to conduct
inference about model parameters and to analyze model fit. For a recent survey see
Fernandez-Villaverde et al. (2016).

4     Why Didn’t DSGE                        Models Predict the Financial
      Crisis?
Pre-crisis DSGE models didn’t predict the increasing vulnerability of the U.S. economy to a
financial crisis. They have also been criticized for not placing more emphasis on financial
frictions. Here, we give our perspective on these failures.

There is still an ongoing debate about the causes of the financial crisis. Our view, shared by
Bernanke (2009) and many others, is that the financial crisis was precipitated by a rollover
crisis in a very large and highly levered shadow-banking sector that relied on short-term debt
to fund long-term assets. By shadow banks we mean financial institutions not covered by the
protective umbrella of the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (for
further discussion, see Bernanke (2010)).

Rollover crisis was triggered by a set of developments in the housing sector. U.S. housing
prices began to rise rapidly in the 1990’s. The S&P/Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index
rose by a factor of roughly 2.5 between 1991 and 2006. The precise role played by
expectations, the subprime market, declining lending standards in mortgage markets, and
overly-loose monetary policy is not critical for our purposes. What is critical is that housing
prices began to decline in mid-2006, causing a fall in the value of the assets of shadow banks
that had heavily invested in mortgage-backed securities. The Fed’s willingness to provide a
safety net for the shadow banking system was at best implicit, creating the conditions under
which a roll-over crisis was possible. In fact, a rollover crisis did occur and shadow banks had
to sell their asset-backed securities at fire-sale prices, precipitating the financial crisis and the
Great Recession.

Against this background, we turn to the first of the two criticisms of DSGE models mentioned
above, namely their failure to signal the increasing vulnerability of the U.S. economy to a
financial crisis. This criticism is correct. The failure reflected a broader failure of the economics
community. The overwhelming majority of academics, regulators and practitioners did not
realize that a small shadow-banking system had metastasized into a massive, poorly-
regulated, wild west-like sector that was not protected by deposit insurance or lender-of-last-
resort backstops.

We now turn to the second criticism of DSGE models, namely that they did not sufficiently
emphasize financial frictions. In practice modelers have to make choices about which frictions
to emphasize. One reason why modelers did not emphasize financial frictions in DSGE models
is that until the Great Recession, post-war recessions in the U.S. and Western Europe did not
seem closely tied to disturbances in financial markets. The Savings and Loans crisis in the US
was a localized affair that did not grow into anything like the Great Recession. Similarly, the
stock market meltdown in 1987 and the bursting of the tech-bubble in 2001 only had minor
effects on aggregate economic activity.

At the same time, the financial frictions that were included in DSGE models did not seem to
                                                 13
have very big effects. Consider, for example, Bernanke et al. (1999)’s influential model of the
financial accelerator. That model is arguably the most influential pre-crisis DSGE model with
financial frictions. It turns out that the financial accelerator has only a modest quantitative
effect on the way the model economy responds to shocks, see e.g. Lindé et al. (2016). In the
same spirit, Kocherlakota (2000) argues that models with Kiyotaki and Moore (1997) type
credit constraints have only negligible effects on dynamic responses to shocks. Finally, Brzoza-
Brzezina and Kolasa (2013) compare the empirical performance of the standard New
Keynesian DSGE model with variants that incorporate Kiyotaki and Moore (1997) and
Bernanke et al. (1999) type constraints. Their key finding is that neither model substantially
improves on the performance of the benchmark model, either in terms of marginal likelihoods
or impulse response functions. So, guided by the post-war data from the U.S. and Western
Europe, and experience with existing models of financial frictions, DSGE modelers
emphasized other frictions.



5     After the Storm
Given the data-driven nature of DSGE enterprise, it is not surprising that the financial crisis
and its aftermath had an enormous impact on DSGE models. In this section we discuss the
major strands of work in post-financial crisis DSGE models.

5.1     Financial Frictions

The literature on financial frictions can loosely be divided between papers that focus on
frictions originating inside financial institutions and those that arise from the characteristics
of the people who borrow from financial institutions. Theories of bank runs and rollover crisis
focus on the first class of frictions. Theories of collateral constrained borrowers focus on the
second class of frictions. We do not have space to systematically review the DSGE models
that deal with both types of financial frictions. Instead, we discuss examples of each.


                    Frictions That Originate Inside Financial Institutions

Motivated by events associated with the financial crisis, Gertler and Kiyotaki (2015) and
Gertler, Kiyotaki and Prestipino (2016) develop a DSGE model of a rollover crisis in the shadow
banking sector, which triggers fire sales. The resulting decline in asset values tightens balance
sheet constraints in the rest of the financial sector and throughout the economy.4

In the Gertler and Kiyotaki (2015) model, shadow banks finance the purchase of long-term
assets by issuing short-term (one-period) debt. Banks have two ways to deal with short-term
debt that is coming due. The first is to issue new short-term debt (this is called rolling over


4
 The key theoretical antecedent is the bank run model of Diamond and Dybvig (1983) and the sovereign
debt rollover crisis model of Cole and Kehoe (2000).

                                                 14
      the debt). The second is to sell assets. The creditor’s only decision is whether or not to buy
      new short-term debt. There is nothing the creditor can do to affect payments received on
      past short-term debt. Unlike in the classic bank run model of Diamond and Dybvig (1983),
      there is no reason to impose a sequential debt service constraint.

      There is always an equilibrium in the Gertler and Kiyotaki (2015) model in which shadow
      banks can roll over the short-term debt without incident. But, there can also be an equilibrium
      in which each creditor chooses not to roll over the debt. Suppose that an individual creditor
      believes that all other creditors won’t extend new credit to banks. In that case, there will be
      a system- wide failure of the banks, as attempts to pay off bank debt lead to fire sales of assets
      that wipes out bank equity. The individual creditor would prefer to buy assets at fire sale
      prices rather than extend credit to a bank that has zero net worth. With every potential
      creditor thinking this way, it is a Nash equilibrium for each creditor to not purchase new
      liabilities from banks. Such an equilibrium is referred to as a roll over crisis.

      A roll over crisis leads to fire sales because, with all banks selling, the only potential buyers
      are other agents who have little experience evaluating the banks’ assets. In this state of the
      world, agency problems associated with asymmetric information become important.5

prices that began in the summer of 2006. The right side of Figure 1 is the analog of the left
side, taking into account the lower value of the 15              shadow banks’ assets. In the example, the
market value of assets has fallen by 10, from 120 to 110. In the absence of a rollover crisis,
the system is solvent. However, the value of the assets in the case of a rollover crisis is 95
and the net worth of the bank is negative in that scenario. So, a relatively small change in
asset values can lead to a severe crisis.
We use this model to illustrate how a relatively small shock can trigger a system-wide rollover
crisis in the shadow banking system. To this end, consider the example Figure 3, which
captures in a highly stylized way the key features of the shadow-banking system before (left
side) and after (right side) the crisis. In the left-side table the shadow banks’ assets and
liabilities are 120 and 100, respectively. So, their net worth is positive. The numbers in
parentheses show the value of the assets and net worth of the shadow banks if there were to
be a rollover crisis and fire-sale of assets. Since net worth remains positive, the Gertler and
Kiyotaki analysis implies that a rollover crisis cannot occur.

Now imagine that the assets of the shadow banks decline because of a small shift in
fundamentals. Here, we have in mind the events associated with the decline in housing prices
that began in the summer of 2006. The right side of Figure 3 is the analog of the left side,
taking into account the lower value of the shadow banks’ assets. In the example, the market
value of assets has fallen by 10, from 120 to 110. In the absence of a rollover crisis, the system
is solvent. However, the value of the assets in the case of a rollover crisis is 95 and the net
worth of the bank is negative in that scenario. So, a relatively small change in asset values
could lead to a severe financial crisis.

The example illustrates two important potential uses of DSGE models. First, an estimated
DSGE model can be used to calculate the probability of a roll over crisis, conditional on the
state of the economy. In principle, one could estimate this probability function using reduced
form methods. However, since financial crises are rare events, estimates emerging from
reduced form methods would have enormous sampling uncertainty. Because of its general
equilibrium structure, an empirically plausible DSGE model would address the sampling
uncertainty problem by making use of a wider array of information drawn from non-crisis
times to assess the probability of a financial crisis. The second potential use of DSGE models
is to design policies that deal optimally with financial crises. For this task, structure is
essential. While we think that existing DSGE models of financial crisis such as Gertler and
Kiyotaki yield valuable insights, these models are clearly still in their infancy.

For example, the model assumes that people know what can happen in a crisis, together with
the associated probabilities. This seems implausible, given the fact that a full-blown crisis is a
two or three times a century event. It seems safe to conjecture that factors such as aversion
to ‘Knightian uncertainty’ play an important role in driving fire sales in a crisis (see, for
example, Caballero and Krishnamurthy (2008)). Still, research on various types of crises is
proceeding at a rapid pace, and we expect to see substantial improvements in DSGE models
on the subject. For an example, see Bianchi et al. (2016) and the references therein.


       Frictions Associated with the People that Borrow from Financial Institutions

We now turn to our second example, which focuses on frictions that arise from the
characteristics of the people who borrow from financial institutions. One of the themes of
this paper is that data analysis lies at the heart of the DSGE project. Elsewhere, we have
stressed the importance of microeconomic data. Here, we also stress the role of financial data
as a source of information about the sources of economic fluctuations. Using an estimated
                                               16
    DSGE model, Christiano et al. (2014) argue that the dominant source of U.S. business cycle
    fluctuations are disturbances in the riskiness of individual firms (what they call risk shocks). A
    motivation for their analysis is that in recessions, firms pay a premium to borrow money,
    above the rate at which a risk-free entity like the U.S. government borrows. Christiano et al.
    (2014) in effect interpret this premium as reflecting the view of lenders that firms represent
    a riskier bet. Christiano et al. (2014) estimate their DSGE model using a large number of
    macroeconomic and financial variables and conclude that fluctuations in risk can account for
    the bulk of GDP fluctuations.

    To understand the underlying economics, consider a recession that is triggered by an increase
    in the riskiness of firms.6 As the cost of borrowing rises, firms borrow less and demand less
    capital. This decline induces a fall in both the quantity and price of capital. In the presence of
    nominal rigidities and a Taylor rule for monetary policy, the decline in investment leads to an
    economy-wide recession, including a fall in consumption and a rise in firm bankruptcies. With
    the decline in aggregate demand, inflation falls. Significantly, the risk shock leads to an
    increase in the cross-sectional dispersion of the rate of return on firm equity. Moreover, the
    recession is also associated with a fall in the stock market, driven primarily by capital losses
    associated with the fall in the price of capital. All these effects are observed in a typical
    recession.7 This property of risk shocks is why Christiano et al. (2014)’s estimation procedure
    attributes 60 percent of the variance of U.S. business cycles to them.

    The dynamic effects of risk shocks in the Christiano et al. (2014) model resemble business
    cycles so well, that many of the standard shocks that appear in previous business cycle models
    are rendered unimportant in the empirical analysis. For example, Christiano et al. (2014) find
    that aggregate shocks to the technology for producing new capital account for only 13 percent
    of the business cycle variation in GDP. This contrasts sharply with the results in Justiniano et
    al. (2010), who argue that this shock accounts for roughly 50 percent of business cycle
    variation of GDP. The critical difference is that Christiano et al. (2014) include financial data
    like the stock market in their analysis. Shocks to the supply of capital give rise to
    countercyclical movements in the stock market, so they cannot be the prime source of
    business cycles.

    Financial frictions have also been incorporated into a growing literature that introduces the
    housing market into DSGE models. One part of this literature focuses on the implications of
    housing prices for households’ capacity to borrow (see Iacoviello and Neri (2010) and Berger
    et al. (2017)). Another part focuses on the implications of land and housing prices on firms’
    capacity to borrow (Liu et al. (2013)). Space constraints prevent us from surveying this
    literature here.


6
  In Christiano et al. (2014) a rise in risk corresponds to an increase in the variance of a firm-specific shock to
technology. Absent financial frictions, such a shock would have no impact on aggregate output. A rise in the
variance would lead to bigger-sized shocks at the firm level but the average across firms is only a function of the
mean (law of large numbers).
7
  To our knowledge, the first paper to articulate the idea that a positive shock to idiosyncratic risk could
produce effects that resemble a recession is Williamson (1987).

5.2    Zero Lower Bound and Other Nonlinearities

The financial crisis and its aftermath was associated with two important nonlinear
phenomena. The first phenomenon was the rollover crisis in the shadow-banking sector
discussed above. The Gertler and Kiyotaki (2015) model illustrates the type of nonlinear
model required to analyze this type of crisis. The second phenomenon was that the nominal
interest rate hit the zero-lower bound in December 2008. An earlier theoretical literature
associated with Krugman (1998), Benhabib et al. (2001) and Eggertsson and Woodford (2003)
had analyzed the implications of the zero-lower bound for the macroeconomy. Building on
this literature, DSGE modelers quickly incorporated the zero-lower bound into their models
and analyzed its implications.

In what follows, we discuss one approach that DSGE modelers took to understand what
triggered the Great Recession and why it persisted for so long. We then review some of the
policy advice that emerges from recent DSGE models.


                         The Causes of the Crisis and Slow Recovery

One set of papers uses detailed nonlinear DSGE models to assess which shocks triggered the
financial crisis and what propagated their effects over time. We focus on three papers to give
the reader a flavor of this literature. Christiano et al. (2015) analyze the post-crisis period
taking into account that the zero lower bound was binding. In addition, they take into account
the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) guidance about future monetary
policy. This guidance was highly nonlinear in nature: it involved a regime switch depending
on the realization of endogenous variables (e.g. the unemployment rate).

Christiano et al. (2015) argue that the bulk of movements in aggregate real economic activity
during the Great Recession was due to financial frictions interacting with the zero-lower
bound. At the same time, their analysis indicates that the observed fall in total factor
productivity and the rise in the cost of working capital played important roles in accounting
for the surprisingly small drop in inflation after the financial crisis.

Lindé and Trabandt (2018b) argue that nonlinearities in price and wage-setting are an
alternative reason for the small decline in inflation during the Great Recession. In particular,
they assume that the elasticity of demand of a goods-producing firm is increasing in its
relative price along the lines proposed in Kimball (1995). So, during a recession when marginal
costs are falling, firms that can change their prices have less of an incentive to do so relative
to the case in which the elasticity of demand is constant. They show that this effect is
quantitatively important in the standard nonlinear New Keynesian DSGE model.

Gust et al. (2017) estimate a fully nonlinear DSGE model with an occasionally binding zero
lower bound. Nonlinearities in the model play an important role for inference about the
source and propagation of shocks. According to their analysis, shocks to the demand for risk-
free bonds and, to a lesser extent, the marginal efficiency of investment proxying for financial
frictions, played a critical role in the crisis and its aftermath.
                                                   18
A common feature of the previous papers is that they provide a quantitatively plausible model
of the behavior of major economic aggregates during the Great Recession when the zero
lower bound was a binding constraint. Critically, those papers include both financial frictions
and nominal rigidities. A model of the crisis and its aftermath which didn’t have financial
frictions just would not be plausible. At the same time, a model that included financial
frictions but didn’t allow for nominal rigidities would have difficulty accounting for the broad-
based decline across all sectors of the economy. Such a model would predict a boom in
sectors of the economy that are less dependent on the financial sector.

The fact that DSGE models with nominal rigidities and financial frictions can provide
quantitatively plausible accounts of the financial crisis and the Great Recession makes them
obvious frameworks within which to analyze alternative fiscal and monetary policies. We
begin with a discussion of fiscal policy.


                                          Fiscal Policy

In standard DSGE models, an increase in government spending triggers a rise in output and
inflation. When monetary policy is conducted according to a standard Taylor rule that obeys
the Taylor principle, a rise in inflation triggers a rise in the real interest rate. Other things
equal, the policy-induced rise in the real interest rate lowers investment and consumption
demand. So, in these models the government spending multiplier is typically less than one.
But when the zero lower bound binds, the rise in inflation associated with an increase in
government spending does not trigger a rise in the real interest rate. With the nominal
interest rate stuck at zero, a rise in inflation lowers the real interest rate, crowding
consumption and investment in, rather than out. This raises the quantitative question: how
does a binding zero lower bound constraint on the nominal interest rate affect the size of the
government spending multiplier?

Christiano et al. (2011) address this question in a DSGE model, assuming all taxes are lump-
sum. A basic principle that emerges from their analysis is that the multiplier is larger the more
binding is the zero lower bound. Christiano et al. (2011) measure how binding the zero lower
bound is by how much a policymaker would like to lower the nominal interest below zero if
he or she could. For their preferred specification, the multiplier is much larger than one. When
the ZLB is not binding, then the multiplier would be substantially below one.

Erceg and Lindé (2014) examine among other things the impact of distortionary taxation on
the magnitude of government spending multiplier in the zero lower bound. They find that the
results based on lump-sum taxation are robust relative to the situation in which distortionary
taxes are raised gradually to pay for the increase in government spending.

There is by now a large literature that studies the fiscal multiplier when the ZLB binds using
DSGE models that allow for financial frictions, open-economy considerations and liquidity
constrained consumers. We cannot review this literature because of space constraints. But,
the crucial point is that DSGE models are playing an important role in the debate among
academics and policymakers about whether and how fiscal policy should be used to fight
                                               19
    recessions. We offer two examples in this regard. First, Coenen et al. (2012) analyze the
    impact of different fiscal stimulus shocks in several DSGE models that are used by policy-
    making institutions. The second example is Blanchard et al. (2017) who analyze the effects of
    a fiscal expansion by the core euro area economies on the periphery euro area economies.
    Finally, we note that the early papers on the size of the government spending multiplier use
    log-linearized versions of DSGE models. For example, Christiano et al. (2011) work with a
    linearized version of their model while Christiano et al. (2015) work with a nonlinear version
    of the model. Significantly, there is now a literature that assesses the sensitivity of multiplier
    calculations to linear versus nonlinear solutions. See, for example, Christiano and Eichenbaum
    (2012), Boneva et al. (2016), Christiano et al. (2017) and Lindé and Trabandt (forthcoming).


                                             Forward Guidance

    When the zero lower bound constraint on the nominal interest rate became binding, it was
    no longer possible to fight the recession using conventional monetary policy, i.e., lowering
    short-term interest rates. Monetary policymakers considered a variety of alternatives. Here,
    we focus on forward guidance as a policy option analyzed by Eggertsson and Woodford (2003)
    and Woodford (2012) in simple New Keynesian models. By forward guidance we mean that
    the monetary policymaker keeps the interest rate lower for longer than he or she ordinarily
    would.

    As documented in Carlstrom et al. (2015), forward guidance is implausibly powerful in
    standard DSGE models like Christiano et al. (2005). Del Negro et al. (2012) refer to this
    phenomenon as the forward guidance puzzle. This puzzle has fueled an active debate.
    Carlstrom et al. (2015) and Kiley (2016) show that the magnitude of the forward guidance
    puzzle is substantially reduced in a sticky information (as opposed to a sticky price) model.
    Other responses to the forward guidance puzzle involve more fundamental changes, such as
    abandoning the representative agent framework. These changes are discussed in the next
    subsection. More radical responses involve abandoning strong forms of rational expectations.
    See for example Gabaix (2016), Woodford (2018) and Angeletos and Lian (2018).




    5.3    Heterogeneous Agent Models
    The primary channel by which monetary-policy induced interest rate changes affect
    consumption in the standard New Keynesian model is by causing the representative
    household to reallocate consumption over time. In fact, there is a great deal of empirical
    micro evidence against the importance of this reallocation channel, in part because many
    households face binding borrowing constraints.8
    Motivated by these observations, macroeconomists are exploring DSGE models where
    heterogeneous consumers face idiosyncratic shocks and binding borrowing constraints. Given


8
  There is also important work allowing for firm heterogeneity in DSGE models. See, for example, Gilchrist et al.
(2017) and Ottonello and Winberry (2017).
                                                       20
space constraints, we cannot review this entire body of work here. See Kaplan et al. (2017)
and McKay et al. (2016) for papers that convey the flavor of the literature. Both of these
papers present DSGE models in which households have uninsurable, idiosyncratic income risk.
In addition, many households face borrowing constraints.9

The literature on heterogeneous agent DSGE models is still young. But it has already yielded
important insights into important policy issues like the impact of forward guidance (see
McKay et al. (2016) and Farhi and Werning (2017)). The literature has also lead to a richer
understanding of how monetary policy actions affect the economy. For example, in Kaplan et
al. (2017) a monetary policy action initially affects the small set of households who actively
intertemporally adjust spending in response to an interest rate change. But, most of the
impact occurs through a multiplier-type process that occurs as other firms and households
adjust their spending in response to the change in demand by the ‘intertemporal adjusters’.
This area of research typifies the cutting edge of DSGE models: the key features are motivated
by micro data and the implications (say, for the multiplier-type process) are assessed using
both micro and macro data.



6     How are DSGE Models Used in Policy Institutions?

In this section we discuss how DSGE models are used in policy institutions. As a case study,
we focus on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. We are guided in our
discussion by Stanley Fischer’s description of the policy-making process at the Federal
Reserve Board (see Fischer (2017)).

Before the Federal Reserve system open market committee (FOMC) meets to make policy
decisions, all participants are given copies of the so-called Tealbook.10 Tealbook A contains a
summary and analysis of recent economic and financial developments in the United States
and foreign economies as well as the Board staff’s economic forecast. The staff also provides
model-based simulations of a number of alternative scenarios highlighting upside and down-
side risks to the baseline forecast. Examples of such scenarios include a decline in the price of
oil, a rise in the value of the dollar or wage growth that is stronger than the one built into the
baseline forecast. These scenarios are generated using one or more of the Board’s
macroeconomic models, including the DSGE models, SIGMA and EDO.11 Tealbook A also
contains estimates of future outcomes in which the Federal Reserve Board uses alternative
monetary policy rules as well model-based estimates of optimal monetary policy. According
to Fischer (2017), DSGE models play a central, though not exclusive, role in this process.
Tealbook B provides an analysis of specific policy options for the consideration of the FOMC
at its meeting. According to Fischer (2017), “Typically, there are three policy alternatives - A,

B, and C - ranging from dovish to hawkish, with a centrist one in between.” The key point is
that DSGE models, along with other approaches, are used to generate the quantitative
implications of the specific policy alternatives considered.

The Federal Reserve System is not the only policy institution that uses DSGE models. For
example, the European Central Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Bank of Israel, the
Czech National Bank, the Sveriges Riksbank, the Bank of Canada, and the Swiss National Bank
all use such models in their policy process.12

We just argued that DSGE models are used to run policy simulations in various policy
institutions. The results of those simulations are useful to the extent that the models are
empirically plausible. One important way to assess the plausibility of a model is to consider
its real time forecasting performance. Cai, Del Negro, Giannoni, Gupta, Li, and Moszkowski
(2018) compare real-time forecasts of the New York Fed DSGE model with those of various
private forecasters and with the median forecasts of the Federal Open Market Committee
members. The DSGE model that they consider is a variant of Christiano, Motto and Rostagno
(2014) that allows for shocks to the demand for government bonds. Cai et al. find that the
model-based real time forecasts of inflation and output growth are comparable to that of
private forecasters. Strikingly, the New York Fed DSGE model does a better job at forecasting
the slow recovery than the Federal Open Market Committee, at least as judged by the root
mean square errors of their median forecasts. Cai et al. argue that financial frictions play a
critical role in allowing the model to anticipate the slow growth in output after the financial
crisis.

In sum, DSGE models play an important role in the policymaking process. To be clear: they do
not substitute for judgement, nor should they. In any event, policymakers have voted with
their collective feet on the usefulness of DSGE models. In this sense, they are meeting the
market test.

7     A Brief Response to the Critics
In this section we briefly respond to some recent critiques of DSGE models. We focus on
Stiglitz (2017) because his critique is well-known and representative of popular criticisms.

                                        Econometric Methods
Stiglitz claims that “Standard statistical standards are shunted aside [by DSGE modelers].” As
evidence, he cites four points from what he refers to as Korinek (2017)’s “devastating
critique” of DSGE practitioners. The first point is:

         “...the time series employed are typically detrended using methods such
      as the HP filter to focus the analysis on stationary fluctuations at business
      cycle frequencies. Although this is useful in some applications, it risks
      throwing the baby out with the bathwater as many important macroeconomic
      phenomena are non-stationary or occur at lower frequencies.” Stiglitz (2017,
      page 3).

Neither Stiglitz nor Korinek offer any constructive advice on how to address the difficult
problem of dealing with nonstationary data. In sharp contrast, the DSGE literature struggles
mightily with this problem and adopts different strategies for modeling non-stationarity in
the data. As a matter of fact, Stiglitz and Korinek’s first point is simply incorrect. The vast bulk
of the modern DSGE literature does not estimate models using HP filtered data.

DSGE models of endogenous growth provide a particularly stark counterexample to Korinek
and Stiglitz’s claim that modelers focus the analysis on stationary fluctuations at business
cycle frequencies. See for example Comin and Gertler (2006)’s analysis of medium-term
business cycles.

Second, Stiglitz reproduces Korinek (2017)’s assertion:

          “.... for given detrended time series, the set of moments chosen to
      evaluate the model and compare it to the data is largely arbitrary—there is
      no strong scientific basis for one particular set of moments over another”.
      Stiglitz (2017, page 3).

Third, Stiglitz also reproduces the following assertion by Korinek (2017):

         “... for a given set of moments, there is no well-defined statistic to measure
      the goodness of fit of a DSGE model or to establish what constitutes an
      improvement in such a framework”. Stiglitz (2017, page 4).

These criticisms might have been appropriate in the 1980s. But, they simply do not apply to
modern analyses, which use full information maximimum likelihood or generalized method
of moments.


                                                23
                                        Financial Frictions

Stiglitz (2017) asserts that pre-crisis DSGE models did not allow for financial frictions or
liquidity-constrained consumers. This claim is incorrect. Consider the following counter
examples.

Galí et al. (2007) investigate the implications of the assumption that some consumers are
liquidity constrained. Specifically, they assume that a fraction of households cannot borrow
at all. They then assess how this change affects the implications of DSGE models for the effects
of a shock to government consumption. Not surprisingly, they find that liquidity constraints
substantially magnify the impact of government spending on GDP.

Carlstrom and Fuerst (1997) and Bernanke et al. (1999) develop DSGE models that incorporate
credit market frictions w h i c h g i v e r i s e a “financial accelerator” in which credit markets
work to amplify and propagate shocks to the macroeconomy.

Christiano et al. (2003) add several features to the model of Christiano et al. (2005) to
allow for richer financial markets. First, they incorporate the fractional reserve banking
model developed by Chari et al. (1995). Second, they allow for financial frictions as
modeled by Bernanke et al. (1999) and Williamson (1987). In addition, they assume that
agents can only borrow using nominal non-state contingent debt, so that the model
incorporates the Fisherian debt deflation channel.

Finally, we note that Iacoviello (2005) develops and estimates a DSGE model with nominal
loans and collateral constraints tied to housing values. This paper is an important antecedent
to the large post-crisis DSGE literature on the aggregate implications of housing market
booms and busts.

Stiglitz (2017, p. 12) also writes:

          “...an adequate macro model has to explain how even a moderate shock has
      large macroeconomic consequences.”


The post-crisis DSGE models cited in section 5.1 provide explicit counter examples to this
claim.

Stiglitz (2017) also asserts that DSGE models abstract from interest rate spreads. He writes (p.
10): “...in standard models...all that matters is that somehow the central bank is able to
control the interest rate. But, the interest rate is not the interest rate confronting
households and firms; the spread between the two is a critical endogenous variable.”

Pre-crisis DSGE models like those in Williamson (1987), Carlstrom and Fuerst (1997), Chari et
al. (1995) and Christiano et al. (2003) and post-crisis DSGE model like Gertler and Karadi
(2011), Jermann and Quadrini (2012), Curdia and Woodford (2010) and Christiano et al.
(2014) are counterexamples to Stiglitz (2017)’s assertions. In all those papers, which are only
                                                24
 a subset of the relevant literature, credit and the endogenous spread between the interest
 rates confronting households and firms play central roles.


                                Nonlinearities and Lack of Policy Advice
Stiglitz (2017, p. 7) writes:
           “...the large DSGE models that account for some of the more realistic features
       of the macroeconomy can only be ‘solved’ for linear approximations and small
       shocks — precluding the big shocks that take us far away from the domain over
       which the linear approximation has validity.”

Stiglitz (2017, p. 1) also writes:
       “...the inability of the DSGE model to...provide policy guidance on how to deal
       with the consequences [of the crisis], precipitated current dissatisfaction with
       the model.”


 The papers cited in section 5.2 and the associated literatures are clear counterexamples to
 Stiglitz’s claims. So too is the simple fact that policy institutions continue to use DSGE models
 as part of their policy process.


                                         Heterogeneity
 Stiglitz (2017)’s critique that DSGE models do not include heterogeneous agents. He writes:
           “... DSGE models seem to take it as a religious tenet that consumption should
       be explained by a model of a representative agent maximizing his utility over an
       infinite lifetime without borrowing constraints.” (Stiglitz, 2017, page 5).
 This view is obviously at variance with the cutting-edge research in DSGE models (see section
 5.3).

 DSGE models will become better as modelers respond to informed criticism. Stiglitz’s
 criticisms are not informed.




8       Conclusion
 The DSGE enterprise is an organic process that involves the constant interaction of data and
 theory. Pre-crisis DSGE models had shortcomings that were highlighted by the financial crisis
 and its aftermath. Substantial progress has occurred since then. We have emphasized the
 incorporation of financial frictions and heterogeneity into DSGE models.

 Because of space considerations, we have not reviewed exciting work on deviations from
 conventional rational expectations. These deviations include k-level thinking, robust control,
                                             25
social learning, adaptive learning and relaxing the assumption of common knowledge.
Frankly, we do not know which of these competing approaches will play a prominent role in
the next generation of mainstream DSGE models.

Will the future generation of DSGE models predict the time and nature of the next crisis?
Frankly we doubt it. As far as we know there is no sure, time-tested way of foreseeing the
future. The proximate cause of the financial crisis was a profession-wide failure to observe
the growing size and leverage of the shadow-banking sector. DSGE models are evolving in
response to that failure as well as to the ever-growing treasure trove of micro data available
to economists. We don’t know yet exactly where that process will lead to. But we do know
that DSGE models will remain central to how macroeconomists think about aggregate
phenomena and policy. There is simply no credible alternative to policy analysis in a world of
competing economic forces operating on different parts of the economy.
