                                     ABSTRACT



     There is substantial evidence from the literature on individual wage

determination that length of service to the firm is an important determinant

of earnings and thus of labor productivity, holding constant employee at-

tributes such as age, sex, and education. Earnings growth associated with

increased tenure is usually interpreted as a reflection of firm—specific

on—the—job training (OJT). In this paper a model of producer technology

consistent   with the hypothesis of firm—specific OJT is formulated and
estimated. Empirical implementation of the model on data for U.S. manu-
facturing provides the basis for estimation of the marginal productivity
of workers classified by length of service to the firm, i.e., of the tenure—
productivity   profile. The parameter estimates also enable us to determine

the effect of recent changes in the tenure distribution (due to changes in

labor turnover behavior) on manufacturing productivity performance.

     Recent studies in the literature on individual wage determination

reveal that tenure is an important determinant of earnings, holding con-

stant the employee's total amount of work experience, education, and

personal characteristics such as sex and race- The significance of tenure

in earnings equations is generally interpreted as providing support for

the hypothesis that a substantial fraction of the skills acquired by

workers via on—the—job training (OJT) are firm—specific. It is true

that the high partial correlation between earnings and tenure may be

partly spurious——an artifact of unobserved worker heterogeneity.2 But

the strong association between earnings and tenure is not destoyed by

attempts to control for heterogeneity. For example, wage regressions

estimated by Mincer and Jovanovic3 on two different samples——the National

Longitudinal Survey sample of young men, and the Michigan Income Dynamics

sample of men of all ages——in which an attempt is made to control for

heterogeneity, suggest that more than half of skills acquired on the job

are firm—specific. According to their parameter estimates, a typical

worker would have increased his current hourly earnings more by moving to

his current job a year earlier (holding total time in the labor force

constant) than he would have by entering the labor force a year earlier

(holding time in the current job constant).

     The role of specific OJT as a determinant of worker productivity is

recognized to be of even greater importance when one considers the fact

that the tenure coefficient in wage equations captures merely the worker's

private return to investment in firm—specific skills, not the social

return. According to the theory of OJT, the costs and returns of specific

investment are shared (in theoretically indeterminate proportions) by worker

and firm. This implies that the rate of growth of wages paid to the worker

as he accumulates skills will be lower than the rate of growth of his
marginal productivity (MP), which reflects the combined return to

employer and worker. By the nature of the case, the wage equation frame-

work is incapable of providing an estimate of the social return to specific

training; what it can, in principle, provide——assuming that the hetero-

geneity problem can be solved, arguably a heroic assumption——is a lower—

bound estimate of the growth of MP attributable to training.

     Although there is ample evidence that firm—specific training contri-

butes significantly to the productivity of labor resources, the specific

training hypothesis has not been integrated or reflected in empirical

analyses of production behavior. Failure to account for specific training

in the analysis of production activity is striking because OJT is, by

definition, integral with the process of production. (Of course, it is the

very integration of the two activities that is the source of many of the

measurement problems associated with training; the process of human capital

formation is "submerged" within production.) Failure to acknowledge the

presence of training in this context is unfortunate in several respects.

First, information about the level and structure of training costs and

returns, which cannot be obtained by any other approach, may be lost.

Second, the representation of technology will, in general, be misspecified,

possibly resulting in distorted estimates of parameters characterizing the

structure of production. The distortion arises from an attempt to isolate

for purposes of analysis two activities (training and production) which

economic agents have found appropriate or efficient to combine. Finally,

the direct analysis of production behavior offers an alternative to wage

equation estimation for the investigation of training issues.

     The objective of this research is to formulate and estimate a model

of producer technology consistent with the hypothesis of firm—specific OJT.



                                —2—
The model is implemented empirically using data for the U.S. manufacturing

sector. Firm—specific training is often thought to play a particularly

important role in the market for manufacturing production workers4, who

comprise roughly seventy percent of manufacturing employment. Estimation

of the model enables us to perform tests of the training hypothesis and to

obtain estimates of parameters which identify the tenure—MP profile. More—

over, the implications of specific training for productivity trends in

manufacturing may be assessed.

     This paper is organized as follows. In Section I, the general form

of a model of technology consistent with the specific training hypothesis

is developed. This model is compared and contrasted to two other general

classes of production models which have been specified by previous

investigators. In Section II, a specific functional form and estimation

procedure are selected, estimation results are presented and hypothesis

tests performed. Problems of statistical inference associated with the

empirical analysis of firm—specific training are discussed in Section III.


                                      I



     The essence of the OJT hypothesis is that firms utilize current

employed resources to augment the future MP of employees. Consequently,

the appropriate representation of the technology of an enterprise which

engages in OJT is a multi—product model of production. Such enterprises

produce intangible investment in human capital as well as ordinary output,

using a stock of human capital (the sum of depreciated past investments)

and other resources. The production possibility frontier (PPF) character-

izing the technology may be written in general, implicit form as

               F(Q,IHC,K,SHC,A) = 0                              (1)

     where     Q =   quantity   of ordinary output
             IHC =   quantity   of investment in human capital


                                     —3—
                K =   quantity   of physical capital input
              SHC =   quantity   (stock) of human capital
                A =   index   of technology

Assume for simplicity that all training is firm—specific. Evolution of the

stock of human capital is determined by past investments in OJT according to

the "perpetual inventory" equation

                SHC(t) =   I IHC(x)     exp[—k(t—x)1 dx        (2)

where k is the (presumed constant) depreciation rate of human capital.

This depreciation rate reflects the separations behavior of trained employees

as well as the effects of skill atrophy.

     This model of production is formally identical to that formulated by

Christensen, Jorgenson, and Lau5 to describe the PPF of the entire economy.

They represent the aggregate production frontier by

                F(C,I,K,L,A) = 0                               (3)


     where      C =   quantity   of consumption goods output
                I =   quantity   of investment goods output
                K =   quantity   of capital input
                L =   quantity   of labor input
                A =   index   of technology

K and I are related by an accumulation equation similar to (2). Just as

physical capital is a produced means of production at the level of the total

economy, so are specific skills produced means of production at the enter-

prise level. In both cases, past decisions to allocate resources to the

production of one output in favor of the other condition the current

availability of inputs. Also, less—than—full utilization of resources

weakens the tradeoff between (human or physical) capital formation and current

production.

     Conventional specifications of technology abstract from firms' produc-

tion and utilization of specific human capital. The PPF is written as

                F(Q,K,L,A) = 0                                 (4)


     where      L =   total   manhours employed

It is instructive to compare the index of total factor productivity (TFP)


                                       —4—
consistent with the "misspecified" technology (4) with the index consistent

with the "true" technology (1). This comparison enables us to determine the

direction and magnitude of biases in TFP measurements based on the maintained

hypothesis that (4) represents the structure of production.

     The rate of growth of TFP is defined as follows:

                  (PIP) =w               —v (x/x)                        (5)

    where            P = total   factor productivity
                     Y quantity of i—th output i =            1,.. .,N
                         share of i—th ouput in value of total output
                     X3 quantity of j—th input    j       = l,...,M
                     v share of j—th input in value of total input

and dotted variables indicate differentiation with respect to time. As

Jorgenson and Griliches6 have shown, if the production function is charac-

terized by constant returns to scale, and if the necessary conditions for

producer equilibrium——all marginal rates of transformation between pairs of

inputs and outputs are equal to the corresponding (shadow) price ratios——

are satisfied, this definition of TFP measures the "shift" in the production

frontier. The definition of TFP       applied   to (1) yields

        (P/P) =             + wIHc(IHC/IHC) — vK(K/K) — vSHC(SHC/SHC)          (6)
                  wQ(Q/Q)
The definition of TFP corresponding to the null hypothesis of no specific

training (i.e., equation (4)) is

                  (P'/P') = (QIQ) -             -
                                      vK(K/K)       vL(L/L)              (7)

The bias in conventional productivity accounting is equal to the difference

between (7) and (6):

        (P'/P') —    (PIP) = wIHc{(Q/Q) — (IHC/IHC)] —
                                                       — (SHC/SHC)]      (8)
                                            vL[(L/L)
We have used the condition that         =           i.e. that the share of labor in
                                            VSHC,
total input cost equals the share of human capital. It is convenient to

rewrite (8) as


                                      —5—
     (p'/p') —   (Pip)   =   v([d ln(SHC/L)]/dT)   —
                                                       wIHc([d ln(IHC/Q)]/dT) (9)
Equation (9) reveals that the conventiot1!i measure of the rate of growth of

TFP overstates the true measure when the growth rate of the stock of human

capital exceeds the growth rate of manhours, i.e., when the stock of human

capital per manhour, or "labor quality", is increasing. The overstatement

is highethe larger is labor's share in total input cost. The conventional

measure understates the true measure when the wth rate of human capital

investment exceeds the growth rate of output. The understatement is greater

the higher is the share of human capital investment in the total (shadow)

value of the firm's production—cum—training activity. The analysis which

follows   suggests that [(Q/Q) — (I}iC/IHC)] and [(L/L) —       (SHC/SHC)]   will
generally have opposite signs at any given moment, implying that the two
sources   of bias will be reinforcing rather than offsetting. The hypothesis

that they have opposite signs is consistent with the notion of an "equil-

ibrium" skill distribution, which the firm attempts to maintain by acceler-

ating training investment when labor quality declines and vice versa.

     Although the multi—product formulation (1) is useful in enabling us to

assess potential biases attending conventional productivity measures, it

cannot provide a basis for empirical research, since investment in firm—

specific training, and hence the stock of human capital, are not directly

observable. Development of a model of training—cum—production capable of

 empirical implementation requires us to make an assumption about the

 determinants of training activity. A hypothesis about the determinants

 of the firm's "demand" for training may enable us to identify the path of

 training investment and the stock of human capital. It is therefore postulated

 that the typical firm has a "standard training program," which consists of

 a sequence of investments in an employee undertaken at specified points in

 his career within the enterprise. In other words, the firm is committed


                                        —6—
to provide certain training investments as the worker accumulates years of

service. The notion of a standard training program abstracts from

variation in investment activity which might arise due to such factors as

differences in learning ability among new entrants and the stage of the

business cycle. The implications of individual variation in the intensity

of investment will be considered in Section III.

      Under the standard training program hypothesis, both the current level

of an employee's MI' and his rate of investment in OJT are indexed by his

length of service (LOS) to the enterprise, or tenure. Similarly, the

distribution of employees by length of service determines both the marginal

productivity of total labor input and the rate of aggregate training invest-

ment; i.e., it determines both the stock and the flow of specific human

capital. If the training program is characterized by a monotone decreasing

(with tenure) rate of investment in the typical employee——a policy consistent

with standard models of optimal human capital accumulation——and there is no

depreciation of skills, individual MP—tenure profiles will be monotone

increasing and concave. As the distribution of employees shifts in the

direction of lower tenure, the stock of specific human capital per worker

falls, and the flow of training investment per worker rises.

       The production possibility frontier of an enterprise which has a

standard training program may be approximated by

                 F(Q,K,L1,L2,. .   . ,L,A)   = 0                  (9)
      where     L1 = employment in the i—th length—of—service category
                        I =   l,2,...,N
In   principle, this formulation captures all relevant information concerning
the firm's past and     current training investments. Estimates of NP by

tenure   group may be   interpreted as ordinates of the tenure—NP profile, and
thus enable us to determine the position and slope of the profile. The

height of the profile at any given length of service indicates the contri-

bution to the stock of human capital by a worker with that length of service,

                                          —7—
and the slope of the profile indicates the rate of investment in the

worker.

     We therefore propose to estimate a model of producer technology in

which labor is classified by length of service to the establishment. Before

turning to the discussion of estimation procedure and results, it is desir-

able to contrast this model with other models of disaggregated labor in

production. Previous investigators have estimated models of production——

either cost or production functions, or marginal productivity (first—order)

conditions derived from them——in which labor is classified by one or more

attributes postulated to determine marginal productivity. The most common

disaggregation criteria are age, occupation, and educational attainment of

workers. Although these models bear an obvious formal resemblance to a model

of the general form (9), these models are based on assumptions about the

operation of the labor market which are inappropriate to the analysis of

firm—specific training. These differences with respect to assumptions

about labor market structure are reflected in different research objectives.

     Previous analyses of labor disaggregated by characteristics such as

age, education, and occupation conventionally assume that the market for

each type of labor is competitive, i.e., the firm can hire all it wants

of each type of labor at an exogenously determined, constant wage rate.

Also, the firm is postulated to be in competitive equilibrium with respect

to each type of labor at every moment, equating the MP of each type to its

wage. The primary objective of these studies is to obtain estimates of

demand elasticities for and substitution elasticities among the different

categories of labor. Knowledge of these elasticities,4ould enable the

analyst to assess the effects on relative employment of policy— or other-

wise—induced changes in the relative prices of different types of labor and,

in some cases, capital.


                                 —8—
     The assumptions of the competitive labor market paradigm are appro-

priate to the analysis of the firm's demand for labor only if the skills

required for production are completely transferable across firms, i.e.,

only if all training is general. An alternative paradigm, that of the

internal labor market, is needed to account for the behavior of employment

and wages classified by skill when skill is a product of firm—specific

training and experience. The constraints on the wages and employment of

the various skill groups are fundamentally different when skills are

generated by the firm's own training activity than they are when skills

may be obtained on the external market. In the latter case, the firm is

presumably free of employment (quantity) constraints, being able to hire

arbitrary amounts of each type of labor in each period, but subject to N

price constraints, required to pay each type of labor its respective market—

determined wage. Where necessary skills are developed by firm—specific

training——and assuming that the quantity of training embodied in a worker

is determined by tenure——the firm operates under (N — 1) employment

constraints: the maximum currently available supply of workers with t years'

experience and training is limited by the number of entrants t years ago.

Only the level of employment of new workers is unconstrained in each period.

It is true that the firm can increase its supply of skilled workers in the

short run by accelerating the training and promotion of workers lower down

in the skill hierarchy, but it is often assumed7 that training is subject

to increasing instantaneous marginal costs, which means that it is more

expensive to upgrade workers rapidly than slowly. This suggests that the

need for workers with different amounts of firm—specific training imparts

an intertemporal interdependence to hiring and employment decisions, in

contrast to the myopic (one—period) character of decisions to employ externally

available labor.


                                —9—
    There is also a sharp distinction between the postulated behavior of

wage rates classified by skill when skills are firm—specific and relative

wage behavior when skills are perfectly general. Because specific training

drives a wedge between a worker's NP and his opportunity wage, producers are

not constrained by the external market to pay a worker a wage equal to

his NP at any particular point in his career. Competition among employers

for prospective trainees would function to constrain the expected present

value of wages over the worker's career to equal the expected present value

of his NP. Rather than operating under a regime of N wage constraints——one

for each job classification in the skill hierarchy——the employer operates

under two broad constraints, one on the level and one on the slope of the

wage profile. The height of the profile must be high enough to attract an

adequate quantity and quality of new entrants; and the rate of growth of wages

must be sufficient to encourage the worker to accept training and promotions.

Changes in external labor market conditions may force employers to adjust

the general level of wages, but not the relative wage structure. It is often

argued in the personnel management/industrial relations literature that

employers seek to maintain stable relative wages within the internal labor

market in order to promote a sense of fairness among employees. There

is evidence that relative (occupational) wage rates among manufacturing

production jobs are extremely stable.

     The estimation of static, technical elasticities of substitution and

demand——the principal objective of previous analyses of disaggregated labor

in production——is not the goal of the present research, nor is the economic

 significance of such parameters clear in a labor market characterized by

 intertemporal constraints on the supply of various skills and relative wages

which do not reflect relative marginal productivity and are not exogenous

 to employers.

                                  —10—
                                    II

        In   this section we formulate and estimate an econometric model of

producer technology——a cost function——in which labor is classified by length

of service. The estimation procedure to be implemented requires that we

adopt the maintained hypothesis of weak separability between labor and non—

labor    inputs. Separability constrains the marginal rate of substitution
between      any two types of labo]74:o be independent of the level of nonlabor

inputs, and the elasticity of substitution between any nonlabor input and

labor to be the same for all types of labor. It is generally not desirable

to impose separability restrictions a priori. When the labor separability

hypothesis has been subjected to test in previous studies of disaggregated

labor in production, it has usually been rejected. The "stylized fact" is

that more highly skilled labor and capital are complementary inputs, and

both are substitutes for unskilled labor in production.8 Evidently, the

potential bias of parameter estimates arising from inappropriate imposition

of the separability restriction is attenuated if the technology is

specified to have the translog form. According to Chinloy9, the translog

function has the property of "approximate consistency in aggregation. This

implies that little error arises from a two—stage construction of value—

added by forming subaggregates of labor and nonlabor inputs, and subsequently

aggregating the two. This vitiates in large part any error from incorrect

aggregation if separability does not obtain."

    Under the maintained hypothesis of separability, there exists a consistent

aggregate index of labor input. it is convenient to begin specification of

the production model with the labor input index. It is assumed that this

index, denoted L*, is a translog index of its arguments:
             *   (I
     in L =B in L + (l/2)w in L1 in L                               (10)

Symmetry and homogeneity constraints are imposed on (10). Symmetry implies

that w =     wj,       for i,j =             1,.. .,N.         Parameter restrictions implied by linear

homogeneity, which ensures that an x percent change in the labor services of

each group yields an x percent change in total labor input, are

     The overall structure of production is represented by a translog cost

function, which relates the minimum cost, C, of producing a given level of

output, Q, to a vector of input prices, P, and an index of technology, T:
                                                           M

Allowing for nonzero g permits us to test for nonneutrai technical change.

 Differentiating the cost function with respect to in h' and imposing the

 symmetry    condition g = gh                      (h,k =       1,... ,M)   we obtain a system of M equations:

                                                           —12—

By Shephard's lemma (which applies to arbitrary cost functions),

        (a C)/(ci                 =
                                      Xh
where          denotes quantity of input h. Hence

        ( in        C)/(a in               =       ( C/ Ph) (Ph/C) =   Xh
                                                                            (Ph/C) = Sh           (15)

where Sh is the share of input h in totai cost. Under the maintained

hypothesis of cnstant returns to scale, the following restrictions on the

cost function parameters obtain:
       M
           ah
                =    1;          g =       0

These restrictions enable us to eliminate (for example) the Mth equation

and g from the remaining (M — 1) equations in (14). The resulting

system of equations may then be written
                          '1-l
       Sh = ah                   g (Ph/PM) +                 T               h =   1,... ,M—1    (16)

Estimation of the parameters of the cost function by (16) requires data on

the price of each factor of production. To maintain a consistent accounting

framework, the (implicit) price of each factor is defined as the ratio of

total expenditure on the factor, Ch, to factor quantity:

           =                                                                                    (17)
                Ch/Xh
Thus

                                                                                                 (18)
       inPhlnCh_lnXh
The price of labor corresponding to the quantity index of labor input is

       ln PL* =           ln     CL —   in     L*                                                (19)

This is related to the conventional definition of the price of labor, labor

cost per hour worked                               by

       in PL* =           ln L — in            Z                                                 (20)

Clearly, our measure of labor quality determines how given total expenditure

on labor input is divided into price and quantity components. By evaluating

the time derivative of (20), it is evident that the change in the price of a

unit of labor equals the change in the price per manhour minus the change

                                                         —13—
in labor quality (input per manhour). If labor quality increases (decreases)

over time, cost per unit of input has been falling (rising) relative to cost

per manhour.

     The appropriate measure of the price of labor to be included in the

cost function and derived factor share equations is PL*, since this indexes

the cost to the firm of employing a unit of labor of constant quality.

Moreover, PL* is more likely than            to be exogenous to producer behavior,

since the latter is affected by changes in employment mix as well as changes

in group—specific wage rates.

     For purposes of empirical analysis, the cost function was specified

to be of the value—added or net output variety: output is defined as value

added, and only primary factor (capital and labor) prices are included in

the cost function. It is well known          that   a value—added specification

is based on the maintained hypothesis of strong separability between primary

and intermediate (energy and materials) inputs. The separability hypothesis

has been subjected to statistical tests and decisively rejected in recent

econometric work. Unfortunately, the data required to generalize the

model to include intermediate inputs were not available for this investigation.

     In a two—factor setting, the system of input share equations (16) reduces

to a single equation:

          SL =        +                   +         T                            (21)
                 aL       ln(PL*/
Substituting for in PL* =     in    —   in    Z and using the expression (12) for

in Z, we obtain the estimating equation

          SL = aL     +
                              [in(PL/
                                              -
                                                  ln(LN/L)]   —B ln(LI) -
                 (1/2)        w(2 in L1 in L -          (in   L)2 -   (in   L.)2)]
                                                                             J
                                                                                        (22)

Ordinary least squares estimation of (22) yields simultaneous estimates of

the parameters of the labor input (or labor quality) index and cost function

parameters. The equation is exactly identified: the coefficient on the

                          —
difference [ln(PL/            ln(LN/ L)j equals g, the coefficient on in(L/ L)
                                        —i4—
equals       and so forth.

     Equation (22) was estimated using quarterly observations on the durable

and nondurable sectors of U.S. manufacturing for the period 196101 to 197604.

Because no regular time—series data on employment classified by job tenure

are available, it was necessary to construct estimates of these series using

"new hires" data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' labor turnover survey,

in conjunction with job tenure data collected periodically in the Current

Population Survey. These sources and the assumptions underlying the

construction of the tenure—group series are documented in the Appendix.

In a nutshell, a perpetual inventory algorithm was developed, and the esti-

mate of the number of employees with n periods' tenure in period t is

proportional to the number of new hires in period t—n. The available

data sources dictated, to a certain extent, the specific partitioning of

employees into tenure groups. After experimenting with several alternative

partitionings, disaggregation into three mutually exclusive and exhaustive

categories——employees with 0—6 months',7—24 months', and 25 or more months'

tenure in the current establishment——was adopted. Further disaggregation

tended to generate unstable estimates of the parameters of the labor

input index, evidently as a consequence of multicollinearity among the

constructed tenure—group series. Together, the three groups account for

roughly a third of employment, on the average.

     Three variants of equation (22) were estimated for each of the two

sectors. All equations were estimated using the Cochrane—Orcutt adjustment

for serial correlation of residuals. The estimation results are presented

in Tables l—D (durables) and 1—N (nondurables). Model III represents the

unrestricted form of the labor share equation, corresponding to the translog

index of labor input (linear homogeneity and symmetry imposed). Model II

corresponds to a Cobb—Douglas labor input index, in which all second—order

terms (w12, w13, w23) are constrained to equal zero. Model I corresponds to

the null hypothesis of no specific OJT, since the price of labor is defined

as labor cost per manhour; this hypothesis implies the following restriction

on the parameters of the Cobb—Douglas index:

          B ln(L1/L3) + B2 ln(L2/L3) + ln(L3/L) = 0

To test the hypotheses that (1) the labor index is Cobb—Douglas, and

(2) labor input is equivalent to total manhours, we performed F—tests on

the three specifications. This consists of calculating the change in the

sum of squared residuals from imposing restrictions; dividing this change

by the sum of squared residuals of the unrestricted equation; and dividing

numerator and denominator of this ratio by the appropriate number of degrees

of freedom (number of parameter restrictions and residual degrees of freedom,

respectively). The resulting test statistic is distributed, asymptotically,

as F(v1,v2), where v1 is the numerator degrees of freedom and v2 is the

denominator degrees of freedom. Performing the test for Models II and III

indicates that we cannot reject the hypothesis of a Cobb—Douglas index,

in favor of the more general translog specification, for either sector.

F(3,55) = 1.29 for durables and 0.28 for nondurables; the critical value

of F(3,55) at the .95 level of significance is 2.78. Imposing the Cobb—

Douglas restrictions results in a neg1igibläecrease in the fraction of

variance explained by the independent variables.

     The hypothesis that labor input is equivalent to total manhours is

decisively rejected for both sectors. The test statistic F(2,58) equals

7.87 for durables and 28.6 for nondurables, compared to a critical value

of 5.03 at the .99 significance level. Besides providing superior overall

goodness of fit, Model II yields estimates of individual parameters

considerably lower in variance than does Model I. Except in the case of

the capital—labor substitution parameter (g =      —g)   for nondurables,

the differences between point estimates of the parameters common to Models


                                —18—
I and II were not statistically significant. This suggests that failure to

include information about the tenure distribution in the specification of

technology does not result in seriously distorted estimates of parameters

characterizing the technology.

marginal productivity estimates in detail, we consider the behavior of the

cost function implicit in our estimates of equation (22). In order to

qualify as a well—behaved neoclassical cost function, a cost function must

have the properties of monotonicity and convexity. The translog function

does not satisfy these conditions globally; we therefore check to establish

that they are satisfied for the sample space on which the model is estimated.

A sufficient condition for monotonicity to obtain is that the fitted cost

shares for all factors be positive in each period. This condition is satis-

fied for all variants of the model for both sectors (fitted values are not

reported here). Convexity of the cost function is guaranteed if the own—

price elasticity of demand for each factor is negative. Own—demand

elasticities and Allen partial elasticities of substitution are related to

estimated model parameters as follows:

            ED =   (g/s)     + s — 1                i =   L,K

            ES =    (/(sj.s)) + 1                 i,j =   L,K;   i   j


            ES . = (g. + 2 — s.)/s.2                i =   L,K
              ii     ii  1    1   1
    where      =   fitted   value of share of factor i in total cost

            EDi = own—price elasticity of demand for factor i

         ES = Allen     elasticity of substitution between factors i and j

Estimates of ES and ED. vary, with s. and s.,, over the sample period; convexity

was satisfied in each period. Estimates of the substitution and demand

elasticities implied by Models I and II, for the first, middle, and last

quarter of the period, are presented in Table 2. Although the estimates

are well—behaved, the substitution and demand elasticities are quite small,

point estimate of the elasticity of demand for labor is of the order —0.3.

have not been able to determine why the estimated elasticities are substantially

smaller than one would expect.

       We turn now to the focal point of the empirical work, the analysis of

estimates of the parameters of the index of labor quality. The analysis

has two objectives. The first is to obtain estimates of the relative marginal

productivity of the three tenure groups of employees, and to perform

significance tests on the estimated productivity differentials. The second

is to examine the behavior of the labor quality index over time, and to

consider the implications of the latter for trends in aggregate labor

productivity.

       Since labor input is postulated to be weakly separable from nonlabor

inputs, comparisons of the marginal productivity of the three tenure groups

may be made entirely in terms of the labor index parameters. The elasticity

of output with respect to the quantity of the i—th group's labor services is

          in Q)/(d   ln   L) =   (( in Q)/( lnL) (( lnL*)/( in L1)) =
                  ((c) in Q)/(inL)(B1 +wJ in
                                             L)
The output elasticity measures the percentage change in output attributable

to a one percent change in L. The marginal product of L1, i.e., the absolute

change in output resulting from a unit (one manhour) change in L1, is obtained

by multiplying the elasticity by the average product, QIL1:

      MP =   ((din   Q)/(c1lnL*))(Q/L1)(B +Wj in L)
Hence the ratio of the marginal productivity of group i to that of group k is

      'ik =   i'k         =
                              [(Bk +iw1 ln L)/(Bk +/Wkj in L)](Lk/Ll)
                                    J
This reduces to (Bi/Bk)(Lk/Lj) in the Cobb—Oougias case.

ratios of the marginal productivities of each of the two "junior" groups

to   that of the "senior" employees——were computed for each quarter for the
Cobb—Douglas variant of       the labor index   (Model II). For the nondurabies

                                        —21—
sector, the inequalities 0 < RMP13 < RMP23 . 1 were satisfied in every quarter.

These inequalities also held in all quarters for durable goods industries,

with the exception of three quarters in which R}1P23 slightly exceeded unity.

In order to obtain summary measures of the relative marginal productivity

of the three tenure groups, sample means of RNP13 and RNP23 were calculated.

These are presented in the top panel of Table 3.These figures may be inter-

preted to signify that, for example, workers with 0—6 months1 tenure in

durable goods industries are 24.0 percent as productive, on the average,

as workers with over two years' experience in their current establishment.

Although the magnitudes of the marginal productivity ratios constitute

presumptive evidence of the unequal contributions (per manhour) of the

various tenure groups, formal tests of the statistical significance of the

productivity differentials were conducted. The (absolute) difference in

marginal productivity between two tenure groups is proportional to

                        —
      DMP1. =
                (B/L)       (B/L.)
Since this is a linear combination of normally distributed variables with

known variances and covariance, calculation of the t—ratio of DMP is

straightforward. T—ratios were calculated for the two pairs of "adjacent"

tenure groups, i.e., groups 1 and 2, and groups 2 and 3. :For the durables.

sector, DMP12 was significantly greater than zero at the 97.5 percent level

(t(64) =   2.00) in 41 quarters (out of 64); DMP23 was significantly greater
than zero in 33 quarters. For nondurables, DMP12 was always sigfificantly

greater than zero, and DMP23 was in 43 quarters. Sample average t—values

are displayed in the bottom panel of Table 3; all pass the significance test

easily.

     Because workers with different amounts of tenure exhibit differences in

marginal productivity, variation in the tenure distribution of employees

induces variation in the average quality of utilized labor services. The

logarithm of the index of average labor quality corresponding to the Cobb—

The labor quality index was evaluated, using point estimates of B1 and B2,

for the sample interval 196101 to 197604. A time—series plot of a four—

quarter moving average of the index (normalized to unity in 196804) is shown

in Chart 1. Mi index of aggregate labor market tightness, Wachter's UGAP

measure, is also indicated. The chart shows that the durables and nondurables

quality indices exhibit marked and similar cyclical variation, although

the durables series is characterized by somewhat wider fluctuations. As

expected, labor quality moves countercyclicaily, rising as firms curtail

hiring in response to weakening sales, declining as firms dilute their

experienced workforces with new entrants during recoveries. Short—term

changes in labor input per manhour may be quite pronounced: labor quality

changed by as much as 12.9 percent in durables, and 11.4 percent in durables,

within six quarters.

     The secular behavior of labor quality has direct implications for long—

term trends in total factor productivity (see eq. (9),p. 6). Labor quality

tended to decline in both sectors over the sample period: the average

quarterly decline was —.048 percent in durables and —.107 percent in nondurables.

These figures correspond to cumulative reductions in quality of 3.3 percent

and 8.3 percent, respectively, over 16 years. To determine whether the

secular decline in quality was statistically significant, the logarithm of

labor quality was regressed on a time trend and a constant. The t—value of

the trend coefficient was 1.77 for durables and 5.46 for nondurables,

indicating significance at the .95 level (t(64) =    1.67).   Because both

beginning and ending quarters of the sample interval were periods at or near

cyclical troughs in macroeconomic activity, the average rates of change do

not appear to be seriously distorted by sample period definition; if anything,

the greater severity of the mid—Seventies/recession might produce an

    The estimates of the parameters of the index of labor
input enabled us to measure the MP of each of the various
tenure groups. In this section we discuss some problems
of attempting to make inferences about the shape of a
"representative individual" MP-profile from these estimates
of MP by tenure group. In essence, all of these problems of
inference are caused by the possibility of unobserved worker
heterogeneity, combined with a process of selection (by firms,
and/or self—selection by workers) which determines which
workers will accumulate tenure. It is likely that our
inability to control for various unobserved characteristics
results in an overestimate of the slope of the "representative
individuals " MP-profile by the derived relative marginal
productivity estimates. We shall consider the effect of two
"types" of heterogeneity: heterogeneity with respect to human
capital investments undertaken prior to employment in,current
firm, and heterogeneity with respect to the intensity of
investment within the current firm.
     Due to data limitations, labor input is classified by a
single characteristic -- length of service to the establishment
-- in the model of production underlying the empirical
investigation. The human capital theory of marginal productivity
determination implies that tenure is not the only attribute
which determines the user value of labor services. In
particular, education and general training acquired in
previous employment are usually postulated to augment the MP
of workers. In principle, if there are n characteristics which
determine the productivity of labor resources, a complete
n—way classification is required for the consistent measurement
of labor input. If the classification scheme is of less than
order n, and some of the attributes by which labor is not
classified are correlated with those by which it is classified,
estimated differences in MP between cells in the classification
will reflect differences in attributes not "controlled for".
There is an omitted classification criterion, analagous to an
omitted variable in regression analysis.


                         —27—
     Although it is not possible to cross-classify labor input
by tenure, previous experience, and education in our data set,
extraneous information concerning the correlation of tenure
with education and age (from which previous experience may be
inferred) may enable us to evaluate the influence of these
omitted criteria on the estimated productivity differentials.
Such information is available in the form of two-way classif i-
cations of employees by (1) tenure and education, and (2) tenure
and age, derived from the Current Population Survey. Estimates
of average educational attainment and average age of employees
in four lenght—of—service categories were calculated from
these crosstabs and are presented in Table . The first column
of the table indicates that there is no clear association
between tenure and educational attainment. This finding appears
to warrant rejection of the hypothesis that part of the estimated
returns (in the form of higher productivity) to increased tenure
should be attributed to differences in education across tenure
groups.
     In contrast to education, age exhibits a strong positive
association with tenure. Moreover, the differences in average
age between tenure groups always exceed the differences in
tenure (measured as differences between midpoints of the class
intervals). The implication is that workers with more tenure
in their current firm generally also have more previous work
experience. Rough estimates of differences in average age,
tenure, and previous work experience between "adjacent" tenure
groups are as follows:

    group              age          tenure     previous exper.
                   difference     difference    difference
7—12 m./0—6 m.       2.1 yrs.       0.5 yrs.       1.6 yrs.
13—24 m./7—12 m.     1.7            0.8            0.9
over 25 m./13—24 m. 10.6            5.3            5.3

It is likely, then, that workers with greater length of service
had higher endowments of general human capital, and higher MP,
at the time they entered the firm than workers with low tenure.
Viewed from a different perspective, workers with greater
previous experience are more likely to "survive" to advanced
service than those with less prior experience. These differences

in MP at time of entry would, in themselves, tend to cause the
estimated productivity differentials to overstate the returns
to specific training. However, this overstatement would be
attenuated if older, more experienced workers tend to invest
a smaller fraction of their time in specific OJT -- behavior
consistent with optimal life—cycle human capital accumulation.
The justification for this statement will be provided by the
following discussion, in which the implications of heterogeneity
with respect to the intensity of specific investment are
analyzed.
     The specification of our model of training-cum-production
was based on the hypothesis of a standard training program, i.e.
a sequence of training investments which is the same for all
entrants. Under this hypothesis, the estimates of MP by tenure
group reflect the slope of the (uniform across workers) tenure-
MP profile. Suppose we relax the assumption of uniform invest-
ment profiles, and assume that workers are free to choose among
a continuum of investment intensities, i.e. they may choose the
fraction of time at work to be devoted to investment. Now if
the probability that a worker would attain a given length of
service were independent of his intersity of investment, we
could still interpret our estimates of MP by tenure group as
indicating the "average" of the slopes of the various MP—tenure
profiles. But the assumption of independence has little appeal.
On the contrary: ceteris paribus, individuals with greater
expected completed length of service (CLS) -- for whatever
reason —— should devote more time to firm—specific investment.
In a cross—section of individuals, the people with higher tenure,
or uncompleted length of service, will tend to have higher CLS.
Thus, workers with higher tenure will have invested more intensively
at every point in their careers than individuals with lower tenure.
In the presence of heterogeneity with respect to investment
intensity, labor input should be classified by intensity of
specific investment as well as by its duration (tenure) in the
specification of labor input. Since intensity of investment is
an omitted classification criterion positively correlated with
tenure, the estimated returns to increased tenure capture the

                           —30—
returns to higher intensity as well. Similarly, omission of
the relevant but unobservable variable "intensity" in wage
equations leads to upwardly biased tenure coefficients.
     Although the intertsity on an individuals' investment is
unobservable, we have postulated that this intensity is deter-
mined by his expected CLS, which, in turn, is inversely related
to his probability of separation. Thus, if one could identify
an attribute or set of attributes of workers which indicated or
determined expected CLS (or the propensity to separate), this
could be used to "control" for heterogeneity in investment
behavior.
     Two recent studies have adopted the strategy of including
variables postulated to reflect separations propensity in
individual wage regressions in order to purge the tenure co-
efficients of the effects of heterogeneous. investment. Both
studies utilize longitudinal data and implicitly assume the
determinant of investment intensity to be stable over time, so
that past observations on the behavior of the individual can
be used to control for heterogeneity. Mincer and Jvanovic11
include a "previous mobility" variable, in addition to education
and linear and quadratic terms in both total work experience and
tenure, in log—wage regressions for NLS young men, NLS mature
men, and MID men of all ages. The effect on the tenure
coefficients of introducing the previous mobility variable into
the equation varied form sample to sample. In the young men's
sample, it had no effect: "Prior mobility is not related to
current wages and does not affect the tenure coefficients...
Appartly differences in early mobility of young men are not
indicative of future differences in specific capital investments
nor do thay capture differences in wage levels which are
positively related to the length of current tenure."12 Introduction
of the prior mobility variable into the regression for mature
men "cuts the linear (tenure) term in half and reduces its
signigicance,"suggesting that "repeated mobility at an advanced
stage of the life—cycle is an indicator of persistant turnover,
denoting little investment in human capital. ,,l3 As one might
                            •




expect, in the wage equation for MID men of all ages "the


                           —31—
inclusion of prior mobility variables reduces the tenure slope
by close to 20 percent." This implies tht"heterogeneity biases
the tenure — wage slope coefficient upward by about 25 percent."14
     Bartel and Borj as15 also estimate earnings functions on the
NLS mature men's data set, but they attempt to control for
heterogeneity with respect to specific investment behavior in a
different way. Instead of introducing an additional right—hand-
side variable to control for heterogeneity, they specify the
dependent variable to be         , where    is current earnings and
Y is imputed earnings in the first year of the life cycle. (The
initial--earnings imputation is made using data on initial occupa-
tion.) By analyzing wage growth rather than wage levels they claim
to "net out individual differences that are unobserved but affect
the individual s earnings throughout the life cycle. ,,l6Although
substituting lifetime wage growth for wage level in an earnings
equation probably does control for some aspects of unobserved
heterogeneity, it is not at all obvious that it controls for
characteristics which determine specific investment behavior;
controlling for previous mobility appears to be a superior
procedure for accomplishing this. Bartel and Borjas find that
tenure is a highly significant determinant of earnings growth
of mature men; that is, it is a highly significant determinant
of their current earnings, holding initial earnings constant.
Unfortunately, they don't report results for a comparable wage
level model, so it is not possible to assess the effect,the tenure
coefficient of controlling for initial earnings.
     The attempts by Mincer/Jovanovic and Bartel/Borjas to control
for unobserved variation in the intensity of specific investment
are implicitly based on the hypothesis that the differences
across individuals in characteristics which determine investment
behavior are permanent differences. To the extent that investment
heterogeneity is an artifact of permanent (or relatively stable)
differences in individual characteristics (e.g., tastes) ,   inclusion
of additional information in wage equations may help to attenuate
bias in tenure coefficients. But recent theoretical work by
Jovanovic17 suggests that an individuals' desired intensity of
investment may also be determined by sheer chance, i.e. by the

                            —32—
quality of his "match" with his current employer. This result
emerges from a model of permanent job separations in which the
intensity of on-the-job specific training and on—the—job search
are endogenous. Jovanovic assumes that there exists a nondegener-
ate distribution of a worker's productivity across different
employers, the nondegeneracy of this distrbution being due to
the assumption that the quality of the worker-firm match differs
across prospective matches. In his model, the quality of the
match determines the worker's productivity upon entering the firm.
Once employed, the worker devotes a fraction of his time, I, to
specific OJT and a fraction of his time, S, to on-the-job search.
These fractions are endogenous: the model determines the evolution
of 1(T) and S(T), where T indexes tenure on the current job. The
following equilibrium conditions are yielded by solution of the
model:(l)"Separation probabilities regarded as a function of job
tenureare uniformly lower for those who are well matched, for two
reasons: workers that are well matched spend less time searching
for alternative work, and when they do receive alternative offers,
they are less likely to accept them."18 (2) Well matched
individuals spend higher fractions of time investing (at any
tenure), because (by (1)) they have a lower probability of
future separation.
     This theory has disturbing implications for our ability to
control for heterogeneity of investment behavior in wage equations
or other applications. For the quality of the worker-firm match
is not merely unobservable; it is also likely to be uncorrelated
with any observable individual attribute.

     Construction of Length—of—service Distributions
         of Employees from Labor Turnover Data


    Empirical implementation of the model developed in this paper requires

time—series estimates of the length—of—service distribution of employment.

Regular time—series data on the tenure distribution are not available.

In the absence of such data, it is necessary to construct these series

using the perpetual inventory technique, by which means we attempt to

make inferences about the current tenure distribution on the basis of the

past history of the gross flow of workers into employment.

     The data base for the perpetual inventory algorithm includes monthly

data on the number of "new hires" in an industry, derived from the Bureau

of Labor Statistics' Labor Turnover survey. New hires are, for the most

part, "temporary or permanent additions to the employment roll of persons

who have never before been employed by the establishment." These employment

accessions are distinguished in the turnover survey from "rehires," i.e.,

additions to the roll of former employees recalled by the establishment.

     The tenure distribution of employees in an industry in period t is

related to the past hiring history of the industry by the following set of

identities:

          EMP(n,t) = NH(t—n) *       s(n,t)            n =   1,... ,w
   where EMP(n,t) = number of employees with n months' tenure in period t

              NH(t—n) = number of new hires in period t—n

               s(n,t) =   probability   that a worker hired in t—n will remain

                          employed   ("survive") until t
                    w = maximum observed length of service

it is evident from this set of equations that given the (known) path of new

hires, the problem of estimating tenure—distributions reduces to the problem

                                      -Al-
 of estimating the "survival probabilities" s(n,t).   Estimation of survival

 probabilities is feasible because, although regular series on the tenure

 distribution do not exist, direct observations of the distribution are

 available for five dates during the period 1963—1978. Under certain

assumptions concerning the survival probabilities and the observed

distributions, these data, in conjunction with the new hires data, enable us

to construct high—frequency series on employment classified by length of

service.

     The available distributions are based on responses of employed persons

to the question, "When did [respondent] start working at his present job

or business?," a supplementary question included in the Current Population

Surveys (CPS) of January 1963, 1966, 1968, 1973, and 1978. For wage and

salary workers (which include the vast majority of manufacturing workers),

"a job is defined as a continuous period of employment [as defined below]

with a single employer, even though a person may have worked at several

occupations while working for that employer." A period of employment is

considered "continuous" if there have been "no interruptions except for

vacations, temporary illness, strikes, short—term layoffs (less than 30

days), and similar temporary factors." A representative tenure distribution

(that of males employed in durable and nondurable manufacturing at the time

of the 1978 survey) is shown in Table A—l. As indicated, the class intervals

of the length—of—service distribution are 0—6 months, 7—12 months, 13—24

months, and so forth. The percentages of all employees (male and female)

in each of the first three class intervals, at each survey date, are

presented for the two sectors in Table A—2. Also shown are the average

tenure distributions, in which each cell is computed as the simple average

of the corresponding cells from the five survey tabulations.

     Two important assumptions were made to permit construction of a time—

series of tenure distributions. First, it was assumed that the survival

probabilities were independent of calendar time, i.e. that s(n,t) =               s(n)
for all n. This assumption is analagous to the common assumption of constant

depreciation rates in the construction of capital stock series. The second

assumption was that the average of the published CPS distributions represents

the average tenure distribution for the entire period spanned by the job

tenure surveys (January 1963 — January 1978). Because the surveys were

conducted at almost regular intervals throughout the period, and general

economic conditions varied considerably from one survey date to the next,

the average of these distributions should be a reasonable approximation

to the average length—of—service distribution for the entire period.

     Given these two assumptions, the estimation of survival probabilities

proceeds as follows. The number of employees with n months' tenure in

period t   is
             EMP(n,t) =   s(n)    NB(t—n)

and their share in total employment is

             SHR(n,t) =   (s(n)   *   N}i(t—n))     /   EMP(t)

  where         EMP(t) r.ENP(n,t)
The expected value of SHR(n,t) over the 1963—1978 period is assumed to be

equal to the corresponding average share in the CPS tabulations, CPS(n):

             E[SHR(n,t)] =   E[(s(n)     *   N(t—n))       /   EMP(t)] = CPS(n)

where E[ I      represents the mathematical expectation operator. Factoring out
s(n), which is assumed constant, and rearranging terms,

             s(n) = CPS(n) / E[NR(t—n) /            EMP(t)}
This was the equation used to calculate the survival probabilities. In a

sense, this procedure consists in benchmarking the new hires data to the

infrequently observed tenure distributions. It is appealing because it

eliminates systematic biases in the turnover data which are known to exist,

and it abstracts from differences in employment levels reported in the

                                             -A5-
household and establishment (turnover) surveys.urviva1 probabilities were

calculated separately for the durables and nondurables sectors, for the first

three tenure categories distinguished in the published tabulations: 0—6

months, 7—12 months, and 13—24 months. These estimates are shown in Table A—2.

      The estimated survival rate for a particular group is, of course, an

average of the survival rates of its members. For example, the survival

rate of the 0—6 month group is an average of the rates of workers with

0 months', 1 month's, 2 months', etc., tenure. In order to obtain more

precise estimates of the tenure distribution, the survival rate within the

0—6 month group was specified to decline at a constant monthly rate (corres-

ponding to a constant monthly conditional probability of separation), such

that the average of the monthly rates equalled the estimate for the entire

group .    The "monthly" survival rates were obtained by numerically

solving the following expression for q:

            (1/7) *          qm =   s(0—6)
                     U   t
  where s(0—6) is the average survival rate of workers hired 0—6 months ago,

and qm is the survival rate of employees hired "exactly" m months ago,

m =   0,1,... ,6.   As for the 7—12 and 13—24 month groups, the average survival

rate for each group was simply imputed to all persons in the group, i.e.,

no allowance was made for within—group variation in survival rates.

       Time—series estimates of the number of employees in a given length—of—

service category were obtained by multiplying lagged new hires by the

appropriate survival rate; this was performed for the three groups specified.

The number of employees with greater than 24 months' tenure was computed as

a residual, by subtracting the sum of the estimates of employment in the

0—6, 7—12, 13—24 month categories from the total employment figure.
