          "Estimating the Determinants of Employee Performance"



                                  ABSTRACT




      Employers often wish to know whether the factors used in selecting

employees do in fact allow them to choose the most qualified applicants.

Because the performance of those not chosen is not observed, sample—

selection bias is a likely problem in any attempt to "validate" employee-

selection criteria. With minor modifications, the recently—developed

techniques for dealing with sample—selection problems can be used in

this context.

      Using data on applicants for first—line supervisory positions and

ratings of on—the—job performance of those hired, ordinary least squares

estimates of the determinants of performance are compared with maximum—

liklihood estimates which correct for selection bias. The correction

for selection bias produces some appreciable improvements in some varia-

bles' coefficients, though the corrected estimates remain "insignificant"

at conventional levels. Differences in the firm's stated and actual

hiring criteria are also noted.

         The relationship between job performance and individual attributes

known by the employer at time of hiring is an important topic among

economists. Selecting the best workforce from a pool of applicants is

an essential function for a firm which hopes to survive competitive pres-

sures. Evidence on how successfully firms perform this function is impor-

tant for verifying the cost—minimizing behavior that most economic analyses

assume) On a more day—to—day level, Federal guidelines on non—discrimi-

natory hiring require that firms demonstrate that hiring criteria which

disadvantage minorities or women are related to subsequent job performance

(U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 1978).

         The "individual characteristic" most often studied by economists

(and often studied by others) is education. Attempts to use within—firm

data to test whether more—educated individuals are more productive have

produced very mixed results.

         Berg (1970, Chapters 5—8) found more—educated workers no more pro-

ductive in a variety of blue collar and (generally lower—level) white collar

occupations. Swartz (1978, pp. 28—30) found education unrelated to secre-

tarial performance at a large conglomerate firm. Brenner (1968, pp. 29—30)

found high school record (grades, teachers' ratings, absenteeism) signifi-

cantly   related to job performance among Lockheed—California workers.

         Supervisory and   technical   workers have been studied   more extensively,

but   again without   real consensus. Wagner (1960,    p. 185) found years of
schooling   to be the best single predictor (among 31 variables) of the per—

formance ratings of young executives. Mahoney et al. (1960, p. 156) found

years of schooling "significantly't related (apparently at the 10 percent

level)   to supervisors'   ratings in a sample of managers. However, Medoff
                                     —2—


(1977,   P. 23) and Medoff and Abraham (1978, P. 18) found education unrelated

to performance but positively related to salary among managers at the same

grade levels in three large corporations. Korinan's (1968, p. 308) survey

of studies using "personal history" data (including years of schooling) to

predict managerial success concluded that "personal history data seem to

have some predictive value for first—line supervisors" but were less useful

for higher—level managers. Cainbell etal. (1970, Chapter 8) reached more

optimistic conclusions, but education was not among the personal history

variables in several of the studies they reviewed.


         Weisbrod and Karpoff (1968) found that, among AT&T college graduates,

school quality and class rank were related to salary, which they used as a

proxy for performance. Wise (1975) found both years of schooling and aca-

demic performance predictive of salary gains among Ford Motor Company engi-

neers, and argued that these gains reflected job performance. Kaufman (1978)

found that graduate courses taken by engineers after being hired were posi-

tively related to performance in research and development, but not in applied

development or manufacturing.

         An interesting body of evidence is evolving from employers' need to

"validate" their hiring criteria (i.e., to prove that these criteria reflect

differences   in job performance) in order to satisfy federal standards for
nondiscriminatory hiring; thus far, their efforts have not been very con—
vincing (White and Francis, 1976).
         While within—firm studies of worker performance can   potentially pro—

vide   valuable evidence on the   question of whether individuals with   more

education (or more of some other characteristic) are more productive, they

suffer from a potentially serious statistical flaw. Whether an employer
                                  —3—

should prefer more—educated applicants depends on whether the (potential)

performance of such applicants is superior to that of less—educated appli-

cants. Because potential performance of applicants not hired is not ob-

served, the performance of those hired by the firm must be analyzed. Un-

fortunately, comparing performance of more— and   less—educated   workers is

likely to give a biased reading of the difference in performance between

more— and less—educated applicants. If firms prefer more—educated appli-

cants, less—educated applicants who are hired must have some "compensating

virtues" (Jencks etal., 1977, p. 183) known to the hirer but often not to

the researcher. Thus, comparing performance of more— and less—educated

workers understates the edge of the typical (i.e., randomly selected) more—

educated worker over the typical less—educated worker. Moreover, the bias

is more severe when the employer overestimates the importance of education

(Brown, 1978).


       This problem is not limited to research on schooling and job perfor-

mance; it is present whenever one attempts to infer the determinants of per-

formance when candidates have been selected using some information not avail-

able to the researcher and his computer (e.g., letters of reference). The

issue has long been recognized in the psychometric literature on testing,

but only highly restrictive models—in which selection is based solely on

a weighted sum of known "test" scores—haw been used successfully. The

typical2 real—world situation in which hiring is based on both recorded ap-

plicant characteristics and unrecorded, informal judgment is thought to

present "an insuperable barrier to any analytic treatment" (Thorndike, 1949,

p. l76).

       The purpose   of   this   paper   is to apply recent econometric research on

"sample selection" problems to this employee—selection problem. In Section

I, a model of selection and subsequent performance, and an estimation strat-

egy, are presented. In Section II, the data——personnel files of applicants

for supervisory positions at a nondurable manufacturing firm——are described.

Empirical results are presented in Section III, and conclusions offered in

Section IV.

I. Statistical Model


         Let N be the number of applicants, indexed by i,                n   of whom are

selected     by the firm. Among applicants, performance Y. depends on a
set of applicant characteristics which are available to the researcher, X.
and a random variable u. which captures all other determinants of per-

formance:


       (1)   Y. =   X.   + u.                 i =   1,    ...   ,N

The disturbance u.         is assumed to be normally     distributed, with mean zero
and constant variance           for all i ; in particular,           u is assumed to

be uncorrelated with X among applicants.            Variables such as schooling,

age, and previous experience would be elements of X. ; that portion of

worker motivation that is uncorrelated with schooling, etc., is part of

   •   If Y. and X. are available for all applicants (or a random sample

of applicants), one could estimate          by ordinary least squares.

        As noted in the introduction, data on Y. are typically unavail-

able for the N—n applicants who are not hired, because Y is a measure

of on—the—job performance. Unfortunately, these "missing" observations are

not likely to be randomly selected, so that estimating equation (1) with

the available n observations who were hired will be likely to produce

biased estimates of B

        Presumably, firms hire those applicants who, based on available in-

formation, are thought to be most productive. The "available information"

includes both data available to the researcher, z               , and   some data which
                                          —6—

the researcher cannot include in the estimation because it is not available

(the selector's subjective impression of the applicant) or cannot be coded

with confidence (letters of reference). Let e. represent all the factors

which affect applicant i's hiring decision that are uncorrelated with Z.

The firm can be thought of as forming an estimate of the applicant's per-

formance if hired, P. , based on Z. and e.

                                                i =   1,   ...    ,N

and hires those with the highest P.'s (those with P. greater than a

cutoff score c ).         Assume that e. is normally distributed with mean zero

and constant variance for all i .          Because the P.'s are not observed, we
                                                                 1
can timeasurelt them with arbitrary origin and scale; the normalizations

c = 0    ,    variance of a =   1   are the most convenient. Therefore, if D. = 1
                                                                                       1
whenever individual i is hired, and zero otherwise, we have


               D. = 1     iff Z.a + e. > 0
                1               1     1
        (3)
               D. = 0     iff Z.a + e < 0
                1               1     i

             Equation (1) is often estimated by ordinary least squares from the

subsample of individuals who were hired by the firm. To analyze the bias

due to such sample selection, Heckman (1976, p. 477) rewrote equation (1)

as



        (1') Y =     X.   + E(uIZ.D) + v.

where            is the deviation of u from its conditional expectation. For

the subsample of applicants who were hired, D. = 1                   .   From the assumption

the u and e. have a bivariate normal distribution, it follows that
        i           1
                                        —7—

E(u.IZ.,Di=l) =       E(u.Ie. > —Zc)   =    poX., where   p    is   the correlation of u

and e (among applicants, A. =                                 and   f() and F(.) are
                                        f(Z.c)/F(Z1a)     ,



the standard normal density— and distribution— functions.


           Viewing A. as an omitted variable whose "true" coefficient is p

ordinary     least squares is seen to produce biased estimates of                unless

(i) A1 and X. are uncorrelated or (ii) p = 0                    .   Since   Z and X
will typically have elements in common, condition (i) is unlikely to hold.

The plausibility of condition (ii) depends on the selection process. If

e reflects factors that are not related to performance (or if selection

is conducted mechanically on the basis of           Z , so that the variance of e
is zero), e and u would be uncorrelated. More likely is the case where

e reflects factors that are related to performance (e.g., the interviewer's

estimate of the candidate's motivation), so that u and e are positively

correlated. It seems likely that the more complete is the set of character-

istics in X and Z , the smaller this correlation would be.

           Griliches, Hall, and Hausman (1977, pp. 11—21) have presented a

maximum—likelihood estimation procedure which incorporates Heckman's in-

sight that the n observations on hired applicants must be "corrected" for

the fact that they were not randomly selected. The data for the N appli-

cants are arranged so that the n selected applicants are indexed by

i =   1,   ...,   n and the (N—n) rejected applicants by i = n              + 1, ..., N

The key to expressing the likelihood function is the string of equalities

      Therefore, the likelihood function for an accepted applicant is

      Thus far,        it has been   implicitly assumed that performance ratings
are available    for all individuals chosen by the firm. In the employee—se-

lection context, this assumption can be violated in two ways: some "selected"

applicants   will   decide to reject the firm' s           offer of employment, and   ratings

may be unavailable for some of those hired. The best way to handle these

exceptions depends on what is known             about   why they became exceptions (i.e.,

are they thought to be nonrandom.ly "selected" from among individuals selected

by the firm?) and on their relative frequency in the data.6 Because these

exceptional cases are not very frequent in the data analyzed below, two

simple expedients were considered. First, the exceptional cases were assumed

to be randomly selected from among those who are chosen by the firm. If

there are n individuals with Y. available, m individuals selected by
                                      —9--


the firm but without ratings, and N—n—rn individuals rejected by the firm,

the last term of equation (7) is replaced by

        n+m                       N
               £n F(Z.c&)   +            £n
        in+l                    in+m+l        F(—Zc)


Alternatively, we can reinterpret D. to equal 1 whenever a rating is

available, and zero otherwise—a more direct application of the "sample

selection" model. Except as noted, the results in Section III are based

on the first of these strategies.

II.   Data

       The data are taken from the personnel files of applicants for super-

visory positions7 at a medium—large (4000 employee) nondurable manufactur-

ing plant. The firm's stated hiring standards were: "inside" applicants

(candidates for promotion) must have a high school degree; "outside" ap-

plicants (new hires) must have a high school degree and previous super-

visory experience, or have a college degree.

       The files of 621 males who applied during 1968—70 and 1972—74 are

available. Of these, 422 were either accepted or rejected by the firm

(184 hired, 226 rejected, 12 offered jobs but rejected them). Of the re-

maining 198, 163 withdrew from consideration before a decision could be

made, and no outcome was indicated for 35. Data for the 422 acted—upon

applicants were used in this analysis.

       The model described in Section I ignored applicants' reservation

wages and thus is most plausible when the firm is constrained (or chooses)

to pay each successful applicant the same wage. In fact, this was approxi-

mately true for this sample. Starting salary data revealed a clear tendency

for new supervisors to receive the "going" monthly rate at time of hire.

By plotting starting salaries chronologically, a starting rate which changed

about once per year over the period studied could be identified; 78 per cent

of those hired received this starting rate.


       The rating used to estimate equation (1) was the individual's latest

rating as a first—line supervisor. Ratings were available for 161 of the

184 hired supervisors. The firm used two different rating forms. Form 1,
                                          — 11 —


used prior to 1974, had four ratings (outstanding, average, satisfactory,

below average); Form 2, used since 1974, had five ratings (excels, meets

requirements, above minimum, meets tn.inimuxn, below minimum). To make the

ratings comparable, each was "Z—scored," using a procedure described by

Madoff (1977) and Freeman        (1978,   p. 135). It was assumed that an under-

lying Continuous performance variable w has a standard—normal distribu-

tion. The frequency distribution of the performance categories for all

ratings was tabulated. From these distributions, the value of the standard—

normal variate at the category boundaries, and the expected value of the

standard—normal variate within each category can be computed.8 For example,

suppose 10 percent of all ratings fall in the lowest category. From a

standard—normal cumulative distribution table, we can infer that the lowest

rating category corresponds to w < —1.28           ,   since       Pr(w < —1.28) = .10

The expected value of w within the lowest rating category is

E(wjw < —1.28) = —1.75       .   If   20 percent of ratings fall in the next lowest

category, this category corresponds to —1.28 < w               <   —.52   ,   since
Pr(w < —.52) = .30     ,   and   E(wI—1.28 < w < —.52) = —.86

       The information available from the personnel files is summarized in

Table 1. These variables represent most of the factors generally thought

to be important in hiring decisions at this level; in any case, they rep-

resent nearly all of the information that was routinely recorded at this

plant during the hiring process.9

       In the estimation of the model, Year of Application is assumed to

influence selection but not performance, while Years in Supervisory Posi-

tion and   Rating   is Form 2 affect the performance rating but not selection.

The remaining determinants of selection are assumed affect performance,

and vice versa. On a priori grounds, one expects those characteristics

which are preferred in the selection process to have positive effects on

performance. While not strictly necessary for identification, the avail-

ability of some variables not entering both equations should alleviate

reservations about estimating sample selection models in other contexts

(Welch, 1977, p. 455).


      The most important aspect of the data, however, is the availability

of data on rejected applicants' Z's. Thus, we have a "censored" sample

rather than the "truncated" samples (Heckman, 1976, p. 476) used in the

employee—performance studies cited in the introduction.

III.   Estimates


        Ordinary least squares estimates of the performance equation are

presented in the first coliunn of Table 2. Schooling and   Potential   Experi-

ence have positive coefficients, though neither is very large (a year of

schooling corresponding to a .05 standard deviation improvement in the

rating) nor statistically significant. Previous Supervisory Experience

has a negative coefficient with a large standard error. Neither Inside

Applicant nor Tenure is significant, and the estimated advantage of an in-

side applicant with average tenure over an outside applicant

(—.017 + .009*6.22 =   .04) is small. Married individuals, those with hon-
orable discharges, and those in the reserves receive lower ratings. Years

in Supervisory Position is strongly and positively related to the perfor-

mance rating.


       The results are similar to what one might expect from ordinary least

squares estimates in the face of sample selection: some variables which

might be expected to have positive effects (Schooling, Potential Experience)

have negligible coefficients, while others whose impact on performance might

be doubted are strongly negative (Married, Ronorable Discharge))0 More-

over, the variable which the firm cannot use for selection—Years as a

Supervisor (with this firm)—is positive and statistically significant.

       The maimuxn-.1ikeljhood estimates of both selection and performance

equations are also presented in Table 2. The selection equation (right-

most column) is of considerable interest. It indicates that, contrary to

the stated hiring policy, Schooling is only weakly related to the probability

of   selection, and Previous Supervisory Experience has a significant nega-

tive effect. Potential Experience has a very small effect, while inside

applicants,11 married workers, and applicants with honorable discharges or

reservist status are preferred. Finally, Year of Decision is significant

and negative, indicating that standardswere rising over time.

        A comparison of the maximum—likelihood estimates of the performance

equation (middle column) with the ordinary least squares estimates reveals

predictable changes in the coefficients. The estimated coefficients of

Schooling and Potential Experience change very little, while Previous Super-

visory Experience becomes more negative. The coefficients of the other

variables which were important in selection become more positive (the aver-

age inside applicant's advantage rises from .04 to .12), but while the

changes are fairly sizeable, none of these coefficients becomes "significant".

In general, the standard errors of these coefficients also increase consider-

ably. Years in Supervisory Position remains significantly related to per-

formance.


         In addition to the changes in coefficients, the impact of accounting

for selection on the ability to predict performance is of interest. The

      presented for the maximum likelihood estimate of the performance equa-

tion uses equation (1') to create a measure analogous to        from ordinary

least squares. Using the maximum likelihood estimates of ,      , p,   and a ,

a predicted value X. + aA was calculated for each rated individual.

The squared correlation of this constructed variable with the actual per-

formance rating was .101, a very small improvement over the ordinary least

squares value.
                                 — 17 —


       As shown in Section I, the bias in ordinary least squares estimates

(and hence the anticipated changes from maximum   likelihood   estimates) de-

pends on the correlation between the error terms in the selection and per-

formance equations. For the equations in Table 2, the maximum—likelihood

estimate of this correlation was 0.43 (the hypothesis p = 0      could not be

rejected).


       The sensitivity of the results to details of the specification was

examined by several exeriments, two of which are reported in Table 3. Be-

cause the selection equations were virtually unaffected, only the alterna-

tive estimates of the performance equation will be discussed.

       The use of the last rating as a measure of performance could be

challenged on the grounds that it obscures the value to the firm of more—

qualified applicants. Those who perform poorly initially might be given

extra attention by their supervisors and eventually perform as well as those

who were better qualified initially. To test this conjecture, the first two

columns of Table 3 report OLS and ML estimates of the performance equation

when the first available rating for each individual is used to measure per-

formance.12 The OLS coefficients display the same patterns as those in

Table 3, except that Potential Experience has a much larger coefficient

which verges on statistical significance. In general, the ML estimates

differ from their OLS counterparts less than when the last rating was used;

this reflects the weaker correlation between the selection and performance

equations' disturbances here compared with Table 2. (.21 vs. .43). The

effect of years in Supervisory Position with this firm is nearly three times

as large as in Table 2; this suggests that the marginal effect of such ex—

perience dies Out rather quickly. (The mean for this variable at first rating
was 0.96 years compared with 2.95 years at last rating.)


        In summarizing the ratings in a single score, the z—scoring procedure

assumed that the underlying continuous performance variable had a normal dis-

tribution. A plausible objection is that, since selection truncates this

distribution, the distribution of observed performance should be asymmetric,

with (much   of)   the lower tail removed. To test the sensitivity of the results

to the distribution of performance among those rated assumed in z—scoring,

an extreme alternative was considered. Since roughly half of the applicants

were hired, it was assumed that performance followed the upper half of a normal

distribution, i.e., f(y) = (2/71)½ exp(—y2/2) 0 < y < +            ,   and   the   rating

categories were z—scored on this        basis.   As the last two columns of Table 3

demonstrate,       the most important effect of this respecification is the improve— -

ment in the coefficients of marital and military status variables. None, how-

ever, is statistically significant. The improvement is due to the increased

estimated correlation between selection and performance         disturbances,      which

now reaches .83.


        Two further experiments were considered. First, a dummy variable for

those hired at premium pay was added to the performance         equation     using   the
Table   2 specifications. This variable was statistically insignificant, and

the other coefficients were not appreciably affected. Second, the variable

    in equation (3) was redefined as "rated't rather than "selected", as dis—

cussed in Section I. Once      again,    this modification had no appreciable affect

on the performance equation.

IV Conclusions

        Ordinary least squares estimates of the determinants of employee per—

fortnance are likely to give biased estimates of the importance of the various

factors which firms use in hiring. The magnitude of this bias, however, de-

pends on the selection process of the firm, being most important when the

firm accurately judges unrecorded attributes of applicants which are in fact

important      determinants of later performance. Consequently, the magnitude of
such biases will vary from one context to another—as will the determinants
of performance themselves.

        For the firm    studied   here mad.mum likelihood estimates of the deter-
minants of employee performance differed appreciably from ordinary least
squares   estimates in some cases, suggesting that selection bias of some im-

portance. However, none of the applicant characteristics available at time

of hiring were significantly related to later performance. In some cases

(Schooling, Potential Experience) these variables appear to have had little

impact on the hiring decision, so that their lack of impact on performance is

unremarkable. The remaining variables were, however, important in the decision

procedure.

        Years in Supervisory Position was strongly related to performance.

While   this   appears to contradict the findings of Medoff (1977) and Medoff and

Abraham (1978), such a conclusion would, be unwarranted. In each of the samples

they studied, the average level of company experience (presumably, mostly super-

visory) was 12 years or more, compared with three years of supervisory ex-

perience with the firm in the sample studied here. Moreover, the coefficient

was much smaller for last rating than first rating, suggesting that the mar-

ginal effect of such experience after a year or two could be very small.

       The apparent lack of relationship between the characteristics preferred

by the firm and subsequent performance is subject to two qualifications.

First, characteristics such as being married may be used by the firm to select

those who will stay with the firm (minimizing future hiring and training costs)

even if they perform no better on the job. Second, the

parameters of the performance equation are not estimated with great precision,

due in part to smaller sample size than previous applications of the sample

selection model. If this finding is supported by later research, it would mean

that the model could be used successfully only for larger firms or less elite

jobs than studied here. However, the difference in estimated coefficients

due to correcting for selection bias reported above suggests that this problem

may be of considerable practical importance in some contexts.

1. Cost—minimizing behavior is a major point of agreement for "human—

    capital't (Becker, 1975; Mincer, 1974) and "screening" (Arrow, 1973;

    Spence, 1973) models of schooling.

2. Campbell etal. (1969, p. 39) state that all of the sample of large

    firms they studied selected managers in this way.

3. The sample—selection problem. is treated as a "restriction in range" in

    this literature, which emphasizes correlations rather than regression

    coefficients. More recent studies give no indication that the "insuper-

    able barrier" has been overcome; e.g., Whitla (1968, p. 470) who reports

    that the restrictiw models "seem to have fallen into general disfavor"

   because their assumptions "are often hard to meet", Schmidt etal. (1976)

   who discuss the importance of selection in small—sample studies, and

   Maxwell (1974, p. 59) who presents a restriction in range correction

    for regression coefficients.

4. This implies that we "give credit" to X for any performance determinant

   which is correlated with X .      This   is appropriate when the firm's goal

    is to predict performance, rather than to determine its "causes."


5. Presumably, elements of Z are also elements of X .         However,   X may
    include variables not available at time of hiring, but subsequently

    available for those who are hired (e.g., time between selection and

   measurement of performance).

6. The relative frequency affects the ability of the data to "support" a

   more complicated analysis as well as the likely practical value of

    undertaking it.

 7.   Twenty—one "supervisory" applicants were hired into nonsupervisory

      (generally technical) positions and    were   deleted from the analysis.


 8. Guilford (1954, pp. 181—2) discusses a similar procedure, except that

      the conditional median is used instead of the conditional mean.


 9. Three available variables were excluded to limit the number of

      parameters to be estimated; they were nearly uncorrelated with

      other   variables among applicants (dummy variables for health problems,
      G.E.D. high school degree, and race).
10. If the firm prefers, say, married     applicants, one would anticipate

      that the estimated coefficient of Married would be negatively biased.

      If the true coefficient were zero, the estimated coefficient should

      be negative.

11. The advantage of the average inside applicant is —.493 + .147 * 6.22 =       .42.

12. Using the average rating produced results quite similar to those for

      first rating, presented below.
