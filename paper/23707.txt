Rethinking the Power of Forward Guidance: Lessons from Japan
Mark Gertler
NBER Working Paper No. 23707
August 2017
JEL No. E52,E58

                                         ABSTRACT

In the spring of 2013 the Bank of Japan introduced a state-of-the-art monetary policy which
included among other things inflation targeting and aggressive use of forward guidance. In
contrast to the predictions of conventional macroeconomic theory, these policies have had only
very limited success in reflating the economy. I argue that the disconnect between the Japanese
experience and existing theory can be traced to the forward guidance puzzle (FGP). As recent
literature suggests, the essence of the FGP is that existing models predict implausibly strong
effects of expected future interest rate changes on the economy,.with the strength of the effect
increasing with the expected horizon of the interest rate change. Accordingly, in this lecture I
sketch a model meant to capture the challenge of reflation in Japan. As in recent literature I
attempt to mute the power of forward guidance by stepping outside of rational expectations. In
particular I introduce a hybrid adaptive/rational expectations belief mechanism. Most relevant to
the Japanese experience is that individuals have adaptive expectations about trend inflation,
which is consistent with the evidence. As Kuroda (2016) emphasizes, for an economy without a
history of inflation being anchored by a target, individuals need direct evidence that the central
bank is capable of moving inflation to target.

1    Introduction
Recent events in the global economy have forced a reevaluation of much of what
we know in macroeconomics. Chief among the challenges is accounting for the
sustained low in‡ation and economic weakness in Japan. It is no longer possible
to blame the stagnation in Japan on mismanagement of monetary policy. Since
the spring of 2013, through the introduction of Quantitative and Qualitative
Easing (QQE), the Bank of Japan has implemented what many view as a state
of the art policy program.
    Sustained low in‡ation and economic weakness has been of course a recent
global phenomenon. The 2008/9 …nancial crisis plunged the advanced economies
of the world into a liquidity trap. The central banks of these economies, further,
have been largely unable to re‡ate their way out. The general problem, though,
has been more severe for Japan. It has lasted much longer, beginning with the
…nancial crisis of the late 1980s. Further, unlike countries such as the U.S.,
in‡ation expectations have not been tightly anchored by an in‡ation target.
    From a scienti…c perspective, it is not easy to explain the di¢ culties that
central banks have had moving their respective economies out of a liquidity
trap. The standard models predict that central banks can e¤ectively stimulate
an economy in a liquidity trap by managing expectations of future policy. Of
course. the central bank’s promises about future policy must be seen as credible.
If not, "forward guidance" will not be e¤ective. However, I will argue it is
unlikely that imperfect credibility alone can account for the slow recovery from
a liquidity trap. It may not even be the most signi…cant factor. Indeed, I
illustrate with an example below why the commitment problem may not be
particularly severe.
    Instead I will argue that an important aspect of the disconnect between
existing models and the slow global re‡ation is related to what is now popularly
known as the forward guidance puzzle (FGP). The essence of the FGP is that
the existing models predict implausibly strong e¤ects of expected future interest
rate changes on the economy. Somewhat perversely, as McKay, Nakamura and
Steinsson (2016) and Del Negro, Giannoni and Patterson (2012) emphasize, the
strength of the e¤ect increases with the expected horizon of the interest rate
change.
    It has become clear thanks to a rapidly burgeoning literature that the FGP is
tied to the assumption of rational expectations. Accordingly, e¤orts to address
the FGP have involved stepping outside the rational expectations hypothesis
as a means to introduce some form of e¤ective myopia. For example, Gabaix
(2016) and Garcia-Schmidt and Woodford (2014) take a behavioral approach.
Angeletos and Lian (2016) introduce incomplete information along with higher
order beliefs. Farhi and Werning (2017) combine a behavioral approach with
…nancial market frictions.
    In this lecture I take the opportunity to be speculative by sketching a model
meant to capture the challenge of re‡ation in Japan. My approach is not meant
to be a …nal word, just a road map. As in recent literature I attempt to mute
the power of forward guidance by stepping outside of rational expectations.


                                        2
    What I o¤er is less theoretically elegant than in the literature, but has the
virtue of being simple and perhaps easier to connect to data, particularly sur-
vey data on expectations. In particular I introduce a hybrid adaptive/rational
expectations belief mechanism. Individuals have adaptive expectations about
macro aggregates (e.g., output and in‡ation) which is consistent with the sur-
vey evidence (see e.g Coibin and Gorodnichenko, 2012). At the same time they
make rational forecasts of policy in the respect that they understood the policy
rule and are receptive to central bank communication.1 As I will argue, this ap-
proach is consistent with the evidence that central bank communication indeed
a¤ects market interest rates (e.g., Evans et. al., 2012).
    Most relevant to the Japanese experience is that individuals have adaptive
expectations about trend in‡ation. Unlike the restrictions in standard models,
individuals do not simply accept the central bank’s desired in‡ation target as
the relevant measure of trend in‡ation. As Kuroda (2016) emphasizes, for an
economy without a history of in‡ation being anchored by a target, individuals
need direct evidence that the central bank is capable of moving in‡ation to
target. That is they have to see it to believe it. It is not so much that they do
not trust the central bank’s intentions. Rather they need to be convinced that
the central bank can indeed deliver on its promises.


2     Some evidence on expectations
To motivate the use of an adaptive mechanism for beliefs about macro aggre-
gates, I …rst present some evidence on survey forecasts versus actual data. I
start with U.S. data. Following Coibin and Gordonichenko, I compare the me-
dian forecast from the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) to the realized
value of a variable.
    Figure 1 plots the median quarterly SPF forecast of core CPI in‡ation versus
the realized value over the sample 2007Q2 to 2017 Q1. There are three points to
note: First the forecast errors appear highly serially correlated. Second, actual
in‡ation tends to lead the movement of expected in‡ation. Note for example the
drop in in‡ation during the recession and then the increase in mid 2010, each
time with expectations lagging behind. Third, after dipping below two percent
for several years following the Great Recession, expectations return to this level
for the duration of the sample. The …rst two points appear consistent with an
adaptive mechanism. The third suggests that the two percent in‡ation target
may have had a role in helping anchor expectations.
    Figure 2 plots the median SPF forecast of real output growth versus the
realized value. As with in‡ation, the forecast errors appear highly serially cor-
related, with variation in output growth leading the movement in the forecast.
Again the evidence is consistent with an adaptive mechanism.
   1 In Farhi and Werning (2017) individuals similarly respond "rationally" to forward guid-

ance. In their framework individuals use level k learning to form beliefs about the real sector.
There is some similarity between level k learning and adaptive expectations in that near term
behavior plays an important role in beliefs about the future.



                                               3
    Next I turn to long horizon in‡ation expectations. Figure 3 plots the me-
dian SPF forecast of headline CPI in‡ation ten years ahead versus actual CPI
in‡ation over the sample 1979Q4 to 2016Q4. For the early years, the Blue Chip
forecast stands in for the SPF forecast. It is useful to divide the sample in half.
From 1979Q4 to the late 1990s the ten year in‡ation forecast drifts steadily
downward from roughly eight percent to two percent. Actual in‡ation tends
to lead the long horizon forecast downward suggesting an adaptive mechanism.
Beginning in the late 1990s the ten year forecast stays roughly anchored just
above two percent. While the Federal Reserve did not introduce a formal in‡a-
tion target until after the Great Recession, it arguably implemented an implicit
target of two percent. At the time members of the FOMC began to de…ne two
percent in‡ation as price stability and this practice continued until the imple-
mentation of a formal target. The long experience with the two percent target
(including the period of implicit targeting) undoubtedly helped anchor beliefs
in the face of volatile CPI in‡ation during and after the Great Recession.
    Finally, I turn to Japanese data. Figure 4 plots survey expectations of CPI
in‡ation excluding fresh food six to ten years out against actual in‡ation over
the sample 1989Q1 to 2017Q1. Early in the sample, long horizon in‡ation
expectations are roughly three percent. As the Japanese economy experiences a
sequence of recessions, in‡ation steadily drops, turning to de‡ation at the turn
of the century. Long horizon expectations follow behind, suggesting an adaptive
mechanism, similar to what occurred in the early part of the U.S. sample (see
Figure 3).
    Behavior in the latter part of the sample, however, is di¤erent from the U.S.
While in the U.S. long horizon in‡ation expectations were roughly at the two
percent target, they hovered at one percent on the eve of the ascension of the
Abe government to power in early 2013. At this point the stimulus beginning
in 2013Q2 from the introduction by the Bank of Japan of QQE pushed in‡ation
up, leading to a slow upward drift of expected in‡ation. Though the BOJ
introduced a two percent target, expectations did not jump immediately to this
level. Instead, in‡ation expectations slowly followed actual in‡ation upward.
Unfortunately, a recession and weakening of commodity prices reduced in‡ation
sharply, inducing a downward drift in in‡ation, despite the aggressive BOJ
policies. Without a history of anchored expectations, the in‡ation target did
not seem to curtail the downward movement in expected in‡ation.


3    The forward guidance puzzle: inspecting the
     mechanism
In this section I review the simple New Keynesian model with rational ex-
pectations, which serves as the basis for the macroeconomic models used for
forecasting and policy evaluation at central banks. I illustrate the power of
forward guidance within this framework. I then do several policy experiments
to illustrate how the strength of forward guidance suggests escaping a liquidity



                                        4
trap may not be so di¢ cult. This sets the stage for the next section where I
dampen the power of forward guidance by introducing a form of hybrid/rational
expectations.

3.1    New Keynesian model with trend in‡ation
Consider the canonical New Keynesian model with consumption goods only.
The one variation is that I allow for trend in‡ation, which individuals perceive
as obeying a random walk. To keep the algebra as simple as possible, I assume
that prices are indexed to trend in‡ation. Finally, the source of exogenous
variation is a demand disturbance in the form of a shock to the household
discount factor t :
    Let yt be the log of the output gap; it the net nominal interest rate; rt the
natural (‡exible price equilibrium) real rate of interest, t the rate of in‡ation
from t 1 to t and t trend in‡ation. As is standard, we can then express the
model in terms of three equations in three unknowns: yt ; t and it (see.e.g.,
Clarida, Gali and Gertler, 1999, Gali, 2015):
    IS curve
                       yt = Et yt+1     (it Et t+1 rt )                       (1)
   Phillips curve
                         t   = yt + Et          t+1   + (1            )   t           (2)
   Policy rule

                    it = maxfrt +   t   +       (     t      t)   +       y yt ; 0g   (3)

with      > 1; y > 0
    Equation (1) relates the current output gap positively to expected future
output and inversely to the gap between the real rate of interest it Et t+1 and
the natural rate rt : The parameter is the household’s intertemporal elasticity
of substitution. In this simple model rt = log t :
    Equation (2) relates in‡ation to the output gap plus a trend term equal
to a convex combination of expected in‡ation next period and trend in‡ation.
The parameter is the steady state household discount factor. The slope of the
Phillips curve lambda depends inversely on the degree of price rigidity (measured
by the probability a …rm does not change price in a period) as well as the
elasticity of marginal cost with respect to output.
    Finally equation (3) is a simple Taylor rule that has the nominal rate equal
to an intercept plus adjustment for deviations of in‡ation and the output gap
from their respective targets. The intercept is the sum of the natural rate and
trend in‡ation. Since the central bank controls trend in‡ation, the latter must
correspond to its in‡ation target. In addition we impose a zero lower bound
constraint. (Later I brie‡y discuss negative rates.)




                                            5
3.2    Rational expectations and the power of forward guid-
       ance.
To see the power of forward guidance, we solve the model under rational expec-
tations:.


                                1
                                X
                      yt = Et              (it+j          t+1+j       rt+j )    (4)
                                j=0

                                           1
                                           X
                                                     j
                                t   = Et                 yt+j +   t             (5)
                                           j=0

Output depends inversely on the sum of current and expected future interest
gaps while in‡ation depends on a discounted sum of expected output gaps plus
an additive term equal to trend in‡ation.
    We can now see how the e¤ect of Et it+j on yt is increasing in j. First note
that the direct e¤ect of Et it+j on yt (from equation (4)) is the same for all j. In
other words, there is no discounting of interest rate changes expected to come
in the future. As pointed out by Angeletos and Lian (2016) and others, the
absence of discounting re‡ects general equilibrium e¤ects in conjunction with
rational expectations. In partial equilibrium, individuals discount the e¤ects of
future interest rate changes. Under rational expectations they take into account
the e¤ect of the future interest rate change on future aggregate activity and in
turn on their future earnings. In this simple model, taking into account the
general equilibrium e¤ect exactly undoes the discounting of future interest rate
changes.
    In addition to the direct e¤ect of Et it+j on yt that is independent of j,
there is an indirect e¤ect due to the impact on expected in‡ation that works
to magnify the overall impact. In particular, the direct e¤ect of an increase in
Et it+j is to reduce yt : The indirect e¤ect then works as follows. The increase in
Et it+j reduces Et yt+k from k = 1 to j. This in turn has the e¤ect of reducing
the path of in‡ation over this interval, thus raising the path of real rates. The
magni…ed increase in the path of the real rate ampli…es the reduction in yt ;
Since this indirect e¤ect is clearly increasing in the horizon j, so too is the
overall impact of an increase in Et it+j on yt .
    It is also worth emphasizing that there is a signi…cant e¤ect of the in‡ation
target on the path of in‡ation. Under rational expectations, a (credible) increase
in the in‡ation target leads to an immediate one-for-one increase in in‡ation.
    It is now straightforward to illustrate how the power of forward guidance
facilitates managing a liquidity trap. When the sum of the natural rate and
trend in‡ation is negative, i.e., rt + t < 0 , the zero lower bound on it binds.
Now suppose that there is a negative demand shock (increase in t ) that leads
to rt+j + t+j < 0 from j = 0 to k 1 and 0 after. Given that the central
bank reduces it to zero over the period where the zero lower bound is binding,
we can express the IS curve as:

                                                 6
                   k
                   X1                                1
                                                     X
        y t = Et         (   t+1+j   + rt+j ) + Et         (it+j   t+1+j   rt+j )   (6)
                   j=0                               j=k

Equation (5) continues to characterize in‡ation.
    Even with a binding zero lower bound, the model suggests two immediate
ways to stimulate the economy in a liquidity trap by managing expectations.
First, keep the nominal rate "lower for longer." Commit to keep nominal rates
su¢ ciently low so that the interest rate gap is negative for a period after the
economy emerges from the liquidity trap. Given the power of forward guidance,
the model suggests that this tool should be e¤ective. Of course it requires that
the central bank can commit to pursuing an in‡ationary policy for a period after
the economy is free of the liquidity trap. However, as I demonstrate shortly,
the commitment problem may not be especially challenging since only modest
levels of in‡ation overshooting may be required.
    The second tool is to raise the in‡ation target. The simple model suggests
that an increase in the target should have an immediate e¤ect on in‡ation and
should thus stimulate the economy by reducing real rates. One might debate
whether raising the target above two percent for a country like the U.S. might be
credible. However, for Japan, going to a two percent target should not impose
any kind of credibility problem.

3.3    Numerical illustration
To illustrate the e¤ectiveness of forward guidance under rational expectations,
we consider several numerical experiments. To perform the experiments, we use
the following parameter values: We set the intertemporal elasticity of substi-
tution equal to unity (i.e., log utility) and the steady state quarterly steady
state discount factor equal to 0:99. We …x the slope on the output gap
in the Phillips curve equal to 0:4 which is within the range of estimates in the
literature. We set the feedback coe¢ cients in the Phillips curve     and y equal
to 1:5 and 0:5, respectively. Finally, we assume that steady state trend in‡ation
initially is zero.
    We then suppose that the model economy is subject to a demand shock
that puts it into a liquidity trap. Suppose, outside the steady state the log of
discount factor obeys a …rst order autoregressive process, with an autoregressive
coe¢ cient equal to 0:9. We then consider a negative shock that pushes the
natural rate of interest below zero for roughly two years. (Again, the natural
rate of interest in this simple model equals minus the log of the discount factor.)
Since trend in‡ation is zero, the economy is in a liquidity trap with a binding
zero lower bound on the nominal interest rate over this period.
    We now consider three policy responses to the liquidity trap. The …rst is
to do nothing: wait until the economy is out of the liquidity trap and then
have policy revert to the Taylor rule. The second two involve management of
expectations in an attempt to stimulate the economy while it is still in the

                                               7
liquidity trap. One is to keep rates "lower for longer" by waiting to raise rates
until four quarters after the economy is out of the liquidity trap. The other is
to raise the in‡ation target.
    Figure 5 analyzes the case where the central bank responds to the liquidity
trap by keeping rates lower for longer. As a benchmark, the dashed line in
each panel reports the case where the central bank does nothing. In this case
the economy experiences a large recession: Output falls four percentage points
while in‡ation drops one and a half percentage points. The lower bound on the
nominal rate prevents the central bank from stimulating the economy in the
absence of managing expectations of future policy.
    The solid line re‡ects the case where the central bank promises to keep
the nominal rate at zero for four quarters after the liquidity trap. Due to the
promise of lower rates in the future, the recession becomes mild and brief as the
output gap becomes positive after several quarters. In‡ation no longer falls: It
now increases modestly.
    It is true that a potential commitment problem emerges. After the economy
leaves the liquidity trap (i.e. when the natural rate turns positive after quarter
seven) in‡ation overshoots its target, a consequence of the central bank having to
carry out the stimulus it promised earlier. However, the degree of overshooting
is relatively modest. Once out of the liquidity trap in‡ation is less than a half
a percent above target for less than a year. This degree of overshooting of the
in‡ation target is well within the norm, for example, of what the Federal Reserve
has done in the past twenty years. There is thus reason to believe that a central
bank pursuing this kind of policy is likely to be seen as credible by the private
sector.
    Figure 6 portrays the impact of the central bank raising the in‡ation target
one hundred basis points. Under rational expectations, individuals’expectations
of trend in‡ation immediately increase by the same amount. In turn, holding
constant the output gap, in‡ation increases one hundred basis points. The net
e¤ect is a reduction in real interest rates which stimulates the economy. As
the solid line shows, relative to the case where the central bank is passive, the
stimulus provided from raising the in‡ation target increases both output and
in‡ation. Note that in‡ation moves quickly to the new target.
    Overall, under rational expectations, forward guidance, i,e, managing expec-
tations of the future path of policy, provides an e¤ective means of stimulating
the economy, and implausibly so as many would argue.


4    A hybrid adaptive/rational expectations al-
     ternative
In order to dampen to power of forward guidance, I next consider an alternative
belief mechanism. The basic idea is as follows. Individuals make rational partial
equilibrium decisions, but they’re uncertain about how the partial equilibrium
feeds into the general equilibrium. In the context of the simple New Keyne-



                                        8
sian model with consumption goods only, individuals make optimal consump-
tion/saving decisions given their respective beliefs about discounted earnings.
While individuals understand how their earnings may be correlated with aggre-
gate output, they are unable to calculate the general equilibrium determination
of its expected path. This leads them to use a mixture of adaptive and rational
beliefs.
    The adaptive part works as follows. Individuals use an adaptive mechanism
for beliefs about the future output gap and trend in‡ation. Given they under-
stand how their own earnings are correlated with the output gap they can use
this forecast to project their respective future income. We also allow them to
understand the partial equilibrium relation for in‡ation, i.e. the New Keynesian
Phillips curve (equation (2)). Given there forecasts of the output gap and trend
in‡ation, they can then compute a forecast of in‡ation as I describe below.
    The rational part then works as follows. Through experience, individuals
understand the central bank policy rule given by equation (3). (Again, they
are good at partial equilibrium but not general equilibrium). They also view as
credible central bank guidance about the policy instrument path. In this respect,
the calculation about the path of the policy instrument is rational. One caveat:
while they understand the Taylor rule, they use the adaptive mechanism to
form beliefs about the deviations of in‡ation and the output gap from target.
At the same time, they accept central bank guidance about deviations from the
traditional rule. It’s just they just can’t make the calculation of the general
equilibrium e¤ect of the policy on the economy.

4.1    The model with hybrid beliefs
Accordingly, suppose the private sector forecast of the output gap is given by
the following adaptive mechanism:
                       et yt+1 = (yt
                       E                  et
                                          E    1 yt )
                                                          et
                                                        + E    1 yt               (7)

where Eet denotes expectations under our hybrid mechanism. Under beliefs given
by equation (7), the updated forecast depends positively on the forecast error
(yt E et 1 yt ) and the lagged forecast E
                                        et 1 yt . The lagged forecast is weighted by
  < 1 to take into account that the output gap is stationary and that individuals
recognize this. In the end, the output gap forecast depends on a geometrically
distributed lag of current and past values, where the weights sum to a number
between zero and unity.
    In turn, beliefs about trend in‡ation are given by the following adaptive

Individuals update their forecast based on the forecast error. They treat trend
in‡ation as non-stationary: Accordingly the weight on the lagged forecast is
unity. As a result, the forecast of trend in‡ation is a geometrically distributed
lag of past in‡ation where the weights sum to unity. Given the forecasts of the
output gap and trend in‡ation and given E et yt+1+i = i Eet yt+1 ; it is then possible


                                          9
to combine with the Phillips curve (2) to construct a forecast of in‡ation, as
follows:

                         et
                         E     t+1   =                 et yt+1 + E
                                                       E         et            t                          (9)
                                          1
   Let cbt be the central bank’s in‡ation target and ft+j be the projected
deviation of the interest rate from the policy rule due to forward guidance.
Then the forecast of the interest rate is given as follows:
    et it+j = maxfE
    E             et [rt+j +     cb
                                      +       (       t+j
                                                                   cb
                                                                        )+    y yt+j        ft+j ]; 0g   (10)

    We assume individuals know the form of the policy rule. They use the adap-
tive forecasts of t and yt to construct measures of deviations of in‡ation and
output from target. But at the same time, they view as credible central bank
pronouncements about the in‡ation target as well as central bank guidance
about the future path of interest rates. Put di¤erently, in computing the ex-
pected path of the interest rate, they accept the central bank’s pronouncements
about cb t and ft+j : In this regard, central bank communication about the path
of future policy (through both cb t and ft+j ) will indeed a¤ect the expected path
of rates.
    Under "hybrid" expectations, the complete model is then given by the fol-
lowing three equations:

      Relative to the case of rational expectations, the power of forward guidance is
muted in the model with hybrid beliefs. Note …rst that in the aggregate demand
relation given by equation (11), the e¤ect of future interest rates is discounted by
  j
    , unlike what occurs under rational expectations. Second, given that forecasts
of in‡ation are adaptive, the movement in expected in‡ation is muted, which
dampens the e¤ect of an expected future nominal rate change on the path of
real rates. In contrast to the case of rational expectations, there is no large
multiplier e¤ect on real rates arising from movement in expected in‡ation.

4.2     Numerical experiments with hybrid beliefs
We now repeat the policy experiments we performed with the model under
rational expectations. For the adaptive rule for output, we suppose that the
updating parameter is given by 0:125 and the serial correlation parameter
is given by 0:95: This calibration suggests that individuals use a geometrically
distributed lag of roughly two years of past data to forecast the output gap. We
suppose much slower adjustment of beliefs about trend in‡ation: is given by
0:5: In this instance individuals e¤ectively use more than ten years of lagged
data.2
    As earlier, we consider a demand shock that pushes the economy into a
liquidity trap for roughly seven quarters. Also as before, we …rst consider the
e¤ect of the central bank promising to keep the nominal rate at zero for a year
after the economy leaves the liquidity trap. Figure 7 illustrates the results.
Once again, the dashed line is the case with no forward guidance, while the
blue line re‡ect the case with forward guidance, though this time with hybrid
expectations as opposed to rational expectations.
    Overall, the policy response has a much weaker e¤ect on output and in‡a-
tion than under rational expectations. In the latter case, the policy virtually
eliminated the output gap and pushed in‡ation modestly above target. Under
hybrid expectations the impact is more modest. The policy is stimulative since
individuals recognize that the lifto¤ of nominal rates from zero will be delayed.
However, the output decline is only about one percent less than the case of no
policy response. Similarly, in‡ation dips before returning to target. The weak
response of economic activity to the stimulus, of course, is the product of how
the hybrid belief mechanism dampens the power of forward guidance.
    Next we consider raising the in‡ation target one hundred basis points. Un-
der rational expectations, there is an immediate jump in beliefs about trend
in‡ation. With adaptive expectations about trend in‡ation, individuals have
to see it to believe it. As …gure 8 illustrates, relative to the case of rational
expectations, there is a much slower increase in in‡ation, mainly due to the
slow adjustment of expectations of trend in‡ation. The policy does provide
some stimulus, though. Raising the in‡ation target implies that everything else
equal, the path of future interest rates will be lower (given that the feedback
coe¢ cient on in‡ation,      exceeds unity). The reduction in expected future
interest rates then stimulates current spending. Thus, even though individu-
als have adaptive expectations about output and in‡ation, they do respond to
central bank e¤orts to stimulate by managing expectations.
    We next explore how transitory factors can a¤ect the central bank’s ability
to achieve the in‡ation target. The motive is to understand how the recession
and commodity de‡ation during 2014/15 frustrated the BOJs e¤ort to re‡ate
the economy. We accordingly modify the model to introduce a cost shock ut
  2 Though it is beyond the scope of this paper, one way to discipline the learning parameters

would be to match the serial correlation in the forecast errors from the survey data.




                                             11
that obeys the following …rst order process

                                  ut =     u ut 1   +   t

where the error term t is i.i.d. with mean zero. The cost shock a¤ects the
Phillips curve as follows:
                            1
                            X
                 t
                       et
                     = E          j
                                      [ yt+j + ut+j ] + Et      t                (14)
                            j=0

                          (yt +           et yt+1 ) + E
                                          E           et    t   +           ut   (15)
                                  1                                 1   u

    I now repeat the experiment of …gure 8. The economy is hit by a demand
shock that moves it into liquidity trap. The central bank responds by raising
the in‡ation target by one hundred basis points. This time, however, while in
the liquidity trap, the economy also experiences a reduction in costs (i.e. a drop
in ut ) which reduces in‡ation. Given adaptive beliefs about trend in‡ation, the
cost shock leads a decline in the long horizon forecast of in‡ation, similar to what
happened in Japan. Interestingly, the shock also induces a decline in output:
The reduction in in‡ation expectations raises the real interest rate, reducing
demand.
    Overall, the model captures how bad luck due to recession and commodity
price de‡ation can frustrate the central bank’s e¤orts to re‡ate, as occurred
recently in Japan. At the same time, good luck could do just the opposite. For
example, if the global economy picks up, then commodity prices and in‡ation
may increase, helping economic activity and in‡ation in Japan move back to
target.


5    Connection to QQE
I now discuss brie‡y how the analysis relates to QQE. There were four key
aspects to the April 2013 plan. The …rst was to set an in‡ation target of 2%.
The second was to commit to a sustained rise in the monetary base by expanding
asset purchases. The third was to purchase long term bonds. The fourth, which
was introduced more recently, was to implement negative interest rates.
   I would argue that the …rst two policies correspond to what I analyzed in the
simulations. Raising the in‡ation target corresponds exactly to one of the policy
experiments I considered. Given that increasing the monetary base pushes short
rates down, the promise of sustained monetary base expansion, in turn, is in
e¤ect a promise to keep short rates low after the economy has recovered from
the liquidity trap. In this respect it corresponds to the policy of keeping rates
"lower for longer."
   The second two policies, long-term bond purchases and negative interest
rates, are appealing in light of the muted power of forward guidance. In partic-
ular, the analysis suggests that, changes in credit costs today, everything else


                                           12
equal, are going to have a greater e¤ect than projected reductions in costs way
into the future. Long-term bond purchases reduces current costs by reducing
term premia. Negative interest rates obviously reduce credit costs today directly
as well.
    Overall, both of the policies make sense in light of the muted power of
forward guidance. But it’s also the case that there are limits to how much one
can use each tool to reduce credit costs. Bond purchases can only push down
the term premium so much. Otherwise, private speculators will start issuing
long-term bonds and going long in short term assets. The government could
also start issuing long-term bonds. There is also a limit to how much one make
rates negative because individuals and institutions will go into cash.


6    Concluding remarks
As the Japanese experience makes clear, the process of re‡ation from a liquidity
trap can take much longer than most existing macroeconomic models suggest.
This can be true even with textbook state-of-the-art monetary policy. This
phenomenon is a lot easier to understand once we step outside of pure rational
expectations. Accordingly, this paper develops a hybrid adaptive/rational mech-
anism for formation of beliefs and uses the approach to illustrate the challenges
a central bank in trying to re‡ate by managing beliefs about future policy. A
key lesson from the Japan experience is that absent a history of in‡ation being
anchored by a target, individuals need to see some in‡ation in order to believe
that more is coming.
    Creating in‡ation in turn is certainly going to involve skill on the part of
the central bank. But, it is also going to involve luck. Despite the best e¤orts
of a central bank, global factors that moderate in‡ation may frustrate e¤orts
to re‡ate. So what is the best course of action? Continue aggressive monetary
policy and hope for some luck. Some cooperation from …scal policy of the kind
that Ben Bernanke discussed earlier in the conference may also help.

  Appendix: Derivation of the IS curve under hybrid ex-
pectations
         The baseline framework is a textbook NK model with consumption
goods only. Output is linear in labor. Discount factor shocks are the only
source of variation. A representative household chooses consumption/saving
and labor supply to maximize expected discount utility. Period utility is sep-
arable in consumption and labor supply. Period utility from consumption is
logarithmic.
         Let ct be the log deviation of consumption from steady state and vt be
the log deviation of household wealth, including human wealth and asset wealth.
Note that since (i) utility is logarithmic,(ii) there are only discount factor shocks
and (iii) consumption equals output and output equals labor, the ‡exible price
equilibrium values of both consumption, employment and output are constant.
Hence ct is also the log deviation of consumption from its natural value.
         Combining the loglinearized …rst order conditions from the household
consumption/saving problem with the loglinearized budget constraint yields the
following relationship for consumption demand

                                                ct = vt                                           (16)

                                     j                 1+j
          vt = Et         f(1    )       yt+j                (it+j    Et     t+1+j      rt+j )g   (17)
                    j=0

In keeping with the permanent income hypothesis, consumption varies propor-
tionately with wealth. Wealth in turn is the expected discounted sum of income,
where yt+i is the sum of labor income and pro…ts from monopolistically com-
petitive …rms.
         As the literature emphasizes, discounting of the future disappears in the
rational expectations general equilibrium. To see, express vt recursively:

                 vt = (1        )yt + Et vt+1                 (it     Et    t+1      rt )         (18)

Given ct = yt , it follows that yt = t and Et yt+1 = Et vt+1 : Accordingly we can
write
                  yt = (1    )yt + Et yt+1     (it Et t+1 rt )               (19)
Rearranging then yields the familiar New Keynesian IS curve

                            yt = Et yt+1         (it      Et    t+1        rt )                   (20)

Observe that discounting of the future disappears after the general equilibrium
with rational expectations is imposed.
        To see how discounting remains under hybrid beliefs, …rst note that
aggregate demand can be expressed as
                    1

                           E              =      (yt         et

   Combining (21) and (22) then yields
