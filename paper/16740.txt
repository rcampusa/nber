                                              ABSTRACT

Two competing explanations for why consumers have trouble with financial decisions are gaining
momentum. One is that people are financially illiterate since they lack understanding of simple economic
concepts and cannot carry out computations such as computing compound interest, which could cause
them to make suboptimal financial decisions. A second is that impatience or present-bias might explain
suboptimal financial decisions. That is, some people persistently choose immediate gratification instead
of taking advantage of larger long-term payoffs. We use experimental evidence from Chile to explore
how these factors appear related to poor financial decisions. Our results show that our measure of impatience
is a strong predictor of wealth and investment in health. Financial literacy is also correlated with wealth
though it appears to be a weaker predictor of sensitivity to framing in investment decisions. Policymakers
interested in enhancing retirement wellbeing would do well to consider the importance of these factors.

                  How Financial Literacy and Impatience
             Shape Retirement Wealth and Investment Behaviors


         Research and policy interest is increasingly focused on the links between financial

literacy and household saving, seeking to explain why consumers seem to undersave for

retirement, take on too much debt, make poor mortgage decisions, and experience other

problems in the modern financial environment.1 This paper explores two explanations that have

been offered for why consumers fail to optimize their financial decision making. One is that

people suffer from financial illiteracy (Lusardi and Mitchell 2007a, b, 2008; Hastings and

Tejada-Ashton 2008). This argument contends that many people lack the knowledge of key

economic concepts and skills needed to make financial computations, which may cause them to

make suboptimal financial decisions. It is this explanation that motivates the many policymakers

who have recently launched campaigns to foster financial literacy around the world (OECD, nd;

PACFL, 2008).         A second explanation is that people are impatient or “present-biased,” which

implies that they chose current gratification over future, higher payoffs (Ashraf et al. 2006;

Rabin and O’Donahue, 1999).

         While both explanations could be influential in explaining apparently suboptimal saving

and investment patterns, thus far there is little evidence that either of these behavioral limitations

is at the root of poor financial decision making. This paper uses experimental evidence derived

from the 2009 Chilean Encuesta de Protección Social (EPS or Social Protection Survey) to

evaluate how financial literacy and impatience predict saving and investment decisions. The EPS

respondents followed every two years, fielded by the University of Chile’s Microdata Center in

cooperation with the University of Pennsylvania (c.f. Arenas et al. 2008; Mitchell et al. 2008).2

Chile is one of the most developed economies in Latin America, having levels of education and

systems of credit similar to those of many developed countries. Also of interest is the fact that

Chile converted to a mandatory national defined contribution system in 1981, giving all

participating employees a chance to select a pension fund manager (AFP, or Pension Fund

Administrator) from a small set of licensed portfolio managers. Two aspects of the 2009 EPS

are particularly valuable for the present paper. First, we administered a battery of financial

literacy questions (developed by Lusardi and Mitchell, 2007a, b) from which we develop a

literacy index which can be used as a predictor of retirement saving and other key outcomes.

Second, we designed and implemented a pair of experiments providing the opportunity to

measure respondent impatience and respondent ability to carry out expressed intentions

regarding financial behaviors, which we then link to outcomes of interest.

           Our results show that our measure of impatience is a strong predictor of retirement saving

and investment in health. Financial literacy is also correlated with accumulated retirement saving

though it appears to be a weaker predictor of sensitivity to framing in investment decisions.

These results have implications for policymakers interested in enhancing retirement well-being

through addressing shortcomings in behavior and economic decision making that may hinder

planning, decision making and investments for long-run financial and physical health.

Data and Experimental Methodology

         The EPS is a nationally representative bi-annual microeconomic panel of Chileans,

fielded by the University of Chile’s Microdata Center in cooperation with the University of

Pennsylvania (Arenas et al. 2008; Bravo et al. 2004, 2006; Mitchell et al. 2008). The 2009 wave

of the EPS collected survey data for a little over 14,000 respondents included in the ten-year

panel. The survey is similar to the US Health and Retirement Study, and it delves into

respondents’ labor history, health, retirement saving, and knowledge of and participation in

Chile’s defined contribution old-age saving scheme. In addition, the EPS also asks respondents

to answer several questions measuring financial literacy and risk preferences (devised by Lusardi

and Mitchell 2007a, b). These questions are as follows:

1. Chance of Disease: If the chance of catching an illness is 10 percent, how many people out of
   1000 would get the illness?
2. Lottery Division: If five people share winning lottery tickets and the total prize is two million
   Chilean pesos, how much would each receive?
3. Numeracy in Investment Context: Assume that you have $100 in a savings account and the
   interest rate you earn on this money is 2 percent a year. If you keep this money in the account
   for five years, how much would you have after five years? Choose one: more than $102,
   exactly $102 or less than $102.
4. Compound Interest: Assume that you have $200 in a savings account, and the interest rate
   that you earn on these savings is 10 percent a year. How much would you have in the account
   after 2 years?
5. Inflation: Assume that you have $100 in a savings account and the interest rate that you earn
   on these savings is 1 percent a year. Inflation is 2 percent a year. After one year, if you
   withdraw the money from the savings account you could buy more/less/the same?
6. Risk Diversification: Buying shares in one company is less risky than buying shares from
   many different companies with the same money. True/False

We use the responses to these questions to generate a financial literacy index – the sum of

correct responses to each question3 – which is our measure of an individual’s knowledge and

capability of performing calculations needed to make wise financial decisions. 4

 Behrman et al. (2010) explore alternative ways to construct a financial literacy index and report that more
sophisticated measures perform about as well as the simple additive approach.


                                                          3
        To ascertain whether financial literacy affects how consumers understand financial

terminology such as pension fund management fees and interest rates (following Hastings and

Tejeda-Ashton, 2008), we provide information to individuals on pension investment returns net

of fees, in various formats. Specifically, we present the pension fund menu in expected pension

fund gains versus pension fund costs over a 10-year period, and we also vary whether these are

presented in Chilean pesos or in Annual Percentage Rates. The formats were randomly assigned

to EPS respondents, who were then asked to analyze the information and rank the funds on the

menu as first, second, and third best, based on the information provided. We then use the

financial literacy index discussed above to test whether the financially literate respondents are

less strongly influenced by how the pension information is framed.

        In a second experiment we investigate whether people subject to impatience -- that is,

those who overweight current consumption versus the future – are also those who make short-

sighted investment decisions. To test this hypothesis, at the end of the survey, each EPS

participant was asked to play a “Game” to receive a gift card. In return for filling out a short

shopping questionnaire, the interviewer gave each participant a gift card to be used at the largest

grocery chain in the nation. If the respondent completed the short questionnaire right away

(‘Now’), he would immediately receive a 5,000 peso gift card (about US$8); alternatively, he

could elect to do so ‘Later’ – i.e., fill out the questionnaire and mail it back in a pre-paid,

addressed envelope within four weeks – at which time the gift card is activated with a higher

amount. This higher amount was randomized between 6,000-8,000 pesos in 500 peso increments,

so respondents who delayed would receive a 20-60 percent return if they delayed receipt (by up

  Arenas et al. (2008) describes other EPS responses regarding knowledge of the Chilean retirement system
including the mandatory contribution rate, the legal retirement age for women (60) and men (65), how pension
benefits are computed in the defined contribution system, whether people are aware of the welfare benefit available
under the law, and whether people know they may contribute additional funds to the Voluntary Pension system.
Mitchell et al. (2008) focus on pension switching in the EPS.


                                                         4
to four weeks).5 The experiment permits us to identify three different types of respondents: the

impatient who took the lower gift-card amount immediately, the efficacious deferrers who chose

the later amount and returned the survey for the higher amount, and the inefficacious deferrers

who opted for the later higher amount but then failed to send in the questionnaire so as to

activate their cards. This provides a real-world decision measure of ability to delay current

gratification for future gains, as well as evidence on peoples’ ability to follow through on a plan

with financial implications. Then we can determine whether respondents who choose Now at a

cost of more money Later are also those who are unable to save for retirement and less likely to

invest in their health.



How Financial Literacy and Impatience Shape Retirement Wealth and Health

        In this section we explore how financial literacy and impatience are associated with

retirement wealth and health. Table 1 reports summary statistics for the total number of financial

literacy questions answered correctly, arrayed by respondent characteristics including age, sex,

education, income, and whether the respondent indicated he had any saving. On average,

younger individuals and men were more likely to give correct answers to more of the financial

literacy questions. Similarly, financial literacy rises strongly with education levels, with those

getting over half of the questions correct being more likely to have completed at least their

secondary schooling. Average monthly income was also strongly positively correlated with

financial literacy, as was the propensity to have some form of saving and to be a member of an



5
 Importantly, because the EPS is a longitudinal panel, all respondents have prior experience with the EPS
interviewers, are regularly contacted by them for scheduling the interviews, receive a telephone number to easily
contact the University of Chile’s Microdatos Center if they have questions, and will be recontacted to respond to
future waves of the EPS. Accordingly, the level of trust between respondents and the EPS is very high, which
minimizes uncertainty regarding receiving the higher but delayed gift card amount.


                                                       5
AFP pension plan (in the past, participation was optional for the self-employed and those not in

formal sector jobs).

Table 1 here

           Next we focus only on AFP participants (self-identified) and investigate how respondents

performed on specific financial literacy questions. Table 2 shows that those who answered each

question correctly were more likely than those who did not know the correct answers to have

higher monthly income, more education, and saving. Of particular interest is the Compound

Interest question. It asked respondents to calculate the exact amount they would have in a saving

account after two years if they started with $200 and the account paid 10 percent interest

annually. Very few – only 154 respondents out of more than 8,000 asked the question –

answered it correctly by giving a response of $242. This handful of respondents was

substantially wealthier and more educated than the sample as a whole.

Table 2 here

           Results from the Game appear in Table 3. Overall, of the 8,850 participants in the game,6

54% chose the Now option, with the remainder electing to turn it in Later for a higher value gift

card. Of the latter, 17% failed to return the questionnaire, in effect losing the certain 5,000 pesos

offered to begin with; 30% successfully returned the survey and received the higher Later

amount. Column 1 of Table 4 reports odds ratios of characteristics influencing the likelihood

that a respondent chose Now versus Later for completing the short additional questionnaire. The

odds of choosing Now decline with income, and the rate is lowest for those having the highest

level of income (the excluded group is those earning 0). In addition, more educated respondents

are much less likely to choose Now (the excluded education group is those with incomplete basic

education). In fact, among those with post-secondary education at Technical or University
6
    We excluded participants who lived in remote rural areas and thus could not make use of the grocery gift card.


                                                            6
levels, the odds of choosing Now decrease by about 40%. Married couples are also less likely to

choose Now, conditioning on age. Interestingly a higher financial literacy score also decreases

the odds of choosing Now instead of Later. The effect is small, with a one point increase in the

score associated with a 2.8% decrease in the odds of choosing Now. However, it suggests that

those who choose to defer payment for a greater reward are more likely to possess a basic

understanding of simple math and financial concepts necessary to make intertemporal financial

decisions. We also find that the probability of selecting Later rises as the amount offered

increases, not surprisingly. It is unexpected that a sizable fraction of participants still chose the

Now option when the Later choice would pay 8000 pesos.

Table 3 here

       The second column of Table 4 shows the effect that these characteristics have on

efficacious deferrals – that is, being able to return the completed questionnaire and receive the

higher gift card amount, conditional on choosing to complete the survey later. Interestingly, few

of the sociodemographic variables predict this behavior, and the only strong and consistent factor

refers to the respondent’s unemployment status: being jobless boosts the odds of returning the

survey successfully by nearly 50%.

       Next, we seek to understand how these factors might influence saving and investment

outcomes, and also whether they play a role in addition to the influence of income and education.

Accordingly, Table 5 illustrates how these factors influence reported measures of retirement

saving. The first column presents odds ratios from a Logit model for self-reported participation

in the additional AFP voluntary saving program into which covered workers may contribute if

they wish (above and beyond the required 10% contribution they are required to save in their

mandatory AFP). Interestingly, choosing the Now option in the Game is a significant predictor




                                                 7
of whether the respondent says he contributes additional amounts to his personal pension

account, and this estimate is in the expected direction: those who select Now have 25% lower

odds of making voluntary contributions. Higher paid workers are more likely to contribute,

though more educated participants are not. In addition, those with a higher financial literacy

score are not more likely to pay in additional voluntary pension contributions, perhaps because

they are saving in other vehicles.

Table 4 here

        The second column of Table 5 provides Tobit estimates of self-reported savings regressed

on the same set of variables. Here we see that those who chose Now in the game also have less

saving.7 Financial literacy is also significant and positive – those with higher financial literacy

scores are more likely to have higher saving accumulations (confirming Behrman et al., 2010).

Comparing the impact of financial literacy versus choosing Now versus Later, impatience in the

Game lowers saving as much as a 2.5 point reduction in the financial literacy score. In other

words, this provides support for the hypothesis that both financial literacy and short-run

impatience play important roles in determining retirement saving, even after controlling for

education and income.

        Next we explore other ways in which these two factors shape peoples’ long-term

investment patterns.       Tables 6 and 7 examine the relationship between measured health

investments and behaviors and EPS participant choices in the Game (health behaviors in the EPS

are self-reported).      One set of outcomes is whether respondents had had any of several

preventative exams in the past two years (since the last EPS round) including Pap smear, breast

exam, prostate exam, and general physicals. The first four columns of Table 6 show that


7
 In future work we will include more complete measures of saving such as home equity and business capital, and
net out debt (as in Behrman et al., 2010).


                                                       8
performance in the Game is a very strong predictor of having had preventative health exams for

women. For them, people choosing Now are significantly less likely to have had Pap Smears and

breast exams (odds fall by 22-35%). Interestingly, higher educated women are much more likely

to have breast exams but not Pap Smears, and generally income is not a strong predictor of either

exam (perhaps the latter can be explained by the fact that Chile has a national health insurance

scheme making the coverage widely available). For men, the likelihood of having had a prostate

exam is uncorrelated with Game behavior, though having had a general physical is. Here those

who chose Later and followed through were significantly more likely to have had a general

physical than either those who chose Now or those who chose Later and did not follow through.

       Lastly, exercise can be viewed as a preventative health measure that imposes a cost now

for health gains in the future. The EPS asks respondents approximately how often they exercise,

with response options varying from never, to once or twice a month, to more than five times per

week. We use this variable to construct a measure of weekly exercise habits to examine if we

find a similar relationship between Game responses and health investments as we did with prior

outcomes. We do not find a significant relationship between self-reported exercise and- Game

responses, even though the exercise measure is strongly influenced by education, age, marital

status and sex with the signs and magnitudes one would expect.

       Tables 6 and 7 here

       Next we use respondent self-reported height and weight to construct a Body Mass Index

to categorize each individual as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. Results are

provided in Table 7 for a Logit regression of whether the respondent is overweight or obese is

related to performance in the Game. For women, demographic factors and the Investment Gain

patterns are strongly associated with weight. Specifically, both those who chose Now and those




                                               9
who chose Later and followed through with their investment are significantly less likely to be

overweight - by about 20% - compared to those who naively chose Later but then failed to get

their questionnaire in on time. Little except marital status affects weight for men.

        For many people, then, behavior in the Game is related to successful outcomes in

retirement saving accumulations, as well as in health behaviors and health investments. This

suggests that the Game discriminates who is efficaciously patient – those who can make forward-

looking financial plans and follow through. We believe that identifying who has difficulty

making such commitments may be important for increasing saving and investment behavior.



Financial Literacy and Sensitivity to Information Framing

        We also undertook a separate experiment to further analyze how financial literacy might

influence investment decisions. Since financial literacy is meant to measure the capacity and

knowledge base necessary to perform calculations needed to make wise financial decisions, we

hypothesize that financially illiterate individuals will be more sensitive to information and how

financial information is framed. To examine this further, we provide individually-tailored

account balance figures8 to respondents receiving the Gain version of the fee information

worksheet used in the experiment. To construct the Loss version of worksheets, we compute the

difference between the largest 10-year account balance for each individual and each of the other

four AFPs in the menu. After fielding these experimental worksheets, we matched each

respondent’s top three AFPs they would ‘recommend to a friend’ to our own ranking of the AFPs

for that individual.


8
 Because some fund fees vary with contribution amounts, these valuations must be tailored to each respondent’s
own particulars. We created each person’s estimated anticipated 10-year fund balances net of fees for all possible
AFPs on offer by combining each respondent’s earnings from the 2006 EPS with historical returns and fees data for
each fund manager.


                                                        10
       Results appear in Table 8. Of the participants who received this information, 10 percent

more respondents who saw the Gain sheet elected the lowest-cost AFP, versus those receiving

the loss sheet (53 versus 48 percentage points). In general, people seem more responsive to

rewards versus losses. Table 8 also indicates that the more educated, men, and the higher earners

are more likely to elect the lowest-cost AFP, particularly when shown the Gain sheet.

Table 8 here

       We further examine how information framing and other factors affect fund choice by

testing for interaction effects of framing and literacy, so we can evaluate which population

subgroups are most sensitive to information framing. Table 9 reports Logit odds ratios from

analyses of whether respondents selected their lowest-cost AFPs, as a function of whether they

received the Gain or Loss worksheet (controlling on other factors). The first column pools

results across respondents given AFP information as either a Gain or a Loss; here we see that

providing the Gain sheet is very powerful, boosting the odds of choosing the most profitable

AFP by 26 percentage points. Quantitatively, showing participants a Gain worksheet has an

impact as large as the impact of having a post-secondary education and twice as large as the

impact of having above-median income. The measured effect is about the same as the impact of

a one unit increase in the financial literacy index.

Table 9 here

       In the second column, we add an interaction between financial literacy and how the

information was framed. Now the odds ratio is significant and less than one, implying that a one-

unit increase in the financial literacy index reduces the impact of information framing by

approximately 10 percentage points. Next, we add an interaction between framing and an

indicator if the person chose Now in the Game. We do not find a significant impact, as expected.




                                                  11
We would expect that choosing Now controlling for financial literacy should not have an impact

on how fund information is interpreted across frames, but instead only affect measures of

investments as we showed in the prior tables. It is also of interest to ask how framing interacts

with both education and income. When we add an interaction for having received a Gain sheet

and having post-secondary education, the odds ratio is significantly less than one for the

interaction, and the interaction financial literacy and a Gain sheet becomes insignificant.

Interestingly, the coefficient on the interaction between information framing and financial

literacy is stable across the two specifications, suggesting that financial literacy scores and

educational attainment are sufficiently uncorrelated to effectively test their separate influences

on the ranking of AFP choices. Our results suggest that education is a stronger determinant of

how sensitive respondents are to viewing information in Gains rather than Losses. Last, we add

yet another interaction term testing for a joint effect of higher income and receiving a gains

sheet. Here, the new interaction term is not statistically significant and the reported odds ratio is

near one.



Conclusions and Discussion

       This paper examines the roles of financial literacy and impatience on retirement saving

and investment behavior, using new data we have generated using the Chilean EPS. We measure

financial literacy as the ability to understand basic concepts like inflation, compounding, and

investment returns, and we measure impatience using a game designed to elicit preferences for

current gratification versus future gain and being able to follow through with it. We find that the

impatience measure strongly predicts respondents’ self-reported retirement saving and health

investments. Financial literacy is also associated with more retirement saving, but it is less




                                                 12
closely associated with sensitivity to framing of investment information. In ongoing work, we

are measuring the impact of impatience and financial literacy on actual saving, pension

accumulations, and investment in health and health practices.

       Our results should interest policymakers seeking to determine how to better shape the

environment in which individuals undertake saving and investment choices. Our results imply

that it may be useful to facilitate decision making, particularly among the less-educated, as well

as to facilitate people committing to and carrying out long-term financial decisions. As

individuals are being asked to exert more control over their own retirement accounts (e.g.,

401(k)’s) and other household investments, this raises a concern about whether consumers are

capable of making optimal investment and saving decisions. Further, the development of ever-

more complex financial products probably makes it difficult for consumers to use these sensibly.

What we have shown is that participant awareness of higher net-return funds can be greatly

enhanced when information on fees is simplified in terms of likely gains from selecting higher

net return funds. The impact of fund fee framing is largest for the least financially literate and the

lowest-educated groups. By contrast, choices made by the financially well-informed tend to be

less responsive to the information presentation, since those individuals tend to better understand

the financial concepts necessary to translate annual percentage rates into costs and benefits. In

the future, a field test of such policies would be the next step towards designing systems that

level the playing field across socioeconomic groups and enable participants to commit to take

actions now for greater gains later.

Notes: Offer Amount is the amount offered to respondents for choosing to mail in their supplemental survey and
receive compensation at a later date. Now is the decision to receive 5000 pesos at the time of survey rather than a
higher amount later. Later, No-Mail-In are those who chose to receive more than 5000 pesos later but did not mail in
the supplemental survey before the offer expired. Later, Mail-In chose to receive more than 5000 pesos later, mailed
in the supplemental survey, and received this higher amount.
