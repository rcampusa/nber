                                                ABSTRACT



        Based on 1986-1992 survey data of 22 midstream petrochemical           industries in Taiwan, the

empirical results of the export price, the markup ratio and the price-cost margin equations in this

study show that Taiwan’s petrochemical          firms absorb only a small portion of a given weighted

exchange rate change in their export prices, markup ratios and price-cost margins.        It implies that

Taiwan’s petrochemical firms have a weak pricing-to-market pattern. The empirical results may be

explained by the volatility of profitability,    high market concentration    and small export/domestic

production share. However, the impacts of the exchange rate change on the export price, markup

ratio and price-cost margin have a tendency to increase during the period of 1987 to 1992. The

tendency might be attributed to increasing competition of the petrochemical        markets in the world,

or Taiwanese firms’ gradual realization of the importance of holding their world market shares in

response to the exchange rate change.

I. Introduction



      In the 1980s there were many           significant    structural     changes    in Taiwan’s

economy.    One of them was the drastic appreciation of New Taiwan dollars. It can be

seen from table 1 that though the export price indexes had been decreasing along with

the appreciation     of NT dollars during this period, the magnitude          of the export price

indexes’ decline did not match that of the NT dollar appreciation. 1 Furthermore,               the

trade imbalance      kept growing.     Does this imply that there exists an incomplete

exchange    rate “pass-through”      in Taiwan’s export price indexes,           or do Taiwan’s

domestic firms have the “pricing-to-market”     behavior?z

      Most of the recent empirical studies show that firms in Newly Industrializing

Countries tend to have “pricing-to-market”       behavior in response to changes in real

exchange rates [Hooper & Mann (1989), Athukorala (1991), and Liu (1994), ...etc.].s

However, Marston (1990), Knetter (1993) and Athukorala & Menon (1994) find that

different industries even in the same country may not have identical behaviors toward

pricing-to-market.      Therefore,   if we want to investigate         the exchange    rate pass-

through pattern, it is more appropriate     to explain pricing-to-market         on the basis of

observable industry characteristics.     Similarly, Krugman (1987), Dombusch               (1987),

Feenstra (1987), Fisher (1989), Knetter (1989) and Shinjo (1993) also show that the

elements of market structure are very important in determining the degree of exchange

rate pass-through.

      There does exist a few studies which investigate the exchange rate pass-through

effects in Taiwan [Hooper & Mann (1989), Liu (1994) and Wu (1995)].                     However,

most of them are based on an aggregative level. As mentioned above, if we study the

pass-through effect by examining the general aggregate price indexes, we might have

misleading results due to the negligence      of market structure elements.           In order to

avoid the aggregation problem, in this paper we use survey data on the exports of 22
                                                                 Kuo-Liang Wang&     Chung-Shu    Wu       2




Taiwanese petrochemical               industries from 1986 to 1992 to investigate the exchange

rate pass-through           effect.    Moreover,   in addition   to production     cost and capacity

utilization,      special     attention   has been paid to the Herfindahl           Index   and price

elasticities of demand in order to emphasize the importance of market structure and

industry characteristics         in the studies of the exchange rate pass-through effects.q

       A number of important features should be noted when discussing the exchange

rate pass-through           effects of Taiwan’s petrochemical      industry.     First, though it is a

large-scale industry in Taiwan, it only exports a relatively small portion of its total

output.5 Secondly, it is a highly concentrated industry, i.e., it owns a relatively strong

power of monopoly.               Therefore, we expect this kind of industry to have a lower

incentive to adjust its markup ratio in response to the changing of exchange rates

except for the purpose of holding foreign market shares [Froot & Klemperer (1989)].

By studying these particular industries’ exchange rate pass-through                  effects, one can

not only examine whether all industries in Taiwan have manipulated the exchange rate

for the purpose of gaining an unfair competitive advantage in the international market,

but it also can provide us more information about industry-specific               pricing behavior.

       In addition to this section, the rest of this paper is organized as follows.              Section

2 sets up the analytical framework for our empirical analysis of exchange rate pass-

through and builds the empirical equations used in this study. Section 3 illustrates the

characteristics     of Taiwan’s petrochemical        industries and data description.       Section 4

presents and analyzes the econometric estimates of exchange rate pass-through effects.

The final section concludes the paper.



II. Analytical       Framework



      As mentioned by Hooper & Mann (1989), exchange rate pass-through                           can be

broadly defined as the extent to which a change in the nominal exchange rate induces
                                                            Kuo-Liang Wang&   Chung-Shu    Wu       3




a change in the import price. Since our analysis is focused on export price indexes, it

is natural to define the exchange rate pass-through        effect as the partial derivative of

export price indexes with respect to the exchange rate minus one.                    In addition,

following previous empirical researches [e.g. Hooper & Mann (1989),Marston(1990),

Kim (1990), Athukorala (1991), Athukorala & Menon (1994)], we adopt a variant of

markup models of price determination.       In this kind of framework, we can discuss the

strategic interaction between domestic and foreign firms operating through variations

in the markup.

      Under the assumption     of imperfect competition,           domestic firms more or less

have a capability to control their prices of output and set the home-currency              export

prices (PEX) at a markup (MK) over the level of normal unit production cost (MC):


              PEX = (1 + A4K)A4C                                                          (1)

      According   to the existing   literatures,     there are many factors that may have

impacts   on the markup     ratio, e.g., demand        pressures    in all markets    combined,

competitive   pressures   in foreign markets,       maintaining     foreign market    share, and

market structure. In this study, the demand pressures in all markets are proxied by the

capacity utilization rate (CU). As the capacity utilization rate goes up, it implies that

total demand in all markets is increasing.         It is then easier for the domestic firms to

raise domestic and export prices above marginal and average costs.            The competitive

pressures in the foreign markets are represented by the price elasticities            of demand

with respect to domestic firms in foreign markets (EL) and the weighted exchange rate

(RX). The pricing theory tells us that other things being equal, the markup ratios are

inversely related to elasticities of demand.       Therefore, the higher the price elasticities

of demand with respect to the domestic firms in the foreign markets, the less possible

it is for the domestic firms to raise export prices above marginal costs.             As for the

exchange rate, it partially reflects the pressure of the foreign competitive           price and

partially reflects domestic firms’ pricing strategy toward foreign market share [Mann
                                                               Kuo-Liang      Wang&     Chung-Shu    Wu   4




(1986), and Froot&Klemperer              (1989)].     Ontheother      hand, the market structure is

captured by the domestic market concentration              (H). It has been shown in oligopoly

theory that the higher the level of domestic market concentration,                 the more likely it is

that domestic firms will be able to raise domestic prices and, then, the export prices

above marginal and average cost [Khalizadeh-Shirazi                (1974)].    As a result, the markup

ratio function can be expressed as follows:

                            (+)    (-)    (+)   (+)
               MK = MK(CU,         EL, RX,      H)                                                  (2)

               Substituting equation (2) into equation (1), the export price equation can be

shown as:




                     O<al <l;      a2, a3, a4–>OC
                                                , a5 <O;              i=l,    ..,,22;

where lowercase letters represent logarithmic             values of variables,          and superscript   i

states the ith petrochemical      product and subscript t states the time period.

      Not all of the export prices of petrochemical           products are based on FOB terms,

some of them are based on C & F or CIF terms. When the distance between the home

and destination     countries increases, the transportation         cost and the probability          of an

accident occurring during shipping will go up, and the domestic firms will tend to

raise export prices. Therefore, we add a transportation              cost variable (TC) to equation

(3) to yield




                     O<al <l;      a2, a3, a4, a6>O;          a550

      The partial derivative ofpex with respect to rx, a,, measures the responsiveness

of the domestic currency export price to a change in the weighted exchange rate. The

pass-through coefficient or pricing to market coefficient (PTM) is then a, – 1, which

measures the effect of a changing exchange rate on the foreign currency price. At one
                                                                           Kuo-Liang Wang&    Chung-Shu    Wu      5




extreme,     if the domestic          firms are price takers, then               a, = 1, and exchange           rate

changes      are reflected         entirely     in domestic         currency     prices    through   a markup

adjustment leaving foreign currency prices unchanged while PTM will be zero. At the

opposite extreme, where the domestic firms do have market or monopoly power in the

foreign markets, changes in the exchange rate are passed through completely and the

markup      is lefi unchanged,          i.e.,   al = O and          PTM = –1.        In between       these two

extremes,    we have the case of incomplete                  pass-through        or pricing to market, i.e.,

–I<a,      –l<o.

        Rewriting equation (1) and substituting the related explanatory variables into the

equation, we can get a variant of the empirical model of the markup ratio equation as

follows:




                        o~flI~l;         ~2,~3,~4~o;               f15~o;

where      A4K = ( PEX – MC)/ MC.                Equation     (5) can directly measure the effects of

factors influencing       a change in the markup                    ratio and its estimation         results    are

supposed to be consistent with those in equation (4).

        Furthermore, we can discuss the pricing behavior of the exporting firms through

Price-Cost     Margin      (PCM).             Assuming      that    the PCM        function     has the same

explanatory variables as MK or pex, the PCM equation can be expressed as:


              PCM~ = y. +ylrxj +y2CU~ +y3H~ +y4tcj +Y5EL~ + E4f                                           (6)


                        O<y,<l;          y2,y3,y4~o;               Yj<o;

where PCA4 = ( PEX – A4C)/ PEX.                   However, the effect of exchange rate fluctuation

on PCM is not so clear as the above equations.                       Nevertheless,        it has been shown in

Appendix A that under some reasonable                    assumptions,          the exchange rate still has a

positive effect on PCM.

III. Data Descriptions        and Features      of Taiwan Petrochemical            Industries



      The data used in this study are based on the annual survey data of 22 midstream

petrochemical   industries in Taiwan for the period of 1986 to 1992. Though there are

more than thirty different products in the midstream petrochemical             industry, data on

some of these products are not complete.           Therefore, we only choose 22 of them in

our study.   Moreover, data for some related explanatory variables are missing before

1986, we have to limit our sampling              period to start from 1986.           The detailed

information about the 22 petrochemical          products, computations     of Herfindahl index,

price elasticities, weighted exchange rate and weighted transportation             cost, and related

data sources are enclosed in Appendix B and table B. 1.

      Before we begin our empirical analysis, it is worth describing the features of

Taiwan petrochemical      industries.   In table 2, we have shown some characteristics               of

those 22 petrochemical industries.         First, from the last column we can see that 10 out

of 22 industries’ Herfindahl indexes were one during the period, i,e., they have strong

monopoly power in the domestic market,            Secondly, from columns 4, 5 and 6 we can

find that only 5 of 22 industries’ average export/domestic       production ratios are higher

than 30 percent       during the period.        However,   most industries’        export/domestic

production ratios had been increasing during the period,        This implies that the foreign

countries’   market    shares have become         more and more        important      for Taiwan’s

petrochemical   industries.   Thirdly, in the early stage of the petrochemical           industries’

development, their focus was on the domestic market and not until the mid-1980s did

they start to export their products.    Moreover, most of the export destination countries

are small countries in which their domestic firms usually produce a small amount of

the related petrochemical      products.     It can be seen from table 3 that only a few

products’ export destination countries are developed countries.

IV. Estimation        Results



       Since each of equation (4), (5) and (6) in section II has different economic

implications,     in this section we will estimate the above mentioned equations and to

examine whether the empirical results are consistent or not. Table 4 reports empirical

results of the export price (pex), markup ratio (MK) and price-cost margin (PCM)

equations    for Taiwan’s petrochemical        industries.     Since all we have is 7 years of

annual sumey data for 22 petrochemical           industries, we adopt the pooling regression

procedure to estimate the three equations.           The explanatory      variables consist of unit

production      cost (me), weighted exchange rate (m), capacity utilization              rate (CU),

Herfindahl      Index (H), demand elasticity         (EL) and transportation       cost (tc).        The

production      cost, weighted exchange rate and transportation           cost are in logarithmic

form. Because not all variables have significant estimates, we report several variants

of estimates.     In addition to the coefficient for each variable, the table also reports the

adjusted Rz and root mean square error.

       The estimation      results of the export prices’ equations         show that, except for

demand elasticity,      all the explanatory    variables     have the right signs as expected.

Among them, unit production cost, weighted exchange rate, capacity utilization rate

and transportation     cost are significantly different from zero at the 10 or 5 percent level

of   significance,     while    the   market   concentration      and     demand     elasticity      are

insignificantly    different from zero. Though the effect of the exchange rate on export

prices is significantly different from zero, the magnitude is rather small and is around

0.07. This implies that on average, Taiwanese petrochemical               firms absorb only about

7 percent of a given exchange rate change in their export prices, i.e., the exchange rate

pass-through      effect is as high as 93 percent,     It is contrary to the general perception

that most exporters in developing countries have pricing to market behaviors.
                                                           Kuo-Liang Wang &Chung-Shu       Wu       8




       For the markup ratio function, the regression results are shown in the middle

part of table 4. It can be seen that the results are very similar to those in the export

price equations.     The weighted exchange rate, capacity utilization rate, transportation

cost and market concentration rate all have significant positive effects on the markup

ratio. Though demand price elasticity has the right sign, it is insignificantly          different

from zero.     Since the markup ratio is not expressed in logarithmic         form, we cannot

interpret the coefficient of the weighted exchange rate as an elasticity.            However, we

can approximate      it through dividing the coefficient by the sample mean of MK.              In

this way, we can get the elasticity of the markup ratio with respect to the weighted

exchange rate as around 0.19.6         The results of the price cost margin equation are

shown in the bottom of table 4. They are also very similar to those in the export price

and markup ratio equations.         The computed      elasticity of PCM with respect to the

weighted exchange rate is also around 0.19, which is very close to the findings of MK

equations. T Moreover, by referring to equation (A. 12) in the Appendix A, the positive

sign of the coefficient of the exchange rate in the PCM equation implies that firms in

Taiwanese     petrochemical     industries   and export    destination   countries    are in the

competitive situation.

       The empirical results of the export price, MK and PCM equations all show that

the impact of the exchange rate on the export price is relatively small, in the range

from 7% to 19Y0.          These results      are quite different    from economists’      general

impression.    Actually, from some existing empirical studies, exporters in developing

countries such as Korea and Taiwan do have pricing-to-market             behavior [Athukorala

(1991 ), Liu (1 994)]. However, why do the exporting firms of petrochemical             products

in Taiwan enjoy more than an 80°/0 pass-through           effect?    The possible reasons are

stated as follows.    First, it is a general feature in the petrochemical     industry that the

volatility of profitability   is very large. Therefore, firms are unwilling to change their

markup while the exchange rate fluctuates.          Second, from table 2 it has been shown
                                                             Kuo-Liang    Wang &Chung-Shu      Wu      9




that the petrochemical      industries    in Taiwan are highly concentrated.             They own a

strong monopoly power and have a large domestic market share.                     Moreover, as we

have shown in section 3, the export/domestic              production     share is relatively   small.

They do not rely on the foreign market to maintain production efficiency.                Third, most

of the markets to which Taiwan’s petrochemical             products being exported are small-

scale markets in which there do not existt domestic firms or their domestic firms

usually produce      a small amount        of the related products.         Therefore,    Taiwanese

petrochemical      firms can have a strong position toward those countries. This can also

be justified    by all the estimated       coefficients   of demand      elasticity   in the variant

equations being insignificantly     different from zero.

      It can be noted from table 1 that the NT/US$ exchange rate has been stabilizing

since 1989. It is interesting whether the exchange rate pass-through             effect of Taiwan’s

petrochemical      industries has structure changes or not [Kim (1990)].              However, our

data period is too short to analyze the time-varying           property of exchange rate pass-

through parameters.      Nevertheless,      we can discuss the issue by dividing our sample

period into two separate periods, and presen~ our estimation results in table 5 and table

6, respectively.     Comparing    the exchange rate parameters between these two tables,

we find that when the coefficients are significant, the exchange rate parameters in the

second period are all almost twice as much as those in the first period.              The exchange

rate elasticity of MK or PCM in the first period was around 13°/0, and in the second

period it was about 30Y0.8 In table 7 we also present the rolling estimation for every

four years of each equation.             It can be seen from the table that exchange                rate

elasticities of the estimated parameters do have the tendency to increase through time.

By referring to equation (A-12) in the Appendix A, it implies that when the elasticity

of collusion{ ~ ) is negative and the absolute value of ~ is increasing, the impact of

exchange rate change on PCM will be positive and increasing.                     That is, Taiwan’s

petrochemical export firms have been more and more pricing to market in recent years.
                                                                   Kuo-Liang    Wang &Chung-Shu      Wu   10




This implication        may be justified by the fact that while petrochemical               firms in most

countries     have continued          expanding     their capacities      since   1986, the degree        of

competition         in the world petrochemical       markets has become increasing.           In addition,

Taiwanese petrochemical            firms have not been so well protected as before in holding

their market shares in the domestic markets since the government lifted all restrictions

on the import of petrochemical products and lowered the related import tariffs in 1986.

They gradually realize that a proper pricing behavior in response to exchange rate

changes is very important for them to penetrate the world market, to reach minimum

efficient scale and to attain production efficiency.               On the other hand, the increasing

degree      of pricing-to-market         may     also be explained           by acquiring    the modem

management          and marketing knowledge           of entrepreneurs       in Taiwan’s petrochemical

industries.    Therefore, they are increasingly aware of the importance of holding world

market share in order to maintain a long-run business [Froot & Klemperer ( 1989)].9



V. Conclusion



       In     the     existing    literatures,    there   is   a   general     perception    that    Newly

Industrializing       Countries    like Korea and Taiwan have little control over prices at

which they sell and therefore exchange rate changes may not have significant impacts

on their foreign currency-denominated               export prices” in international markets.         In this

paper we investigate a special industry, petrochemicals,                 which has a high monopoly

power and faces weak competition in export destination countries, to demonstrate that

not all industries in Taiwan’s export sectors have a strong pricing-to-market                       pattern.

The empirical results show that Taiwanese petrochemical                        export firms absorb only

about 7 percent of a given weighted exchange rate change in their export prices, and a

19 percent impact of a one percent exchange rate change on the markup ratio or price-

cost margin.          It implies that Taiwan’s petrochemical             industries   have had a weak
                                                              Kuo-Liang   Wang&   Chung-Shu   Wu   11




pricing-to-market    pattern during the period of 1987 to 1992.             The empirical results

may be explained by the large volatility           of profitability,   high market concentration,

and small export/domestic       production   share.     These empirical results further support

the argument, pointed by Knetter (1993), that the range of parameter estimates across

industries within each source country is very wide and there exist little differences in

behavior within common industries of different source countries.               We also show that

though influences of the exchange rate on export prices, MK or PCM are relatively

low in Taiwan’s petrochemical        industries,     the impacts have a tendency to increase

over time.      This might be attributed to increasing competition           in the world market

and/or the realization     of   the importance        of world market shares for Taiwanese

petrochemical     export firms. Finally, our results are very preliminary due to the short

sampling period and insufficient data of foreign countries.            If we could have prices of

petrochemical     products in every export destination          countries, we would have more

reasonable proxies for demand pressures.           In addition, more rigorous analyses on the

causes for structural change of pricing-to-market            and the cyclical behavior of pass-

through effects are worth of future research.

NOTES



1. It can be seen from table 1 that the average NT/US$            exchange    rate had been

  decreasing from 36.84 in 1981 to 26.41 in 1989, which is over a 38.31 percent

  appreciation.     However, during the same period the export price indexes dropped

  from 111.68 to 97.40, only decreasing 12.79 percent.

2. Incomplete     exchange rate pass-through   is ofien mentioned     as one of the main

  reasons for sluggish adjustment in the trade imbalance among countries.

3. For the case of Japan and other countries, please see Athulorala & Menon (1994),

  Froot & Klemperer (1989), Knetter (1993), Marston (1990), Menon (1995), Ohno

  (1989), etc.

4. Herfindahl Index is a measure of market concentration     or fewness, and is equal to

  the sum of squares of the market shares of the firms in the market.

5. It can be seen from table 2 that there were 12 out of 22 industries whose average

  export/domestic     production share was less that 10 percent during the period 1986

  to 1992.

6. The sample mean of markup ratio during the period 1987 to 1992 is 0.737.

7. The sample mean of price cost margin for the sampling period is 0.333.

8, The sample means of MK and PCM for first period are 0.769, 0.359, and 0.706,

  0.307 for second period, respectively.

9. Since 1985, accompanied      by the recovery of the world economy, petrochemical

  industries world wide have vigorously expanded their production            capacity, which

  increases the degree of competition among world petrochemical        exporters.

Appendix        A. Derivation      of the Impact       of the Exchange         Rate on PCM



        Following     Cowling & Waterson (1976), Brander & Krugman (1983) and Dei

(1990), we envisage two open economies, home and foreign countries.                    Assume that

there is a monopolist producing a homogeneous               product with the same cost condition,

respectively,     in both countries.    Suppose that marginal costs are constant at c for both

monopolists,      and the inverse market demand functions in both countries are as follows:


                Pd =Pd(xh+x”),           Pd’<o                                             (A-1)


                P“ = P“’(x’ +Xf),        x’” = x’ +Xf,        P“’’<();                     (A-2)

where Pd and P 11represent prices at home and in the foreign countries, respectively;

Xh and X’, quantities produced by the domestic firm and sold at home and in the

foreign countries, respectively;        X~ and Xy , quantities produced by the foreign firm

and sold at home and in the foreign countries,                 respectively;    X”,   total quantity

demanded in the foreign country.           Let P’ = r. P’”, where p’ represents the home-

currency export price and r is the exchange rate.              Then, the domestic firm’s and the

foreign firm’s profits can be formulated as follows:


                Zd =( Pd–c)xh+(Pe          –c)x’–      Fd                                  (A-3)


                m’”= (rP’’’-c)x~       +(P~ -C)xm      -F”;                                (A-4)

where    Xd and n’” represent           the domestic     firm’s and the foreign firm’s profits,

respectively;       Fd and ~’”, the domestic firm’s and the foreign firm’s fixed costs,

respective y.

        Assuming profit-maximizing         behavior and Cournot zero conjectural variation,

the first-order conditions for a maximum can be derived as follows:
                dnd
                — - P’ +rxe P’’’-c=o                                                      (A-5)

            &f

Taking   total differentiation   of equations    (A-5) and (A-6), and rearranging            and




                                                                                    (A-7)


Assuming that the costs of production remain constant (i.e., dC = O), we can obtain

by the Cramer’s Rule
            x’         rpw’ [(P“” x’   - 2X’)    - P“]
             a=                  3(rP”” )2

                   7              otherwise,
            Xf         rpw’[(P’” x’ - 2X’)       - P“’]
             a=                   3(rP”” )2

                   ?              otherwise,

where the absolute value of –3X@P”’ is assumed to be greater than that of P ‘r.

      In order to allow possible collusion between the domestic and foreign firms, we

relax the assumption that the domestic firm expects no response to its output change

from the foreign firm. Therefore, equation (A-5) becomes
                     ~xf
           rXePw’(l+ ~)+rP’”-C=O                                                  (A-1O)


By rearranging and manipulating equation (A-10), we can obtain

            pcM.p’-c=(,+:fl)~;
                                                                                  (A-n)

differentiation       of equation (A-11) with respect to r and referring to equations (A-8)

and (A-9), we can obtain
