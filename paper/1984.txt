                             Why Are Children Poor?




                                     ABSTRACT

     Data from the 1960, 1970, and 1980 Censuses of Population and the

Current Population Surveys of 1980 and 1985 are used to describe and analyze

the economic position of children with special emphasis on cross-section

differences and variation over time in the incidence of poverty. Between

1959 and 1979 the income available to children tended to follow the same

pattern as adult income, but between 1979 and 1984 the trends for children

were very unfavorable. Poverty rose, average income fell, and income

inequality increased. Contrary to popular belief, the increase in female-

headed households played only a small part in the growth of poverty among

children since 1979. Income available to children fell because households

with children are highly dependent on labor income- -which fell for all age

groups. The elderly (65+), who derive 75 percent of their income from

nonlabor sources (e.g., social security, private pensions, interest), were

the only age group to experience gains in real per capita income during

1979-84. The conclusions about trends in the money income available to

children and adults are relatively unchanged when estimates of the value of

nonmarket production and in-kind government social welfare programs are

added to money income.

                           WHY ARE CHILDREN POOR?

                              Victor   R. Fuchs



     A substantial improvement in the income of elderly Americans is leading

some social scientists to redirect attention to the economic problems of

children.1- This redirection is very timely. Although real income per

capita in the United States increased slightly between 1979 and 1984, the

proportion of children living in poverty also increased- -from 16.6 to 20.9

percent. Among black children, almost half were in poverty in 1984. Concern

over the economic position of children stems from an interest in the

country's future because resources devoted to children are a major form of

private and social investment. In addition, a country that takes pride in

providing equality of opportunity needs a better understanding of

differences among children in the resources available to them.

     Why are children poor? This paper provides several answers to this

question, but always in the context of economic poverty. Children can, of

course, be poor in other ways as well. Some are physically or mentally

abused; some are neglected or exploited. Children can be in poor health,

emotionally starved, or deprived of an adequate education. The emphasis on

economic measures is not to suggest that the non-economic aspects of

childhood are unimportant, but access to a reasonable level of goods and

services is usually an important factor in overall well-being--for children

as well as for adults.

     Even when the inquiry is limited to the economic position of children a

precise description is beyond reach because many of the necessary data are

not available. For instance, we do not know how the income of individual

households is shared within those households, or even how, on average, the


                                        1
sharing between adults and children may have changed over time. This paper

assumes that household income is shared equally among all members of a

household. Alternative sharing rules would not have much effect on the

analysis provided the rule was relatively constant over time and between

different types of households. Another possible limitation concerns possible

transfers of income between households (e.g., gifts from grandparents). With

the exception of alimony and child support payments, this paper omits inter-

household transfers because data are not available.2 Although access to

goods and services depends on more than money income, most measures of

poverty concentrate on money, and that practice is followed here. Toward the

end of the paper, however, money income measures are supplemented in two

ways. First, an estimate is made of norimarket production of goods and

services within households. Second, the value of in-kind government programs

in health, education, and social services is estimated and allocated to

children and adults.

     The question of economic poverty among children can be explored from

several perspectives. One might, for instance, be interested in the absolute

level of living of children, in which case the overall state of the economy

is surely the most important factor. It is no mystery why the children of

India are poor--India is a poor country. In the United States as well, the

proportion of children living in poverty tends to change with changes in the

economy as a whole. For instance, the incidence dropped almost 10 percentage

points between 1959 and 1969, primarily because of the economic boom of the

1960s.

     A more interesting analytical question is why the economic position of

children differs from that of adults. The answer is to be found in variation

in the number of children across households and the relation between this



                                      2
variation and the distribution of household income. The importance of number

of children can be shown with a simple example. Suppose that every household

consists of two adults and three children. In that case there can be no

difference between children and adults in available per capita income

(assuming equal sharing), regardless of the distribution of income across

households. But suppose one-third of the households have two children, one-

third three children, and one-third four children (with two adults in each

household). If household income is not correlated with size of household,

the average income available per child is less than average income per adult

because more of the children are in larger households with lower per capita

income. In this example, the child/adult income ratio is â€¢953 If the

variance in household size is greater, say one-fifth of the households each

having one, two, three, four, or five children (with two adults per

household), the ratio of average income available per child to that of the

average adult would be .86. A positive correlation between household income

and household size would tend to raise the ratio back toward unity, but a

negative correlation would decrease it further.

    A third type of question concerns differences among children. Why are

some children poor and others not? Differences in the number of children per

household can be an important part of the answer, but other features of the

household such as the age, education, or sex of the adults are also

relevant. For instance, how much of the recent growth of poverty among

children can be accounted for by an increase in female-headed households?

Or, in the light of major reductions in black-white earnings differentials,

why is poverty so much more prevalent among black children than among white?

     This paper uses data from the Censuses of Population of 1960, 1970, and

1980, and the Current Population Surveys of March 1980 and March l985 to

shed light on several dimensions of children's poverty. Poverty levels for


                                      3
each household in each year are set according to the official Census Bureau

weights that establish income thresholds based on the number of adults and

number of children in the household.6 For instance, a household with two

adults and two children has a poverty threshold 1.51 times that of a

household with two adults, and 1.95 times a one-adult household. Once a

household is identified as having total money income below the poverty

threshold, all the individuals in that household are designated as being in

poverty. The poverty thresholds are adjusted each year to take account of

changes in the price level.

     As a supplement to the poverty analysis, the paper also considers

trends in the average income available to children (and adults). The average

is calculated in two ways. First, the total income of each household is

divided by the number of individuals in that household to obtain   ttper

capita" income. No distinction is made between adults and children and there

is no allowance for economies of scale.7 The second approach, "adjusted per

capita income," divides total household income by one if there is one person

in the household, and by various multiples of one for other households,

depending on the number of adults and number of children present. The

multiple is equal to the ratio of the Census poverty level for that

particular type of household to the level for a one-person household. For

instance, the income in a two-adult, two-child household is divided by 1.95

to obtain adjusted per capita income because the poverty threshold for such

a household is 1.95 times the threshold for a one-person household.8

     The next section describes and analyzes cross-section differences and

changes over time in the incidence of poverty. Then trends in average income

of children and adults and in income inequality are discussed. The final set

of results shows how inclusion of nonmarket production and in-kind

government programs modifies conclusions based on money income alone.

The Incidence of Poverty

     The basic statistics describing the incidence of poverty among children

and adults over the past quarter-century are set out in Table 1. We see that

the trends for children and adults, and whites and blacks, generally follow a

similar pattern: huge declines in poverty during the prosperous l960s, much

smaller declines in the l970s (with a small increase for white children),

and increases in the l980s. There are, however, interesting differences in

both levels and trends. In every year the level of poverty is always much

higher for children than for adults, and much higher for blacks than for

whites. The relative gap between children and adults has tended to increase

since 1969 (especially for whites) while the relative gap between the races

has declined for children while remaining approximately constant for adults.

The tables that follow provide some understanding of the sources of these

differences in levels and trends.

     The data in Table 2 help answer the question "Why are children poor

relative to adults?" We see that there is considerable variation in the

number of children per household; in 1959 the actual distribution was not

very far from one-fifth in each of five different size classes. This

variation would not put children at a disadvantage if household income rose

proportionately with the number of children, but the correlation is actually

in the opposite direction: household income falls in the larger households,

and therefore per capita income falls precipitously. Even after adjustment

for economies of scale, per capita income is much lower in the households

with many children.

     In contrast to children, only a small percentage of adults live in the

households with many children, and by 1984 well over half of all adults were

in households that had no children. These adults had an adjusted (for

economies of scale) per capita income that was 57 percent greater than the

average available to children; the unadjusted difference in per capita

income was 110 percent.

     Each period since 1959 had its own distinctive pattern of change.

During the 1960s the distribution of number of children remained very stable

while the negative correlation between household size and income diminished.

This tended to help children relative to adults. Between 1969 and 1979 the

income correlation became more negative, offsetting a big reduction in the

proportion of children living in large households. Between 1979 and 1984 the

distribution of number of children was again stable while the relative

income position of the households with many children deteriorated further.

     Taking the 25-year period as a whole, a reduction in the proportion of

children living in large households tended to help the economic position of

children, but a fall in the relative income of households with many children

tended to hurt them. The increasing proportion of adults who lived apart

from children and the increase in the relative income of those households

contributed to the widening gap between adults and children. To gain further

insights concerning these trends, we turn to a multivariate analysis where

the number of children per household is considered simultaneously with other

household characteristics.

     To set the stage for the muitivariate analysis, we note in Table 3 that

the proportion of children in poverty varies not only with race and number

of children but also with region, sex and marital status of the adults in

the household, as well as the education and age of the householder (head of

household). Poverty rates for children are particularly high for blacks, and

in households that do not have an adult male, that have five or more

children, and where the householder has less than nine years of education or

is under 25 years of age.

     The relationship between children's poverty and each of these

variables, holding constant the levels of the other variables, is shown in

Table 4, which reports the results of regressing poverty status (a

dichotomous variable) on a series of dummy variables representing the

household characteristics. Logit regressions estimated by maximum likelihood

are theoretically preferable to the OLS method reported in Table 4, but the

results when evaluated at the means of the variables are sufficiently close

to the OLS results that the latter are reported here to simplify the

exposition.

     The multivariate approach sharply reduces the influence of some

variables such as race and region, while others such as the absence of a man

in the household remain very large. Many of the coefficients are stable

across the years, but region and race show substantial change. In 1959,

ceteris paribus, there was a 13 percentage point differential between

Southern children and other children in the probability of being in poverty.

By 1984 the regional differential had completely disappeared. The

coefficient for black fell in half between 1959 and 1979, but showed no

further decline between 1979 and 1984.

     Je saw in Table 2 that the distribution of children by size of

household changed markedly between 1969 and 1979 and that this change,

ceteris paribus, would tend to increase the income available per child.

Other compositional changes that affected children were also occurring, as

shown in Table 5. Of particular relevance was a shift of children from

households with a married couple to those with no man, and an increase in

the proportion of children living with householders who had completed 12

years or more of schooling. The information about changes in the

distribution of children by household characteristics can be combined with

the regression coefficients reported in Table 4 to get some sense of the

relation between these compositional changes and the overall change in

poverty among children.

     Table 5 reports the results of such a statistical decomposition for

each of the three periods. These figures were obtained in the following way:

the change in the proportion of children in each group between each pair of

years was multiplied by the average of the coefficients for that group in

the two years. For example, the regression coefficients for South in 1959

and 1969, .13 and .07, tell us that, ceteris paribus, during this period

living in the South added, on average, 10 percentage points to the

probability of a child being in poverty. Thus the decline of one percentage

point (from 32 to 31 percent) in the proportion of children actually living

in the South would, ceteris paribus, have produced an overall decline in

children's poverty of 0.1 percentage points (0.1 x 1.0).

     Similar calculations were made for each variable and, in the case of a

set of related dummy variables such as number of children, the results were

aggregated to show the total change in poverty implied by the regression

coefficients and the changes in distribution of children. The change in the

intercept between two regressions shows the change in poverty implied for

the omitted group, i.e., white, non-South, married couple, three children,

householder with 12 years of schooling, and aged 25-34. The sum of all the

changes minus the actual change in percent in poverty yields the unallocated

change. This reflects changes in the poverty rates of other groups relative

to the omitted group (i.e., changes in the regression coefficients) as well

as changes not captured by this statistical decomposition. This accounting

framework is suggestive of the principal variables associated with changes



                                     13
in poverty among children, but it cannot be interpreted as providing proof

of causality. Changes in some variables, such as the number of children per

household or the proportion of female households, are treated in this

framework as exogenous, but they themselves may be determined by changes in

household income.

     Looking at the results for 1959-69 we see that the most important

compositional changes were the shift in sex and marital status of adults,

which tended to indrease poverty in children, and the increase in the

education of householders, which tended to reduce poverty. In 1969-79 these

variables continued to act in the same way, but the shift in the

distribution of children by number in household was also a major factor

tending to reduce children's poverty. In the most recent period, 1979-84,

all three of these variables were at work, but the net effect of the

compositional shifts was very small. Perhaps the most important inference to

be drawn from Table 6 is that the growth of female households can account

for only a small part of the recent increase in poverty among children. This

conclusion is confirmed by a separate calculation: when children in female

households are eliminated from both the 1979 and 1984 samples, the remaining

children show a 3.3 percentage point increase in the incidence of poverty

between those years. This deterioration in the economic position of children

is explored in greater detail later in this paper.

     Poverty has always been much more widespread among black than white

children. Why is this so? In particular, how much of the differential can be

accounted for by race differences in size of household, sex and marital

status of adults in household, education of householder, and so on? The

method of statistical decomposition used to analyze changes in poverty over

time can also be used to account for the black-white differential in poverty

at given points in time. The results reported in Table 7 were obtained by

multiplying the regression coefficients of Table 5 by the black-white

differences in the percentage distribution of children according to the

various household characteristics.

     We see that in 1959 the poverty rate among black children was 44.3

percentage points greater than among white. The race difference in

distribution of children by number of children in household accounted for

8.0 percentage points, the difference in education of householder 7.4

percentage points, and so on. The total differential accounted for by

composition differences was 25.3 percentage points. The remainder, 19.0

percentage points, is the black-white differential, holding constant the

influence of the other variables.

     In 1969 (and all subsequent years) the race difference in sex and

marital status became more important and was the largest compositional

factor. Race differences in number of children and education of householder

became less important and region became much less important. The fact that

blacks are disproportionally in the South cannot account for race

differences in poverty once the overall regional difference in poverty rates

disappears.

     In 1979 and 1984 the sex and marital status variables were even more

important, both absolutely and relatively. In those years the race

difference in these variables accounted for more of the overall differential

in poverty than did any other factor. The contrast between 1959 and 1984 in

this respect is particularly striking. In the former year the sex and

marital status variables accounted for only 12 percent (5.1 Ã· 44.3) of the

race differential in children's poverty. In the most recent year they

accounted for 40 percent (11.1 Ã· 27.9) of the differential. Excluding

children in female households, the black-white gap in children's poverty in

1984 is 16 percentage points.

Average Income and Income Inequality

     The poverty measures provide information about the lower end of the

income distribution. Additional insights concerning the economic position of

children can be obtained from an examination of levels and trends in average

income and income inequality. Table 8 shows the average income available to

children and adults in 1984 as well as rates of change in average income for

the three periods covered in this paper. Both the per capita and adjusted

per capita measures are presented.

     We see that the level of adjusted per capita income is substantially

higher than the unadjusted version because the latter makes no allowance for

economies of scale. Thus the difference between the two measures is greater,

the larger is the household. When households get smaller over time, as

during the 1969-79 period, per capita income rises more rapidly than does

the adjusted measure, but comparisons of rates of change between children

and adults, whites and blacks, or between subperiods, yield similar

qualitative conclusions for both measures. Given the objectives of this

paper, probably the most important conclusion to be drawn from Table 8 is

that average income available to children grew about as rapidly as adult

income until 1979 (and more rapidly for black children), but that since 1979

the trend has been much worse for children than for adults.

     The negative experience of children during 1979-84 is largely the

result of disparate income trends by age of adult. The elderly (65 and over)

did much better than other adults, but only five percent of them live in

households with children. By contrast, one-half of adults under age 65 live

with children. Between 1979 and 1984 the per capita income of persons 65 and

over grew at 2.7 percent per annum, while adults ages 25-64 had zero growth

and those ages 18-24 experienced a decline in per capita income of 1.5

percent per annum.1Â°

     Why did per capita income grow so much more rapidly for the elderly?

The answer can be found by disaggregating income into its labor and rionlabor

(including transfer) components (see Table 9). Within each category the

income of the elderly did not grow more rapidly than the income of other

adults; on the contrary, it lagged behind the other groups. Total income

grew more rapidly for the elderly because nonlabor income at all ages

increased while labor income decreased.11 The former accounted for 74

percent of total 1979 income at ages 65+, but only 12 percent and 10 percent

at ages 25-64 and 18-24, respectively. In summary, when income is

disaggregated into its labor and nonlabor components the rates for children

and adults are similar. The disparate trend overall is attributable to the

fast-growing nonlabor income accounting for a much larger share of adults'

income, especially adults 65 and over.

     The unfavorable trend in average income available to children since

1979 has been exacerbated by an increase in income inequality among

children. Inequality, as measured by the coefficient of variation (standard

deviation divided by the mean), increased between 1979 and 1984 by 4.8

percentage points of the mean after decreasing by 9.4 percentage points

between 1959 and 1979. The increase for black children since 1979 was 6.6

percentage points- -more than reversing the decrease of 2.4 percentage points

in the 20 years prior to 1979.

     In 1984 the coefficient of variation of per capita income available to

black children was 93.5 percent, much higher than the 72.8 figure for

whites. Much of this differential is attributable to the large proportion of

black children living in female households (with low per capita income).

Even when these households are excluded, however, income inequality is still

greater for black children: 80.6 percent vs. 68.8 percent for white.

Norimarket Production and In-Kind Transfers

     The economic position of children (and adults) depends on more than

money income. Measured in dollar value, about one-third of the goods and

services consumed in American households is produced in those households in

the form of meal preparation, housecleaning, child care, and other kinds of

norimarket production)2 The extent to which children can benefit from such

production depends heavily on the presence of adults in the household and on

the extent to which those adults are, or are not, also engaged in work

outside the home.

     During the past quarter-century there have been several significant

changes in the living arrangements of children. First, there has been a

large increase in the proportion of children living in households with only

one adult. This increase was particularly large for black children: by 1985

one out of every three black children (and one out of nine white children)

was in such a household. Second, there has been a large increase in the

proportion of children in households in which there is no adult out of the

labor force. The increase in this category was much greater for white

children than for black. Even among those under the age of six, more than

one-third of white children lived in households with no adult out of the

labor force. These changes tend to reduce the amount of home-produced goods

and services.

     In order to estimate the nonmarket production of goods and services

available to children and adults, ordinary least squares regressions were

run on 1975-76 time diary data provided by the University of Michigan's

Institute for Social Research)3 Separate regression equations for men and

women were estimated, with hours of housework (or child care) as the

dependent variable. The predictor variables included race, age, marital

status, hours of market work, and number and age of children. Average


                                     22
housework and child care hours worked by men and women in 1959, 1969, 1979,

 and 1984 were estimated by applying the 1975-76 cross-section parameters to

 the characteristics of the individuals in the Census and CPS samples in the

respective years)-4

     The value of a nonmarket hour of production was set equal to the

individual's hourly wage if the individual worked at least 500 hours in the

market. For other individuals, an hour of housework or child care was valued

by the average hourly wage earned by market workers of the same sex, race,

age, and education. The value of housework was allocated to children and

adults on a per capita basis exactly the same way as money income was

allocated. The value of child care hours was allocated only to children; the

household's total child care was divided by the number of children.

     Over the full 25-year span the growth of per capita nonmarket income of

children lagged slightly behind that of adults (see Table 10). This is

attributable to the shift of children into female households and of adults

into households without children. When nonmarket and money income are

aggregated, the adult-child gap in growth rates is somewhat larger than for

either nonmarket or money income alone. The reason is that nonmarket income

grew less rapidly than money income for both children and adults, and

children are more dependent on nonmarket income than are adults. In 1984 the

ratio of nonniarket to money income was .86 for children and only .52 for

adults. For children in female households the ratio was 1.16; that is, the

value of nonmarket production exceeded that of money income by 16 percent.

Inclusion of nonmarket income reduces slightly the adult-child gap for 1979-84

because adults experienced a bigger decline in nonmarket income than did

children.

     In addition to output produced at home, children (and adults) benefit

from the goods and services such as health, education, and social services

that are provided in kind by government. The value of these goods and

servi es is typically not included in official measures of income or

pov cy, and have not been included in the measures presented thus far.

Tale 10, however, provides rough estimates of the value of these

expenditures and shows how trends in such governmental spending have

affected the economic position of children in comparison to adults.

     Total expenditures for social welfare by federal, state, and local

governments amounted to $642 billion in 1983.15 Of that total, approximately

$312 billion represented cash transfers such as social security retirement

income, public employee retirement income, and veterans' pensions. These

expenditures are already included in the money income measures and do not

enter into the following discussion.

     Of the remaining $330 billion of social welfare expenditures,

approximately $145 billion (44 percent) was spent for goods and services

provided to children, and $185 billion (56 percent) for goods and services

provided to adults. These estimates are subject to some error, but probably

not much because most of the major categories of expenditures are for

programs that are exclusively for children or exclusively for adults. Those

that are exclusively for children totaled $116 billion, of which $110

billion was for elementary and secondary education (including construction)

and the balance for child nutrition, maternal and child health, and child

welfare programs. Many other government programs such as Medicare ($57

billion) and higher education ($32 billion) provide services almost

exclusively for adults. The total value of such programs in 1983 was $106

billion.

     A third category of programs, such as Medicaid, housing, food stamps,

and the like, provide goods and services to adults and children. Their



                                       25
aggregate value in 1983 was $108 billion. Assuming that children and adults

benefited equally from these programs on a per capita basis,16 approximately

$29 billion was for the benefit of children and $79 billion for adults. In

1959 over 60 percent of in-kind social welfare expenditures were exclusively

for children (mostly education) and the balance divided equally between

programs that were exclusively for adults and those that served both adults

and children.

     During 1959-84 the rate of growth of such expenditures on a per capita

basis was more than twice as rapid for adults as for children. In 1979-84

the rate of decline was more rapid for children than for adults. When these

in-kind social welfare expenditures are added to money income, however, the

differential rates of change between children and adults are similar to

those for money income. This is also true when all three sources are

aggregated, except that the gap between children and adults during 1979-84

is 0.37 percent per annum smaller than for money income alone.




                                  Summary

     Poverty among children was more widespread in 1984 than in 1979 or

1969; the rate of increase during 1979-84 was almost as rapid as the rate of

decrease from 1959 to 1969. Contrary to popular belief, the increase in

female-headed households played only a small part in the growth of poverty

among children since 1979. The biggest factor was a fall in average income

available to children in all kinds of households; a second factor was an

increase in income inequality. Income available to children fell because

households with children are highly dependent on labor income--which fell

for all age groups. The elderly (65+), who derive 75 percent of their income

from nonlabor sources (e.g., social security, private pensions, interest),


                                     26
were the only age group to experience gains in real per capita income during

1979-84.

     In 1984 the poverty rate among black children was 45 percent, compared

with 17 percent for white. A substantial portion of this differential

(two-fifths) is accounted for by the race difference in proportion of

children living in female households. About one-fourth is accounted for by

race differences in education and number of children in the household.

     Between 1969 and 1979 the proportion of children (all races) living in

households with four or more children dropped from 36 to 20 percent. Other

things equal, the decrease in large households helps the economic position

of children because per capita income tends to be lowest in those

households. Between 1979 and 1984 there was a very small decline, and, given

the present low fertility rate, there does not seem to be much possibility

of further improvement in the economic position of children from that source.

     The conclusions about trends in the money income of children and adults

are relatively unchanged when estimates of the value of nonmarket production

and in-kind government social welfare programs are added to money income.

     2. Fragmentary data from a household survey sponsored by the

President's Commission on Pension Policy suggests that these transfers are

not large relative to conventional household income. In August 1979, 18.4

percent of the households acknowledged receiving a transfer during the first

eight months of that year. The average transfer was a bit over $2,000, which

means that the average transfer spread over all households would have been

about $400. Only 27 percent of the recipient families had a child age 18 or

under. See Donald Cox and Fredric Raines, "Interfamily Transfers and Income

Redistribution," in Martin David and Timothy Smeeding (eds.), Horizontal

Equity, Uncertainty, and Economic Well-Being, Studies in Income and Wealth,

Vol. 50, National Bureau of Economic Research, Chicago, University of

Chicago Press, 1985, pp. 393-421.

     3. If per capita income in the three-child households is set equal to

100, it would be 125 in the two-child households and 83.33 in those with

four children. Average income per adult would be 102.78, but only 98.15 per

child because 4/9 of the children are in the larger households and only 2/9

in the smaller ones.

     4. If children required less income than adults, the effect of

variance in the number of children per household would be diminished, but

would still work in the same direction. For instance, if each child required

only one-half the income of an adult, the .86 ratio derived in the text

would rise to .90.

        5. Because the samples and survey methods differ somewhat between the

Current Population Survey and the Censuses, the change between the 1980 and

1985 Surveys is linked to the changes in the earlier Censuses to facilitate

comparison between 1959 and 1984.

        6. The official poverty statistics are actually based on families

rather than households, but given the marked changes in the legal status

of adults who share the same household it seems more appropriate to use

a household approach throughout the period. The poverty threshold for a two-

adult, two-child household in 1984 was $10,500.

        7. This is equivalent to the procedure often followed in international

comparisons or in tracking economic well-being within a single country over

time.

        8. This is only one of many possible ways of adjusting for household

size and composition. See Terry R. Johnson and John H. Pencavel, "Welfare

Payments and Family Composition," in P. K. Robins, R. C. Spiegelman, S.

Weiner, and J. C. Bell (eds.), A Guaranteed Annual Income: Evidence from a

Social Experiment, New York, Academic Press, 1980, pp. 223-240. The method

used in this paper is consistent with the method used to set poverty

thresholds for different types of households.

        9.   In 1959, for instance, the mean deviation between OLS coefficients

and those implied by the logit regression is only two percentage points.

    10.      The rates of growth of adlusted per capita income by age were 2.6

percent, -0.2 percent, and -1.2 percent, respectively.

    11. For men about 70 years of age in 1978 over half of nonlabor income

came from social security and related government payments; the other major

sources were private pensions and interest and dividends. Cf. Michael D.
