                                            ABSTRACT



       We have recently initiated the Survey of Economic Expectations      (SEE) in an effort to learn

how Americans perceive their near-term futures. This paper uses SEE data on over two thousand

labor force participants interviewed in 1994 and 1995 to describe how Americans in the labor force

perceive the risk of near-term economic misfortune.      We measure economic insecurity through

responses to questions eliciting subjective probabilities of three events in the year ahead: absence

of health insurance, victimization by burglary, and job loss. With item response rates exceeding 98

percent, respondents clearly are willing to answer the expectations questions and they appear to do

so in a meaningful way. Using the responses to classify individuals as relatively secure, relatively

insecure, and highly insecure, we find that respondents with a high risk of one adverse outcome tend

also to perceive high risks of the other outcomes. Economic insecurity tends to decline with age and

with schooling.   Black respondents perceive much greater insecurity than do whites, especially

among males. Within the period 1994-1995, we find some time-series variation in insecurity but no

clear trends. We find that expectations and realizations of health insurance coverage and of jobs tend

to match up quite closely, but respondents substantially overpredict the risk of burglary.

1. Introduction



       During the first few months of 1996, economic insecurity became a focus of

media attention in the United States.               The New York Times (March 3-9) ran a week-

long series on “The Downsizing of America,”                 Business Week (March 11) devoted a

cover story to “Economic Anxiety,” and The Economist (April 6) offered its own

perspective       on   “Learning    to     Cope”   with   economic    insecurity.      This    public

discourse coincided with policy proposals intended to reduce insecurity, such as

the Kassebaum-Kennedy            bill    (S 1028) to      increase   the    portability   of   health

insurance and the “American Workers Economic Security Act” to reduce taxes on

corporations which “treat workers fairly” and to restrain corporate mergers and

acquisitions, among other provisions (Kennedy, 1996).

       Attention to insecurity is by no means new.                   Advocating    “some safeguards

against misfortunes which cannot be wholly eliminated in this man-made world,”

Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed a cabinet Committeeon                   Economic Security in 1934

(reprinted in Davis,            1986, p.449).       This committee’s        recommendations    led to

passage of the Social Security Actof               1935, creating a system of social insurance

to partially insulate the population from the risk of economic hardship.                       Twenty

years later, the Federal Reserve Board’s Consultant Committee on Consumer Survey

Statistics recommended           that data be collected to monitor             “popular feeling of

anxiety and security” (reprinted in Tobin, 1959, p.10).

       Since      then,   the    federal    government     has   invested    substantially     in the

development of statistics that monitor the current status of the population, but

not in statistics that monitor               how Americans       perceive   their futures.      Major

national surveys such as the Current Population Survey, the Survey of Income and

Program   Participation,         and the Panel Study of            Income Dynamics    describe    the

outcomes that individuals actually experience, but not the outcomes they expect
                                                    2

to experience in the future.

         A    number   of    private    survey   organizations         regularly   elicit   economic

expectations.          These measures     of     “consumer       confidence”    have generally     not

detected recent increases uneconomic             insecurity.       See, for example, the analysis

of Gallup survey data by Newport and Saad (1996).

         Perhaps the available survey data show no increase in insecurity because

the apparent trend is simply an artifact of media hype in a presidential election

year.        Or perhaps increased insecurity is not detected because the surveys are

not well-suited to monitor the phenomenon.

         We have recently initiated the Survey of Economic Expectations (SEE) in an

effort       to learn how Americans        perceive      their    near-term    futures.     SEE   is a

periodic module in WISCON, a national continuous telephone survey conducted by

the Letters and Science Survey Center at the University                        of Wisconsin-Madison

(see Winsborough,           1987).     We measure       respondents’    perceptions   of near-term

economic insecurity through their responses to questions eliciting subjective

probabilities of three events:




Health Insurance: “What do you think is the percent chance (what are the chances

out of 100) that you will have health insurance coverage 12 months from now?”




Burglary: “What do you think is the percent chance (what are the chances out of

100) that someone will break into (or somehow illegally enter) your home and

steal something, during the next 12 months?”




Job LOSS: “What do you think is the percent chance that you will lose your job

during the next 12 months?”
                                                 3

All respondents are asked the first two questions, and those currently working

are asked the third.

        The use of probabilistic questions to elicit individuals’ expectations has

been recommended by Juster (1966), Savage (1971), Manski (1990), and Fischhoff

(1994), each of whom concludes that probabilistic questions should yield more

informative        responses     than   do     the     qualitative      expectations       questions

traditionally       asked in surveys.        In Dominitz and Manski (1996a), we consider

three methods for learning about individuals’ expectations--el icitingqual itative

expectations, eliciting probabilistic expectations, and inferring expectations

from realizations--and         make the case for probability            e“ icitation.     Section 2

explains our thinking further.

       Our empirical analysis begins in Section 3, which describes the SEE data.

We   focus   on    respondents    interviewed        in 1994    and   1995 who   are    labor   force

participants at the time of the interview.                With item response rates exceeding

98 percent,       respondents    clearly     are willing       to answer   the three      subjective

probability questions.          Moreover, they appear to do so in a meaningful way.

       In Section 4 we use the responses to classify individuals                       as re7ative7y

secure, relatively insecure, and highly insecure.                 We find that respondents with

a high risk of one adverse outcome tend also to perceive high risks of the other

outcomes.     We find that economic insecurity tends to decline with age and with

schooling.        Black respondents perceive much greater insecurity than do whites,

especially among males.

       With only two years of data, we cannot provide an historical perspective

on trends in economic insecurity but we can examine how expectations of economic

misfortune have varied recently.             This is done in Section 5, where we find some

time-series variation in insecurity but no clear trends.                   With the accumulation
                                                       4

of data from subsequent administrations of the SEE, we anticipate that the time-

series data will help us to understand how changes in the real economy affect

individuals’      expectations   and, conversely,                how expectations     affect the real

economy.

        Thedata    we have already accumulated allowus                to assess the extent to which

the   expectations     of   various        groups      of   Americans    accurately       predict   their

subsequent     realizations.          In     Section        6,   we   find    that   expectations     and

realizations of health insurance coverage and of job loss tend to match up quite

closely, but respondents substantially overpredict the risk of burglary.

        Section 7 gives conclusions.




2.    Background




        What is economic insecurity?           An individual’s sense of economic insecurity

may be thought to arise from his or her perceptions                          of the risk of economic

misfortune.       To monitor economic insecurity, analysts                    have used    a variety of

measures   derived     from   responses         to     survey     questions     eliciting    individual

perceptions.       In this section, we discuss these efforts. 1




     1 Other analysts look instead to data on recent realizations. To ascertain
the perceived risk of job loss, for example, researchers may use the local
unemployment rate as a proxy. The inherently subjective nature of risk
perceptions,   however, limits the usefulness      of measures   based only on
realizations data. See Manski (1993) and Dominitz and Manski (1996a).

2.1.   Standard    Approaches to Measuring Insecurity




       We decidedto    elicit subjective probabilities of health insurance coverage,

burglary, and job loss after considering and rejecting standard survey measures

of subjective economic insecurity.          We have three main areas of concern about

these measures, which we discuss here using as examples the questions posed by

some national     survey   organizations.     The areas of concern      are: qualitative

expectations,     loosely-defined outcomes, and confounded phenomena.




Qualitative expectations:




       Gallup Organization:      Thinking   about the next twelve months,         how

       likely is it that your [husband/wife] will lose [his/her] job or be

       laid off--     is it very likely, fairly likely, not too likely, or not

       at all likely?      (CNN/USAToday/Gallup   Poll, April, 1996, Wave 1; see

       also Newport and Saad, 1996)




       University of Michigan Survey Research Center (SRC):            Now looking

       ahead -- do you think that a year from now you             (and your family

       living there) will be better off financially, or worse off, or just

       about the same as now?       (Curtin, 1982)




       When asked to consider the prospects for a given economic outcome, such as

the loss of one’s job,        respondents    are often   asked   to report    whether   they

“think,” “expect,” or “are worried” that the event will occur.               Sometimes they

are asked to report the strength of this belief or worry by attaching one of a
                                                6

choice of modifiers, such as “very,”           “fair
                                                   ly, ”    “moderately, “ or “not at all”

likely/worried that the event will occur.

       Perhaps the most basic problem concerns the interpersonal comparabilityof

responses.     Do different respondents interpret these verbal phrases in the same

way?       Empirical   evidence    indicates        that   interpretations    of    qualitative

expectations questions vary substantially between respondents                (see Wallsten et

al., 1986) .

       Even    if respondents     were   to   identically    interpret    these    phrases,   the

coarseness     of response options would        limit the     information contained      in the

responses.      For example, a respondent to SRC’S Survey of Consumer Attitudes, who

must choose among “better,” “worse,” and “about the same,” cannot express much

about his or her prospects for financial well-being.




Loosely-defined outcomes:




       New York Times: All in all, how economically              secure do you feel?

       Very insecure, somewhat insecure, ..? (New York Times, March3,               1996)




       Our concern about interpersonal comparability comes into even sharper focus

when considering the outcomes about which respondents are asked.                   What does it

mean to be “economically secure,” as the New York Times asked earlier this year?

How does the respondent reduce the many facets of economic security into one

dimension?      Do respondents    interpret security as an absolute concept or as a

relative one?      If relative, to whom or to what time period does the respondent

compare?      Similar concerns apply to SRC’S forward-looking            financial well-being

question (above) and to its backward-looking counterpart, which asks                respondents
                                                     7

to compare     how well they         “are getting        along financially     these days” to the

situation one year earlier.            These types of questions are asked by SRC (Curtin,

1982), the Conference Board (Linden, 1982), and the Gallup Organization                       (Newport

and Saad, 1996), among others.




Confounded phenomena:




      Harris:       Compared to a year ago, do you feel more afraid and uneasy

      on the streets today, less uneasy, or not much different than you

      felt a few years ago?            (Erskine, 1974)




      Ferraro and LaGrange (1987) argue that “fearofc rime”                     questions generally

confound two concepts--the perceived risk of crime and the emotional response to

crime--which       need not be strongly correlated.                  In fact, they argue that the

empirical    evidence      suggests    these two phenomena            are not strongly   positively

related and, for some criminal activities, may be negatively related.                        Responses

to this     type    of    survey   question    may   therefore       provide   inefficient,    if not

invalid, indicators          of the perceived risk of crime victimization.

      The confounding          of two distinct           phenomena    in a single    indicator    also

characterizes       measures   of consumer confidence.               For example,    SRC’S    Index of

Consumer    Sentiment      is derived       from responses     to a series of five questions,

including    the    two    financial    well-being        questions     previously   discussed    (see

Zagorski    and McDonnell,         1995).     Changes     in this measure      are said to reflect

changes in both optimism/pessimism and certainty/uncertainty                     (see Curtin, 1982,

and Throop, 1992).         While inspection of the questions leaves us to wonder about

the mechanism by which subjective uncertainty is conveyed, it is clear that no
                                                 8

single indicator can be well-suited to capture changes in two phenomena, unless

these   phenomena     are strongly     positively      related.      We    know of no empirical

evidence to substantiate such a claim.




2.2.    New Approaches to Measuring Insecurity



        We seek to elicit subjective probabilities                of well-defined      prospective

outcomes.     These    responses   may    be    used   to   construct      measures    of   economic

insecurity (see Section 4).        A number of recent studies have elements in common

with our strategy to measure         economic        insecurity.     We discuss       some of them

briefly before proceeding to the analysis of our data.




        The HRS/AHEAD Surveys:       In 1992,    SRC began two companion panel surveys of

51 to 61 year-old and of over-70 year-old               Americans,    entitled the Health and

Retirement Study (HRS) and the Asset and Health Dynamics among the Oldest Old

(AHEAD) surveys, respectively (see Juster and Suzman, 1995).                  In addition to many

questions    on outcomes    actually     realized,     respondents        are asked   a number    of

questions eliciting the subjective probability of living to age 75/85, job loss,

entering a nursing home, and medical expenses using up all savings, among other

events. Thus far, analyses of these data have focused on expectations                        of one

outcome at a time, such as mortality            (Hurd and McGarry, 1995) or nursing home

utilization (Holden et al., 1995).




        The Italian SHIM and Dutch VSB-Pane7 Surveys:              Two European surveys include

questions eliciting subjective probabilities of one-year-ahead growth rates in

income.     Responses to the Bank of Italy’s 1989 Survey of Household                   Income and
                                               9

Wealth (SHIW) have been analyzed by Guiso et al. (1992), who focus on the effect

of income uncertainty on savings behavior.             We are not aware of any analyses of

responses to similar questions contained in the more recent, continuing VSB-Panel

survey conducted by the Center for Economic Research in Tilburg, Netherlands.




         The Carnegie Mellon Studies of Risk Perceptions:          The Social and Decision

Sciences group at Carnegie Mellon University has undertaken a series of small-

scale studies       (e.g., less than 300 subjects drawn         from the Pittsburgh       area)

eliciting subjective probabilities of various events.             For example, Quadrel et

al. (1993) report findings from a diverse sample of adults and adolescents on

their perceived risks of becomi ng alcohol dependent, getting mugged, and becoming

sick from pesticide poisoning, among other adverse outcomes.




         The Madison Study of Student Expectations:        In Dominitzand    Manski (1996b),

we describe the results of a survey in Madison, Wisconsin eliciting from71                    high

school students and 39 college undergraduates their expectations of the income

they would earn if they were to complete different              levels of schooling.           The

questions elicited expectations in the form of subjective probabilities.




         The    Torino-Budapest   Study   of   Socio-Economic    Security:       A    group     of

sociologists conducted a survey of 249 adults in Torino, Italy and 409 adults in

Budapest, Hungary in 1988 (Garner and Garner, 1991).             Respondents were asked to

report    the    likelihood   of job   loss,   crime   victimization,   moving       because   of

eviction or rent increase, and having a sufficient pension, among other outcomes.

Responses were given in the form of verbal quantifiers--very            probable, probable,

improbable, very improbable.       An index of economic security was constructed from
                                                  10

these responses.




         The 1993 Survey      of Economic       Expectations:        The     first version    of SEE,

administered during 1993, elicited respondents’ one-year-ahead expectations of

income, earnings, and employment          (see Dominitz, 1994, and Dominitz and Manski,

1996a).     This study served as a proving             ground    for the series of questions

contained in the current, continuing survey.             The income and employment questions

have been revised and supplemented, and the earnings questions have been replaced

by questions on health insurance coverage and crime victimization.




3.     Elicitinq Sub.iective Expectations




3.1.     The 1994-1995 Survey of Economic Expectations




         We placed our set of probabilistic            expectations        questions as a periodic

module in WISCON, an ongoing national telephone survey conducted by the Letters

and Science Survey Center (LSSC) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.                           The

WISCON     survey    core   questions     ask     respondents        about    their   labor     market

experiences, demographics, and household income.                Our module was included during

the periods April to July 1994 (henceforth, mid 1994), November 1994 to January

1995 (end 1994), May to July 1995 (mid 1995), and November 1995 to January 1996

(end 1995).       The interviewing intensity varied across the time periods, but the

samples    were     drawn   from   the   same    population     of    American     households     with

telephones    via the same random-digit           dialing     algorithm.        LSSC completed     971

interviews in mid 1994, 480 in end 1994, 774 in mid 1995, and 661 in end 1995.

The respondent selection rule chooses one adult person to interview from each

contacted household; hence adults living in single–adult households are drawn

with higher probability than adults living in multiple-adult                   households.   In

Sections 4, 5, and 6, where we generalize our results to the U.S. labor force,

we present weighted estimates that adjust for differential respondent-selection

probabilities across households and time periods.

      The module of expectations questions was prefaced by the following set of

instructions read to respondents:




      Now I will ask you some questions about future, uncertain outcomes.

      In   each   case,   try to   think   about   the    whole   range   of    possible

      outcomes and think about how likely they are to occur during the

      next 12 months.      In some of the questions, I will ask you about the

      PERCENT CHANCE of something happening.             The percent chance must be

      a number from O to 100.       Numbers like:

             2 or 5 percent may be “almost no chance”

             20 percent or so may mean “not much chance”

             a 45 or 55 percent chance may be a “pretty even chance”

             80 percent or so may mean a “very good chance”

             and a 95 or 98 percent chance may be “almost certain”

      The percent chance can also be thought of as the number of CHANCES

      OUT OF 100.




      Our analysis focuses on the 2060 respondents who were in the labor force

at the time of the interview and who gave valid responses to the three questions

on economic insecurity.     Respondents are defined to be in the labor force if they
                                                   12

state that, at the time of the interview, they are either working                               for pay,

temporarily absent from a job, or looking for work.                     We exclude persons not in

the labor force because job loss probabilities                     are not meaningful           for them.

Among    the     respondents     who   are   in   the    labor     force,    we   elicited       job-loss

expectations only from those who are currently working.                      This group constitutes

about ninety percent of the labor force participants                     and it was necessary to

impute job-loss expectations to the remaining ten percent.2




3.2.     Response Rates




         The WISCON interviewers attempt to contact about twenty households per day

and    obtain    an     interview   from   slightly      over   fifty   percent     of    the    selected

households.        The nonresponse     is fairly evenly divided between refusals                    to be

interviewed       and    cases   in which    repeated      phone    calls    find   the    appropriate

respondent to be not at home or otherwise unable to complete the interview.

         Our expectations questions were administered to 2886 WISCON respondents,

55 percent of whom were women, indicating that nonresponse rates differ somewhat

by gender.       The sample includes       2102 labor force participants, 1063men                and 1039

women.    The respective male and female labor force partici pat on rates of .82 and

.65 exceed those typically found in recent Current Population Survey data by five

or six percentage points, for both men and women.

         Table    1 reports      the demographic        and schooling       characteristics       of the




     2 We assign 1.00 as the subjective probability of job loss to the 88
respondents who were unemployed at the time of the interview; that is, to those
who did not have a job and were looking for work.       We assign 0.05 as the
subjective probability of job loss to the 135 respondents who stated that they
were “temporarily absent” from a job at the time of the interview.    The value
0.05 is the population-wide median job-loss probability of employed persons.
                                                    13

respondents.       The first column describes the entire sample of 2886 individuals,

and the second column describes our sample of 2060 labor force participants who

gave valid responses to each of the economic                   insecurity questions.           Weighted

fractions,      which    adjust     for    differential       selection      probabilities          across

households and time, are given for each school ingand                 demographic group in column

four.   The weighted fractions are very close to their unweighed                       counterparts in

column three.

        Overall,    98   percent      of   labor    force    participants     (2060 out        of    2102)

responded     to   the   economic      insecurity        questions.      Rates    of    response      vary

negligibly across the groups described               in Table 1.       The item response rate is

less than 95 percent in only one group, women aged 65 or more, among whom 39 out

of 44 responded.




3.3.    Are the Responses Meaningful?




        The   feasibility      and utility     of    eliciting       subjective     probabilities       in

household     surveys is a subject of some controversy                 among researchers.           While

probabilistic      questions    should yield more           informative     responses       than do the

qualitative     expectations questions traditionally                 asked in surveys, a diverse

literature suggests that respondents may think about uncertain events using less

than the full structure of modern probability                  theory.      See Camerer and Webber

(1992) .

        If    respondents      have    difficulty         thinking     in   terms      of    subjective

probabilities, then perhaps they will be unwilling to respond to probabilistic

expectations questions.        Our very high rates of item response indicate otherwise,

as do the high response rates generally obtained in the other studies described
                                                    14

in Section 2.2.

         Willingness      to respond, however, does not imply that the responses            are

meaningful.          Perhaps responses are simply given in a perfunctory manner.          There

is no definitive way to assess the seriousness with which respondents answer our

questions, but we can look for response patterns that may indicate a lack of

care.        In particular, we can examine the extent of bunching at round numbers.

         For each of the three events--         no health insurance coverage, burglary, and

job loss--Table 2 reports the complete frequency distribution of responses given

by the 2060 respondents.3          The entries in Table 2 indicate that each event tends

to be perceived as unlikely to occur, with the overwhelming majori ty of responses

falling in the lower half of the percent-chance scale.                Responses appear to be

rounded to the nearest multiple               of 5, except   at such low values      as 1 or 2

percent.

         A    fear    commonly    expressed    by    researchers   skeptical   of   probability

elicitation is that respondents will concentrate their responses on the values

O, 50, and 100.          Table 2 documents many reports of a O percent chance           (almost

one-third of all responses), but many of these responses presumably                   are cases

where a respondent perceives less than a 1 percent chance of the event and simply

rounds down.         Even if the responses are rounded down from somewhat higher values,

this type of rounding            error should not greatly      affect the results     presented

below.       Quadrel et al . (1993) are fundamentally         interested in separating     zero

from non-zero probabilities           and adopt methods designed to induce more precise

responses.




     3 Responses to the health insurance question have been subtracted from 100,
yielding the percent chance of not being covered rather than of being covered.
We make this transformation to focus on the likelihood of adverse outcomes in
each of the three cases.

behaviors and on attributes of respondents.        We find that respondents who report

a 50 for one question are more         likely to report the same value for another

question, but this association is not strong.       For example, eleven percent of all

respondents report a 50 for the burglary question, whereas nineteen percent of

those    reporting    a 50 for the health     insurance    question    also do   so for the

burglary question.       In personal communications, some researchers have asserted

that    less educated    respondents   have   the most    difficulty   with   probabilistic

questions.       We find that respondents with no more than a high school diploma are

only slightly more likely than others to report a 50 (e.g., thirteen percent

report a 50 for the burglary question).




3.4. The Sample Distribution of Risk Perceptions




        We can summarize the central tendency of the responses reported in Table

2 by giving their sample means and medians.          For health insurance, the sample

mean and median subjective probabilities are .15 and .02. For burglary, they are

.17 and .10.      For job loss, they are .18 and .05.      Observe that each sample mean

is much larger than the corresponding sample median.          This reflects the skewness

of the sample distributions.      Table 2 shows that, in each case, amajority         of the

respondents place negligible or small subjective probability on the              event,   but

some respondents think the event moderately or even very likely to occur.

        To more fully summarize the heterogeneity of risk percept ons we present

several quantiles of the sample distribution of the responses:
                                                  16

             Sample Means and Quantiles of the Subjective Probabilities

       No Health Insurance            Victim of Burglary                         Job LOSS

   Mean         Quant- le            Mean      Quantile                  Mean        Quantile
             .25 .50 &                      .25 .50 .75                           .25 .50 .75

   .15       .00     .02   .20       .17    .02        .10   .20         .18      .00   .05   .20



Consider,     for example, the perceived risk of job loss.                     At least twenty-five

percent     of the respondents       (the .25-quantile) see themselves              as facing zero

chance of losing their jobs in the next year.                      At least fifty percent of the

respondents        (the .50-quantile or median) see themselves as facing no more than

a .05 chance of job loss.           But some do not feel so secure.               The entry for the

.75-quantile shows that up to twenty-five percent of respondents see themselves

as facing a .20 chance or more of job loss in the next year.                    Other quantiles may

be derived directly from Table 2.




4. The Concentration of Insecurity



4.1.      Measuring    Insecurity




          In Section 3 redescribed     some basic features of the SEE sample data.                  From

here on, we use those data to draw conclusions about the risk perceptions of the

American population.         To this end, we henceforth weight the sample datato              adjust

for differential respondent-selection probabil ities across households and across

time periods.

          First consider the three events one at a time.               Table 3 characterizes         the

distribution of risk perceptions within various groups defined by gender, age,
                                                           17

education, race, and employment status.                         Observe that, in every group, the mean

subjective       probability              of each event       is much   higher    than the corresponding

median.     Thus our earlier finding of skewness in the sample distribution of risk

perceptions persists when we examine the risk perceptions of subpopulations of

Americans.

            Considering the three events one at a time does not reveal the extent to

which   insecurity            is concentrated          within    the population.        Do most Americans

perceive a high risk of at least one adverse outcome, or rather do some perceive

high risks of all three events while others perceive themselves to be relatively

immune?

        Let (p,,        P2,    P3)    denote     a   person’s subjective probabilities of the three

events -- no health insurance, burglary, and job loss.                        The estimated population-

wide    median     values            of    the   subjective      probabilities     of   these    events    are

(.02,   .10,    .05)          and    the       .75-quantile      subjective      probability     val ues   are

(.20,   .20,    .20).          To measure        the concentration       of insecurity within        various

groups, we report in Table 4 the fraction F(pl < .02, pz<                          .10, p~<     .05) of group

members whose subjective probabilities all lie below the respective population

medians.       We refer to these persons as relatively secure.                     We report the fraction

F(pl > .02, pz >.10, p                    > .05) of group members whose subjective probabilities

all exceed the population medians.                        We refer to these persons as relatively

insecure.       We also compute the fraction F(pl > .20, Pz > .20, Pz > .20)                        of group

members whose subjective probabilities all exceed the population .75-quantiles.

We refer to these persons as highly insecure.

        As reported in the top row of Table 4, we estimate that 16 percent of men

are relatively secure and 14 percent are relatively insecure, according to these

def nitions, leaving 70 percent in the intermediate group who are neither secure
                                            18

nor insecure.    Highly insecure individuals constitute 4percent       of the male labor

force.     Similarly, among women, 16 percent are relatively secure, 13 percent are

relatively insecure, and 3 percent are highly insecure.

         These results indicate that persons with a high subjective probability of

one event tend also to have high subjective probabilities of the other events.

If p,, pz, and p~ were statistically independent of one another, 10 (9) percent

of men (women) would be relatively secure, 6 (7) percent would be relatively

insecure, and 1 (1) percent would be highly insecure.4           Instead, we find these

percentages to be 16, 14, and 4 among men, and 16, 13, 3 among women.              These

substantially    larger values indicate that the     subjective probabilities    PI, P2,

and p~ are not statistically       independent but rather are positively      associated

within the labor force.

         In Section 2, we identified weaknesses in previous attempts to measure

insecurity.     We recognize that Table 4 also has its limitations.         Perhaps most

significantly, we may have ignored important dimensions of insecurity.         We do not

incorporate    perceived    risks to retirement   savings or to home ownership,      for

example.    While wedo     include the risk of job loss, wedo    not include perceptions

of the loss of income associated with job loss.       An advantage of our approach is

the natural way in which such additional dimensions may be included.              If the

probabilities of other adverse outcomes are elicited, the classifications may be

redefined to incorporate the additional dimensions.             In the meantime, we are


     4Letj=l,2,3.          If the empirical distribution of pj were continuous,
half of all respondents would have pj less than the empirical median and half
would have pj greater than the empirical median. A quarter would have pj greater
than the empirical .75-quantile.     Hence, under the statistical independence
assumption, the fractions relatively secure and relatively insecure would each
be (.5)3 = .125, and the fraction highly insecure would be        (.25)3 = .016.
Because the empirical distributions are discrete with some mass at their medians
and .75-quantiles, these fractions turn out to have the values .097, .066, .009
among men, and the values .092, .073, and .015 among women.
                                                     19

satisfied     that     the   three   events     we    have     selected   capture     an    inherently

interesting array of risks.




4.2. Variation in Insecurity across Groups




          How do risk perceptions vary across subgroups of the population?                      Tables

3 and 4 show that males and females have very similar overall distributions                           of

risk perceptions but somewhat different patterns by age and schooling.                           Among

females under age65, the fraction relatively secure increases substantially with

age from .13 (18-34 year-olds)           to     .27 (50-64 year-olds),           while the fraction

relatively        insecure   decreases   from    .14 to       .09.     Table    3 reveals    that    the

subjective probabilities of each of the three events tend to decrease with age.

A weaker pattern emerges with respect to schooling.                       The fraction relatively

insecure decreases from .16 (high school diploma or less) to .10 (bachelor’s

degree or more), but the fraction relatively secure does not vary monotonically.

It   is   the subjective probability          of no health        insurance     that decreases      most

clearly with schooling.

          Among males, the variation with respect to age is s milar to that found

among females, but the variation with schooling levels is much more striking.

Whether     the    event   be lack   of health        insurance      or burglary,    the    subjective

probabilities of males with a bachelor’s degree tend to be less than half the

magnitudes     of those with      no more than a high school diploma.                  The job loss

probabilities also tend to be lower.                      Among males with a bachelor’s degree,

only .07 are relatively insecure and .02 are highly insecure.                       Among those with

no more than a high school diploma,              .19 are relatively            insecure and .07 are

highly insecure.
                                                  20

       Tables    3   and   4   show    that   whites      and   blacks      have   very   different

distributions    of risk perceptions, with blacks tending to report much greater

perceived insecurity than do whites.           The racial pattern is apparent among both

males and females but is particularly strong among males.                    Whether the event be

lack   of   health   insurance,       burglary,    or    loss   of   job,    black   males    report

substantially higher subjective probabilities than do white males.                    Fully .180f

black males are highly insecure.           The fraction among white males is just .02.

       The tables also describe the risk perceptions of persons who currently are

both employed and covered by health insurance.              This group, which constitutes an

estimated   79 percent of the labor force, may be thought of as the relatively

well-off core of the labor force in terms of current economic status.                          Being

well-off at a point in time does not, however, imply that one is secure.                     We see,

for example, that .13 of this group of males are relatively insecure, a fraction

which exceeds the .07 of males with a bachelor’s degree, regardless of employment

and insurance    status.       More generally,         we see that the fraction           relatively

insecure among employed, insured persons is one or two points lower than that of

the general labor force, whereas the fraction relatively secure is two or three

points higher.

         We undertook this studyto             monitor economic insecurity.                 Thus far, we have

investigated the extent to which insecurity varies across and is concentrated

within    segments       of the     labor      force.        We   also    aim to monitor         variation          in

insecurity over time.             Our ability to track changes over time is limited because

the data collected to date span only two years.                           In previous sections, we have

pooled the four quarters of data--mid 1994, end 1994, mid 1995, and end 1995.

In this section, we distinguish the time periods.

         Table     5A    describes       the    population         distribution        of     the        subjective

probabilities in each of the four quarters.                       Table 5B reports our measures of the

concentration of insecurity.                Of the three events, perceptions of the risk of

burglary appear the most stable and the job loss probabilities                                   are the most

volatile.

         Some differences between the perceptions ofmal es and females are apparent.

Among males, the perceived risks of no health insurance and job loss tended to

decrease from mid 1994 to end 1994 before rising in mid 1995 and falling in end

1995, yielding          concomitant      fluctuations         in the       insecurity       measures.          Among

females     (focusing        on    the    population          mean       and    .75-quantile),           job     loss

probabilities tended to increase from mid 1994 to end 1994 before falling in

successive quarters.          Our measures of economic insecurity give no clear picture

of changes in insecurity among females across these time periods.

         It isof    interest to compare the trends in risk perceptions revealed by the

SEE    instrument       to   the     trends      observed         in    other      indicators       of     economic

expectations.        One such measure is SRC’S Index of Consumer Expectations                                  (ICE).

The   ICE   is     constructed       from      responses      to       questions     eliciting      qualitative
                                                    22

expectations of family financial well-being and business conditions, as well as

assessments of “buying conditions” (e.g., a “good time” or “bad time” to buy).

The ICE averaged 82.0 in mid 1994, 87.3 in end 1994, 83.9 in mid 1995, and80.7

in end 1995 (Survey Research Center, 1996).                The Index    of Consumer Sentiment,

which     incorporates     responses   to     two    backward-looking     questions   on    family

financial well-being and business conditions               as well as the components of the

ICE, averaged 106.1 (mid 1994), 106.3 (end 1994), 105.4 (mid 1995), and 103,2

(end 1995).      Each of these measures therefore exhibited a steady, if relatively

slight, decline from mid 1994 to end 1995.




6. The Ob.iective Accuracy of Elicited Risk Perceptions




         In two distinct senses, we would like to determine the accuracy of the risk

perceptions that we elicit from respondents.               First, we would like to know how

well the elicited subjective probabilities               measure what persons really think

about their risks of health insurance coverage, burglary,                  and job loss in the

next year.       Second, we would      like to know how objectively          accurate      are the

reported risk perceptions.

         We cannot offer any really satisfying way to assess accuracy in the first

sense.     Every effort to interpret responses             to subjective    questions      runs up

against    the   generic    problem    that    a    researcher   cannot   directly    observe    a

respondent’s thinking.        We do judge the pattern of responses to be reasonable.

The findings presented in Section 3 indicate that respondents                   are willing to

answer the questions and do so in more than a perfunctory manner.                 The findings

in Section 4 make sense to us--the positive intra-person association among the
                                                  23

subjective probabilities of the three events, the broad similarity of the risk

perceptions     of    males   and   females,     the   patterns     of   insecurity      by    age   and

schooling,    and the     substantial      difference       in insecurity      between    whites     and

blacks.

      Perhaps the cleanest          way to assess the objective             accuracy     of elicited

expectations       is to re-interview      respondents       a year   later, learn about their

experiences     during     the   year,     and    compare     the   realized     events       with   the

expectations elicited a year earlier.              Such comparisons are straightforward               if

one is willing       to assume that realized           events are statistically           independent

across respondents.        In this vein, Dominitz (1995) uses a one-year follow-up to

the 1993 version of SEE to assess the objective accuracy of respondents’ earnings

expectations.

      Respondents to the 1994 and 1995 version of SEE have not been recontacted,

and so we cannot use this approach to assess the objective                      accuracy of their

elicited    risk     perceptions.     We   can,    however,     assess   objective       accuracy     by

comparing    the expectations       elicited     in 1994 to the realizations             reported     by

members of the same group in 1995.

      All SEE respondents were asked these three questions:




Realized Health Insurance: Do you have any health insurance coverage?




Realized Burglary: During the past 12 months, did anyone break into or somehow

illegally get into your home and steal something?




Realized Job Loss: Have there been any times during the past 12 months when you

did not have a       job and were looking for work?
                                                 24

The first two questions elicit realizations of the same events about which the

expectations   questions ask.     The job loss question, which is one of the core

WISCON questions, does not correspond as well to the expectations question. 5

       Suppose that the realizations of health insurance, burglary, and job loss

are statistically independent across respondents.                 Subject to this assumption,

we can assess the objective accuracy of elicited risk perceptions by comparing

population   mean subjective probabilities             reported   in 1994 with corresponding

realized rates of occurrence reported in 1995.              Table 6 presents this comparison

using data from the 1036 labor force participants                 in 1994 and the 1024 labor

force participants in 1995.

       The findings are striking.        The expectations         and realizations     of health

insurance and job loss match up closely.              Among men (women), the mean subjective

probability of no health insurance is .15 (.16), and the subsequent proportion

without   insurance in 1995 is    .15   (.13).        The mean job loss probability       is .15

(.21) among men (women), and the subsequent rate of realization is .18 (.18).

       The   picture   is quite   different       with    respect    to   crime   victimization.

Whereas only .03 of all women report in 1995 that they were victims in the past

year, the mean subjective probability of being burglarized (among 1994 women) was

.17.   Discrepancies of this general magnitude showup               across the board, in every

demographic and schooling group, among both males and females.

       We can offer no compelling rationale              for the large discrepancy       between




     5 The comparison is appropriate under the following two conditions: (i) all
unemployed job seekers over the past 12 months have lost a job rather than left
one voluntarily or recently entered the labor force and (ii) all job losers over
the past 12 months have spent some time as unemployed job seekers and did not
exit the labor force, Should condition (i) fail to hold, then we would overstate
the proportion of the labor force with realized job losses.     Should condition
(ii) fail to hold, then we would understate the proportion with realized job
losses.

expectations and realizations of burglary.            Our findings do seem to corroborate

the conventional wisdom that Americans perceive crime to be far more prevalent

than it actually is (see Bursik and Grasmick, 1993, Chapter 4).




7. Conclusion



       This study has presented ev dence on American                perceptions       of personal,

near-term economic insecurity during 1994 and 1995.                 Our method of monitoring

insecurity diverges substantially from standard survey methods, but it does have

elements in common with a series of recent studies in the U.S. and in Europe.

We   find   this   approach   to be promising,       but we do not      assert       that we    have

developed    the best method     possible.       We believe that measures            of insecurity

should be derived from reported subjective probabilities of a variety of well-

defined,    adverse outcomes.         The elicitation method,        choice of outcomes,         and

measure of insecurity are three subjects deserving further consideration.

       We would also like to assess the effects of insecurity.                  Economic theory

suggests    that   income risk    induces      individuals   to    increase    savings,      thereby

decreasing consumption.        Heightened fear of crime may cause individuals to take

precautions in their daily activities.            Risks to health insurance coverage may

keep   workers     from   switching    jobs,   yielding   the     phenomenon    of    “job    lock.”

Economic insecurity may also adversely affect an individual ’s mental or physical

health (see Catalano, 1991).          To make progress on these issues, we see the need

for simultaneous collection of data on actual behaviors thought to be related to

economic insecurity.

The WISCON sample includes all persons interviewed in the relevant time periods.
The SEE sample are those WISCON respondents who are in the labor force and who
respond to the three expectations questions.     The weighted fractions reflect
differential respondent-selection   probabilities across households and time
periods.
