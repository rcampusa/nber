Firms’ Demand for Employment-Based Mental Health Benefits

JEL No. I

                                           ABSTRACT




Employment-based health insurance is the main source of health coverage for the non-elderly. Few
previous studies have examined the factors that impact employer decision-making in selecting the
coverage to offer to their employees and none have examined generosity of mental health coverage.
This paper uses cross-sectional data from a survey of medium to large firms, including information
on employee characteristics, to examine the empirical determinants of mental health coverage
choices. We find that the firm's demand for mental health coverage is strongly influenced by
employee characteristics. We also find that certain state and local policy interventions directed at
enhancing access to mental health care have impacts on coverage decisions. Specifically, public
provision of mental health lowers mental health coverage generosity and parity legislation increases
mental health generosity. Future research with panel data is warranted to examine the causal effects
of these policies.

       Employment-based health insurance is the main source of health care coverage

for the non-elderly. Currently, 61.3 percent of the under 65 population are covered

through employer-provided policies (Denaus-Walt et al., 2003). Evidence from data over

the past several decades also indicates that this coverage is usually fairly generous. Gabel

et al. (2002) examine trends in generosity of health insurance benefits and find little

variability in generosity with, on average, employees expecting to pay 25 percent of their

expenditures out of pocket. Bundorf (2002) develops plan generosity estimates from the

1993 Robert Wood Johnson foundation employer survey. Within each of four different

categories of plans (HMO, POS, PPO and indemnity), she finds that the coefficient of

variation of estimated plan value ranged from 0.68 to 0.125. Moreover, her estimated

plan value means are very similar across plan types, ranging from $1,133 to $1,220.

       The fairly uniform pattern of generous coverage (at least among employers who

offer coverage) may not be surprising in light of the strong tax incentives for

compensating workers via their health benefits (Sheils and Haught, 2004). Some recent

studies, however, suggest that this level of benefit generosity is beginning to trend

downward in response to increasing premium cost pressures on employers (Strunk and

Ginsburg, 2003).

       In the case of coverage specifically for mental health services, comparable

national data on levels and trends of benefit generosity have not been produced, but the

evidence that is available suggests the possibility that the burden of cost sharing is greater

for persons with mental disorders and that increases in this burden may outpace

comparable increases for health services in general. Using BLS data, Jensen et al. (1998)




                                              1
find that 82 percent of firms provided less coverage for mental health inpatient services

compared to general health services and that 98 percent provided less coverage for

mental health outpatient services compared to general health. In 2002, 74 percent of

covered workers were subject to annual outpatient visit limits and 64 percent were

subject to an annual inpatient day limit (Barry C et al., 2003). State and Federal

governments have responded to these differentials via enactment of so-called mental

health “parity” laws, as well as laws mandating mental health benefits, though it is clear

that these laws have not eliminated coverage differentials (U.S. General Accounting

Office, 2000). Anecdotal evidence suggests that in responding to cost pressures and

premium increases, employers may look specifically to reductions in mental health

benefits (Rosenheck et al., 1999). At the national level, McKusick et al. (2002) simulate

coverage under typical private health insurance plans in 1987 and 1995 and report that

the share of mental health spending covered by the typical plan declined from 65.8 to

60.1 percent.

       In the current economic climate, with most observers expecting further reductions

in mental health coverage generosity, it is important that policy-makers understand the

factors that impact on employer decision-making in selecting the coverage packages to

offer to their employees. Prior economic research on this question is sparse. Bundorf

(2002) is the first to examine what factors may be associated with the overall health

benefit generosity of employer sponsored insurance. Supporting the presumption that

employers seek to provide compensation packages that are most valued by their

employees, she finds evidence of employee characteristics (specifically wage levels and a

measure of variation in health risk) affecting the generosity of the health plan for firms




                                              2
with 100 employees or less; however she finds no significant effect of employee

characteristics on generosity for firms with greater than 100 employees.

       In this paper, we focus specifically on employer decisions about the generosity of

the mental health benefits offered to their employees. Following Bundorf (2002), our

dependent variable is a measure of generosity averaged across all plans offered by the

employer and explanatory variables include employee characteristics, as well as

employer and area characteristics. We also examine impacts of state-level policy

measures (benefit mandates and parity laws) on benefit generosity. The next section of

the paper presents our conceptual approach to employers’ mental health benefit choices.

The following sections describe our data sources and variables, and our estimation

methods and results. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of our findings

and directions for future research.



   I. Conceptual Approach



       The view that employer-sponsored health insurance should reflect the preferences

of the employees has a long history in the health economics literature. (For an early

exposition, see Goldstein and Pauly, 1976). Several recent papers (Dowd and Feldman

1987; Bundorf 2002) have formalized this notion by assuming that employers choose the

health insurance plans to offer by minimizing their compensation costs subject to a

market-determined utility constraint for their workers. We follow the same general

approach here in modeling an employer’s mental health insurance coverage decision, but

we also incorporate an extension suggested by earlier work on job safety (Rea, 1981)




                                            3
which allows the characteristics of the insurance plan offered to impact on employers’

profits both through compensation costs (as in Dowd and Feldman and in Bundorf) and

through effects on workers’ health.

        We model the employer’s mental health insurance decision as a short-run profit-

maximization problem (with capital inputs fixed) for a competitive firm. The firm

simultaneously chooses a quantity of labor to employ (L), a “wage” to pay (w), and a

level of generosity of mental health coverage (G) to maximize the profit LaGrangian (H)

which is defined as follows:




                                                       [
    (1) H = pQ{a(G)L}− mGL− wL+ λ Ψ − {a(G)V (w) + (1− a(G)U(w,G))}                       ]
where

p = price of product

Q(⋅) = production function for output quantity

a = probability of NO mental illness for the worker

G= generosity of mental health benefit

L= quantity of labor

m= price per unit of generosity of the mental health benefit

w= dollar cost of wages (and other benefits besides mental health coverage)

Ψ = the firm’s labor market compensation constraint (in expected worker utility)

V = worker’s utility function with no mental illness

U = worker’s utility function with mental illness.




                                             4
For simplicity, we assume (1) that workers are only in one of two possible health states

(healthy or mentally ill), (2) that workers with mental illness do not work, and (3) that the

employer’s workforce is large enough that her/his labor supply will be known with

certainty to be aL. (The labor-market constraint assumes that workers are expected utility

maximizers.) The employer’s first-order conditions for profit maximization are as

follows:



      ∂Η
(2)        =   pQL a − (mG + w) = 0
      ∂L

      ∂Η
(3)        =   pQL aG L − Lm + λ[−aGV − UG + aGU + aUG ] = 0
      ∂G

      ∂Η
(4)        = − L − λ(aVw + (1− a)U w ) = 0
      ∂w

      ∂Η
(5)        = Ψ − (aV + (1− a)U ) = 0
      ∂λ



       Condition (2) is a direct analog of the standard condition for profit maximization

of a competitive firm. Condition (3) indicates that the firm chooses a benefit generosity

level such that the marginal cost of an additional increment of generosity (Lm) is just

equal to the marginal revenue product of an additional increment of generosity plus the

effect of that increment on workers’ expected utility multiplied by λ, which is the

marginal effect on profit of a change in the expected-utility (market) constraint.

Condition (4) shows that wages are set at the point where the marginal cost of an

increment to the wage, L, equals the effect of that increment on workers’ expected utility




                                             5
multiplied by λ. Since an increase in wages increases workers’ expected utility, λ must

be negative; in other words, a one-unit increase in the level of the expected utility (labor

market) constraint reduces profit by λ.

       Also note that when condition (3) is divided by condition (4), we find that the

ratio of marginal expected utility for an extra unit of coverage (G) to that for an extra

dollar of wage is equal to (m - pQLaG). In comparison, if w and G were chosen to

maximize worker expected utility subject to a budget constraint of B = w + mG, the

corresponding ratio would be equal to m. Thus, in this model the firm has a stronger

incentive to purchase generous coverage to obtain the marginal revenue product of lower

disability rates among its workforce.1

       Several simple extensions of the model provide direct links with some current

policy concerns. One is the inclusion of the tax preference for benefits, which would

imply changing the wage argument in the workers’ utility functions to (1-t)w, where t is

the marginal tax rate. A second is inclusion of a parameter, z, representing the influence

of G on the adverse selection costs to the employer of attracting a workforce with greater

demand for mental health care as G increases. This adverse selection process would

imply that the benefit price (m) should be an increasing function of G (with the rate of

increase depending on z) and that the influence of G on the probability of disability

would also depend upon z. As will be noted later, such adverse selection effects may be


1
 In the polar case where mental health coverage has no effect in reducing the probability
of disability, employee expected utility maximization conditions apply and the
employer’s choice reduces to the cost-minimization framework as in Bundorf (2002). For
evidence of coverage effects on disability rates, see Salkever et al. (2000, 2003). Also
note that in our model if workers’ incomes in the disabled state are reduced to Ω⋅w
(where 0 ≤ Ω < 1), the relevant ratio becomes {m – [pQ-(1-Ω)w]aG}.


                                              6
particularly relevant for understanding the ways in which parity legislation impacts on the

employer’s choice of G.

          The foregoing discussion of the model indicates that the employer’s optimal

choice of G should depend upon the following exogenous factors: the prevailing market

price of her/his product (p), the prevailing compensation constraint for her/his workers

(Ψ), tax rates, the price (m) of each unit of G, risk factors that influence the marginal

effect of G on the probability of mental illness, and worker characteristics that influence

their productivity and their preferences in both the no-mental-illness and mentally-ill

states.



    II.      Data Sources and Study Sample of Employers



          The primary data source for this research is a survey of employer practices

regarding benefits and disability management that was conducted in 1996 by the

Department of Health Policy and Management of The Johns Hopkins University. In

cooperation with a private disability insurer, a survey target population of 1,433

employers was identified based on the following criteria: 1) having an active long-term

disability policy with this insurer over the past three years and 2) having at least 300

covered lives on the LTD policy at some time during that three-year period.

          These employers received a mailed questionnaire as well as up to two follow-up

calls to encourage responses and to answer any questions about the survey. Besides the

mailed survey, firms were asked to send summary plan descriptions or a detailed plan

abstract form (nine firms sent abstract forms) for each health plan offered to their




                                               7
employees. Data were obtained on 577 health plans offered by 250 employers. (An

additional 28 firms responded in the survey that they offered health plans but did not

provide the detailed information we requested on these plans.) This health plan data was

abstracted and used for our analyses.2 More detailed descriptions of the survey data are

provided in Salkever et al. (1999).

       Additional variables, defined for the geographic location of each employer and for

their industry (SIC) category, were obtained from public sources noted below.

Additional data on employee characteristics for those employees who are covered by the

employer’s long-term disability (LTD) plan were obtained from the private insurer’s

administrative data files.3

       Characteristics of the employers in our study sample (unweighted means averaged

across employers) are presented in Table 1. While all regions of the country are

represented, the largest numbers of employers are located in the East North Central

region (24.8 percent) and the Middle Atlantic region (17.2 percent). Over half (57.2

percent) of the employers have employees located in more than one state and 38.8

percent have locations in four or more states. Most of the employers are in either the

services (47.2 percent) or manufacturing (24.8 percent) sectors. Among the 91 percent of



2
  Since the overall response rate was low (17 percent), as is often the case in employer
mail surveys (Jensen and Gabel, 1992; Freeman and Kleiner, 2000), we have carefully
analyzed administrative data on respondents and nonrespondents for evidence of
respondent bias. Our analysis (available from the authors) consistently supports the null
hypothesis of no respondent bias.
3
  While some employees are not covered by the LTD benefit, the median for the ratio of
the total lives covered under LTD to the total number of employees reported on the
survey is 0.90. Thus, the characteristics of LTD covered employees should provide a
close approximation to the firm's overall employee characteristics.



                                             8
employers who report their distribution of employees by salaried versus hourly status,

53.7 percent of employees are salaried. Union employees are present in 26 percent of the

firms.

             Responding employers are mainly medium-sized or large: the mean number of

employees is 1,776 and the median is 773. Given their size, and the fact that all offer

LTD benefits to at least some of their employees, it is not surprising that their other

benefit offerings are generous. For example, 89.6 percent of employers offer retirement

benefits, and the mean total days offered for sick and paid vacation leave is 21.5 days per

year. Employment-based health insurance coverage is offered by all of the employers.

(This also applies to the 28 employers who responded to our survey but did not provide

detailed information on the health benefits available to their employees.) The employers

pay, on average, approximately 82 percent of the health insurance premium4 and 23.6

percent of employers pay the entire health insurance premium.



      III.      Specification of Variables


             Dependent Variables: Our measures of mental health coverage generosity are

summary variables that incorporate various specific features of coverage such as

copayments, coinsurance, deductibles, and expenditure and utilization limits.

Information on the characteristics of each health plan offered by a firm is obtained from

the summary plan descriptions or detailed abstraction forms each firm provided.5 The



4
    Approximately 9 percent of respondents did not respond to this survey question.
5
 Descriptions of the mental health coverage features under these various health insurance
plans are reported elsewhere (Salkever et al., 1999). The Salkever et al. (1999) study


                                               9
generosity measures are first constructed at the health plan level and then averaged over

all health plans the firm offers to obtain a firm level measure.

       In order to summarize the generosity of health plans offered by the firm, variables

representing the dollar amount of benefits covered are constructed by combining plan-

specific data with simulated utilization data. Since we do not have actual health plan

enrollment or claims history data, we use distributional parameters from the literature to

simulate the utilization of a covered population and apply the resulting simulated data to

the benefit structure for each health plan offered by the firm. The process simulates the

utilization patterns for mental health inpatient days and outpatient visits.6 A total of

100,000 random draws is simulated.

       Prices for each service are added to create our simulated expenditure data. All

prices are for the year 1995. The inpatient price per day is obtained from Leslie and

Rosenheck (1998, Table 2) and the outpatient price per visit is from a price list of a large

managed behavioral health care provider.

       Information on health plan coverage provisions obtained from employers is

combined with the simulated utilization data and expenditures to determine the amount of

out-of-pocket expenditures for each random “person” for each service. The health plan

coverage provisions incorporated into the simulation are: deductibles including mental

health and/or inpatient specific deductibles, copayment amounts, coinsurance rates,

annual limits on mental health inpatient days or outpatient visits, annual benefit limits for


reported that in general, the HMO plans in this data are more likely to use day and visit
limits than the non-HMO plans.
6
 Distributional parameters are obtained from Goldman et al, 1998 and Sturm 1997. See
Shinogle, 2001 for complete details of these calculations.



                                             10
mental health or a specific mental health service such as outpatient or inpatient, per

admission copayments, out-of-pocket expenditure limits, and scope of out-of-pocket

expenditure limits (e.g. mental-health specific limits vs. overall limits).

       The generosity indicators for each plan are computed as one minus the ratio of the

mean simulated out-of-pocket expenditure to the mean simulated total expenditures for

each service category (outpatient, inpatient, total). The unweighted averages of plan

generosity are then computed among all plans offered by an employer.7

       The means and standard deviations for the mental health generosity measures are

presented in Table 2. The percent of total mental health expenditures covered (MHCOV)

range from zero (no coverage) to 100 (complete coverage) with an average of 62.01

percent of total simulated mental health expenditures covered. The average coverage of

outpatient mental health expenditures (MHOPCOV) is 62.11 percent and the average

coverage of inpatient mental health (MHIPCOV) is 60.92. Table 2 also presents the

medians of the mental health generosity measures, which are almost identical to the

means.8 The last two columns of the table report the number of cases with either zero or

full coverage for each of the three measures.




7
 Note that we assume the same distribution of utilization and expenditures for all plans.
Thus we abstract from moral hazard considerations in computing our generosity
measures.
8
  Salkever and Shinogle (2000) present information on the generosity of the health plan
benefits by health plan type. This study found that preferred provider organization
(PPOs) have a higher simulated coverage of total and outpatient mental health coverage
than fee-for-service (FFS) plans and a higher simulated inpatient mental health coverage
than heath maintenance organizations (HMO) plans. FFS plans in this data have higher
simulated inpatient mental health coverage than HMO plans but HMO plans have higher
outpatient mental health coverage than FFS plans.


                                              11
       The descriptions and data sources for all explanatory variables used in the

analysis are presented in Table 3; the corresponding means and standard deviations are

presented in Table 4. Employer characteristics such as dummies for the total number of

employees, a 0-1 dummy for the presence of any union employees (UNION), and the

percent of employees who are salaried (PCTSAL) are obtained from the employer survey

described above. Note that we include dummies for the employer size categories (based

on numbers of employees) rather than the exact number of employees since the number

of employees is a choice variable in our conceptual model and therefore arguably

endogenous. At the same time, we expect that factors such as economies of scale in

benefits provision and the feasibility of self-insurance are strongly related to numbers of

employees; the employer size dummies are intended to control for these factors while

being less susceptible to endogeneity bias.9 Since detailed information on employees’

education levels and specific job types are lacking in our data base but are potentially

important predictors of employee preferences with regard to benefits, the percent of

salaried employees (PCTSAL) is included to control for these preferences. (Since 25

employers did not provide information on the number of salaried employees, the

PCTSAL variable is coded as zero for these employers and a dummy variable

(MISS_SAL) is created that is equal to one if salaried employee information is missing.)

       Characteristics of employees who are covered under the firm’s LTD insurance

benefit are obtained from administrative data collected by the insurer. This



9
 Note that seventeen employers failed to report their total number of employees in the
survey. To include these respondents in the analysis, information on their number of
employees was obtained from 1996 Dunn and Bradstreet Information Services data, from
employer web sites, or from regional economic web sites (e.g., the Greater Toledo
Regional Growth Partnership, http:\\www.rgp.org).


                                             12
administrative data is available for all 1,433 firms in the sample universe. As noted

above, not all employees are covered by the LTD benefit, but the median for the ratio of

the total lives covered under LTD benefit to the total number of employees reported on

the survey is 0.90. Thus, the characteristics of LTD covered employees should provide a

close approximation to the firm’s overall employee characteristics. This administrative

data contains employee characteristics such as the percent of employees covered under

the firm’s LTD benefit that are: 1) female (FEMALE), 2) age 35 years old or younger

(AGE ≤35), and 3) age 50 and older (AGE50+). These data also describe the distribution

of the firm’s employees among four different occupational categories: white collar

(OCCWC), skilled blue-collar (OCCBL), unskilled (OCCU), and semi-skilled.10

       To measure the tightness of the local labor market, data on the 1995 state

unemployment rate (UNEMP) is acquired from the Local Area Unemployment Statistics

on the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) web site (www.bls.gov). This variable is

matched to employers by the address of the main company headquarters.

       As a proxy for the market compensation constraint, we construct a measure of

total compensation per employee (TOT_COMP) from administrative data on the median

salary for LTD covered employees, from survey data on the generosity of health

insurance benefits offered by the firm, and from information on retirement benefits

offered by the firm. The dollar value of health coverage is computed as the product of 1)

the simulated percentage of general plus mental health expenditures covered on average


10
  For firms with incomplete administrative data, missing information on employee
characteristics is imputed using data from all employers in the sample universe that
reported complete information (See Salkever et al., 2000 for more information on this
imputation).

by the plans offered by the employer, 2) the percentage of the health plan cost paid by the

employer, and 3) the mean per capita spending for physicians, hospitals, drugs, and other

health professionals by persons with active employer-sponsored health insurance as

calculated from the 1996 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey.11 The cost of retirement

benefits is computed as the product of 1) a dummy variable for firms offering retirement

benefits, 2) the firm’s median salary, and 3) the estimated cost (in percentage terms) of

retirement benefits. The last term is calculated based on the Standard Industry

Classification (SIC)-category-specific percentage of compensation going to retirement

benefits as reported in the BLS Employment Cost Index (ECI), and the state-and-SIC-

specific percentage of employees reporting the receipt of retirement benefits in the April

1993 CPS.12

       It is hypothesized (Dowd and Feldman, 1987) that risk of illness should increase

the demand for coverage. The only available risk factor that could be used in this study is

the percent of employees with heavy alcohol consumption (HEAVY_ALC) in the

industry of the employer (Hoffman et al. 1997).

       The marginal tax rate (MTR) is calculated using 1994 state and federal rates and

tax laws compiled by the Advisory Commission of Intergovernmental Relations (ACIR,

  The method for simulating the generosity (i.e., percent coverage) of non-mental health
expenditures is analogous to that used for simulating mental health coverage generosity.
Further details are available from the authors.

  The CPS data are used to adjust for the fact that the compensation cost percentages in
the ECI data are for all firms rather than just for firms providing retirement benefits.

1995). The rate is based on the median income for full-time workers in 1994

(www.bls.gov). The rate is calculated assuming a standard deduction.

       Local health care and mental health care market characteristics pertain to the

health maintenance organizations (HMO) enrollment, expenditures on mental health

specialty services, and the area costs to Medicare. The 1995 per capita enrollment in

health maintenance organizations (HMO) is obtained from the Area Resource File

produced by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. This county level

measure is summed over the state and divided by state population to obtain state level per

capita HMO enrollment. Greater availability of HMO plans in the local market is

expected to be positively related to coverage generosity in that HMOs can presumably

offer more effective control of moral hazard costs arising from generous benefits relative

to PPO or traditional fee-for-service plans. We note, however, that simple descriptive

comparisons of plan types do not show that HMOs provide more generous coverage on

average and also show that HMOs tend to make more use of various benefit limitations

(Salkever and Shinogle, 2000; Salkever et al., 1999).

       To measure the importance of publicly funded mental health services in the state,

the percent of the mental health specialty expenditures (primarily for clinics and

hospitals) accounted for by public facilities is computed (PCTPUBEXP) from the 1994

Inventory of Mental Health Organizations Survey data (Substance Abuse and Mental

Health Services Administration, 1995).13 Since no state level measure of price for mental

health treatment is available, the 1996 local costs to Medicare (AAPCC) for health care



13
  The public facilities included state, regional, county, and other public mental health
facilities but excluded Veterans Administration or Tribal facilities.



                                            15
services for the elderly are used. This measure reflects the price of health care services as

well as the average level of use of these services by Medicare beneficiaries.

       State laws relating to 1) mental health benefits parity, 2) substance abuse

treatment and mental health treatment coverage mandates, and 3) premium taxes are

obtained from several sources. For each of the three types of laws, two variables are

included in the analysis: a 0 -1 dummy variable for firms located in states with the law in

effect in 1995 or earlier, and an interaction dummy which equaled one if the firm had less

than 1000 employees and the firm was located in a state with the specific benefit law in

effect. (The interacted variables are labeled with an "_EMP" extension (MAN_EMP,

PAR_EMP, and PREM_EMP).) Firm size is included in the interaction variables since

state insurance laws are not applicable to firms who self-insure. Our data contain no

information on the insured versus self-insured status of the health plan; thus we use firm

size as a proxy measure for self-insurance.14 To determine if the firm is located in a state

that had a mental health parity law in effect in 1995 (PARITY), information is obtained

from the National Institutes of Mental Health Parity Report (National Institutes of Mental

Health, 1998). For this analysis, only states with a full parity law are coded as having

parity. Information on states mandating coverage of mental health, alcohol abuse

treatment, and/or drug abuse treatment benefits were obtained from the National

Conference of State Legislators Health Tracking service (www.ncsl.org) as well as a

recent General Accounting Office report (U.S. GAO, 2000). (Laws mandating only the

14
  Uccello (1996) finds that for firms with 1000 or more employees, 75 percent are self-
insured; for firms with 500 to 999 employees, 46 percent are self-insured; for firms with
250 to 499 employees, 49 percent are self-insured; for firms with 100 to 249 employees,
27 percent are self insured and for firms with less than 100 employees approximately 10
percent are self-insured.



                                             16
offer of optional coverage are not considered.) If the firm was in a state that mandated all

three benefits (mental health, alcohol abuse, and drug abuse treatment) then the mandate

(MANDATE) variable is coded as one. State health insurance premium taxes vary with

the type of insurance product (HMO, Blue Cross and Blue Shield, or other private

insurance). The information on state health insurance premium taxes is derived from a

U.S. General Accounting Office Report (U.S. GAO, 1996). For our premium tax measure, we

use the maximum tax rate for any health insurance product within the state (PREMTAX).


       IV.     Estimation Methods


       Since our dependent variables have upper and lower limits (of no coverage and

full coverage), we use a two-limit Tobit regression approach. Results are reported for the

full model; to assess the stability of our strongest results to inclusion or exclusion of

explanatory variables with non-significant coefficients, we also report results obtained

when insignificant variables are selectivity removed in a backward selection process with

an exclusion criterion of p > 0.3. 15

       Since our total compensation constraint measure is based on firm-specific data

and uses our dependent variable (MHCOV) as one of the elements in its construction, it is

reasonable to consider the possibility that the coefficient for this variable is subject to

simultaneity bias.16 Accordingly, we re-estimate our full models using Amemiya’s



15
 In addition, we replicated our Tobit results using the GLM approach suggested by
Mullahy (2003) and by Papke and Wooldridge (1996). We also estimated linear OLS
models. Findings are virtually identical to those reported here.
16
   In relative terms, however, MHCOV accounts for only 0.003 percent of TOT_COMP
since mental health spending is only about 4 percent of total health spending.



                                              17
Generalized Least-Squares method for simultaneous equation Tobit models (Amemiya,

1979; Newey, 1987) and include two additional variables as instruments. These are the

population density in the county where the employer is located or headquartered

(DENSITY) and a dummy variable for firms that experience a layoff that changed the

number of employees by more than 15 percent in the five years preceding the survey

(ANYLAYOFF).17

       V.      Results

       Results of regressions on the overall (outpatient plus inpatient) generosity

measure (MHCOV) are reported in Table 5. Columns 1 through 4 present the results

with the occupation group variables included. Since we presume that these variables are

strongly correlated with our market compensation constraint variable (TOTCOMP), we

estimate our models both with and without these variables. Results obtained when they

are excluded are shown in Columns 5 through 8. As a group, variables relating to

employee characteristics are found to exert a strong influence on the generosity of mental

health benefits. Percent female is a strong positive predictor of generosity and the

industry-level risk-factor variable (HEAVYALC) also has a significantly positive

coefficient. The fraction of total employees who are salaried is a positive predictor of

generosity up to approximately 68 percent, beyond which further increases in percent

salaried reduce generosity. If salaried workers generally have higher levels of education,

we might expect a positive relationship of PCTSAL to generosity throughout the 0 to 100

percent range based on the empirical literature on demand for mental health services


17
  Analogous linear IV models were also estimated since the numbers of limit dependent
variable observations in our data were small. Here again the results were essentially the
same as for the Tobit models.



                                            18
(Newhouse JP, 1993). The reasons for our finding of a more pronounced downturn at

higher levels of PCTSAL are unclear.18 Results for the variables describing the

occupational mix of employees are not quite as strong, but there is some support for the

expectation that workers in white-collar jobs (OCCWC) and skilled blue-collar jobs

(OCCBL) have a stronger demand for generous mental health coverage.

       Results for the firm size dummies indicate a positive effect on generosity as the

employee pool increases from under 500 to over 500 employees and from under 2000 to

over 2000 employees; a positive effect over the range from 500 to 2000 is not observed.

The presence of unions per se does not appear to affect generosity while the per capita

HMO enrollment rate in the state is a strongly negative predictor of generosity.

       A number of the variables typically found in economic models of insurance

demand do not have significant coefficients in our regressions. These include the

marginal tax rate (MTR), the premium tax rate (PREMTAX), and our proxy for the price

per unit of generosity (AAPCC). The tightness of the local labor market, as measured by

UNEMP, is also not significant. The market compensation variable (TOT_COMP) is

weakly positive; since some previous studies (e.g., Wells et al., 1986; Taube et al. 1986)

have reported positive relationships between income and mental health utilization or

expenditures, we suspect that the weakness of our result may be at least partly due to

measurement errors in this variable.

       Finally, several results for variables relating to public policies are of interest. The

strongly negative coefficients for PCTPUBEXP indicate a crowding out of private


18
  One might speculate that the strength of adverse selection also is stronger for salaried
employees and that this tends to cause a decline in average generosity of coverage as the
percent of salaried workers increases, offsetting other positive effects.



                                             19
coverage by public spending. The magnitude of this effect is fairly small however; a 10

percent increase in PCTPUBEXP predicts a reduction of about 1 percent in mental health

coverage. State legislation of benefit mandates does not show any effect on coverage but

we do observe a large and strongly positive effect of parity laws on coverage generosity

for firms with less than 1,000 employees. A reasonable interpretation of this result is that

state parity laws have diminished problems with adverse selection by excluding plans

with minimal mental health coverage from the underwritten portion of the market. Self-

insured firms, which are typically larger, are not affected directly by these parity laws and

our results suggest that there are minimal spill-over indirect effects on their coverage

decisions.

       Analogous regression results for outpatient coverage generosity (MHOPCOV) are

reported in Table 6. For the most part, these results closely parallel the findings for total

mental health coverage. Evidence for the crowd-out effect of public expenditures and for

the impact of parity on smaller firms is slightly stronger.

       In the regression results for inpatient coverage generosity (MHIPCOV) in Table

7, we find that a smaller number of our explanatory variables are significant. Firm size

effects do not occur above 500 employees. AAPCC has a strongly positive coefficient but

this may be primarily due to inter-area variations in utilization (rather than prices) since

areas where general hospitalization use is high may also display greater hospitalization

use for mental health treatments. The positive effect of PCTSAL does not diminish at

higher values.19 Apart from the industry-level risk factor (HEAVYALC), employee


19
  If inpatient coverage is less affected by adverse selection, this finding would be
consistent with our earlier speculation (in Note 18).




                                             20
characteristics do not appear to exert a strong influence on observed demand for inpatient

coverage. Results for our policy variables are also rather different than in Tables 5 and 6.

Coverage mandates appear to have a negative effect for all firms regardless of size and

parity laws have a positive effect for all firms. Public-sector spending does not appear to

crowd out private coverage for inpatient treatment. Finally, the results for UNEMP do

show some evidence of a negative relationship between labor-market slack and inpatient

coverage.

       Instrumental variable results with total compensation treated as endogenous are

reported in Appendix Tables 1-3. The IV estimates are generally quite close to the simple

Tobit results but a few differences are noteworthy. First, the positive effect of

TOT_COMP on insurance demand is somewhat stronger in the IV results, particularly in

the total and outpatient generosity regressions when other non-significant variables are

deleted from the models.20 These coefficient estimates suggest a coverage demand

elasticity, evaluated at mean values, of approximately 0.15. Second, the parity effect for

smaller firms is somewhat weaker in the IV models when all explanatory variables are

included; exclusion of non-significant explanatory variables yields results that are more

similar to the simple Tobit estimates. Finally, we test for overidentification by re-

estimating our models as standard linear IV regressions and computing Basmann’s

(1960) test statistic. We generally fail to reject our null hypothesis with p-values ranging

from 0.166 to 0.387. The only exception is the inpatient coverage regressions with the

occupational variables excluded (Columns 5 and 6).



20
 Note that in the IV regressions with non-significant variables deleted, these variables
were retained as instruments.


                                             21
               VI.     Discussion


       The demand for mental health coverage under employer-sponsored health

insurance is strongly driven by employee characteristics. Our results show a strong

positive demand effect for the firm-level percent of workers who are female and percent

of salaried workers, and the industry-level percent of employees with heavy alcohol

consumption. Our results are similar to Bundorf’s (2002) small-firm results in that she

finds a positive effect for the variation in worker characteristics (measured through a

health risk variable that includes demographic information) on choice of plan and plan

generosity. Our gender result also accords with the finding of Long and Scott (1982) that

the percent of total employment that is female has a significantly positive effect on the

percent of compensation received as health insurance.

       As in Bundorf’s (2002) small-firm results, we also find some support for the

hypothesis that the income or total compensation effect is positive. Our results are not,

however, very strong. Future research should further examine the effects of area

compensation on health plan generosity.

       We find other economic factors, such as labor market tightness, premium taxes

and marginal income tax rates, to be weak predictors of mental health coverage

generosity. These variables have had mixed effects in previous studies. Gruber and

Lettau (2004) find significant marginal tax effects on health insurance offering, but their

results are also driven by smaller establishment data (<100 employees). Similarly,

Leibowitz and Chernew (1992) find tax rates significantly associated with firms offering

health insurance but only for firms with less than 50 employees.




                                             22
       State benefit mandates do not appear to lower the fraction of total and outpatient

mental health expenditures covered but are negative predictors of the fraction of inpatient

mental health expenditures covered. On the other hand, state mental health parity laws

significantly increase the fraction of mental health expenditures covered for smaller

firms. This supports the concept that the parity laws may lower the potential adverse

selection effects. This could lower the marginal benefit costs of more generous coverage.

Other direct evidence on this finding is limited; Bao and Sturm (2004) found little effect

of parity on employee’s perceived quality of health insurance coverage, perceived access

or use of specialty services. To the extent that parity simultaneously increases coverage

generosity and the use of utilization management mechanisms, the two findings could be

consistent.

       Finally, the lower coverage of mental health (total and outpatient) expenditures

for firms located in states where the public facilities account for a higher percentage of

the total mental health specialty expenditures supports the expectation of crowding out of

private benefits by public services. This is consistent with a recent finding of crowd-out

effects for public hospital facilities on individual’s private insurance coverage status

reported by Rask and Rask (2000). Other recent crowd-out estimates of public insurance

programs (such as Medicaid) on employer offers of health insurance have reported

similar results. Marquis and Long (2003) find a substitution between the employer offer

of health insurance and pubic coverage of children during the Medicaid expansions.

Shore-Shepard et al. (2000) find no effect of the expansion on employer offers of

insurance, but they did find a significant decline in coverage generosity measured as




                                             23
offering family coverage and employees’ share of premiums (both single and family

coverage).

        While we believe that a strength of this study is in its bringing together of

employer-level data on mental health benefit offerings and data on employee

characteristics, the reader should note several important limitations in these data. First,

the cross-sectional nature of the data suggests the need for caution in drawing causal

inferences about policy variables. In particular, it is possible that omitted state-specific

population characteristics which influence the adoption of mandate and parity laws, or

the provision of publicly funded mental health services, may also be related to

employees’ preferences for insurance coverage. Panel data are clearly needed to control

for these omitted state characteristics and to provide more definitive estimates of impacts

for these factors.

        Second, the generalizability of our results to a broader universe of firms may be

problematic. Since only 17 percent of surveyed firms responded to our detailed

questionnaire, there is clearly some potential for response bias, though our tests have

failed to detect it. (See Salkever et al., 2000 and 2003; additional information is available

from the authors.) A more serious concern arises from the fact that our sample of firms

was drawn from a list of firm's that offer employees long-term disability insurance

coverage. These firms are presumably larger and offer a richer fringe benefit package

than a representative sample of all U.S. firms. Comparing our firms to establishments

who cover long-term disability insurance from the 1993 National Employer Health

Insurance Survey finds a similar geographic distribution and similar firm size.




                                              24
       One other data deficiency, which of course is common to most studies, is gaps in

available data on explanatory variables. Given the focus of this analysis, it would clearly

be desirable to have more information on employee characteristics such as education that

could be expected to influence demand for coverage. Our area total compensation

variable is also incomplete; important parts of the compensation package such as short-

term and long-term disability insurance, are not valued due to the lack of data while

national averages (rather than firm-specific data) are used in several parts of our method

for constructing this variable.



       VII.     Conclusions and Future Directions



       ThIs study provides some additional empirical support for the long-standing

proposition in the economic literature that demand for employer-provided health

insurance is derived from the preferences and characteristics of the covered employees.

While the previous empirical support for this proposition has come from results for small

firms, our results pertain primarily to medium-size and larger firms. Of course, the

support we provide is somewhat qualified in that some of our employee characteristics

variables are not significant predictors or displayed unexpected patterns of influence (as

in the case of the percent of workers who are salaried). Further testing of this general

proposition is certainly warranted, perhaps including a more detailed examination of the

differences between small and large firm results reported in previous studies.

       One could also view the consistency of our results with earlier studies as

supporting the view that demand for mental health coverage generally responds to the




                                            25
same incentives and factors as demand for general health coverage. We do, however,

find that some policy interventions directed at enhancing access to mental health care

(specifically public provision and parity legislation) do impact on coverage decisions. As

noted above, further testing of these policy impacts with panel data sets is clearly needed.

       The comparison of the simple conceptual model that we use to motivate our

empirical research with the compensation-cost-minimizing models described in previous

studies also raises some interesting questions for future investigation. While the latter

model focuses on employee preferences and utility, the recent literatures on the cost of

mental disorders in the workplace to employers (Goetzel et al. 2003; Goldberg and

Steury, 2001; Goetzel et al. 1998; Kessler and Frank, 1997) and the effectiveness of

interventions to prevent or treat these disorders (Goetzel et al. 2002); implies that the

employers may also have a direct interest in the mental health coverage decision.21 If

empirical indicators that may relate to employer costs can be developed (e.g., amount of

firm-specific human capital, the prevalence of team production methods), their inclusion

in models of coverage demand would provide an empirical test of the view that both

employers and employees have distinct stakes in this decision.

       Finally, extension of this research with more recent data should expand its scope

by including information about drug coverage. Pharmacotherapies are now a critical

element in the treatment of mental disorders, and studies of insurance coverage for the

costs of treating these disorders must recognize this fact.




21
  A similar point about employer benefits from employee health coverage has been
noted, in a somewhat different context, by Dey and Flinn (2005).
