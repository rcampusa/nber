Does Gentrification Displace Poor Children? New Evidence from New York City Medicaid

                                         ABSTRACT

The pace of gentrification has accelerated in cities across the country since 2000, and many
observers fear it is displacing low-income populations from their homes and communities. We
offer new evidence about the consequences of gentrification on mobility, building and
neighborhood conditions, using longitudinal New York City Medicaid records from January 2009
to December 2015 to track the movement of a cohort of low-income children over seven years,
during a period of rapid gentrification in the city. We leverage building-level data to examine
children in market rate housing separately from those in subsidized housing. We find no evidence
that gentrification is associated with meaningful changes in mobility rates over the seven-year
period. It is associated with slightly longer distance moves. As for changes in neighborhood
conditions, we find that children who start out in a gentrifying area experience larger
improvements in some aspects of their residential environment than their counterparts who start
out in persistently low-socioeconomic status areas. This effect is driven by families who stay in
neighborhoods as they gentrify; we observe few differences in the characteristics of destination
neighborhoods among families who move, though we find modest evidence that children moving
from gentrifying areas move to lower-quality buildings.

       Gentrification—or the in-movement of college-educated, higher-income residents into

historically low-income areas—has grown more common in U.S. cities since 1990, and

especially since 2000 (Baum-Snow and Hartley, 2017; Couture and Handbury, 2017; Ellen and

Ding, 2016). Low-income neighborhoods in New York City have seen particularly large

increases in mean income, educational attainment, and rents (Furman Center, 2016). While these

trends have attracted considerable attention from the media, the lack of large, longitudinal

datasets on the movement of populations over time has limited the ability of researchers to draw

firm conclusions about their consequences.

       Observers commonly voice concern that rent and cost-of-living increases or shifts in

neighborhood composition from gentrification force low-income families, who may have lived in

an area for generations, out of their homes and communities and pushes them to lower quality

buildings and higher poverty neighborhoods that offer inferior public services and amenities.

While existing studies provide little evidence of such displacement, those analyses generally

focus on the 1980s and 1990s, when the pace of gentrification was slower, and rely on datasets

that cannot identify where people settle after they move.

       A few recent studies use new longitudinal datasets to compare mobility patterns in

gentrifying and persistently low-socioeconomic status (SES) areas since 2000 and find evidence

that gentrification increases displacement either modestly (Brummet and Reed, 2019) or more

substantially (Aron-Dine and Bunten, 2019). However, these studies do not use building-level

data and are not able to distinguish between low-income renters living in subsidized housing and

those living in market-rate housing. If gentrification displaces people through rent increases or

economic pressure, those living in market rate housing would be at higher risk than those in

subsidized housing.




                                                                                                    3
       In contrast to earlier studies, we focus on young children, given the evidence that they are

most sensitive to neighborhood conditions. Specifically, we use New York State’s Medicaid

claims database from January 2009 through December 2015 to shed new light on this question.

As a large, administrative dataset, the Medicaid claims data contain residential address data for

over 6 million New York State Medicaid enrollees annually. Using these longitudinal

administrative data, we can track the residential movements of a cohort of low-income, New

York City (NYC) children born between 2006 and 2008 who were continuously enrolled in

Medicaid from 2009 to 2015. Importantly, because these data contain exact addresses throughout

the period, we are also able to control for whether a family is living in public housing or another

type of subsidized building, as roughly 20% of our sample does. Families with housing supports

are less likely to move and may be less affected by gentrification. In most of our analyses, we

exclude subsidized families, focusing on those most vulnerable to displacement.

       Our results suggest that low-income children who start out in NYC neighborhoods that

gentrify are no more likely to move over the seven-year follow-up period than those who start

out in neighborhoods that remain low-income and do not gentrify. This is even true for low-

income children who live in market-rate, rental housing. Gentrification, however, or at least

extreme gentrification, is associated with mean distance moved, as well as the likelihood of

moving to a different borough (county) or ZIP code. In other words, when families move, they

move further from gentrifying neighborhoods than from persistently low-SES areas; this is

consistent with the idea that they may need to travel further to find an affordable home.

       Unlike prior researchers, we can also identify the precise buildings where children live

and can provide a rich description of the neighborhoods where low-income residents of

gentrifying neighborhoods end up, including levels of violence and the performance of the zoned




                                                                                                    4
elementary school. Contrary to fears voiced by many, we find that the average low-income child

who starts out in areas that later gentrify experiences a reduction in neighborhood poverty,

mainly because the majority do not move as neighborhood income rises around them.

Specifically, low-income children who live in a low-income area in 2009 that later gentrifies

experience a roughly three percentage point greater decline in neighborhood poverty than those

who start out in low-income areas that do not gentrify. While these reductions are driven by the

stayers, contrary to conventional wisdom, families who move away from gentrifying

neighborhoods do not appear to end up in more disadvantaged areas than those who move from

persistently low-SES neighborhoods. As compared to movers from persistently low-SES

neighborhoods, movers from gentrifying neighborhoods end up in areas with similar poverty

rates, and if anything, lower levels of crime. That said, we find some evidence that children who

move from gentrifying neighborhoods see lesser gains (and possibly some deterioration) in

building conditions, as measured by serious building code violations. Finally, children staying

in gentrifying neighborhoods see a relative reduction in the math scores of their local zoned

school.


Background

          Gentrification has attracted considerable media attention in the last few years. But

despite its common usage, the term does not have a precise meaning, with different people

interpreting it very differently. We use the term gentrification to describe large, relative

increases in the share of adults with college degrees in initially low-income, central city

neighborhoods since such changes likely reflect the influx of gentrifiers to a neighborhood rather

than any incumbent upgrading. Further, college degrees are measured with less error than

income or rent, and are more likely to capture permanent income. Whether using this definition



                                                                                                   5
or other variants, it is clear that gentrification has become more common since 2000 (Baum-

Snow and Hartley, 2017; Couture and Handbury, 2017; Edlund, Machado, and Sviatschi, 2015;

Ellen and Ding, 2016).

        Gentrification has also grown more controversial. While the choices of higher-income

and more educated households to move to lower-income, city neighborhoods enhance integration

in the short-term, many worry that their in-movement will bid up house prices and rents and

displace long-time residents. It is certainly true that rents are rising in the low-income

neighborhoods that are attracting higher-income in-movers. Consider that in U.S. cities between

2000 and 2014, initially low-income census tracts that “gentrified,” or experienced large gains in

income relative to their city, also experienced an average increase of 42 percent in real rents. By

contrast, initially low-income, central city tracts around the country that did not see large gains in

income between 2000 and 2014 saw more modest rent increases of 17 percent (Ellen, 2018).

Yet despite these rising rents, most of the papers examining the consequences of gentrification

have found scant evidence of displacement (Ellen and O’Regan, 2011; Freeman, 2005;

McKinnish, Walsh, and White, 2010; Vigdor, 2002). Further, some research has found that

low-income residents who stay in gentrifying areas report greater increases in satisfaction with

their neighborhoods than low-income residents who stay in persistently low-SES areas (Ellen

and O’Regan, 2011), and Autor, Palmer and Pathak (2017) suggest that crime falls in gentrifying

areas. 1 Qualitative research suggests that residents appreciate at least some of the new amenities

and improved services in their communities (Dastrup and Ellen, 2016; Freeman, 2006).

        The lack of evidence for displacement is something of a puzzle as well as a frustration to

many observers who are certain that they are witnessing low- and moderate-income households

 Other studies focusing on crime changes have found mixed results (Covington and Taylor, 1985; Papachristos et
al, 2011), but Autor et al (2017) use the most recent data and convincing identification strategy.


                                                                                                                 6
being displaced as their communities gentrify. Part of the issue may be that displacement is

simply more salient in gentrifying areas. People may be less likely to notice the evictions and

forced moves in other neighborhoods, because in non-gentrifying neighborhoods newly entering

tenants more closely resemble those exiting. It is also possible that the academic studies have

failed to capture the phenomenon because of poor measures or inadequate data. Most previous

studies, for example, have relied on the American Housing Survey, or other longitudinal datasets

that follow housing units, not people (Ellen and O’Regan, 2011; Freeman and Braconi, 2004;

Vigdor, 2002). These data indicate when a household moves out of a housing unit but do not

provide any information about why households move or where they end up when they do.

       The few studies that use longitudinal datasets that follow households over time have

generally had limited samples in gentrifying areas. For example, Freeman (2005) uses a

geocoded version of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, which offers a relatively small,

national sample of poor renters in cities experiencing rapid gentrification. (Like most other

studies, gentrifying neighborhoods are defined as those seeing gains relative to other

neighborhoods in the metropolitan area, so neighborhoods are deemed to be gentrifying even in

areas with soft housing markets.) The study finds no evidence of elevated mobility among

renters in gentrifying neighborhoods but modest evidence of an increase in the number of

involuntary moves. The results show no elevated risk of displacement among poor renters,

though the small sample is relatively small.

       Another issue is that most of the papers on gentrification studied the 1980s or 1990s,

when gentrification was less common and rent increases were more modest. The papers that

study the consequences of gentrification during a more recent period offer somewhat more

evidence of displacement.




                                                                                                  7
         First, a pair of recent studies use data from the Consumer Credit Panel, which follows a

five percent sample of all adults with credit scores. Ding, Hwang, and Divringi (2017) examine

gentrification 2 in Philadelphia during the 2000s and find that disadvantaged residents who live in

neighborhoods that gentrify are no more likely to leave their homes than other disadvantaged

residents, but when they leave, they are more likely to move to a lower-income neighborhood,

suggesting that these moves are less likely to be affirmative choices. Aron-Dine and Bunten

(2019) broaden the scope to the country as a whole and use a novel definition of gentrification

based on price-to-income ratios, which they can estimate at the census tract level, allowing them

to filter out early gentrifiers from the group of original residents. 3 They find more evidence of

displacement using this definition than earlier work did. But this research has limited

applicability at the census tract level (because rent information is rarely available at this

granularity) and the sample used includes only individuals with a credit score, which may

exclude some disadvantaged households. Further, the dataset is missing measures of tenure and

income and while it includes a proxy for disadvantaged renters (individuals with a low credit

score who do not have a mortgage), it does not separately identify households living in market-

rate (versus subsidized housing). Finally, the study does not describe the attributes of the

neighborhoods where households end up.

         Brummet and Reed (2019) also offer an important new analysis, using a unique dataset

that links individuals who responded to both the 2000 decennial Census and the American

Community Survey in a year between 2010 and 2014. They observe a longer time period than

many studying gentrification and find evidence of modest increases in mobility among low-

  The existing studies using the PSID include self-reported residence in assisted housing, but households often mis-
report.
3 The need to filter out “early gentrifiers” is less important for our study, because we are studying low-income
Medicaid recipients who are unlikely to be gentrifiers themselves.


                                                                                                                       8
income renters in neighborhoods that gentrify. But in their analysis, low-income individuals

moving from gentrifying areas do not end up in more disadvantaged neighborhoods.

       We build on this new research through leveraging the New York State Medicaid

administrative records to characterize the relationship between gentrification, mobility, and

neighborhood quality. Unlike these other studies, we focus on young children, as we have

stronger evidence that neighborhood environments shape the outcomes of young children than

any other age-group (Chetty et al, 2015). Specifically, we aim to shed light on whether children

living in gentrifying neighborhoods move more frequently and longer distances than comparable

children living in persistently low income neighborhoods, as well as whether there is any

difference in the characteristics of the buildings and neighborhoods where they end up.

       The New York State Medicaid dataset provides several advantages over previous datasets

used in gentrification research. First, as Medicaid is a needs-based social program, most

recipients are, by definition, under 154 percent of the federal poverty line (with the exception of

some children with disabilities) and therefore more vulnerable to displacement. Second, we

focus on New York City, a large, high cost city that has experienced rapid increases in rents

since 2000 (Furman Center, 2016). While New York City is no more representative of the

national picture than any other city, the large size of the city and the rapid pace of gentrification

make it important to study. Third, the data include a near universe of low-income children in the

city, who we can follow over seven years. We select a cohort of children born between 2006 and

2008 who were continuously enrolled in Medicaid from the start of 2009 through the end of

2015, for whom we have the most accurate and real-time address records. This captures a time-

period in New York City when concern about gentrification was widespread.




                                                                                                        9
       Finally, unlike other research, the Medicaid data identify the precise buildings where

children live in each year, which allows us to restrict our sample to children who live in

multifamily rental buildings, to identify the children who live in public housing and other forms

of subsidized rental housing, and to observe changes in building conditions and very localized

measures of neighborhood environments, including crime rates and school performance. We do

not believe any other studies of gentrification have been able to track changes in the conditions

of buildings where children live.



Data and Methods

       Cohort selection. We focus on the universe of Medicaid-enrolled, low-income children

born in New York City between 2006 and 2008. We use the New York City Department of City

Planning’s GBAT software to clean and geocode residential addresses for children from 2009

through 2015. With the geocoded addresses, we extract the children who had a valid New York

City address in January of 2009 (n = 239,882). We further restrict the sample to include only

those children who were continuously enrolled in Medicaid from January 2009 through

December of 2015, because we are more confident about the accuracy of the residential

addresses for the population that is continually engaged with the Medicaid program.

Additionally, we can only count the total number of moves for children for whom we have

annual address records over the seven-year period. (When replicating the results for a larger

sample that was enrolled in January 2009 and December 2015, but not necessarily every month

in between, we obtain nearly identical results.) We also limit the study population to children

living in multi-family rental buildings to exclude both families who own their homes and are

thus insulated from rising rents, and exclude as well higher income families whose children




                                                                                                  10
qualify for Medicaid due to disabilities rather than income. Finally, we limit the study cohort to

children whose starting census tract had valid income estimates from American Community

Survey data. Figure 1 illustrates the construction of the final study cohort. Our final sample

includes 56,992 children. Our regressions focus on the 44,356 who live in low-income

neighborhoods (defined below) in 2005-2009, and, where indicated, are further restricted to the

35,710 in market rate housing within low-income neighborhoods.

       Measurement. Following other studies, we use census tracts to proxy for neighborhoods

and use five-year estimates from the American Community Survey to characterize conditions.

We draw on 2005-2009 estimates to describe the characteristics of the neighborhoods where

children live in 2009 and 2011-2015 estimates to describe the characteristics of the

neighborhoods where they live in 2015. Unlike other studies, however, we supplement Census

data with administrative data on neighborhood conditions and services. Specifically, we draw on

violent crime data from the New York City Police Department to characterize the safety level of

neighborhoods; data on school performance from the NYC Department of Education to describe

the elementary school for which each residential building is zoned; and serious housing code

violations data from the NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development to capture

housing quality.

       We assign each child’s January 2009 census tract to one of four categories: higher-

income; persistently low-SES; moderately gentrifying or rapidly gentrifying. Higher-income

neighborhoods are those with mean incomes in the top 60 percent of New York City tracts in the

2005-2009 American Community Survey. Persistently low SES and gentrifying neighborhoods

both start out with mean incomes in the bottom 40 percent of the city’s distribution, as measured

by the 2005-2009 American Community Survey. But gentrifying neighborhoods experience a




                                                                                                 11
growth in the share of adults with college degrees in the top quarter of the city’s neighborhoods

between 2005-2009 and 2011-2015, with moderately gentrifying neighborhoods seeing a growth

in percent college-educated between the 25th and 10th percentile of the city’s distribution and

those that experience rapid gentrification seeing an increase in the top decile. As discussed later,

we replicate results using growth in mean income and growth in rents to define gentrifying areas

and obtain similar, though not identical, results. We also repeat our analysis using

Neighborhood Tabulation Areas and, at this broader level of aggregation, replicate the measure

of gentrification used by Aron-Dine and Bunten.

        Figure 2 shows the geographic distribution of the tracts by gentrification status across

New York City. As expected, the gentrifying tracts tend to be concentrated in Brooklyn as well

as areas in Upper Manhattan. Note that we are capturing tracts that experienced gentrification

between 2009 through 2015, so they tend to be further from core Manhattan than the

neighborhoods that experienced earlier waves of gentrification.

        We characterize mobility using several metrics. “Ever moved” is a binary variable that

takes a value of 1 if a child’s December 2015 address is different from his or her January 2009

address. “Number of moves” is the number of changes in address a child experiences between

2009 and 2015. “Distance moved” is the as-the-crow-flies distance between the child’s

December 2015 address and his or her January 2009 address. (We only calculate this metric for

children whose December 2015 address is in New York City.) We also report whether children

move to a different ZIP Code, borough or outside of New York City altogether. 4

        We construct several measures to capture the changes in neighborhood environment each

child experiences. First, we calculate the net change in poverty rate, or the child’s 2015

City move to another part of New York State.


                                                                                                           12
neighborhood’s poverty rate minus her 2009 neighborhood’s poverty rate. As for other measures

of neighborhood environment, we capture changes in overall and violent crime rate at the census

tract level between 2009 and 2015. To minimize noise, we use three-year crime averages for

each year (2007-2009 and 2013-2015). 5 Finally, we match each building to the elementary

school for which it is zoned and measure the performance of schools by their average math and

English Language Arts (ELA) 4th grade passing rates (converted to Z-scores). We subtract the

2009 Z-score of the school for which a child is zoned in January 2009 from the 2015 Z-score of

the school for which he or she is zoned in December 2015 to calculate net change in zoned

school performance.

           Finally, we also calculate changes in the building conditions that children experience,

using the number of serious housing code violations per unit (code violation rate) as a proxy for

quality. We subtract the code violation rate of the building where a child lived in 2009 from the

code violation rate of the building where he or she lived in 2015.

           Analytic strategy. All studies of the relationship between gentrification and mobility face

a challenge in isolating causality, as families with more unobserved resources may select into

gentrifying neighborhoods. Unfortunately, it is difficult to instrument for gentrification, since

predictors of gentrification (like proximity to high-income neighborhoods or midtown

Manhattan) capture underlying tract attributes that might differentially attract certain types of

families. We attempt to isolate causal relationships by controlling for individual characteristics

and both baseline neighborhood conditions and pre-existing trends. We restrict the sample for

the regressions to the children who start off in “gentrifiable” census tracts, or those classified as

low-income in 2005-2009.

    We use 5-year 2005-2009 and 2011-2015 population counts to calculate rates.

distance to Empire State Building (our proxy for the CBD), distance to the nearest subway

station, 2009 income, 2009 mean rent, 2009 share of adults with college degrees, and pre-

existing trends in share of adults with college degrees, measured between 2000 and 2009; Z

represents attributes of the building, including subsidy status; and ε is an error term. We cluster

standard errors at the tract level. Our key coefficient of interest is β1, as it shows differences

between experiences of children who started out in low-SES neighborhoods that later gentrified

rapidly and those of children who started out in low-SES neighborhoods that did not gentrify.

For most of our regressions, we restrict to children who start out living in a market-rate rental

building since they are the children most at risk of displacement. These children represent about

80 percent of our sample.

        In our first set of regressions, we consider mobility rates and in the second set, changes in

neighborhood conditions experienced by children. Note that we focus on regressions that show

changes in neighborhood environment for all children, regardless of whether or not they move

residences, since mobility patterns themselves may be shaped by gentrification. Finally, we also




                                                                                                     14
compare changes in neighborhood outcomes only for the set of children who move residences

during our time period.

        Summary Statistics. Table 1 shows that 44,356 children, or nearly 80 percent of the final

study cohort live in census tracts that were classified as low-income in 2005-2009, even though

these two types of neighborhoods only comprised 40 percent of all New York City

neighborhoods during this time period.

        Table 2a summarizes the baseline characteristics of the children in the cohort, including

race, age, and borough, and Table 2b shows mean neighborhood income, crime rate, and local

elementary school performance by tract. The children starting out in higher income areas are diff

notably from the other groups: they are much more likely to be white and Asian and are much

less likely to be black or Hispanic or live in subsidized housing compared with those in

persistently low-SES areas. The children who start out in gentrifying and persistently low-SES

neighborhoods look fairly similar, though those in areas that would rapidly gentrify between

2009 and 2015 are somewhat less likely to be white or Hispanic, and more likely to be Asian or

black. They are also less likely to live in subsidized housing. Although we limit all analyses to

continuously enrolled children (Figure 1), we also conduct an attrition analysis among the full

non-continuously enrolled population to test whether we are introducing selection bias with the

continuous enrollment constraint. We find that among the non-continuous cohort, 42% of

children in persistently low-SES areas disenroll at some point in the 7-year period, versus 43%,

41%, and 48% in rapidly gentrifying, moderately gentrifying, and higher income areas,

respectively. 6

  Given our key comparison is between children in gentrifying and persistently low-SES areas, the unequal attrition
rates of children in higher income areas (48%) and those in persistently low-SES areas (42%) is of minimal concern.
(And as noted above, we replicate the results we can for non-continually enrolled children and obtain highly similar
results.)


                                                                                                                 15
          As for baseline characteristics of neighborhoods, Table 2b shows large and unsurprising

differences between the higher income neighborhoods on the one hand and the gentrifying and

persistently low-SES neighborhoods on the other. The baseline differences between the

neighborhoods that gentrify and those that do not are far more modest. In fact, moderately

gentrifying neighborhoods have somewhat lower incomes and higher poverty rates in 2009 than

low-income neighborhoods that do not gentrify. The rapidly gentrifying neighborhoods have

slightly higher baseline incomes and slightly lower poverty rates. Trends in income are fairly

similar, though gentrifying areas experienced somewhat larger declines in income between 2000

and 2009. As expected, gentrifying neighborhoods are more likely to be in Brooklyn and are

somewhat closer to midtown Manhattan, consistent with earlier research.



Results

          Table 3 shows the raw mean values of each outcome variable by gentrification category.

The differences in raw means suggest that there are only very small differences in mobility

patterns across neighborhood types over the 7-year follow up period (Jan 2009-Dec 2015).

Medicaid children who start out in neighborhoods that gentrify are slightly more likely to move

at least once between January 2009 and December 2015 as their counterparts who start out in

persistently low SES neighborhoods, but differences are very small. Mobility rates are high

across the board for this population, with nearly half of children moving regardless of their

neighborhood. As we show in Appendix Table A1, we also observe very similar rates of

mobility across demographic groups in our sample; together, these results suggest that mobility

is a persistent factor in the lives of low-income families regardless of neighborhood of residence

or demographic group, echoing literature on risk factors for residential mobility in the US




                                                                                                 16
(Gillespie, 2017). Mobility rates, while notably lower, are still quite high in absolute terms for

families living in subsidized housing (31.4%) or public housing (35.6%),

       The average child starting out in a low-income neighborhood makes 1.1 residential

moves between 2009 and 2015, regardless of whether their neighborhood gentrifies. The

bottom panel of the table shows that among children who move over the period, those who move

from gentrifying neighborhoods tend to move further away from their original home and are

more likely to move to another borough ZIP Code and borough, perhaps suggesting greater

dislocation from the moves. That said, they are no more likely to move out of New York City

altogether.

       Further, gentrification does not appear to push children to more disadvantaged

neighborhoods. On average, children starting out in gentrifying neighborhoods experience

greater reductions in neighborhood poverty than do their counterparts who are born in

persistently low-income neighborhoods. Further, children starting out in gentrifying

neighborhoods see slightly larger reductions in both overall neighborhood crime and violent

crime than do their counterparts. However, children starting out in gentrifying neighborhoods

see slightly larger reductions in the performance of their neighborhood elementary school.

       Table 3 also shows differences in the ending neighborhood attributes relative to the

baseline 2009 value. Children starting off in low-income neighborhoods that would gentrify

experienced a reduction in neighborhood poverty rate while those that started off in

neighborhoods that remained persistently low SES saw an increase in neighborhood poverty.

Neighborhoods that gentrify have higher rates of crime at the start of the period but see larger

declines. Average test scores at local elementary schools declined across the board, though




                                                                                                     17
declines in math test scores are larger in gentrifying neighborhoods. 7 Finally, children starting in

all neighborhoods appear to see improvements in building conditions, though this may be due to

a difference in city recording practices during this period. At the start of the period, children in

rapidly gentrifying neighborhoods live in buildings with fewer code violations per unit than their

counterparts in moderately gentrifying and persistently low SES neighborhoods. By the end of

the period, they are all living in buildings with similar code violation rates.

        Many of these results hold up in regressions that control for individual and starting

neighborhood characteristics. The first column of Table 4 shows regression results for a linear

probability regression of moving between January 2009 and December 2015. (Results are

qualitatively the same when estimating with a logistic regression.) Children living in the Bronx

and Brooklyn are 4.1 and 5.6 percentage points more likely to move than those living in

Manhattan, children living a mile closer to a subway station are 3.5 percentage points more

likely to move, and children who are black are 7.3 percentage points more likely to move than

non-Hispanic white children. Children living in subsidized housing are much (nearly 20

percentage points) less likely to move than other children. We see no difference in mobility rates

between those living in gentrifying neighborhoods and those living in persistently low-SES

neighborhoods.



Market rate renters

        The effects of gentrification are likely to be different for children who live in subsidized

housing and are protectd against rent increases than for those who live in market-rate housing.



7
 Note that the change in the Z-scores are negative across all neighborhood types, suggesting that children on
Medicaid either lived near to schools that saw a deterioration in proficiency rates or moved to lower-performing
schools when they moved.


                                                                                                               18
We next compare the effects of gentrification across children in all housing and those in market-

rate housing only.

       The first column of Table 5 presents the coefficient on initial residence in a neighborhood

that would rapidly gentrify in a series of regressions of different outcomes (shown in rows) that

control for baseline individual characteristics, baseline neighborhood attributes and recent

neighborhood trends. The omitted neighborhood category in each regression is persistently low

income, so the coefficient on rapidly gentrifying can be interpreted as showing the difference

between children who start out in low-SES neighborhoods that rapidly gentrify and those who

start out in neighborhoods that remain persistently low-SES. The results largely echo those in

Table 3.

       The first column of Table 5 shows results for all renters, while the second column and all

subsequent tables focus on market rate renters only. Children who start off in gentrifying areas

are no more likely to move and move no more frequently than those who start in areas that

remain persistently low-SES areas. In the bottom panel of the table, which restricts the analysis

to movers, we see that children who move from gentrifying areas tend to move further and are

more likely to move to another ZIP Code and borough, though they are no more likely to leave

New York City.

       Children who start out in gentrifying areas experience significantly greater reductions in

neighborhood poverty. Measured as the net change in children’s 2015 poverty rate relative to

their 2009 neighborhood’s poverty rate, children starting in areas that gentrify see a 2.5

percentage point larger decline in neighborhood poverty rate between 2009 and 2015, as

compared to those starting in persistently low income neighborhoods.      We again see smaller

differences when we look at neighborhood crime and schools. Compared to those who start off




                                                                                                 19
in persistently low-SES neighborhoods, children starting off in gentrifying neighborhoods

experience the same change in crime, and somewhat larger reductions in math test scores at their

local zoned elementary school. They also appear to experience a relative increase (or a smaller

decline) in serious code violation rate.

       The second column of Table 5 shows regression coefficients for the sample of children

who start in market-rate rental housing in 2009. The results are quite similar. Perhaps

surprisingly, we see no evidence that gentrification is more likely to trigger moves among low-

income children who live in market-rate rental housing. The coefficients on residence in a

gentrifying neighborhood are statistically insignificant in the regressions of the probability of at

least one move and the number of moves for children who start off in market-rate rental

buildings.

Sensitivity Tests

       Because of the greater vulnerability of children who live in market-rate rental housing in

2009, we focus the sensitivity analyses on this population (though qualitatively results are the

same when we include children living in subsidized rental housing).

       As a robustness test, we estimate our models using multiple, alternative measures of

gentrification (Appendix Table A2). First we adopt a more expansive definition of gentrification

that groups the moderately and rapidly gentrifying neighborhoods into a single category (those

seeing top quartile of growth in percentage of adults with college degrees). Second, we use gains

in income and rent to identify gentrifying neighborhoods. Finally, because census tracts are

small in New York City, we use a somewhat larger geographic unit of analysis called a

Neighborhood Tabulation Area (NTA), which consist of about 10 census tracts. We generally

see similar results: we see no evidence of heightened mobility in gentrifying tracts and children




                                                                                                   20
starting off in gentrifying areas end up in lower poverty neighborhoods, regardless of the

definition of gentrification. 8 We also replicate Aron-Dine and Bunten’s definition of

gentrification at the NTA level, and still see no heightened risk of mobility. Most measures of

gentrification also indicate that children who move from gentrifying areas are more likely to

move to a new borough.

        Results for other outcomes are less consistent. We only see evidence of a relative decline

in school math test scores and a relative deterioration in building conditions when gentrification

is measured by gains in percentage college educated. For several of the alternative measures of

gentrification, we see evidence that children starting off in gentrifying neighborhoods enjoy

relative reductions in crime compared to their counterparts in persistently low SES

neighborhoods. (See Appendix table A2.)

        We also estimate our regression models on the larger set of children who were enrolled in

Medicaid in 2009 and in 2015, but not necessarily continuously enrolled throughout the period.

The results are again substantively unchanged. Finally, we expand our sample of children to

include those living in single- and two-family homes and again observe the same relationships

and magnitudes.


Differences Between Movers and Non-Movers in Market Rate Housing

        Our neighborhood characteristics results are driven in part by the fact that many families

stay in place, and so those in gentrifying neighborhoods naturally see greater gains in income and

reductions in poverty. Table 6 separately analyzes outcomes for movers and non-movers so we

can examine whether children moving from gentrifying neighborhoods end up in different types

of neighborhoods than those moving from persistently low-SES neighborhoods.

8
 These results are also similar when we use the definition of gentrification proposed by Aron-Shifrah and Bunten
(2019) at the NTA level using housing price transaction data and aggregated census tract income data.


                                                                                                               21
         Among children who stay in place during the 7-year period, those who start in gentrifying

neighborhoods saw a significantly greater reduction in neighborhood poverty rate. We see no

difference in changes in neighborhood poverty among movers. We see no evidence, in other

words, that children who move from gentrifying areas are moving to more disadvantaged

neighborhoods. Indeed, movers even see greater improvements in neighborhood safety when

they start off in gentrifying neighborhoods.



Racial Differences

         Our average patterns may conceal important differences across racial sub-groups.

Gentrification pressures may differ in predominantly black and Latino neighborhoods, and

families of color may face greater difficulty navigating the housing market due to discrimination.

To test these possibilities, we re-estimate our models separately for children of different races

(Table 7). We once again see no evidence of elevated mobility for children of any race (though

Asian children experience slightly fewer moves when they start off in gentrifying

neighborhoods). The coefficient on change in poverty rate is negative for children of all races but

it is only statistically significant for white children. But this difference is driven by the fact that

fewer white children move from any neighborhood. In further analysis (see Appendix Table A3),

we separately look at movers and non-movers by race and find that children of all races (except

Asian children) who stay in gentrifying neighborhoods experience greater reductions in

neighborhood poverty than those who stay in persistently low-SES areas. And we see no

difference for children of any race between the changes in neighborhood poverty rate enjoyed by

those moving from gentrifying neighborhoods and those moving from persistently low-SES

areas.




                                                                                                      22
Discussion and conclusion

       This research provides new evidence about the residential mobility of low-income

children living in gentrifying neighborhoods in New York City. Consistent with most past

research, we find little evidence of elevated displacement rates from gentrifying areas, though

when they move, children in gentrifying areas tend to make slightly longer distance moves,

perhaps reflecting because they have to travel further to find affordable options. We show that

residing in subsidized housing reduces the probability of moving substantially, but the

association between gentrification and residential mobility is no different for children living in

subsidized housing than for those living in market-rate housing.

       Unlike most previous research, we can also observe the characteristics of the

neighborhoods where children end up and find that children who start off in low-income

neighborhoods that gentrify experience larger reductions in neighborhood poverty as compared

to those who start off in persistently low-SES neighborhoods. This is driven by the fact that

children in gentrifying neighborhoods who stay in place see neighborhood incomes gain around

them. But among children who moved during the 7-year period, we see no difference in poverty

rate changes between those who start in neighborhoods that gentrify and those who start off in

neighborhoods that remain persistently low-SES. Indeed, children who move from gentrifying

neighborhoods move to somewhat safer neighborhoods. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that

children who remain in place in gentrifying areas see slightly larger reductions in the

performance of their local zoned elementary school (at least in terms of math scores). This

suggests that as neighborhoods gentrify, they may not experience improvements in school




                                                                                                     23
quality, at least in the short-term, and may even see initial reductions. Given that gentrifiers tend

to be childless, they may not demand changes in local schools.

        Significantly, the results cannot be generalized beyond New York City, which provides

more robust rights to tenants than many cities, and that regulates the rents of approximately half

of the rental stock falls through a soft form of rent regulation, called rent stabilization. But

tenants in stabilized units are not fully shielded from market forces. Under rent stabilization,

landlords can increase rents by set amount each year, they can charge higher rents if they engage

in capital improvements, and they can increase rents by 20 percent when a unit turns over, which

could incentivize landlords to push tenants out. Further, New York is a large city that includes

five diverse counties with different demographics and housing stocks. We find similar results in

all boroughs (or counties). This is not to say that no households are displaced from their homes.

In high-cost cities like New York City, many low-income renters leave their homes because they

cannot afford to pay for the rent. We show that low-income children in New York City

experience high mobility rates during their early childhood years regardless of whether their

neighborhood is experiencing gentrification; only white children and children in subsidized

housing see mobility rates below 40% over the seven year period. But, our research finds little

evidence that low-income renters are more vulnerable in gentrifying areas. Forced moves happen

in all types of neighborhoods. 9

        Importantly, our research does not shed light on the long-run economic diversity of

gentrifying neighborhoods. It is plausible that over time, lower-income renters are less able to

move into neighborhoods as they gentrify and experience increases in rents. If preserving the
