I.    Introduction

      With the inflationary excesses beginning in 1966 a prime mover, the

last few years have witnessed considerable rekindling of interest in the

effects of price expectations on economic behavior. For the most part,

however, the recent empirical research in this area has focused on

aggregate data and has been concerned primarily with the impact of price

expectations on market rates of interest1'1 and changes in
                                                             money wages--"
The effects of price expectations on consumption and saving, in contrast,

has received relatively little                  especially at the micro

level, and the present effort is addressed to this void.


*    This is part of a National Bureau of Economic Research study of the
     effect of inflation on the country's financial institutions that has
     been funded by the American Life Insurance Association. The
                                                                  study
     is not an official NBER publication as it has not yet been reviewed

     also been financed in part by the National Science FoundiLion. I

         More specifically, the paper's primary purpose is to
                                                                 iflvest:igate
  whether it is possible to discern
                                          empirically a relationship between

  individually...held price expectations and decisions of households to hold

  particular types of assets. To this end, I have analyzed aggregate time—

  series data from the National Income Accounts and the Flow-of—Funds and

  two bodies of micro household data,
                                           each involving several thousand
 households and each containing
                                     fairly detailed information on price
 expectations.

         The micro data that have been analyzed are based on the well—known

 Consumers Union panel study of the late 1950's and the Consumer Anticipations

 Survey conducted by the U.S. Bureau of the Census during the late l960'.!1
 The year of reference is 1959 for the
                                       CU sample and 1967 for the CAS sample.
 In additjon to having reasonably detailed breakdowns of the household's

 balance sheet, both of these data sets contain data on income and family

 characteristics together with explicit information on price expectations.

Although they refer only to the long term, the price expctationg data are

especially detailed in the CU sample, for:respondents
                                                            were questioned

regarding their expectations of changes in the level of consumer prices

for 5, 10, and 20 years in the future. CAS respondents, in
                                                            contrast,
were asked for their expectations only over the next 12 months.

        The price expectations data from both household samples have been

taken   at face value, and there has been no effort either to "explain" the
prioe   expectations themselves or to assess, except in a general way, their
plausibility or reliability.    To, do so, while   clearly of interest In its
own right, is outside   the scope   the present task; the maintained
                                    of

hypothesis throughout is that households take seriously the expectations

   Henceforth, these will be referred to as the       CU and CAS samples,
   respectively.
 they express, whatever these are and whether or not they appear reasonable

 to an outsider.

      The format of the paper is as follows: The next sectidn discusses

 the effects that price expectations might be expected to have on a house-

 hold's saving and the composition of its portfolio. Particular attention

 is given to the traditional view that expectations of inflation lead to a

 substitution of present consumption for future consumption, and therefore

 to reduced current saving, and to the contrary view, long espoused by

George Katona, of the Survey Research Center at the University of Michigan,

that expectations of inflation are associated with increased
                                                                uncertainty
with respect to the future and that this in turn leads to increased current

saving.

     Section III is concerned with specification of the model to be analyzed.

The model utilized is based on an underlying stock adjustment process in

which saving (or one of its components) is related to the hOusehold's

existing stock of assets, as well as to income, various demographic char-

acteristics, and, of course, to price expectations. The stock of assets

and Income are both disaggregated, although the extent to which this can

be carried varies between the data sets.    Description of' the two micro

data sets occupies Section IV.

     Sections   V and VI are devoted to presentation of empirical results.

The results deriving from the micro data sets are discussed in Section V,

while the time—series results are presented in Section VI. Finally,

Section VII provides an overall assessment of the results and offers some

suggestions for future research.

 II.    Theoretical Considerations
      In analyzing the effect of price expectations on a household's saving,
 there are two separate questions to be kept in mind, namely, (1) the
 impact   of price expectations on the overall amount saved and (2) the

differential impact of price expectations on the separate components of

the household's balance sheet. On the assumption that the household strives

 to structure Its portfolio so that yields (including nonmonetary returns

and with allowance for risk) on different assets are equal on the margin,

it is clar that, because yields are, in general, not affected uniformly

by inflation, the rational household will adjust its portfolio whenever

there is a change in its price expectations. Indeed, it is quite possible

for there to be substantial portfolio restructuring even though the impact

of inflation on the overall level of saving is nil. Moreover, it is also

clear that we should expect the impact of price expectations to vary, even

for the same dependent variable, depending UOfl    the   time horizon over

which the expectations are measured and for horizons of short du-ration,

depending upon whether price changes are expected to be permanent or only

temporary. If prices are expected to rise and soon thereafter to fall,

current saving should be stimulated, while the opposite should be the case

If the higher prices are expected to persist.

       The existing literature on the effects of price expectations on

saving —— which is surprisingly not very extensive ——     is   ambiguous and,

in some instance, contradiotory. There Is the old traditional idea that

anticipated inflation will induce a shift from money, savings accounts,

and bonds to real assets   including equity. The   likely effect on the over-

all amount saved, howevr, is much less cicarcut. While economists

typically take the view that an e:pected price rise will lead to increased

consumption, and thus to reduced saving, as present goods arc substituted
                                       5—




    for   the future goods, the assumption usually implicit is that         the   expected
.   price rise had not been previously anticipated. For price inflation that

    is fully anticipated should not have any impact on real economic decisions

    because all of the impacts will have been fully discounted and embodied

    in current prices, interest rates, etc.

           In   contrast with the traditional       view is a view that is rooted more

    in psychology and sociology than in economics, but which is increasingly
    gaining a following among economists, namely, that an increase in prices
    (anticipated     or not) will lead to a reduction In       spending and an increase
    In   saving'1. The argument Is usually phrased in terms of the impact on

    rising prices on consumer confidence: Expected inflation leads to a
                                               'S

    decrease in the confidence with which the future is approached and             this
    in turn leads to anincreasein_y_i'. Because it                  has a strong

    theoretical     foundationV in additon to being a well established result
    empiricall)1,       the second part of the K—J argument, i.e., that       saving is
    negatively     related to uncertainty of the future, evokes little controversy.

          However, the circumstances surrounding the survey—based finding

    that rising prices stir pessimism are much           less clear. Juster and
    Wachtel (1972a) suggest that the        connection is to consumer expectations

    of future real income. In particular, they argue (pp. 86—87):

           Historically,     high inflation rates tend to be
                                                         associated with a
           relatively high variance in the rate of inflation. If consumers
           commualy believe that the rate of increase in nominal income will

          As Katona (1960) puts it:
                Most   people hold that the future is uncertain; they speak of
          possible emergencies such as accidents, illness, unemployment, or
          bad times as their reasons for accumulating' reserve funds (pp. 95).
          See also Juster and Wachtel (l972a, 1972b).
          This will be referred to as the K—J (for Katona and Juster) argument.

          See Mirman (1971), Sandnio (1970), Levhari and Srinivasan (1969),
          and Leland (1968).
          Most of the empirical evidence is based on survey data. See in
          particular, ue11er (199), Katona (1960) and Juster and Wachtcl
          (1972a,   1972b)
                                   -6-



          be less variable than the rate of increase prices, the expect-
          ation of rising prices will generate greaterindispersion of expect-
          ations about real income. A wider dispersion may not have syuI—
          metrical effects on behavior, in that the prospect of rising real
          income, even though the two arc regarded as equally probable. In
          short, consumers may be more concerned that price inflation will
          erode their real income, even though the two are regarded as equally
          probable. In short, consumers may be much more concerned that price
         Inflation will erode their real income than pleased i:hat rising
         nominal incomes will outweigh rising prices. If so, the appropriate
         reaction to inflationary expectations would be to curtail spending
         in an attempt. to guard against declining real income, thus, as a
         corollary, raising the saving rate.
        Despite   first appearance, the traditional and K—J views of expected

 inflation and saving are not necessarily in conflict. For once
                                                                uncertainty
 (especially with regard to the stream of future income) is admitted into

 the traditional model, the K—J
                                   positive relationship between saving and
expected inflation emerges almost as a matter of course. Readers inter-

ested in details are referred
                                  to the papers cited in footnote 7.

        In approaching the analysis, a reasonable attitude to adopt is that

price   expectations are actually described by a probability distribution
                             a
and that the information/household provides is its "best" guess of what
prices will do during the period of reference.2! Moreover, it also is
plausible to assume that the extent
                                         to which price expectations actually
influence a household's decisions will
                                           depend upon the confidence with
which the expectations are held. In particular, it is much more likely

that expectations will be a factor in decisions if they are held with

a great deal of ccnfidence rather than with much uncertainty.

     To formalize this reasoning, let
                                          us suppose that the household bases
its saving decisions on an assumed price level P*which it defines
                                                                  as a

   I enclose best in quotation marks
                                     because the particular point
   estimate given will probably vary depending on the shape of the
   underlying distribution. The mean undoubtedly will be provided by
   respondeits where the distribution is
                                         symmetrical; however, if the
   distribution is skewed, it will more likely be the mode.

                                                                 C

    where g is an inverse function of a2, the variance of the        distribution
    describing the expectations. In particular, we shall assume 0 <         g(o2)   < 1


    with g'(o2) < 0, g(0) = 1, and g(co) = 0.         p* will thus be near pC for 2

    small, but near p for a2                   Implementation of this model requires,

    of course, knowledge of o2 .         While neither of the micro data sets to be

    analyzed provides Information about 2 dIrectly, some weak, though usable,

    Information can be adduced In both samples—

          As was noted at the beginning of this section, we should expect the

    impact of price expectations to be different depending upon the length

    of the horizon over which the expectations are measured and depending upon

    whether price increases are expected to be permanent or only teiaporary.

    The traditional view ——      I.e.,   that expected inflation leads to a substitution

    away from money —— seems most relevant to extended horizons and to price

    changes that are expected to be permanent, whereas the K—J .view seems more

    relevant to short—run expectations and to price changes that are expected

    to be temporary. As has already been mentioned, the price expectations

•
    in the CU sample pertain to horizons of 5, 10, and 20 years, while in the

          This model can be rigorously derived from the adaptive expectations
          framework of Nerlove (1958) and Muth (1961) on the assumption that
          the distribution of price expectations is normal and the additional
          assumption that the information provided by p is combined with that
          provided by p in accordance with Bayes theorem. See Turnovsky (1969).

          households, see   de   Neniland Ehalla   (1973).

  CAS sample they are confined, to a horizon of 12 months.
                                                                (The time—series
 exoectations also refer to a horizon of 12 months.) This being the case,

 it is tempting to view the results with the CU sample as testing the

 traditional thesis and the results with the CAS sampleas testing the

 K—J thesis.



 III. A State Adjustment Model of Saving

        The point of departure for the model that underlies the empirical

 analysis is to assume that saving is determined by the interaction of the

 tastes of the household, a collection of objective quantities (such as

 income, prices, and the rate of interest) generated by the market,.and a

 set of state variables!?! .      in     symo1s, we can write


 (2)       =
               O(Xie••xm   w1,... ,w).


where s denotes saving,
                             X1,...,x m objective market quantities, and
w 1,...,wn n state variables. It is assumed for now that the tastes of

the household are reflected in the parameters of 6.

       The state variable encompass a variety of. phenomena, some objective

and some subjective. Represented in the former will be items from the

household's balance sheet ——     stocks of durable goods and housing, saving
accounts, level of consumer debt, etc.'-" These quantities are all

concrete in interpretation, cardinally measurable (at least in principle),

and in general are determined by saving decisions in the past, current



       Th model aboutto be described 'takes its roots in the state—
       adjustment model of Houthakker and Taylor (1970) as applied to aggregate
       consumption and saving (see especially Chapter 7).
13/                           .
       The objective state variables will also include demographic char-
       acteristics which for now are put to the side.
                               —9—




market   conditions, and possibly the mere passage of time. The     subjective
state variables, on the other hand, will also reflect decisions in the

past, but in addition will collate the household's evaluation of the

future as characterized (say) in expectations of income and prices and

the confidence with which the future is approached. The past makes its

appearance   in these state variables in the form of inertia (or habit
formation) which is well—known to characterize     important segments of

consumption, particularly expenditures on services.--'
      The objective state variables will change:

            a). In response to current saving as assets are bought and sold

                   and liabilities are increased or decreased;

            b). With the passage of time through depreciation and technolog-

                   ical obsolescence; and

             c). In response to inflation, changes in the market rate of

                   interest, and changes in the earning capacity of physical

                   assets.

The   subjective   state variables that reflect habit formation, In contrast,

will alter in response to:

             a). Current consumption of nondurables and

                   services;

            b). Current depreciation of physical assets; and

             c).   The dissipation of habits.
How the remaining subjective state variables (i.e., those representing

the household's evaluation of the future) vary through time, however, is

clearly much more speculative.

      That objective state variables and the    subjective   state variables



      See Duesenberry (1949), Brown (1952), and Houthakker and      Taylor   (1970).
                                                                                       -
                                   —II)—




 that do     not   incorporate expectations summarize the    influence of the   past
and the objective present on the household's saving decisions, while the
state variables reflecting expectations provide links to the fuLurc.'
The household is assumed to adjust its saving in such a way as to bring its

state variables, all except those reflecting expectations,-" into desired
relationships with its current and prospective income. As yields and

expectations change, the household will not only adjust the amount it

saves, but also will alter the composition of its portfolio.

        In order to illustrate the ideas involved, let us consider a model

in which saving (s) is linearly related to the existing level of wealth (w),

a state variable representing ti accuniulated effects of past consumption

(h), income (x), the rate of interest (r), income expectations (Xe)             price

expectations (p*), and general consumer confidence (q).

In terms of our earlier classification of variables, x and r represent

objective market quantities, w represents an objective state variable,
                 *
while I-i, xe , p , and q denote subjective state variables. The state

variables wand h represent legacies from past saving and consumption
                                                                  e   *
decisions,     respectively, while the expectational quantities, x , p , and

q embody subjective evaluations of the future. (It is assumed, of course,

that e *           and q pertain to some definite horizon.) We, naturally expect

      to be negative, and       and        to be Positive. The parameters   and

can be of either sign, and, as we have already noted, the same is true of


       Depending upon one's theoretical predilections, the "future" in this
       context can be made as precise, or left as vague, as desired.

       The state variables incorporating expectations are excluded because
       it does not make any sense to speak of desired
                                                       relationships connecting
       them with income. On the
                                  contrary, they, along with income and other
       market quantities, must be considered movers of the

 income. Changes in expectations cause these equilibrium relationship to

 alter, and this in turn leads to changes in saving. This result is of some

 importance, because it means that the effects of changes in expectations

 are in fact reflected in the levels of expectations taken in conjuction

with the levels of the state variables Wd and h.

        Let us now turn to the model that has been estimated in the empirical

work. In general form,           this   can be written as



(9)      S =    cx   + 'Y + y'A + X'E + D + c,


where S denotes saving (or one of its components), Y, A, and E are vectors

representing income from different sources (or from prior years), components

of the household's balance sheet, and expectations, respectively, D is a

vector of demographic characteristics, c is a random error term, and cx, ,

y,    A, and         are parameters (or vectors of parameters) to be estimated.

       The major difference between this model and the one represented in

expression (3) involves the disaggregation of wealth and income. The

disaggregation         of wealth follows from the desire to analyze adjustment in

the composition of thehousehold's balance sheet as well as saving in toto,

while the disaggregation of income is inspired by the findings reported in

Taylor   (1971). However, the extent to which these disaggrcgat:-ion1; can be
                                —13--




 effected varies with the data set. For
                                            the CAS sample, income is reported
 by type —— wages and salaries, business income,
                                                 rent, interest and
 dividend, gifts and inheritance, social security, and pensions ——
                                                                   and for
 households with multiple members in the labor force, there is a further

 disaggregation of wages and salaries by recipient. The cu sample does not

 provide a decompositjon of income by
                                        type, but does distinguish between the
 earnings of husband and wife, and unlike the
                                                CAS sample, it includes data
 on family income, both before and after taxes, for several years prior to

 the year of reference!".    Capital gains also are treated separately. The
 CU sample contains very detailed information on the composition of the

household's balance sheet,
                             Particularly with regard to holdings of financial
assets. The CAS sample, on the other hand, is much less detailed and

complete in this respect and,
                                 apart from housing, provides only indirect
information on stocks of real assets.

     Moving on to price expectations, respondents in both the CU and CAS

samples were presented with intervals of
                                           price changes and asked to indicate
the one within which their
                             expectations fell. Should they be too uncertain
to guess, this, too, was an option. Because they were obtained
                                                               only in

price expectations data into the model in this manner makes it
                                                               unneessary to


    The majority of equations
                              tabulated, however, include income of the
    current year only.

    One such set for the 5—year
                                   expectations in the CU sample is as follows:
                prices expected to fall
           d2: prices expected to increase 0 to 5%
           d3: prices expected to incrcase,5 to 15%
           d4: prices expected to increase 15 to 40%
           d5: prices expected to increase more than 40%

assume explicit and essentially arbitrary values for the open—en1cd

classes; an added benefit is that it automatically allows for the effect

of price expectations to be nonlinear.--

        Since neither of the micro data sets contains direct information$2'
on the variance of a household's price expectations, it has not been

possible to employ the mechanism for p* specified in.expressjon (6).

However, in addition to being asked about price expectations, respondents

in the CU survey also were invited to assess their financial prospects

"over    the   next few years." A possible response to this question was

"too    uncertain to say". Not unreasonably,   it might   be argued that uncer—
tainty regarding price     expectations share some common causes (whatever

these   are), so that the answer "too 'uncertain to say"   about financial
prospects provides some proxy information on the variance of the household's
price expectations. This information has been introduced into the model
for the CU                                        23/
               sample by defining a dummy variable,—


       However, the use of dummy variables is not without cost. For in
       estimation, one of the dummy variables must be excluded, requiring
        the coefficients on the dummy variables remaining to be interpreted
       as deviations from the coefficient of the dummy variable that is
       left out. Ordinarily, this last coefficient, which is asorbed
       into the equation's constant term, is recovered through the assumption
       that the coefficients for the entire group of dummy variables sum to
       zero. In the present context, however, such an assumption is clearly
       unwarranted, whence the excluded coefficient cannot be recovered.
       Thus while the overall effect of price expectations can be tested
       (through an analysis of covariance), the effects of individual
       Intervals of expectations can only be tested relative to one
       another.

       Except for that implicit in the response "too uncertain to say" in
       both samples.

       The validity of this procedurerequires, of course, that households
       answering "too uncertain to guess" for price expectations and
       financial prospects do not form identical sets.

                                                                                  .

    This   being the case, it can be argued that I would have been better
      advised to group households by the characteristics involved and then
      estimating separate equations for each group. However, this would
      have (1) put distressingly severe demands on my limited computer
      budget and (2) resulted in many cells with a meager count of households.

 being the cSc, it has been necessary to assume that the price
 expectations for this period stand as a good proxy for those held a year
 earlier.
      The particular data set that is u.tilized contains 2876 households. The
 households Included all consist of a married couple residing in an urban
 area (no farm families arcincluded) with husband and wife both present.
 Equations have   been estimated for the sample as a whole and with the

 2876 households grouped into three asset categories as follows:


                Croup                   Assets                     }1ousehols

Since for this sample data on household net worth are not available, the.

grouping has been based on total assets defined as the sum of savings accouct.

     The "typical" household is seen to have had expectations, correctly

as it turned out, of rates of inflation approximating 2—4% per year.

However, it is to be noted that a fair proportion of the households, 14%,

was unprepared to express any expectations at all. It also is of Darticuaar

interest that the distribution of expectations is, for all practical

purposes, invariant across asset classes.


2. Consumers Union Sample

based on the extensive survey of some 15,000 of its members by the Consumers

Union in the late l950's.-21 The particular data set analyzed here contain

4227 households, all residing In an urban area, with both husband and wife

present. Since members of Consumers Union tend to be above average with

respect to income, wealth, and education, the households included in this

data set are similar in their circumstances to those in the CAS data set.

     The period of reference for the dependent variables in this data

set is the calendar year 1959. All stocks, both real and financial, are

measured at the end of 1958. As with the CAS sample, equations have been

extimated for the sample as a whole and with the households grouped

according to three asset classes. The grouping is on the basis of the

household's net worth at the end of 1959 as follows:


           Group
          ______              Net Worth                  Households

             1              under $25,000                   2074

             2             $25,000 — $75,000                1614

             3               over $75,000                    539


     As with the CAS sample, it is useful to provide for the CU sample as

well a breakdown of price expectations across households. This is done for

5—year expectations in Table 2.

         As with the CAS sample, the "typical" household is seen to have had
  expectations that     correctly anticipated the inflation that axtually
  occured   over the period involved,-Q''    What   is   more, we again find the dis-
  tribution of price expectations to be invariant with respect to wealth.



 V. Empirical Results I: CAS and CU Data Sets

        Equations have been estimated for the
                                                    following categories of
 household saving and investment:

            3).   FA: net purchases of financial assets
            4:). NW: change in net worth.

       Because of the large number of predictors in the equations, the majority

of which are dummy variables
                                  representing demographic characteristics,
the equations are tabulated in full in Appendix A and only the
                                                                         coefficients
for   the price expectations variables are presented here in the text.

       Let me begin with the predictors other

comment in detail on the importance of these other variables would

inject a detracting digression, and I shall simply list their main

features:'
     1). The strongest variables statistically are almost invariably

         existing holdings of assets, savings accounts and government

         bonds in the CAS equations2?I and various categories of

          financial assets in the CU equations. The effect of existing

          assets on household investment, especially financial invest-

         ment, is for the most part strongly negative, thus indicating

          the presence of substantial stock adjustment. Finding this to be

          the case is, of course, hardly surprising.

     2). Income aiqo is uswtllv a qtron redictor, csccially in th

          CAS equations where family income is disaggregated as to type

          and wage and salary income is further disaggregated according

          to recinient. Realized caDital gains show up fairly strongly


    The CAS equations are listed in Tables Al and A2 in Appendix A,
    while the CU equations are given in Tables A3 and A4.

    The reader will note that the R2 s for the equations for savings
    accounts (SA) and government bonds (GB) in Tables Al and A2 are
    extremely high given that the observations refer to households.
    These high R'S result primarily from the presence of SA(t—l) and
    CB(t—l) as predictors, as is evident from the t—ratios for these
    variables. The rationale for including SA(t—l) and GB(t—l) as
    regressors in these equations is that these variables allow for
    the dynamic effects of stock adjustment. However, in the present
    context, it is clear that these variables also are reflecting
    idiubyncracies of individual households. Households vary in how
    they structure their portfolios, not just because of differences in
    expectations and objective circumstances, but also because of
    factors unique to themselves. In the absence of variables that
    allow directly for these unique factors, they will tend to be
    reflected in SA(t—l) inthe equation for SA and GB(t—l) in the
    equation for GB. This being the case, the inclusion of the5e
    two quantities serves to clarify the estimates of the coefficients
    of the other variables. However, it is clear that   itwould be
    misleading (indeed, incorrect) to interpret the coefficients of SA(t—l)
    and CB(t—l) as reflecting purely dynamic phenomena.

           in the equations for both data sets, as do unrealized capital

           gains on real estate in the CAS equations. In particular,

           the latter appear to substitute quite strongly for other forms

          of saving.

    3).   Of the demographic factors analyzed, family size showsup

          strongly in the CAS equations and age of head of household

          in the CU equations. Education is of some importance in the

          CU equations, but its contribution is relatively minor in the

          CAS equations. Finally, for neither data set is occupation

          of much consequence.


     The coefficients for the price expectations variables for the CAS

equations are tabulated in Tables 3 and 4. The coefficients in Table 3

are from the equations estimated from the entire sample of 2876 households,

while the coefficients in Table 4 are from the equations estimated for

each of three asset classes, where the asset classes are those defined

near th end of Section IV.

     Since price expectations are represented in the equations as

dummy variables, the coefficients of these variables, as ndted in footnote

21, can only be estimated in terms of deviations from one another. The

equations have been estimated with PE5, too uncertain to guess, as the

excluded category, but the coefficients in Tables 3 and 4   are expressed as
deviations from the coefficient of PE2—'. This makes for easier inter—

pretation of the results since the expectaions of the households in

this category (inflation of 2—4%) were in fact realized.


33/ The entry for SA under PE1 in Table 3, for example, indicates that,
    ceteris paribus, households expecting prices to increase by less
   than 2% added, on the average $348.63 more in savings accounts   than
   households expecting prices to increase 2—4%.

        The results in Table 3 can only be said to present a mixed picture.

 On the one hand:

        1).     The coefficients for PE1, PE3, and PE4       in   the equation for

                LCS   ——
                           being   negative, positivc, and positive, respectively,
                and increasing in magnitude — imply that higher expected
                inflation leads to increased investment in common stock,
                which is in keeping with the traditional notion that common
                stock is a good hedge against inflation.
       .2).     The coefficients for PE5, being positive in the equations
 •



                for SA, GB, IP, Si, and S3, are consistent with        the Katona—
                Juster view                                              34/
                               that uncertainty leads to increased saving.—

On the other hand, it seems implausible ever to have the coefficients for

PE1, PE3, and PE4 all with the same sign, since this implies a marked

and unusual nonlinearity in the effect           of price.expectations. However,
this   is seen tO be the case in the equations for SA, GB, IP., Si, and S3.

       The central message of the results in Table 4, which has the CAS

household      grouped according to wealth, is that the effects of price
expectations      are not uniform with respect to wealth. For there is seen

to be substantial differences, not only in magnitude, but in sign as well,

in the coefficients for each component of investment across the three

wealth ciasses,1 Moreover, even within wealth classes, grouping does


       The negative coefficient in the equation for CS might seem an
       anomaly; however, to fice the stock market in the face of
       uncertainty seems perfectly sensible behavior.                                -   -



       Among   other things, this casts doubt on the assumption, implicit
       in the equations in Table Al in Appendix A and which undcriy Table
       3, that the structure being estimated is liomogenous across wealth.
       The proper procedure would  be to test this assumption as a hypothesis
       in an analysj of covaricuce. IJowever, the dispariLy of standard
       errors of the estimate (see the bottom of Table 42 in Appendix A) sigests

not lead to much, if any, clarification of the results. There remain

many instances where PE1, PE3, and PE4 all have the same sign, and the

sign of PE5 is now seen to vary with the level of wealth. Indeed, the

view that uncertainty and saving are positively related receives unequivocal

support only in the equations for households with assets in excess of

$75,000.

       As mentioned in footnote 20, the significance of the price expectations

dummy variables (taken as a group) can be tested through an analysis of

covariance. Equations are estimated with the dummy variables excluded and

with them included. An F—test is then undertaken on the resulting

reduction in the unexplained sum of squares. The results from this test

for the 7 CAS equations, with households grouped according to wealth, are

presented in Table 5. The numbers in this table are the observed F—ratios

for   testing the hypothesis that the coefficients of the price expectations
dummy variables listed in Table 4      are   significantly different from zero
as   a group

       The   only equations with observed F—ratios significant at the 0.05
level   are seen to be for tiCS and S2 for households having assets between

$25,000 and $75,000. Price expectations are totally devoid of consequence

for households having assets under $25,000 (not one equation for these

households has an F—ratio exceeding 1) and are of only mild importance for

households with assets in excess of $75,000 (the F—ratio for IP for these

households     is significant at the 0.10    level).   For reasons that I   will   go

into in the concluding section, I find none of these results especially

implausible. Indeed,. the significant F—ratio in the equation for tiCS

strikes me     as quite an encouraging result.

         Let us now turn to the CU data set. The tabulation of the results

    for this sample follows that for the CAS sample in that the coefficients

    for only the price expectations variables are given here in the test and

    results are presented for households grouped according to net worth as

    well as for the entire sample. The relevant tables are Tables 6 and 7

    and Tables A3 and A4 in Appendix A. Tables 6 and 7 follow Table 3 and

    4, while Tables A3 and A4 contain the estimated equations in full and

    thus parallel Tables Al and A2.
•        As already noted, the important conceptual difference (with regards

    to the price expectations data) between the CU and CAS samples is   that,
                               —28—



whereas price expectations in the CAS sample refer to a single horizon

 of 12 months, the data in this sample refer to multiple horizons of 5, 10,

and 20 years, respectively. However, equations utilizing the data for all

 three horizons simultaneously have been estimated only for the entire sample;

only data for the 5—year horizon are used in the equations with the households

grouped according to wea1th.--' Like the CAS equations, the CU equations

have   been estimated with "too uncertain to guess" as the excluded price
expectations category, but the coefficients in Tables 6 and 7    are

expressed   as deviations from the coefficient of the category that contains

the modal expectations. Thus, in Table 6, the numbers listed represent

deviations from the coefficients of PE4, PEL2, and PELR2 for the 5, 10,

and 20 year horizons, respectively, hile in Table 7 they represent dev-

iations from PE11 and PEF11.

       Once agains, the results present a very mixed picture. Indeed,

the results in Table 6 for the sample as a whole present very little that

is positive. For the 5—year expectations, the signs and magnitudes of

the coefficients for PE1—PE8 imply price expectation effects that are

sufficiently non—linear to defy any plausible interpretation. The situation

is somewhat better for the 10—year expectations (cf. the coefficients for

PEL1, PEL3, and PEL4 in the equation for NW, which decrease in magnitude

with signs, +, —, and —), and best for the 20—year expectations, where PELR1

and PELR3 have opposite signs in all equations except the one for additions

to net worth. The signs of the coefficients for PE1 are positive for all

four equations, implying that households expecting prices to fall save more



       The decision to forego exploration of the 10 and 20 year horizons in
       the equations with households grouped by wealth was prompted str:ictly
    by budgetary considerations.
                               —29—




than   those households expecting inflation of 1—2% per year. This Is

consistent with the   traditional   view discussed in Section II. Finally,

with regard to the category "too uncertain to guess" (PE9, PEL5, and

PELR4 for the 5, 10, and 20—year horizons, respectively), the coefficients

are of both signs, and there is no particular pattern one way or another.

       The poor results for the sample as a whole may reflect in part

a breakdown of expectations into too many subintervals, and in the

equations with households grouped according to wealth, the number of

(5—year horizon) price expectations categories has been reduced to four.

However, as Table 7 shows, neither this procedure, the elimination of

the 10 and 20—year expectations, nor grouping all taken in combination,

leads to any marked clarification in 'the results. From a comparison of

coefficients across wealth classes in Table 7 (see also Table A4 in Appendix

A), it is clear that we once again have strong prima fade evidence of

nonhomogeneity of structure with respect to wealth. And     as   with the CAS

sample, the substantial variation in standard errors of the estimate,

seen at the bottom of Table A4, suggests that nonhomogeneity also extends

to error variances.

       The variables PEF1, PEF1O, and PEF12 in Table 7 are interaction dummy

variables defined as the product of the price expectations dummy variables

with a dummy variable denoting whether a household was too uncertain to

guess   about its financial prospects over the next several yearsu1. As
discussed in Section IV, this represents an attempt to make the coefficients
for    the price expectations variables a function of the uncertainty with


.2i    See the end of Table 7 for precise definitions of these variables.
       It will be noticed that there is no PEF8 corresponding to PE8. This
       is because there were no households in the sample with expectations
       of more than 40% inflation (over the next five years) and too
       uncrtain to assess their financial prospects.
                                    —30—




    which the expectations are held. Consistency with the hypothesis that
    motivates this procedure    requires the coefficients of PEi and PEFI
    (i = 1, 10, 12) to have opposite signs. Of the 36 pairs of PEi and PEFi
    in the table, 20 have this disparity in sign, while 16 do not. The hypotheses
    thus receives little support.




    VI. Empirical Results II: Evidence From the Quarterly Flow—of—Funds

         In this section, we turn our, attention to an analysis of aggregate

    time—series data from the quarterly flow—of—funds accounts that are pub-

    lished by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

    While our primary interest here will still be in price expectations and

    their effects on saving and its composition, the reduced size of the

    time—series equations makes it feasible to include the predictors other

    than price expectations in the discussion.



    1. The Model, Data, and Methods of Estimation

         The model underlying the time—series analysis is as follows:



•




      •y-a0.+ lSHt_l + 2SDti +              + a4SBt_i + a5DDi + a6SA1

         + a7CC_i + a8LP + a9TPt +           ÷       + ai2PE + a13PA1

         + cLl4R + ai5LC + u,



          See the discussions surrounding expression (6) and (10) above.
          Other analyses of the flow—of—funds data include Houthakker and Taylor
          (1970), Motley (1970), and Wachtel (1972).
                                       —31—



    where:


             y =    a measure of saving to be defined below

             SH     depreciated stock of residential housing less the mortgage debt

                    on the stock

             SD     depreciated stock of durable goods

             SB market value of stocks and bonds owned by households (hereafter

                    referred to as corporate wealth)

             DD = demand deposits and currency owned by households

             SA =   savings and time deposits owned by households
             CC = consumer debt owed by households

             LP =   labor   and property income

             TP =   transfer   payments made to individuals

             SI     personal contributions to social insurance

              T =   personal   tax and nontax payments

             PE = a measure of price expectations

             PA = percentage increase in the implicit deflator for personal

                     consumption expenditure during the preceding 4 quarters

             R ='   market rate of interest                            -




          LC = a vector of points on the age distribution of the population

             u = random error term.

          Detailed definitions of all variables and their sources are given in

     Appendix B. Like the models used with the micro data sets, the model in

     (11) is based on the model discussed in Section III. The quantities

     comprising net worth, Sil, SD, SB, DD, SA, and CC, represent objective

     state variables, PE represents a subjective state variable and the

•    — No attempt has been made to include state variables representing the
             psychological stocks arising from habit formation in consumption. To
             do so would require formulating a model in which saving and coisumption
             are determined jointly and is beyond the scope of the present effort.
                                —32—



income variables LP, TP, SI, and T, PA, and R represent objective market

quantities.     Finally, LC represents   a vector of demographic characteristics,

which    in this case is confihed to points on the age distribution of the
population.
     The price expectations variable employed is based on data      collected

quarterly by the Survey Research Center at the University of Michigan

and is   defined as the difference between the proportion of surveyed
households    expecting prices in the year ahead to increase minus the

proportion expecting prices to decrease divided by the sum of these two

proportions.       Thus defined, PE is a quantity that necessarily lies

between —l and 1, being positive when more households expect prices

to rise than to fall and negative when the reverse is true.

        Personal disposable income, it will be noticed, is disag—

gregated to four components ——    the    sum of labor and property income,

transfer payments, personal contributions to social insurance, and

personal taxes. This disaggregation, which is motivated by the findings

in Taylor (l97l),-" is based on the breakdown appearing in Table 2.1 of

the National Income Accounts, but with two modifications. The first

is minor and involves the addition to labor and property income of

government insurance payments and capital gains distributions. The

purpose of this simply is to bring the NIA data into line with FOF

definitions. The seóond modification is more substantive and involves

     The question asked respondents is whether they expect the prices
     of things they buy in the next 12 months to go up, go down, or
    remain the same. Prior to 1959, the ttthingstt in question referred
    to household goods, appliances, and clothing. Beginning in 1959
    reference wa to the things that the houshold buys in general. For
    discussion of theeUect of this change, see Juster and Wachtel (1972a).
    Beginning in 1966, households were asked to provide point estimates
    of their expectations. Prior to this, they just were asked whether
    they expected prices to decrease a lot, decrease a little, remain the
    same, increase a    little, or increase a lot. Unlike Juster and Wachtel
     (1972a,   1972b) or DeNenil and Bhalla (1973), I have not attempted to
    convert    the pre—1966 data to point estimates.
                             —33—



eliminating from disposable income components based on imputation. Details

are given in Appendix B. Since housholds may view changes in the market

value of their holdings of stocks and bonds as income, even though only

a part of the gains (or losses) may be realized, the current change    in SI,
as well as its beginning of period level, is also included as a predictor.

Finally, depending upon the variable being explained, two different series

have been used for the interest rate, namely, the yield on Baa bonds and

the yield on savings accounts.

     The analysis is quarterly and covers a sample period beginning with

the first quarter of 1954 and ending with the fourth quarter of 1970.

The data on savings and income are all taken from either the Flow—of—Funds

or else from the National Income Accounts. All flows are seasonally

adjusted and are expressed at annual rates in billions of current dollars.

The asset variables are also based upon data from the Flow—of—Funds,

and are measured at the end of the preceding period in billions of current

dollars. These, too, are seasonally adjusted where appropriate. Estiration

has been by ordinary least squares, excepj for four equations which have

been estimated using the Cochrane—Orcutt transformation as a correction

for apparent autocore1ation in the error term. Finally, there are several

equations which involve a distributed lag, and these have been estimated

on the assumption that the parameters of the distributed lag lie on a

third degrca polynomial, using the LaGrangian method of interpolation

developed by Almon (1965).



2. Summary and Evaluation of Time—Series Results

    Equations have been estimated for 14 different items appearing in the
                                     —34--




household sector of the quarterly Flow—of—Funds, and are tabulated in

Table 8. The        variabes   involving a distributed lag are denoted by an

asterisk, and the coefficient given in Table 8 in these cases represents

the   sum of the lag coefficients. The lag coefficients themselves are

presented in Table 9. Finally, the coefficients for just t'he        inflation
variables     are tabulated in Table 10.

       Brief definitions of the dependent variables are as follows

      PS      personal saving

      NS =    net   saving

       CS     gross saving

       CI =   gross investment
       CE     capital expenditures

      NFI= net financial investment

       CD =   expenditures for durable goods
       uN =   investment     in housing

      NAF =   net   acquisition of financial assets

      NIL =   net   increase in liabilities

       DD holdings of demand deposits and currency

       SA =   holdings   of savings and time deposits

       CC     change in consumer debt

       ID = change in installment debt.

For the independent variables not already defined:

       Rl =   yield   on Baa bonds

       R2 =   yield   on savings accounts

       Al =   percentage of population of age 20 to 30
42/
       Complete definitions are given in Appendix B.
                                   —35—



      AA1     percentage   of population of age 20 to 25

       A2     percentage of population of age 30 to 40

      AA2   = percentage of population of age 25 to 40

       A3 =   percentage of population of age 40 to 50
       A4     percentage of population of age 50 to 65.


       The first three equations in Table 8 refer to concepts of saving of

varying comprehensiveness, while the last eleven refer to household invest—

mentand its most important components. The first equation (PS) refers to

personal saving as defined in the National Income Accounts, which is

composed of net purchases of owner—occupied dwellings and buildings of

non—profit organizations, less depreciation, plus net investment in

financial assets. For present purposes, however, the NIA definition of

personal saving has been augmented with two quantities from the Flow—of—

Funds, namely, credits from government insurance and capital gains

dividends. The second equation is for net saving (NS), which consists of

personal saving (as just defined) plus expenditures for durable goods

net of depreciation. This definition of saving is of interest because of

its   close correspondence (ai least in principle) with the definition of
saving implicit in the permanent income and life—cycle models. Gross
saving   (CS) is the most comprehensive concept analyzed and consists of

net saving plus depreciation on residential housing, durable goods, and

the capital stock of nonprofit organizations. Study of this quantity is

of importance because, in relation to personal and net saving, it best

represents the full impact of the household sector's saving and investment

decisions on the economy.,

      On the investment side of the household ledger, the most comprehensive

concept analyzed is gross investment (Cl), which consists of capital

expenditures (CE) and net financial investment (NFl). In principle,
gross investment and gross saving should always be equal, but, like

National Income and Net National Product in the   National   Income Accounts,

they are separated by a statistical discrepancy which frequently reaches

$5 billion or more. Further disaggregation takes capital expenditures

into expenditures for durable goods (CD) and gross investment in housing

(FIN), while net financial investment is decomposed into net acquisition

of financial assets (NAF) and net increase in liabilities (NIL). Finally,

equations have also been estimated for demand deposits and currency held

by households (DD), savings and time deposits (SA), the net increase in

consumer credit (AID).

     Price expectations. Of particular interest to the present under—

taking is the importance of the variable representing price expectations.

Indeed, the results (see Table 10), especially for the equations for personal,

net, and gross saving and gross investment, in all of which the t—rat

for PE is 2.9 or higher, leave little question but what expectations of

inflation lead housholds to increase the amount they save. This corroborates

the recent results of Juster and Wachtel (1972a) and the earlier findings of

Mueller (1959) and, of course, is consistent wi.th the Katona—Juster thesis

that inflation increases the uncertainty with which households view the

future and leads them to increase their saving. Moreover, the equations

f or capital expenditures, expenditures for durable goods, the net

acquisition of financial assets, and the acquisition of consumer debt

all point to the positive effect of expected inflation on saving as being

uniform across asset categories


     While PE is absent from the equation explaining the level of demand
     deposits, the variable's impact, when included as a predictor, was
     negative but with a t—ratio less than one. In contrast, whcn PE
     was included in he cquation for savings accounts, its coefficients
     was positive, but again with a t—ratio less than one.

      Inflation in the recent past. Although it does not do so with the

 frequency and gusto of PE, inflation in the recent past, as represented

 in the variable PA, is seen to appear in several equations.    My idea for

 including this variable in the model was that it would capture a real—

 balance effect on money—denominated financial assets. Inflation reduces

 the real value of such assets and, to the extent that inflation was not

 anticipated, my hypothesis was that households will increase current saving

 so as to make up the loss. I originally set out to incorporate this into

 the model directly through a distributed lag on the real change in house-

 holds' holdings of demand deposits and savings accounts. However, the

 lag coefficients were very unstable, and the approach was abandoned in

 favor of a four—quarter moving
                                  average of the percentage change in the PCE
deflator.

     PA appears with a positive sign in the equations for NS, CS, CI, NFl,

and NAF and with a negative sign in the equation for NIL ——    all   of which

is in keeping with the hypothesized real—balance effect.    Still, the

hypothesis would have received more impressive support had PA also

appeared (with positive sign) in the equation for savings accounts.

     Effect of wealth. It is a well—established implication of the

Modigljanj—Brberg life—cycle model that saving will be negatively related

to the level of wealth. Existing studies, however, have tended to

concentrate on wealth as a whole and have not paid much attention to

the possibility that the effect of wealth on saving is different

depending upon the type of wealth involved. The results presented in

Table 8 suggest that differential effects
                                            are definitely present, not only
on total saving, but 'on Its disposition as well. Iideed, the only item

analyzed   for which wealth in some form is absent altogether is savings

accounts.—
      Of the components of wealth that have been considered, the ones that

appear with greatest frequency are corporate wealth, often as a distributed

lag on capital gains, and the existing level of consumer debt, the latter,

of course, being a liability rather than an asset. The stock of durable

goods appears in the three equations for saving (PS, NS, and GS), but

rather surprisingly not in the equations for gross investment, capital

expenditures, or expenditures for durable goods. The housing stock shows

up in the equations for gross saving (although with what would appear to

be the wrong sign) and gross investment, but not, as would be expected,

in the equations for capital expenditures and residential construction.

Surprisingly, in fact, in the equation for capital expenditures, no real

components of wealth appear as predictors at all.

      With regard to corporate wealth, the results clearly support the thesis

that the stock market, through generation of capital gains and losses,

has an influence on saving and consumption. However, because of the fact

that realized capital gains are not included in disposable income, care

must be taken in interpreting the quantitative strength of this influence.

We can derive the effect of a capital gain on consumption, but paradoxically

we cannot do this for saving, properly measured. From the equation for

gross saving, a dollar áf capital gain is seen to lead to about a two cents

increase in consumption, the latter being defined as the sum of expenditures

or nondurables and services. That this is so follows from the fact that

GS, consumption, and disposable income are connected by an identity.

However, since realized capital gains do not appear in disposable income,

the true effect on saving will not be given by the.decrease in CS, but will

44/
      However  this absence may be more apparent than real because of an
      extremely strong trend underlying the dependent variable, which led to
      the exclusion of the beginning—of—period level of savings accounts
      from the equation finally estimated.

                                               illustrate, if there is a
in fact be an increase in consumption. To

capital gain of $1 of which $.50 is realized, then, again from the equation

for gross saving, consumption will increase by $.02 and true saving by
                                      Flow—of—FundS would indicate a decrease
$.48, although gross saving in the

of $.02. Two   conclusions   thus emerge:

     1). The impact of capital gains appears to fall much more on saving

          than on consumption; and

     2). Because of the fact that realized capital gains arenot included

          in disposable income, the measures of saving based on NIA definitions

          will considerably understate changes in saving, properly defined,

          in periods of marked realization of capital gains or losses.I'
     The rather small effect on consumption that has just been noted is

counter to the substantial wealth effects that Nodigliani and hi

associates are currently finding in the consumption sector of the NIT—Penn

                        However, the   following   should be kept in mind in
—SSRC (MPS)

assessing this apparent contradiction:

     1). Although the two models have many elements in common, they also

          have points of divergence. Wealth is treated as an aggregate in

          the MPS mOdel, but is disaggregated here; disposable income is

          expectations; and, interestingly enough, the present model,

           through the inclusion of points on the age structure of the

           population, contains life—cycle features that the MPS      model   does


          not.


      There is one other important implication of the way that capital ga:Lns
      are treated in the National Income Accounts. \hile the

      2).   There is also a difference, which may possibly be of consequence,

            in the corporate wealth series used in the two models. The

            procedure here has been to take FOP year—end levels and interpolate

            them to quarterly     levels using the   Standard and Poor Index of

            Stock   Prices.   The MPS model, in contrast, uses a corporate wealth

            series constructed by capitalizing net dividends from the

            National Income Accounts by the Standard and Poor Index of

            Dividend Yields±.ZJ


      Although there are numerous instances of absence of components of

wealth from the equations in Table 8, cases of perverse sign on those

included are rather few. The housing stock has a positive coefficient

in the equation for gross aving, but in view of the fact that this sign

is reversed in the equation for gross investment, this may reflect mainly

on the quality of the underlying data for saving. The stock of durable

goods has a positive sign in the equation explaining the net increase in

liabilities, which seems somewhat strange, but the most puzzling sign is

the one on CC. Frequently, the level of consumer debt appears with a

distributed lag, which is reasonable given that much of consumer debt

is subject t well—defined schedules of repayment, and coefficients

on CC beginning two quarters in the past almost invariably have

the expected sign (see Table 9)•/ But this is usually not the case

for the sign on CC1. While a negative sign in t—l can be rationalized

somewhat in those equations in which expenditures for durable goods form

      Saving out of different types of income. The results presented in

Table 8 corroborate in every major detail the findings reported in my BPEA

paper with respect to the disaggregation of personal income.-' In partic—

ular, they continue to show a very high short—run marginal propensity to

save out of transfer payments and very substantial negative coeficients on

personal contributions to social insurace and personal taxes.   While the

results obtained here offer no insight as to      the short—run marginal

propensity to save out of transfer income is higher than out of labor and

property Income, they do throw some light on where households channel this

higher saving. The equations for NAP and SA Indicate that it is into

financial assets and into savings accounts in particular'

      Finally, it is worthy to note that the results do offer some insight into

the fact that the coefficient on personal taxes is larger (in absolute value)

than the one on labor and property income. For, as indicated in footnote 44,


      One extenuating circumstance may be the use of a fixed—weight distrib-

      The differences between the model used here and the one in the BPEA
      paper are as follows: (1) only NIA personal saving was analyzed there;
      (2) wealth is disaggregated here and the components introduced explicitly
      as predictors; (3) capital gains were ignored in the BPEA paper; (4)
      the BPEA model also ignored expectations and the age structure of the
      population; (5) the saving and income data used here are free of mput—
      ations; and (6) the data used in the BPEA data were expressed in 1958
      dollars.
      Needless to say, It cannot be deduced from aggregate time—series data
      alone whether the higher observed short—run marginal propensity to
      save out of transfer income is intricsic to transfer income, or whether
      it is a phenomenon arising from aggregation across households with
      different marginal propensities to save. The negative coefficient on
      TP in the equation for capital expenditures, though, suggests that
      it might be the latter. It was hoped at the outset that the results
      from the CAS data set would shed some light on this question, but
      this has not been the case.

it would appear to be accounted for, at least in part, by the inclusion in

personal taxes of the taxes paid on capital gains.

    The features of note are as follows:

    1). Households whose heads are very young——age 20 to 30—-- save more

         than average. This would appear to corroborate the point made

         by Tobin and Dolde (1971) that young households are forced to

         save more than would be expected by strict life—cycle consider-

         ations because of imperfections in the capital market.

    2). Households in the age group 30—40 are indicated to save,, less than

         average. Interestingly, the "dissaving" appears especially to

         surface in the holding of financial assets, particularly savings

            accounts. That the saving of this age group tends to be les

            than average conforms wjth general observation, but it is not

            in keeping with the life—cycle model in which only age is taken
                            52/
            into account.

    3). Considerably greater than average saving is exhibited by the

            40—50 age group. This, too, accords with general observation,

            and also with the fact that peak of earning potential, is ,    in
            general, reached in the forties.

    4). The 50—65 age group, on the other hand, is indicated to be

            relative dissavers. While this is in keeping with the life—

            cycle model, I nevertheless find it somewhat unexpected, since

            casual   observation suggests that the 10   to 15 years before age

            65   are years of conscious saving for retirement.
     5). Finally, it is to be noticed that the equations for which       age

            appears   to be of no consequence at all are net investment in

          financial assets and the holdings of demand deposits. However,

          neither of these results seems particularly surprising.



VII. Conclusions and General Discussion

     The findings with respect to price expectations cluster at two extremes.

The time—series results unambiguously point to price expectations having an

impact on the amount that households save and on the way that they structure

their portfolios. In particular, the time—series results show that

expectations of inflation lead households to save more. The results from

the two micro dat sets, in contrast, are weak and mixed. The CAS results provide

mild support for the Katona—Juster hypothesis and, in addition, suggest

that price expectations are of most consequence to households of moderate

wealth. On the other hand, nothing conclusive at all emerges from the CU

sample.

     The relationship between the saving and portfolio decisions of a

household and its expectations regarding inflation obviously involves a set

of issues that is too complex to come fully to grips with in a study as

limited as that reported hered Many of these issues have been ignored

altogether——such as whether higher (or lower) prices anticipated by a

household are expected to be permanent or only temporary——while others,

such as a]1owing for the confidence with which a household holds its

expectations, have been taken into account only cErudely and indirectly. Yet,

the present undertaking has, in my opinion, led to positive results. First,

and foremost, it provides fairly convincing evidence that individual price

expectations are a factor to be taken seriously no matter how ill—founded

the expectations 2se may appear to an outsider.

     Secondly, and of no less importance, I find in Table 5 that price
                                —52—




expectations are of greater importance to households of moderate wealth,
as   opposed to poor or very wealthy households, on the whole, to Iflake sense.
For the most part, households with little wealth lack the scope to he niuch
affected by expectations of inflation. Imperfect capital markets preclude
their undertaking many transactions, and high transactions costs limit their
interest in undertaking others. Consequently, these households arc much
more likely    to react to inflation that   has already occurred as opposed to
inflation    that they expect to occur. Wealthy households, on the   other
hand,   can either afford to ignore price expectations altogether or, what is

more likely, can place their portfolio decisions in the hands of

professionals whose expectations, rather than their own, are the ones that

are relevant. Finally, for householdswith moderate wealth, their portfolio

is sufficiently large to provide a return to its active management, but not

large enough to be placed in the hands of professionals.

        Finally, it has become increasingly clear through the course of the

study that the price expectations data that have been analyzed are

markedly deficient. I do not mean this as criticism of the surveys from

which the tiata were obtained——these surveys were designed for purposes other

than the analysis of price expectations——but only in tens of lessons for

the future. In particular:

        1). Analysis of the price expectations data in both the CAS and CU

             samples indicates that the distribution of price expectations

             data vàriës markedly depending upon which member of the house-

             hold was queried." Clearly, the expectations that are relevant

             are those of the one responsible for the decisions that are made.

             Future endeavors in collecting price expectations data must

  53/

         for being sufficiently curious to undertake this analysis purely    in

               accordingly make certain that the expectations obtained are

               those of the decision—maker(s).

       2). Efforts should also focus on obtaining estimates of the      confideace
               with   which price expectations are held. The iinpotance of

               obtaining this additional information in a usable form cannot

               be overestimated.

       3). Finally, future endeavors should also elicit inforxnation on

               whether near—term price changes are expected to be permanent:

               or only temporary.
