                                               ABSTRACT

This paper proposes the use of consumers’ preferences in formulating policies for keeping secret information
about terrorist activities and threats that might compromise future security. We report the results from
two surveys indicating that people have clear preferences for full disclosure of some terrorist related
information regardless of its consequences for specific industries or future threats. This result is especially
clear for threats involving commercial airlines. For those threats associated with more general surveillance
or threats to the financial system respondents were more willing to allow government authorities to
withhold information.

      Do Citizens Want the Truth About Terrorist Threats Regardless of the Consequences?

                        V. Kerry Smith, Carol Mansfield, and H. Allen Klaiber



1. Introduction

        It is widely assumed that security requires some amount of secrecy. Even in a free

society, most people recognize the need for governments to keep some information secret to

protect their citizens. But how much is enough and how do people react when the information

involved is about terrorist threats? This paper reports the first national survey of people’s

attitudes toward public deception in the name of security.1

        Many discussions of the criteria for limiting the disclosure of information in a democracy

are based on conceptual arguments. They consider the relative importance of accountability and

policy effectiveness when full information disclosure contributes positively to the first objective

and may have negative impacts for the second. Secrecy has increased since the September 11,

2001 attacks in the U.S. because it is argued that public disclosure of the government’s private

information related to anything that might compromise security will increase terrorist risks.

Priest and Arkin’s [2010] series in The Washington Post on the privatization of national security

is a notable example of one of the effects of these policies. Their first installment highlights the

significant role of private companies in homeland security operations, a situation that has been

largely unknown to the public.

 Viscusi and Zeckhauser [2003] conducted a survey of law students’ attitudes toward security screenings and
other infringements on civil liberties as measures intended to reduce terrorist threats.
                                                       2
        In another context, Shapiro and Siegel’s [2010] analysis of the arguments for secrecy use

models of the strategic actions of the government and of terrorists, as interacting agents. They

recommend a nuanced approach in evaluating policies that call for increased secrecy in the name

of security. In their analysis information is grouped into broad types- organizational, general, and

target specific. Their models do not offer unambiguous criteria for disclosure versus secrecy.

Nonetheless, their analysis does suggest the analysis should consider the type of information that

is being kept secret and the net benefits of disclosure, weighing the increased risks against the

potential for an enhanced ability to protect the public due to better use of information2.

        The analysis we report in this paper is based on a survey of Knowledge Network’s

panelists in thirty-three large metropolitan areas conducted in late 2009 and early 2010. While

our survey was developed before we became aware of the Shapiro and Siegel findings, the

design poses questions that complement the logic of their analytical structure. Shapiro and

Siegel’s models assume the government agent reflects the preferences of the population at risk.

These preferences are assumed to depend on reducing the risk of a successful attack. Our survey

findings suggest the public’s preferences are more complex. The respondents want some types of

information revealed regardless of the consequences for future risks. As a result the criteria for

information disclosure need to consider the preferences of the people facing the increased risk

that disclosure creates.

        These responses do not appear to be due to cognitive mistakes and vary with the type of

information that would need to be withheld. Thus, even if the net benefits from enhanced


2
  Recent work by Abadie and Dermisi [2008] is based on the maintained assumption that people assess the risks of
future terrorist actions based on the past. In this study they use commercial office vacancy rates to assess whether
vacancies are higher in business locations near “signature” buildings with the potential for greater terrorist
threats. This type of logic is another reason why we focused our sample on respondents from large metropolitan
areas.
                                                         3
efficiency in the government’s responses to threats with information were small compared to the

risks, people will prefer full disclosure of certain types of information. Our findings indicate that

disclosing information about threats to commercial airlines is especially important to the survey

respondents.

       Section two provides some highlights of the literature on the criteria for withholding

information in a democracy. Section three describes our survey. Section four summarizes our

findings and the last discusses their implications.



2. Information and Security Externalities

       Government secrecy may seem inconsistent with the principles that define a democratic

society. However, the issues involved in public management of information dissemination in a

free society are complex. Most scholars considering the subject argue that some limits to full

information disclosure are essential. Thompson [1999], for example, described the inherent

dilemma as having two parts:

       “…democracy requires publicity, but some democratic policies require secrecy. The first
       horn [of this dilemma] is familiar enough: The policies and processes of government
       must be public in order to secure the consent of the governed. … the second horn points
       to the fact that some policies and processes, if they were made public, could not be
       carried out as effectively or at all. These policies and processes may well be ones to
       which citizens would consent if they had the opportunity” (p. 182, bracketed term added).


 Homeland security policy since September 11, 2001, has focused renewed attention on the

question of government secrecy. Thompson’s description applies nicely to debates over when

information should be kept secret for national security reasons.




                                                  4
        Shapiro and Siegel [2010] address the question of information disclosure in a more

formal modeling framework3. They use models of the strategic interaction between two players

to analyze the conditions under which information should or should not be kept secret. They use

a model with two agents. The first represents the government. This agent must decide whether to

release different types of information. The second represents all the terrorists grouped as a single

“player” who would use the information to “destroy, incapacitate or exploit critical infrastructure

across the United States to threaten national security….”4 The authors consider whether

information provided by the government will be a net benefit to the society that has the

information and faces the threat from terrorists. Their analysis reviews three different types of

information:

        (1) Organizational Information- This is described as information that would help the

        government predict terrorists’ operating patterns.

        (2) General Information- This information need not be associated with terrorism directly.

        It could be associated with accountability of governing units and anticipating shortfalls in

        service. They cite research uncovering capacity limits or key nodes in

        telecommunications infrastructure that serves to identify limitations before they create

        problems. Such anticipatory research could also convey general information about

        weaknesses of the system.

        (3) Target Specific Information- Systems that allow the reporting of vulnerabilities of key

        facilities to threats and can be effective in reducing those limitations.

  Shapiro and Siegel [2008] is a mathematical appendix to their paper which provides the details for the models
underlying their conclusions.
4
  Shapiro and Siegel cite Homeland Security Presidential Directive seven as the source of a redefinition following
September 11, 2001, of the scope of secrecy in the name of national security. See discussion pp 67-68 and note #4.
                                                        5
           In all three classes of information, the dissemination of information has both positive and

negative effects. Sharing organizational and general information allows more people to work on

the issues and, as a result, increases the chances of improved responses to specific terrorist

threats or system vulnerabilities. Of course, as several authors have noted,5 the terrorists are also

using the freely available information. When the protecting agent and the agent seeking to

disable interact continuously, the realized risks (and outcomes) are the result of the sequence of

strategic interactions. Once information is released the interactions change because terrorists can

react. Given that terrorists will react, the outcomes resulting from the government’s decisions to

release information, the form in which the information is released, and the government’s

protective responses become endogenous variables to the model.

           Using the case of organizational information as an example of this endogeneity, consider

the government’s acknowledgment of a database on terrorist actions and research about terrorists

based on that data. Knowing the existence of this information creates incentives for terrorists to

change tactics, reducing either the value of the database or the incentives to study the data. As

another example, identifying “weak links” as either general information or target specific

information offers opportunities to fix them, but also provides ideas to the terrorists of potential

targets.

           In the end Shapiro and Siegel conclude favoring a more nuanced approach to information

policy and suggest:




5
  Enders and Sandler [2006] offer the most complete overview of the literature and in chapters five and six
specifically discuss the ways information influence terrorist responses. In chapter six the specific focus on
transnational terrorism and the failure to share information across the autonomous agencies protecting individual
countries offers an example of the Shapiro Siegel argument. Zhuang and Bier [2010] offer a brief summary of some
of the more recent literature on strategic models of government terrorist interactions.
                                                        6
        “Under a wide range of conditions, open sharing of government’s private information can
        enhance efforts to protect citizens. This is true even when the information deals directly
        with specific targets. When the positive externalities of information sharing are taken into
        account, the set of conditions under which open information sharing benefits society
        become wider still. Our analysis puts to rest the overly simple conception that revealing
        vulnerabilities to the other side is strictly a poor idea.” (p. 96, emphasis added).

        The conclusion follows in part from an assumption that the “publicness” of the

information allows the government agent to act “faster” and “better” than the terrorist. That is,

the government has the opportunity to take advantage of insights from many sources through

coordinated use of what is learned. With more people looking at problems or with greater “light

on problems” there are more likely to be solutions and/or actions to address them.6 The

government “benefits” from public release of information because it can make greater use of the

information as data and can coordinate responses as a result.

        This logic is actually not a part of their formal model. Nonetheless, it is consistent with

their focus on technical features of the interaction. The strategic interaction in their model is

about factors influencing the ability of the government to “produce” protection. People’s

preferences may be more multi-faceted with different concerns about disclosure about specific

types of information. One reason stems from differences in the ability to self-protect across

different people. Another arises with heterogeneity in the assessment of different types of

theorist risks. These extensions are important if the general public does display marked

differences in their attitudes toward disclosing different types of information and provide the

motivation for our survey.




6
 This assessment is based on the explanations described in the Shapiro-Siegel [2010] paper not their mathematical
appendix to the paper. The appendix (Shapiro and Siegel [2008]) is a more narrowly focused set of two person
game-theoretic models developed in expected utility terms where the odds of specific actions being effective
depend on the other agent’s behavior including information disclosure.

3. A Survey on the Merits of Secrecy

        This section describes a survey to assess the public’s tolerance for government secrecy

under different conditions. The survey was structured as part of a larger study on the benefits of

homeland security policies. As part of the questionnaire, each respondent was asked whether

they would support allowing the government to keep information secret given a set of conditions.

Figure 1 contains the wording of the three questions with scenarios presenting different types of

information and consequences. Each scenario must have some elements of specific types of

events to establish the context. As a result, a designation of each one as an example of the

Shapiro-Siegel categories will be imperfect. We regard version B as similar to what Shapiro and

Siegel label as target specific information. Version A, an airport surveillance system, is closer to

the organizational information category. Version C has elements of both but a generic

surveillance system is highlighted specifically in this scenario as well. Each information scenario

also includes a statement about the likelihood that announcing details of the information

collected as part of reducing the threat of some terrorist action could reduce the ability to protect

against future threats of that type. Each respondent was randomly assigned one of three

scenarios. Each person also received one of three probabilities (1 in 5 chances, 1 in 10 chances

and 1 in 100 chances) that the negative externality due to the information disclosure would

occur. The respondents were asked whether they would favor announcing the information or

keeping the details secret.

        Our survey was implemented in two phases using a web-based instrument to members of

the Knowledge Networks panel.7 Unlike most other internet panels, Knowledge Networks



7
 The survey instrument was developed and tested in four focus groups and through a pre-test involving 222
panelists, 18 years and older, who lived in the metropolitan areas of Kansas City and Los Angeles. The pre-test

recruits a representative sample of households onto their panel through Random-Digit Dialing

and, more recently, through address-based sampling. Households that do not have a computer

are provided with a computer and internet access. Households with a computer are provided with

free internet access.

        The survey was first sent to a sample of panelists aged 18 and over who lived in one of

33 metropolitan areas between December 15, 2009, and December 31, 2009.8 Seventy-one

percent of those invited responded to yield a sample with 1901 panelists9. Major metropolitan

areas were selected for the sample, based in part on the discussions during survey pretests

indicating that most people felt terrorist threats were most salient for those living or working in

large metropolitan areas.

        A follow-up survey of 482 different panelists in four of the metropolitan areas involved

in the first sample was conducted between April 1, 2010 and April 19, 2010. The same survey

instrument was used for both surveys. This second survey allowed assessment of whether the

events surrounding the Christmas bomber influenced the panelists’ attitudes toward secrecy.10



indicated respondents were able to answer the questions and understood the materials presented. The questionnaire
was shortened to accommodate budget restraints.

  The thirty-three metropolitan areas were: Atlanta, GA; Boston, MA; Buffalo, NY; Charlotte, NC; Chicago, IL;
Columbia, MO; Dallas, TX; Detroit, MI; Greenville, SC; Houston, TX; Huntsville, AL; Kansas City, KS; Las Vegas, NV;
Lincoln, NE; Los Angeles, CA; Miami, FL; Mobile, AL; Nashville, TN; New Orleans, LA; New York City, NY; Norfolk, VA;
Oklahoma City, OK; Phoenix, AZ; Pittsburgh, PA; Raleigh, NC; Richmond, VA; San Diego, CA; San Francisco, CA;
Seattle, WA; St. Louis, MO; Tallahassee, FL; Tampa, FL; Washington, D.C.

  The overall response rate for Knowledge Networks surveys is below 10% if one accounts for the entire panel
recruiting process, which includes many steps at which panel members could drop out. Smith et al [2009] discuss
in the appendix to their paper the recruiting process for the Knowledge Network panels and the analysis of
selection effects associated with this process. The research record to date suggests that while the Knowledge
Network panel is systematically different from the U.S. population as a whole due to non-response, this process
has not impacted the assessment of risks, characterization of individual preferences for policies that affect non-
market environmental services or security risks.

   On December 25, 2009, an attempt to destroy a Northwest passenger jet bound for Detroit was unsuccessful.
The event received extensive news coverage in the months after it took place. Two hundred and thirty of our
panelists in the first sample completed their interviews after the event. We investigated whether their responses
                                                         9
        Table 1 summarizes the demographic characteristics of the respondents to the two

surveys. The first column reports summary attributes and attitudes of the full December 2009

sample. Four metropolitan areas, Chicago, the District of Columbia, Los Angeles, and New

York, were oversampled in this survey. These areas were the focus of the second survey in April

2010. The second column provides a summary of characteristics for these four areas’ panelists in

the December 2009 survey and the third column reports the same summary statistics for the

independent panelists from these areas who participated in the April survey. As these summary

results suggest, the panelists are broadly similar in their demographic characteristics, education,

income, and attitudes toward personal responsibility for being prepared for a variety of

uncontrollable threats. Considering the summary statistics in Table 1, most of the sample are

between 35 and 64 (over 75 years of age is the omitted category in the table). The majority are

white and married. Slightly greater than half of the respondents have a college degree or higher

and household income levels are higher than the U.S. average. The majority felt it was very or

somewhat important to be prepared for disasters.



4. Results

        The first row in Table 1 reports the proportion of respondents in each sample who

favored full government disclosure of information (publicizing the truth) when we combine the

responses from all three of the scenarios. The results suggest that somewhat less than half the




                                                                      th
were different from those completing the survey before December 26 . There was no difference in their
responses. This was tested using simple chi-square tests as well as in the more extensive multivariate model. As a
result we focus our attention on the analysis of the second survey with added time to consider all of the news and
discussion of terrorism threats.
                                                        10
respondents would favor information disclosure. This result holds for higher risk metro areas as

sub-samples as well as over time in these four higher risk metropolitan areas.

          However, this general result is misleading. As Table 2 suggests, there are dramatic

differences in this willingness to accept secrecy across different types of threats. The three panels

in Table 2 provide the most direct summary of our primary findings. Adult residents of major

metropolitan areas likely to be potential terrorist targets do not accept blanket secrecy policies

for different types of information. There is a sharp and persistent difference in their attitudes

toward public secrecy that depends on the nature of the information describing the terrorist

target.

          Policies that would withhold information about terrorist plots involving commercial

airlines would not be acceptable to over eighty percent of the respondents asked about them. The

rate observed for respondents from Chicago, the District of Columbia, Los Angeles, and New

York did not change after the Christmas day attempted bombing of a commercial flight bound

for Detroit. Information associated with incidents involving surveillance systems that disrupted

terrorists at airports or with the financial system could be withheld from the perspective of the

majority of respondents receiving them. The percentage willing to withhold this information was

over seventy-five percent and stable across sub-samples and time periods.

          Changes in the likelihood of information impacting future safety did increase the

acceptability of secrecy for incidents involving the commercial airline system. Nonetheless, this

effect was small and respondents did not discriminate between odds of one in five compared to

one in ten. The primary finding from varying the stated likelihood of future effects was an

increased propensity for full disclosure at the lowest odds of disruption from making the

information public, when compared to either of two higher odds cases. This result implies that

                                                  11
people did understand the external effect of information disclosure. Higher risk of effects

reduced the demands for disclosure but the effect was not large enough to change general

sentiment for full disclosure in the case of threats to commercial airlines.

        These findings are quite robust and make no assumptions about perceptions of the

importance of the secrecy or the reasons why availability of information might be important to

Knowledge Network panelists. They assume each respondent receiving one of the nine

treatments can be treated as approximately equivalent to any other. Table 4 investigates whether

observable features of panelists’ heterogeneity influences our findings. This assessment fits

probit models to panelist responses to the information disclosure questions. The model

hypothesizes that a response favoring full disclosure is a function of the type of information-

organizational (Versions A and, potentially, C), target specific associated with the commercial

airline system (Version B). We also include fixed effects for two of the three odds of disruption

(so the parameters measure the effect compared to the omitted category). Our probit model is

restricted to exclude an intercept. This normalization allows us to identify separate estimates for

the effect of each version rather than to estimate a comparative effect (i.e. relating the included

terms to the omitted category). Our conclusions would not change with an alternative

normalization.

        The models include age class fixed effects, gender, a variable identifying whether the

respondent’s household had young children, race, education fixed effects, marital status,

household income and a count of the number of emergency preparedness actions they have

taken.11 This last variable is intended to serve as an indicator of their concerns about hazards and



11
   The question asked respondents about a list of things people have done to prepare for disasters including: have
a first aid kit, have a weeks supply of personal care and hygiene products, have a 7-day supply of prescriptions,
                                                        12
propensity to self protect. Finally we estimated the basic model using the full sample with and

without fixed effects for the thirty-three metropolitan areas.

        The findings confirm the results from our simpler cross tabulations. After controlling for

age, gender, race, income, and the likelihood of disruption, these respondents consistently

support disclosure of information concerning terrorist threats to the airline system, regardless of

consequences described as leading to damage and potential destruction of a viable commercial

airline sector. By contrast, they would support withholding information that was general about

surveillance methods. In addition information could be withheld about a surveillance system that

reduces the threat of disruption to the credit system.

        We considered the model using the full sample (both December 2009 and April 2010

surveys) and found the airline related threat between the surveys associated with the incident

labeled the Christmas bomber, did not influence attitudes toward disclosing airline information.

The interaction variable defined as the product of the fixed effect for Version B and one

indicating that the respondent was part of the second survey was not significant. Controlling for

metropolitan areas did not influence our conclusions (see column (2)). Similarly restricting the

sample to the four metro areas before (column (3)) or after the Christmas bombing threat

(column (4)) did not alter the general findings.

        Our ability to isolate the effects of demographic variables was influenced by sample size.

It appears women are more willing to support withholding information. Those with at least a

college degree are not. Married households are more willing to allow limits on information




have a radio with fresh batteries, designate a contact outside the area, and have a two week supply of food and
water. This variable is a count of the number each respondent indicated they had available.
                                                       13
disclosure. Otherwise, support for treating the disclosure of different types of terrorist related

information differently is quite uniform.

       Thus, these results imply that the Shapiro-Siegel “nuanced policy” should consider

people’s views about the type of information they indicate should be disclosed and not assume

strategic models of government and terrorist interactions in response to information can be

interpreted independent of context for the information. People display significantly different

preferences for full disclosure of terrorist related information.



5. Implications

       There are certainly limits to full information disclosure in free democratic societies.

Many observers have argued the 9/11 attacks lead to significant increases in calls for secrecy as

essential to homeland security. Political scientists have considered the properties of alternative

decision criteria that can be applied in making the choices about when Democratic governments

can reasonably withhold information from citizens. Based on formal models of the strategic

interaction between two agents, the government and a terrorist entity, along with informal

contextual analysis, Shapiro and Siegel argue against increased secrecy in favor of a more

nuanced policy. They suggest, given the assumptions of their analysis, that open access to most

types of information is likely to yield greater benefits to a threatened society like the U.S. than

most forms of secrecy.

       Our analysis suggests their discussion and most of the earlier work on limits to

information disclosure leave out the preferences of the citizens who would be affected by these

choices. That is, the strategic analyses take as given that the government “agent” in these models



                                                  14
can be adequately described by assuming the primary concern is avoiding a successful attack of

any type.

       We began our analysis with the premise that people have different demands for

information about different types of threats. As a result, even if the government is assumed to be

equally effective in responding to all types of threats and that information disclosure would be

equally damaging, regardless of the type involved, people might nonetheless want to have

information in some situations regardless of the consequences. Our survey results support this

hypothesis. Respondents were especially concerned about full disclosure when the events

involved threats to the commercial airline system. Comparable descriptions of threats to the

effectiveness of a terrorist surveillance system or to compromising the credit system yielded

much greater willingness to accept secrecy.

           Figure 1: Information Scenarios and Question-Wording

Background

Now we would like to ask you about a different situation. National security has always required that some information be kept secret, often for a long time. Usually the
government keeps information secret because making the information public might be dangerous for the people who supplied the information to the government
officials, the people involved in the activity being kept secret, or it might hurt the government’s ability to protect the public from threats in the future.

At the same time, there is increasing recognition among psychologists that many people overreact to some risks. As a result some experts support changes to policies
that determine what information to keep secret. Please consider each of the following situations and indicate whether you would support letting a government expert
decide whether to keep the information secret in order to protect our security or our economy.

Version A: Organizational Information

Suppose Federal law enforcement has prevented a major plot to destroy airports in Los Angeles and New York. The investigators are confident all terrorists are
captured.
If the Federal government announces the details of the arrests then the public would know how effective our surveillance system is and would have more confidence in
the government.
However, if they announce the details of the arrests, then it might give away the techniques they used to identify the suspects and other details of the security network.
This could potentially make it harder for Federal law enforcement to uncover future plots. When the suspects come to trial, the information can be protected under
federal laws that limit public access to information associated with cases where there are threats to national security.

Assume that there is a 1 in (5, 10, 100) chance that announcing details about the arrests would make it harder to uncover other plots in the future. Would you favor
announcing the details of the arrests or keeping the details secret from the public?

   I would support announcing the details from the arrests
   I would not support announcing the details; I would support keeping the details secret

Version B: Target Specific Information-
Commercial Airlines

A terrorist attack on a commercial flight could lead to an irrational fear of air travel. If people are afraid to fly, this would impact the commercial airline business and
potentially undermine the financial viability of major airline companies.
Some experts have recommended it would be in everyone’s best interest to keep information about the cause of an airplane crash due to a terrorist attack secret from the
public. This would avoid the possibility of an irrational fear of flying by the public that could have large economic effects.
The actual risk of being in a plane that was the target of a terrorist attack is extremely small. If there was a terrorist attack on a plane, the cause of the crash would be
kept a secret from the public – the public would be told the crash was caused by something else. The experts believe that keeping the information about the terrorist
attack secret would save the economy and the airline industry from a loss of business. Experts believe this would be in the public’s best interest and it defeats the
terrorist’s intentions by protecting the economy.

Assume that there is a 1 in (5, 10, 100) chance that if the government announced a terrorist attack caused a plane to crash it would cause complete disruption of the
commercial airline industry that would take 5 years to recover from. Would you favor announcing that a terrorist attack caused a plane to crash or keeping the
information secret from the public?

   I would support announcing that a terrorist attack caused a plane crash
   I would not support announcing that a terrorist attack caused a plane crash. I would support keeping the information secret from the public

Version C: Target Specific Information-
Credit System

Suppose Federal law enforcement has prevented a major terrorist plot to disrupt internet service at commercial banks that would prevent processing of credit and debit
card sales for 48 hours – so no one in the U.S. would be able to use a credit or debit card for 48 hours. The investigators are confident all terrorists are captured.

If the Federal government announces the details of the arrests then the public would know how effective our surveillance system is and have more confidence in the
government.

However, if they announce the details of the arrests, then it might give away the techniques they used to identify the suspects and other details of the security network.
This could potentially make it harder for Federal law enforcement to uncover future plots. When the suspects come to trial, the information can be protected under
federal laws that limit public access to information associated with cases where there are threats to national security.

Assume that there is a 1 in (5, 10, 100) chance that announcing details about the arrests would make it harder to uncover other plots in the future. Would you favor
announcing the details of the arrests or keeping the details secret from the public?

   I would support announcing the details from the arrests
   I would not support announcing the details; I would support keeping the details secret
                                                                                      20
