NBER Working Paper No. 24865
July 2018
JEL No. I1,I15

                                          ABSTRACT

We systematically review the literature linking health to economic activity, particularly education
and labor market outcomes, over the lifecycle. In the first part, we review studies that link
childhood health to later-life outcomes. The main themes we focus on are in-utero exposures,
birthweight, physical health and nutrition, mental health, and the environment. In the second part,
we review studies of the impact of health on labor market success for adults. The main themes we
focus on are the environment, disability, physical health shocks, within-household spillovers,
cancer, and mental health.

1     Introduction

A voluminous literature studies the relationship between health at various points in life and
economic outcomes. The goal of this literature review is to summarize what is known about
the impact of health on economic activity throughout the life course. We consider the life
course in two parts. During the first part of life, childhood, health capital and general human
capital are built through investment, possibly affected by health shocks. During the second
part of life, adulthood, people enter the labor market. Their productivity is influenced by
the health capital and general human capital built during childhood, depreciates over time,
and is also subject to shocks.
    In the childhood section of this review, we examine how children’s health influences
educational outcomes, which in turn likely influence labor market outcomes in adulthood. We
also examine how children’s health may be connected with labor market outcomes through
other channels. Labor market outcomes, including employment and earnings, are natural
endpoints to be interested in, however, the majority of studies is only able to examine
educational outcomes, because the examination of labor market outcomes requires long-
term follow up and more data. In the adult section, we examine how health is connected
with labor market outcomes, including employment and earnings.
    To understand the scope of this review, it may be useful to consider the types of studies
that we are not including. We do not include studies that consider how economic circum-
stances impact health. We also omit studies that have health as their outcome variable,
including studies of how in utero and childhood health shocks influence health in childhood
or in adulthood. Instead we focus only on studies with economic outcomes, like education
and earnings. Our focus is the United States and other developed countries, many of which
have better data access for high-quality empirical studies, thus we omit studies of developing
countries.
    Each subsection of the children and adults sections presents a systematic review of a
particular literature. The systematic review was done by searching the economics literature

                                              5
using Google Scholar, specifying appropriate search terms for each subsection (e.g., “in utero”
OR “fetal” OR “prenatal” for Section 2.2 on the impact of in utero health), excluding studies
that were not relevant. In addition to the Google Scholar search, we added a small number
of studies that were referenced by the studies we found through the systematic search but
did not themselves come up in the search (usually because they did not contain the keywords
in their title). While we reference a few classic papers in each section, we limit our review
in most sections to 2005-2017, and indicate review articles that summarize earlier work
where available. Mindful of the slow publication process and the fast pace of some of the
subliteratures covered in our review, we also included relevant NBER Working Papers from
2015-2017 from the Children, Health, and Labor Studies programs. More specific details on
the systematic review are given at the beginning of each subsection.
   We structure each of the two sections, on children and adults, similarly. We give a short
overview of the broad topics of childhood and adult health and discuss the most recent com-
prehensive reviews. Then we review the subliteratures on different types of health. In the
childhood section, these are in-utero exposures, birthweight, physical health and nutrition,
mental health, and the environment. In the adult section, these are the environment, disabil-
ity, physical health shocks, within-household spillovers, cancer, and mental health. Each of
the subsections on different types of health is structured similarly. After a brief introduction,
which discusses previous important reviews where available and the search terms used in the
systematic review, we first summarize the methods that are common among the studies in
the subsection (but typically quite different across subsections), and then go through the
studies. We also provide summary tables for each subsection and conclude each section with
a summary discussion, which includes directions for future work.

2     Childhood health

2.1    Introduction

This section focuses on the impact of health on the educational attainment of children
and the long-term consequences of childhood health. While a voluminous literature shows
that later-life health is strongly related to childhood health, we prioritize studies that also
establish the importance of childhood health on outcomes other than later-life health. These
“non-health endpoints” are cognitive and noncognitive ability, educational attainment, and
longer-term labor market outcomes. We also limit our attention to studies that were done
in the United States and other developed economies, some of which have much better access
to administrative data, allowing researchers to connect data on health to data on measures
of educational attainment and economic outcomes.
    Two relatively recent general reviews on the topic are Currie (2009) and Almond and
Currie (2011a). These reviews are updated in Almond, Currie and Duque (2017). Currie
(2009) summarizes the literature that connects parental socioeconomic status (SES) to chil-
dren’s health and children’s health to education and future income. In this review, we are
interested in the latter of these connections, the relationship between childhood health, edu-
cation, and future income, but understanding the former, the relationship between parental
SES and childhood health is helpful to conceptualize the intergenerational transmission of
economic status. The conclusion of Currie (2009) is that child health has a measurable
impact on future educational and labor market outcomes, although the exact magnitude
of this connection has not been clearly established by the liteature. Almond and Currie
(2011a) is a more general review of the literature on human capital development in early
childhood. The authors discuss in detail the literatures on the long-term consequences of
both the prenatal environment and the early childhood environment. They conclude that
the literature establishes that prenatal and early childhood health matter for longer-term
outcomes at the population level and that in most, though not all cases, prenatal impacts are


                                              7
larger than postnatal impacts. They single out mental health conditions and non-cognitive
skills as examples health conditions that become important in early childhood after birth.
Almond, Currie and Duque (2017) summarize the developments of the fetal origins and early
childhood literatures since their earlier reviews. They argue that we can identify some inter-
ventions during the in utero and early life periods that can significantly improve long-term
outcomes, but there is still much to learn about heterogeneous effects and the magnitude of
the effect of various shocks and interventions. Moreover, they emphasize that little is known
about what they term the “missing middle years”, that is, early and middle childhood proxies
for longer-term effects.
   The section on children considers six main themes in the literature: (1) the fetal origins
literature that studies various in-utero exposures, (2) the related fetal origins literature that
studies the impact of low birth weight on longer-term outcomes, (3) the literature that studies
the longer-term impact of child physical health and nutrition, (4) the literature on the longer-
term impact of child mental health, and finally (5) the literature on environmental health.
Each of the thematic subsections starts with a discussion of the common methodologies that
have been used in the particular literature and then proceeds to discuss the most important
studies.


2.2     Fetal origins: In-utero exposure

2.2.1      Introduction

While David Barker was not the first one to work on this topic, the fetal origins hypothesis,
the idea that fetal conditions are persistent, latent, and may act through “programming”,
is sometimes called Barker’s hypothesis. Barker and Osmond (1986), Barker (1990), and
Barker (1995) present empirical work on the association between fetal conditions and later
life health. These studies were followed by a large literature in economics that established the
longer-term health impact of fetal origins. Here we focus on contributions that examine non-
health endpoints, such as education and earnings. An optimistic review of this literature is

presented in Almond and Currie (2011b) and its update, Almond, Currie and Duque (2017).
Given the large number of studies that have been written on a single historical pandemic,
the Spanish Flu of 1918, after discussing the common methodologies in the in-utero exposure
literature, we first discuss papers studying the 1918 influenza pandemic, and then separately
discuss papers studying other exposures.
   This subsection is based on a systematic review which started with searching the eco-
nomics literature on Google Scholar using the search terms "in utero" OR "fetal" OR
"prenatal" for years 2005-2017. Our search returned an initial 164 results, however we
only consider 25 studies that are relevant to our review. These need to consider the impact
of health on economic outcomes, rather than the other way around, examine non-health
endpoints (education or economic outcomes), and be done in the US or other developed
countries. In addition to the Google Scholar search, we added a small number of studies
that were referenced by the studies we found through the systematic search but did not
themselves come up in the search (usually because they did not contain the keywords in
their title). Mindful of the slow publication process and the fast pace of some of the liter-
ature covered here, we also included relevant NBER Working Papers from 2015-2017 from
the Children, Health, and Labor Studies programs.

2.2.2   Summary of methods

The main identification challenge in the in utero exposure literature is that in general it is not
plausible to assume that children who experience a worse in utero environment are otherwise
similar to children who experience a better in utero health environment. For example, if we
wanted to estimate the impact of maternal smoking during pregnancy and simply regressed
children’s outcomes on a measure of maternal smoking behavior, omitted variable bias would
likely make the results impossible to interpret as causal estimates. The reason for this is
that we know that smoking is correlated with a variety of other maternal characteristics, for
example socioeconomic status that are in turn correlated with children’s outcomes. Omitted
variable bias will be a concern even if we control for observable maternal characteristics
because unobservable characteristics correlated with smoking behavior can play a large role
in determining children’s outcomes as well. Given this basic identification challenge, the lit-
erature on in utero exposures has primarily relied on four research designs to arrive at causal
estimates: cohort discontinuities in exposure, geographic variation in exposure, variation in
the timing of exposure, and where possible family fixed effect specifications. In this section
we discuss in broad terms identification under each of these research designs, including the
underlying assumptions and possible violations.
   Cohort discontinuities in exposure arise when an exposure can be relatively precisely
timed, allowing researchers to compare people in utero during the exposure to people in
utero before and after. Because many outcomes (e..g, educational attainment) can have
strong secular time trends, it is important to have data on cohorts born both before and
after the exposure in question. A prime example of the use of a cohort discontinuity design
is Almond (2006) which estimates the long-term impact of in utero exposure to the 1918
influenza pandemic. Using data on people who were in utero in each year from 1912 to
1922, the author is able to compare the 1919 cohort (in utero in 1918) to the previous and
later cohorts. In this context, secular time trends are important, because for example each
successive cohort got more years of education independent of the exposure under study.


                                               13
Therefore estimation is done relative to these time trends. The main assumption required
for the identification of causal effects is that different cohorts are in fact comparable, in
particular, that the exposure does not coincide with changes in observable and unobservable
characteristics correlated with the outcomes. For example as discussed below, the potential
contemporaneous impact of World War I on the socioeconomic characteristics of families
giving birth in 1919 is a challenge to Almond (2006).
   Some studies rely on geographic variation in exposure either in their primary or in their
secondary analysis. Instead of comparing people born at different times, they compare peo-
ple born at the same time but in different areas of a country which had different levels of
exposure. An example of a strong study that relies on geographic (as well as temporal) vari-
ation in exposure is Black, Bütikofer, Devereux and Salvanes (2013) which exploits variation
across municipalities and months in low-level radioactive exposure in Norway. The main
assumption required for the identification of causal effects is that people born in different
regions are in fact comparable, at least conditional on observables. This would for exam-
ple be violated if people knew about the potential exposure and moved around the country
accordingly, and the people who chose to relocate were different, for example, because they
care more about their children in unobservable ways, than the people who chose to stay and
be exposed. The assumption is most plausible if the exposure was sudden and unexpected
(as was arguably the case with nuclear fallout from Chernobyl reaching Sweden in 1986,
studied in Almond, Edlund and Palme, 2009) or not known to people (as was arguably the
case with nuclear fallout from Soviet testing reaching Norway in the 1950s and 1960s, studied
in Black, Bütikofer, Devereux and Salvanes, 2013).
   Some of the studies below contrast the outcomes of people who experienced an exposure
at one point in their life with the outcomes of people who experienced the exposure at
a different point in their life. In Lavy, Schlosser and Shany (2016), different trimesters
of pregnancies are contrasted, in Black, Devereux and Salvanes (2016) and Persson and
Rossin-Slater (2016) bereavement events in the mothers family during versus before or after


                                             14
the pregnancy are contrasted. The idea behind this strategy is that by using only people who
experienced the exposure it is able to eliminate concerns about selection into the exposure,
while isolating the effect of the timing of the exposure. For example, in the context of
the in utero micronutrient deficiency among Ethiopian Jews immigrating to Israel during a
military operation studied by Lavy, Schlosser and Shany (2016), all individuals in the data
experience the deficiency but in different trimesters, so the identifying assumption is that the
trimester of the pregnancy is random relative to the date of the military operation studied.
Similarly, in the two maternal stress studies (Black, Devereux and Salvanes, 2016; Persson
and Rossin-Slater, 2016) all mothers experience the bereavement event. In this context, the
identifying assumption is whether the child is in utero or has already been born is random
relative to the bereavement event causing the variation in stress.
   Some more recent studies that make use of comprehensive administrative data are able to
connect parents to children and siblings to each other to control for family fixed effects. The
idea is that family background has a large impact on birth and later-life outcomes and is likely
correlated with various exposures. Moreover, family background can be thought to subsume
a variety of unobserved characteristics which are hard to control for. In a family fixed effects
specification, the variation exploited is within families across pregnancies, increasing the
credibility of estimates. For example, Black, Bütikofer, Devereux and Salvanes (2013) only
relies on siblings born at different times to the same mother and therefore subject to the
same family inputs but different levels of exposure. Besides the large data requirements,
the need to connect parents, children, and siblings and throw away most of the data where
children don’t have siblings, the main challenge is the possibility of change over time in
family inputs related to the exposure. If in fact family inputs change contemporaneously
with and in a way related to the exposure, the identifying assumption of constant family
background is no longer valid, moreover omitted variable bias can be worse because the
impact of any violation is increased by reliance on within-family variation. Such problems
might for example plague Aizer, Stroud and Buka (2015) which relies on variation in cortisol


                                              15
levels across pregnancies of a woman to measure the impact of maternal stress on children’s
outcomes. Since the variation in cortisol levels is connected to changes in socioeconomic
status and therefore likely to changes in related unobservable characteristics, it is unclear
whether it is in fact the impact of stress that is identified.


2.2.3   Studies: The 1918 influenza pandemic

A large number of studies investigate the long-term impact of in utero exposure to the 1918
influenza pandemic, often called the Spanish Flu. The pandemic infected 500 million people
all over the world, on all continents. Below, we discuss the papers that originated this wave
of literature by studying long-term impacts in the US and then turn to critiques of the
original studies as well as research attempting to extend the findings to European and Asian
countries.
   Almond and Mazumder (2005) used data from the Survey of Income and Program Par-
ticipation (SIPP) to show that cohorts in utero during the 1918 influenza pandemic had
worse health outcomes decades later. Relying on SIPP data from 1984 to 1996, this study
examines the long-term outcomes of approximately 25,000 individuals of ages 60 to 82 at the
time of the survey, born in the U.S. in the 1915-1923 period. The authors estimate linear
regressions of health measures on indicators of quarter (or in other specifications month) of
birth (4th quarter of 1918, 1st quarter of 1919, 2nd quarter of 1919, etc.) and control for
survey year, age, and season of birth effects. The key result of the study is that individuals
born in the second quarter of 1919, who were in utero at the peak of the influenza pandemic,
fare significantly worse for a number of health measures than individuals born just before or
just after. For example, they are 16 percent more likely to rate their health as fair or poor
(as opposed to excellent, very good, or good).
   In perhaps the most famous article in this literature, Almond (2006) presents complemen-
tary evidence using census data, establishing the negative consequences of exposure to the
1918 influenza pandemic for educational attainment, disability, income, and socioeconomic


                                               16
status. Making use of the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS), a 1% (for 1960),
3% (for 1970), and 5% (for 1980) sample of microdata from the U.S. census, the author stud-
ies the outcomes in 1960, 1970, and 1980 of individuals born in 1919, and therefore exposed
to the pandemic, relative to trends for individuals born between 1912 and 1922. Most results
are reported for white men. The key regression framework in the paper relates educational
and economic outcomes to trends over time (parametrized as a linear and quadratic year of
birth effect) allowing for a deviation for those born in 1919. He finds that the 1919 birth
cohort received on average 1.5 months less education and was 4-5% less likely to complete
high school relative to the trend. Because of course not all mothers contracted influenza
during the pandemic, these average effects are larger, an estimated 13-15%, for those who
did contract the disease. The incomes of the 1919 birth cohort were also lower according
to the census data. They made $850-$1,100 (updating the author’s figures to 2016 dollars)
less per year than the surrounding cohorts. The estimate for the wage effect is $3,100 for
sons of infected mothers. Men are 6% more likely to have work-limiting and 8% more likely
to have work-preventing disability (17% and 25%, respectively, for those born to infected
mothers). They are also 8% more likely to be on welfare. Though not discussed at length,
most effects that the author estimates are smaller for women and non-white individuals than
for white men who comprise his main analytic sample. There is also some discussion and
use of a secondary method that relies on geographic variation in exposure. A key limita-
tion to be noted in translating the “reduced-form” estimates of the impact of exposure to
the pandemic into the “treated” estimates of the impact of being born to a mother who
actually contracted influenza is that the author relies on an estimated one-third infection
rate rather than microdata connecting sons with their mothers. Some of the recent studies
we discuss below that use administrative data from Nordic countries were able to solve this
issue, actually connecting parents with their children.
   Almond (2006) has been influential in spurring a large literature that has aimed to
establish the impact of the pandemic in other countries. It has also drawn some criticism


                                             17
that questions the validity of the identifying assumptions in the original study.
   In a recent critique, Brown and Thomas (2016) argue that the families whose children
were in utero during the 1918 influenza pandemic were systematically lower SES and that
controlling for SES there is little evidence that in utero exposure has an impact on longer-
term outcomes. The key insight of this critique is that the estimates in Almond (2006) are
unbiased causal estimates of in utero exposure to the pandemic if the 1919 cohort is “statis-
tically exchangeable” with the surrounding cohorts. In other words, the worse educational
and labor market outcomes that are found by the original study can be attributed to the
impact of the pandemic if there are no characteristics that are either unobserved or observed
but not controlled for in the original regressions and are correlated with both the outcomes
(educational attainment, labor market success) and the explanatory variable of interest (ex-
posure to the pandemic). The authors argue that this assumption does not hold and the
original results suffer from substantial omitted variable bias or lack of exchangeability. In
particular, they show, using data from the 1920 and 1930 censuses that the fathers of men
born in 1919 were much less likely to be literate and in general had worse socioeconomic
backgrounds. They first show that individuals born in 1919 and found by the original study
to be poorer in adulthood had poorer fathers. In a second exercise they also demonstrate
that controlling for parental background, there is no evidence that these individuals are in
fact poorer as adults and they might in fact be better off. In their discussion, the authors
cite World War I as a possible reason for difference between the distribution of paternal
characteristics of the 1919 cohort relative to the surrounding cohorts. The two particular
reasons related to the war that they mention is that wealthier families might have differen-
tially postponed childbearing because of the war and wealthier men were also more likely to
be deployed during the war. In fact they show that that WWI veteran status is a “sufficient
statistic” for paternal SES in the regressions: when an indicator for father’s veteran status
is included in the regressions, the original results, that in utero exposure to the pandemic
had a negative effect on adult outcomes, either disappear or are reversed.


                                             18
   Examining rich administrative data from Sweden, Bengtsson and Helgertz (2015) con-
clude that while effects on later-life health are large and negative, income is weakly and
positively affected by exposure to the pandemic. The authors are able to study the uni-
verse of individuals living in Sweden at any time between 1968 and 2012 using data that
includes longitudinal information on hospitalizations, educational attainment, and income.
They are also able to exploit month-by-county level variation in influenza exposure and rule
out changes in paternal SES around the time of the pandemic, the essence of the Brown and
Thomas (2016) critique. They both argue that Sweden did not actively participate in the
war and show using aggregate data that paternal SES is not related to birth quarter around
the pandemic. While the authors find significant morbidity effects (the affected cohorts are
hospitalized at an approximately 3% higher rate), long-term mortality effects were small in
Sweden. The earnings of cohorts exposed in utero to influenza were not lower, and there
is some indication that they were higher, than those of the surrounding cohorts. The af-
fected cohorts earn about 2% more and may be more likely to be in high SES occupations.
Providing complementary evidence using geographic variation in exposure rates, Karlsson,
Nilsson and Pichler (2014) find that there was no detectable effect on earnings in Sweden.
Neelsen and Stratmann (2012) rely on 1970 census data from Switzerland and as a secondary
analysis exploit not only variation across time but regional variation in influenza severity.
They uncover negative impacts on education and socioeconomic status. Lin and Liu (2014)
rely on 1980 census data from Taiwan for educational outcomes and also explore regional
variation to some extent. They find large negative effects on education.
   In a recent pair of studies, Richter and Robling (2016) and Richter and Mazumder (2016)
investigate whether the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic had multigenerational impacts on
socioeconomic outcomes. That is, they look at what happens to individuals whose parents
were in utero during the pandemic. Using administrative data from Sweden Richter and
Robling (2016) establishes that for women, schooling was 3-4 months lower and college
attendance was reduced by 3-5 percentage points if their mothers were in utero during the


                                             19
pandemic, while for men schooling was 4-7 months lower and college attendance was reduced
by 7-11 percentage points if their fathers were in utero during the pandemic. Adjusting for
the proportion of people who were actually infected during the pandemic, these estimates
may be as high as 12-16 months for women and 16-28 months for men. Interestingly, they
find that mothers don’t transmit the negative impact to their sons and fathers don’t transmit
the negative impact to their daughters. In Richter and Mazumder (2016), the authors look
at a sample of adoptees in the same Swedish administrative data in order to disentangle
direct (health) and indirect (household environment) mechanisms in the intergenerational
transmission of the impacts of the influenza pandemic. While they are underpowered to draw
firm conclusions, they find suggestive evidence that the second generation effect through
the direct health channel may be positive and the effect through the indirect household
environment channel may be negative.


2.2.4   Summary: The 1918 influenza pandemic

Even for a particular exposure, the 1918 Spanish Flu, estimates of long-term impact can
vary a lot across different contexts. The literature has presented numbers from large, 4-5%
estimates of the impact of exposure to the pandemic on educational outcomes in Almond
(2006) to no impact in studies using administrative data in Sweden (Bengtsson and Helgertz,
2015; Karlsson, Nilsson and Pichler, 2014). It unclear is whether the later studies deliver
estimates so much smaller than the early studies because they rely on more detailed admin-
istrative data or because the context is different, and European welfare states were better
able to compensate for the similar underlying negative impacts of the influenza pandemic. It
also remains an open question whether we can generalize about the importance of in-utero
health from one historic influenza pandemic to current circumstances. The following section
which examines other in-utero exposures suggests that this may be the case.

2.2.5   Studies: Other in-utero exposures

While the 1918 influenza pandemic has received the most attention in the literature, there
are studies that were written using similar methods but focused on in-utero exposure to other
events. These exposures include a 1957 influenza pandemic, the 1986 Chernobyl accident,
nuclear weapon testing, fasting during Ramadan, and most rcently maternal stress and
alcohol consumption during pregnancy.
   Using outcome data from the National Child Development Study (NCDS), Kelly (2011)
shows that in utero exposure to the 1957 Asian influenza pandemic in the UK had negative
effects on the cognitive development of children. The NCDS is an ongoing cohort study that
follows all, approximately 17,000, British children born between March 3 and March 9, 1958.
This means that the study is able to rely on very detailed data on the socioeconomic back-
ground and development of the children included. It also means that all children included
in the data were potentially exposed to the Asian flu, which hit the UK between September
and November 1957, in utero, making the cohort discontinuity design that is presented as
the primary analysis in most of this literature impossible to use in this case. Instead, the
author relies on geographic variation across local authorities in the incidence of influenza, a
research design that is presented as the secondary analysis in much of the preceding litera-
ture. The analysis essentially regresses the outcomes of interest (birthweight, test scores at
ages 7 and 11) on the number of pneumonia notifications per 100,000 in a local authority
(a measure of influenza exposure) and local authority-level and child-level control variables.
The author concludes that exposure to influenza had a negative effects on the physical health
of children born to less healthy mothers and had negative effects on test scores across the
SES distribution. The paper also discusses the fact that birthweight does not capture the
impact of influenza exposure on cognitive development which suggests that the birthweight
literature discussed below should be treated separately from the in-utero literature that relies
on various exposures.
   Almond, Edlund and Palme (2009) study the negative impact of in-utero exposure to


                                              21
fallout from the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident on school outcomes in Sweden. The authors
rely on administrative data for the universe of Swedish people born between 1983 and 1988.
They study birth, hospitalization, and schooling outcomes only as in 2009 it was too early to
study labor market outcomes for individuals born in 1986. Because they rely on high-quality
administrative data that allows them to connect parents to children and siblings with each
other, the authors are able to control for family fixed effects. In essence, they compare
children within the same family, one of whom was in utero during the nuclear accident,
while the others were not. This may be a major improvement relative to the previous
literature that relied on cohort discontinuities and/or geographical variation only and that
were possibly confounded by unobserved socioeconomic differences across families having
births at different times. The primary finding is a substantial negative impact on test scores
and the probability of high school graduation (projecting forward these correspond to up to
3% income loss) which is not mediated through birthweight or health outcomes (measured in
hospitalization data) which are not affected by in utero exposure to the fallout. The authors
argue that the impact then must come through latent cognitive ability. Similarly to other
studies in the in-utero literature, their secondary analysis considers regional variation in the
fallout and finds evidence consistent with the primary findings: the magnitude of test score
drops is larger in more exposed areas. Considering heterogeneity in effects, the authors find
that the negative impact on human capital is concentrated among low-SES families.
   Also studying exposure to nuclear fallout, Black, Bütikofer, Devereux and Salvanes (2013)
use variation across time and municipalities in Norway, created by the location and timing
of Soviet nuclear weapon testing in the 1950s and 1960s. They find declines in cognitive
ability, educational attainment, and earnings associated with exposure to low-dose nuclear
radiation. Similarly to other studies from Nordic countries, the authors are able to exam-
ine rich administrative data, which means that they are able to control for a variety of
parental characteristics and connect parents with their children and children with their sib-
lings. Given that nuclear testing was done for many years, rather than being a discreet event


                                              22
like Chernobyl or the 1918 influenza pandemic, the authors cannot rely on a simple cohort
discontinuity design. However, the substantial heterogeneity in exposure across municipal-
ities and across time allows them to exploit geographic heterogeneity interacted with time
(measured at the month level). The ability to connect families in the data means that they
can include family fixed effects, comparing siblings born at various times, corresponding to
different exposure levels. As discussed previously, this can be important in alleviating con-
cerns that families with different observed and unobserved characteristics have children at
different times and places in a way that is correlated with exposure and later-life outcomes.
This paper uncovers large impacts on IQ at age 18, years of education, high school com-
pletion, and earnings. Because of the richness of the data, the authors were able to match
another generation of people in addition to those directly exposed in utero and their parents.
Remarkably, the effects on IQ at age 18 persist, with a 60% transmission rate, in a second
generation, that is among the children of people who were in utero in the 1950s and 1960s.
   Sanders (2012) studies the impact of in utero exposure to air pollution. He exploits
geographic and termporal variation in air pollution generated by a wave of industrial recession
that hit Texas in the early 1980s. The author implements an instrumental variable (IV)
strategy, using annual employment changes at the county level in manufacturing employment
as the instrument for total suspended particulate matter (TSPs). In the first stage, he shows
the strong relationship between the instrument and pollution and then examines the impact
of pollution on educational outcomes, in particular, high school test performance. The key is
to link the TSP in a student’s year and county of birth to her test scores. (Since the the test
score data does not contain information on students’ place of birth, the author assumes that
they are taking the test in the county where they were born.) The main finding of this study
is that TSP in the year of birth is negatively correlated with high school test performance.
   Bharadwaj, Gibson, Zivin and Neilson (2016) use similar methods but studies the impact
of in utero exposure to air pollution in Chile and have better identification because they are
able to control for family fixed effects. They connect data on national standardized test


                                              23
scores at the inidivual level to a dataset on births that allow the authors to match siblings
through a unique mother identifier. Knowing the birth date of each student, they match on
environmental quality at the municipality level for the time when the student was in utero.
They uncover a significant negative correlation between in utero carbon monoxide exposure
and fourth grade math and language test results.
   Using detailed data on siblings born before, during, and after the cleanup in areas near
toxic waste sites in Florida, Persico, Figlio and Roth (2016) study the impact of in utero
exposure to toxic waste. Between 1993 and 2002, the period under study in this paper, the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) cleaned up a large number of so-called Superfund
sites that released neurotoxicants into the air, water, and ground in Florida. The authors
exploit within-family variation in the timing of the births of sibling pairs. Because they have
data on every child born in Florida between 1994 and 2002 and educated in Florida in public
schools between 1996-2012, they are able to trim their data a great deal. In particular, of
the 1.6 million children in the data, they only study the 13,000 families that live within
five miles of the sites and who are exposed to a change in environmental toxicity in the
sense that they have one child before and one child after the cleanup. While findings on
birth outcomes are mixed, the authors find a strong relationship between environmental
toxicity and cognitive development, as measured by test scores, grade repetition, behavioral
incidents, and cognitive disability. Their main estimates suggest that children conceived
before the cleanup wihin 2 miles of the Superfund sites were 7.4 percentage points (40%)
more likely to repeat a grade compared to their own siblings born after the cleanup. They
are 6.6 percentage points more likely to be suspended from school and 10 percentage points
more likely to be diagnosed with a cognitive disability.
   Almond and Mazumder (2011), Almond, Mazumder and van Ewijk (2015) and Greve,
Schultz-Nielsen and Tekin (2015) describe the negative impact of fasting during Ramadan
while pregnant, in the United States, England, and Denmark, respectively. Both papers
exploit the fact that Ramadan, the ninth month of the Islamic (Hijri) calendar moves by 10


                                              24
to 12 days each year in the Gregorian calendar. For example, in 2016 Ramadan started on
June 6, but in 2017 it will start on or around May 27, and in 2018 it will start on or around
May 16. In the years 2006-2008, it started in September, in the years 1996-1997, it started in
January. Almond and Mazumder (2011) use approximately 50,000 birth records for mothers
of Arab ancestery living in Michigan for ther period 1989-2006. The authors also accounnt
for the fact that a quarter of Michigan Arabs are Christians. Perhaps more importantly,
they account for the variation in hours of exposure to fasting generated by the fact that
Muslims are expected to fast during daylight hours, the length of which varies (from 9 to
15) across the year. They also control for a variety of parental characteristics. They uncover
an approximately 20 gram negative effect on birthweights and a reduction in the number of
male births. Turning to educational outcomes, Almond, Mazumder and van Ewijk (2015)
use data from a register of students of Bangladeshi and Pakistani origin, and find that an
overlap of Ramadan with pregnancy is associated with a 0.05-0.08 reduction in test scores
at age 7. Similarly, Greve, Schultz-Nielsen and Tekin (2015) find large negative effects on
the test scores of low-SES Muslim students in Denmark, using administrative data for the
1985-1995 period.
   In a study of the impact of experiencing famine in utero, in infancy, or during early child-
hood, Neelsen and Stratmann (2011) examine the long-term educational and SES outcomes
of individuals who were born in 1940-1942 and were therefore exposed to the 1941-1942
Greek famine. Using individual-level census data from 1971, 1981, 1991, and 2001, they
compare the outcomes of the 1940-1942 birth cohorts to the overall trends in the 1936-1946
cohorts. They find that in urban areas, which were more exposed to the famine than rural
areas, educational attainment is significantly reduced, by as much as 3 months for those
exposed during infancy, corresponding to a 3.3 percentage point drop in upper secondary
school completion.
   Studying a more recent period, Lavy, Schlosser and Shany (2016) use the variation in in
utero micronutrient (iodine, iron, and folic acid) availability created by the immigration of


                                              25
Ethiopian Jews to Israel to find large impacts on educational achievement. In May 1991, the
government of Israel airlifted 14,000 Jews from Ethiopia to Israel. The authors study this
event, often referred to as “Operation Solomon” as a discontinuous change in the micronu-
trient and healthcare environment for infants in utero at the time of the airlift. Because the
airlift was covert action by the Israel Defense Forces and kept secret by military censorship,
selection concerns are arguably not too important in this context. To isolate the impact
of the change on in utero development, they compare pregancies in the first and second
trimester with pregnancies in the third trimester at the time. The authors follow all 600
children born after the airlift in Israel but incepted in Ethiopia in healthcare and educational
data. They find that exposure to better environmental conditions earlier in a pregnancy lead
to significantly better educational outcomes, higher high school graduation rates and better
testscores, especially among girls. Students who were already in Israel in the first trimester
are 12 percentage points (50%) more likely to obtain a high school Baccalaureate diploma
than students who arrived to Israel in the third trimester, and they are also 12 percentage
points less likely to repeat a grade and 7 percentage points less likely to drop out of high
school. Similarly to other studies, they find no differences in birthweight.
   Using a genetic instrument, von Hinke Kessler Scholder, Wehby, Lewis and Zuccolo (2014)
studies the educational consequences of in utero exposure to alcohol. Exploiting variation in
the presence of two different genotypes of an alcohol metabolism gene, the author finds in the
Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) that among a large sample of
children born in the Avon region of England, there was a strong negative association between
alcohol consumption and schooling outcomes.
   Using administrative data from Sweden, Nilsson (2016) finds that prenatal exposure to
alcohol consumption damages cognitive and non-cognitive ability, educational attainment,
and labor market outcomes; effects are mostly through prenatal health. Using administrative
data to follow all children born between 1964 and 1972 in Sweden, the author exploits a
policy that increased the availability of strong beer products both in general and to under


                                              26
21 people in particular in two regions between November 1967 and July 1968. The author
first confirms that the policy change did indeed lead to large increases in alcohol sales in the
affected regions and then goes on to estimate its impact using a triple differences (difference-
in-difference-in-differences) strategy, comparing children of under/above 21 mothers, regions
affected/not affected by the policy change, before/after the policy change. He finds in 1990-
2004 administrative data that adults exposed in utero to maternal alcohol consumption had
substantially worse labor market outcomes, mediated by cognitive and non-cognitive ability,
and education. Effects are stronger for men than for women. On average, exposed cohorts
earn 24% less, and there is an 8.3 percentage point increase in the share of individuals with
no labor income. Schooling is reduced on average by 0.32 years, and the share of individuals
in the bottom third of the cognitive ability score distribution increases by 27% (16% for
non-cognitive ability).
   In recent contributions, Aizer, Stroud and Buka (2015), Black, Devereux and Salvanes
(2016), and Persson and Rossin-Slater (2016) study the impact of maternal stress during
pregnancy, in the United States, Norway, and Sweden, respectively. The evidence appears
mixed: using variation in maternal cortisol levels, Aizer, Stroud and Buka (2015) find nega-
tive effects on cognition, health, and educational attainment; exploiting bereavement events
in the mother’s family, Black, Devereux and Salvanes (2016) find small negative effects on
birth outcomes but no adverse effects on education and labor market outcomes in Norway,
while Persson and Rossin-Slater (2016) uncover large impacts on later-life mental health in
Sweden.
   The data in Aizer, Stroud and Buka (2015) come from the National Collaborative Peri-
natal Project (NCPP) which collected data for pregnancies between 1959 and 1965. They
focus on the 1,100 pregnancies in Boston and Providence for which children were followed
into adulthood. To measure stress, they use data on cortisol levels in mothers which has
been linked to stress. Given obvious concerns about cross-sectional endogeneity of cortisol
levels to observed economic status and important unobserved characteristics, they exploit


                                              27
variation across pregnancies for siblings born to the same mother. They first establish that
this variation in cortisol levels follows changes in the economic status of the mother. They
then show that cortisol levels are associated with children’s outcomes in a highly nonlinear
way. Essentially only very high levels of cortisol are predictive of lower IQ and fewer years
of education. They find no significant impact on birth outcomes.
   In two closely related studies Black, Devereux and Salvanes (2016) and Persson and
Rossin-Slater (2016) use very detailed administrative data matched across generations from
Norway and Sweden, respectively. Both studies exploit a death in the mother’s family as
a shock to maternal stress levels and present various empirical strategies to account for
the possibly nonrandom nature of exposure to death during a pregnancy. Importantly, they
compare children who are exposed to a death in the mother’s family while in utero to children
who are exposed to the same shock shortly after birth. Black, Devereux and Salvanes (2016)
use the universe of Norwegian birth and death records for the last 50 years which they connect
to comprehensive administrative data on education, families, labor market outcomes, taxes,
and earnings. IQ data come from military records. There are negative but small impacts
on birth outcomes. However, there is no evidence of persistent impacts on important long-
term outcomes, such as education completed, employment, earnings, or cognitive ability.
Persson and Rossin-Slater (2016) use the universe of Swedish birth and death records for
the last 40 years which they connect to comprehensive administrative data on inpatient and
prescription drug claims. They find large impacts on birth outcomes and later-life takeup of
ADHD, anti-anxiety, and depression medications.
   In recent work on in utero exposure to war, which is a mixture of displacement, stress,
and hunger, Lee (2014) finds that the educational attainment and socioeconomic status of
South Korean cohorts that were in utero during the worst part of the Korean War (1951
birth cohort) were negatively affected relative to general trends in these outcomes. The 1951
birth cohort has significantly lower educational attainment, is less likely to have professional
employment, and these effects are larger for individuals who were in utero in areas more


                                              28
affected by the war. There is also some evidence of heterogeneity by gender and pregnancy
stage.


2.2.6    Summary: Other in-utero exposures

The studies discussed in this section suggest that a range of different in-utero exposures
(e.g, nuclear fallout, deficient nutrition, maternal stress) can have long lasting effects on
individuals. These effects are often not mediated through birthweight or even early-life
health but perhaps through latent cognitive ability. The wide variety of exposures that
have been found to have substantial impacts on later-life outcomes suggests that the in-
utero environment is very important both for early development and later-life economic
outcomes. A key open question is how much improving the in-utero environment through
various interventions can affect later-life outcomes in the US or other developed countries.
In other words, it is not yet clear whether we can generalize from the large shocks that are
typically studied in this literature to more conventional variation in the in-utero environment.


2.3      Fetal origins: Birthweight

2.3.1    Introduction

A literature related to fetal origins studies that examine the longer-term impact of exposure
to various negative health shocks considers birthweight as a proxy for the gestational environ-
ment and the resulting health endowment. We choose to consider this literature separately
for three reasons: (1) there are many studies interested in the impact of birtweight as the
explanatory health measure rather than in the impact of in utero shocks, (2) several of the
studies focused on in utero exposures show that birthweight can be relatively unaffected by
exposures that impact later life outcomes, and (3) the near exlusive reliance of birthweight
studies on twin fixed effects represents a methodological approach different from in utero
exposure studies that rely primarily on variation across cohorts or across geographic areas.



                                              29
   This subsection is based on a systematic review which started with searching the eco-
nomics literature on Google Scholar using the search terms "birthweight" OR "birth
weight" for years 2005-2017. Our search returned an initial 128 results, however we only
consider 15 studies that are relevant to our review. These need to consider the impact of
birthweight on economic outcomes, rather than the other way around, examine non-health
endpoints (education or economic outcomes), and be done in the US or other developed
countries. In addition to the Google Scholar search, we added a small number of studies
that were referenced by the studies we found through the systematic search but did not
themselves come up in the search (usually because they did not contain the keywords in
their title). Mindful of the slow publication process and the fast pace of some of the liter-
ature covered here, we also included relevant NBER Working Papers from 2015-2017 from
the Children, Health, and Labor Studies programs.

2.3.2   Summary of methods

The empirical economics literature that connects birthweight, which is thought to be asso-
ciated with in utero nutritional environment to health, educational, and economic outcomes
relies almost exclusively on twin fixed effects estimation strategies. The identification prob-
lem that this strategy is supposed to solve is that birthweight is expected to be strongly
correlated with family background, and other observed and unobserved characteristics that
are also correlated with children’s outcomes. The idea is that once these observed and
unobserved family background characteristics are controlled for, we can consider variation
in birthweight within twin pairs to be reflective of randomly arising variation in in utero
nutrition and environment.
   Twins have been used to study a variety of causal effects in economics, for example, the
returns to schooling. In most other contexts, the credibility of the twin research design is
questionable because even within twin pairs there will be omitted variable bias that can
be blown up by the fixed effect specification, making estimates more, not less biased. For
example, in returns to schooling estimates, comparing a twin with more and a twin with less
schooling, it is likely that the twin getting more schooling is different in a number of ways,
most importantly potential earnings, from the twin getting less schooling.
   However, in the context of studies of birthweight, twin studies might be valid, consid-
ering that birthweight is measured at the very beginning of life. The main concern is that
birthweight is correlated with or proxies for unmeasured endowments at the beginning of life,
and it is the effect of those endowments rather than birthweight that the studies attribute to
birthweight. Another potential concern is that parental actions, for example in the form of
educational investments, may reinforce or counteract birth endowments. Variation in birth-
weight within twin pairs turns out to be quite substantial. For example, in the sample of all
US twins used in Almond, Chay and Lee (2005) the median difference is 220 grams, in the
sample of all Norwegian twins used in Black, Devereux and Salvanes (2007) the difference
between the medians is 310 grams. To put these in context, the mean birthweight is around


                                              33
2,500 grams and the standard deviation is around 600 in each of the studies.


2.3.3      Studies

Using data from the UK’s National Child Development Survey (NCDS), Currie and Hyson
(1999) find that low birth weight (LBW) is associated in the long term with education,
self-reported health, employment, and wages for both low-SES and high-SES children.1 The
authors find large and significant negative associations between LBW and the number of
O-Level examinations passed at age 16, self-reported health, and employment outcomes
measured at ages 23 and 33, controlling for various measures of family background. The
authors examine the interaction between SES and LBW, but find that for the most part
these interactions are not statistically significant. They conclude that the effect exists for
children of low-SES and high-SES backgrounds as well. This study is important in the
development of the literature because it represents an early attempt to study the long-term
consequences of in utero conditions. However, causality is hard to evaluate as the approach is
essentially cross-sectional, comparing LBW and non-LBW children, only controlling for SES.
There are possibly many unobserved factors that bias the estimates if we want to interpret
them as causal.
      Behrman and Rosenzweig (2004) collect data on monozygotic twins in Minnesota and
find that increasing birthweight would increase educational attainment at most birthweights
and would have positive labor market payoffs for LBW infants. The authors identified same-
sex twins in the Minnesota Twin Registry (MTR) which contains birth records for all twins
born in the state between 1936 and 1955. They sent out questionnaires to about 6,000 same-
sex twin pairs but estimation relies on female same-sex twin pairs with enough information
provided on returned questionnaires, so there twin sample size is only 800. Their estimates
are derived from variation in birthweight within twin pairs. In addition to twin fixed effects,
they also include some other control variables. They uncover large effects on education and

                                                     34
wages.
   Analyzing a sample of Australian identical twins in survey data, Miller, Mulvey and
Martin (2005) find that birthweight has no impact on schooling levels and only a small impact
of earnings. They estimate that a 100 gram increase in birthweight would be associated with
a 1.4% increase in earnings.
   Using data on births in California, Currie and Moretti (2007) conclude that birthweight
is intergenerationally transmitted, the transmission is stronger for mothers in higher-poverty
areas, and contributes to the transmission of SES. Using birth records for all infants born in
California between 1989 and 2001, the authors attempt to link mothers’ birth records from
the 1970-1974 period, which is only possible for mothers also born in California. Their sample
contains about 640,000 birth records. To study intergenerational transmission of birthweight,
they regress the birthweight of children on the birthweight of their mothers, adjusting for
some SES control variables. They are also able to include “grandmother fixed effects”, or in
other words, rely on estimates within families. The intergenerational persistence of LBW is
substantial, women whose mothers were LBW are 50% more likely to be LBW, controlling
for SES. The transmission is found to be stronger for poor women. They also find effects on
which zipcodes women end up living in (a proxy for SES) and their educational attainment.
   Black, Devereux and Salvanes (2007) use within-twin methods and comprehensive data
from Norway to establish that LBW has negative long-term consequences for IQ, education,
and earnings. The researchers rely on rich administrative data from Norway that includes all
births between 1967 and 1997 connected with education, family, tax, and earnings registers
for the years 1986 to 2002. Military records give information on the IQ of all men. In order
to study twins, the authors connect a survey of twins that contains information on zygosity.
Birthweight is found to significantly effect adult IQ, education, earnings, and the birthweight
of the next generation. For example, a 10% increase in birthweight is associated with a 1%
higher probability of high school graduation and with 1% higher earnings.
   Oreopoulos, Stabile, Walld and Roos (2008) use data from Manitoba and twin and sibling


                                              35
methods to show that poor infant health, as measured by birthweight and other measures, is
associated with elevated mortality up to age 17, and also with lower educational attainment
and worse labor force outcomes. The authors match a dataset that contains birth records
for all infants born in Manitoba in the 1978-1985 period with administrative records on
education, later-life outpatient care, and social program uptake. Infant health, measured by
birthweight and some other indicators, is found to be strongly associated with educational
and labor force outcomes.
   In another twin study, Royer (2009) finds that LBW is related to educational attainment
and intergenerational transmission of LBW. The author relies on a dataset that contains
birth records for twins born in California between 1960 and 1982 and a separate dataset, the
Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Birth Cohort (ECLS-B), a nationally representative
survey that follows infants born in 2001. Her estimation strategy relies on variation in
birth weight within pairs of twins, and finds statistically significant but small long-term
associations between birthweight and education. There is also evidence of intergenerational
transmission of LBW. However, the impact of birthweight on educational outcomes is small:
a 200 gram increase in birthweight would be associated with a 0.03-0.04 year increase in
schooling.
   Nakamuro, Uzuki and Inui (2013) study Japanese twins using a web-based survey. They
find that lower birthweight is associated with worse academic achievement at age 15, but
has no statistically significant impact on further educational attainment and earnings.
   Using merged data on the birthweight and school records of all children born between
1992 and 2002 in Florida, Figlio, Guryan, Karbownik and Roth (2014) document the effects
of poor neonatal health in the form LBW on educational outcomes. Similarly to the majority
of other studies in the literature the authors use twin and sibling fixed effects to account for
unobserved family-specific characteristics that could bias the results. They find that a 10%
increase in birthweight is associated with a one-twentieth of one standard deviation increase
in test scores. Using data from a longitudinal follow-up of the sample used in Royer (2009)


                                              36
to account for the relationship between test scores and years of schooling, they estimate the
association between birtweight and years of schooling to be almost exactly the same as in
Royer (2009): a 200 gram increase in birthweight would be associated with a 0.03-0.04 year
increase in schooling.
   Chatterji, Kim and Lahiri (2014) use data for years 1997-2007 from the PSID and combine
sibling fixed effects with an attempt to instrument for birthweight with fetal growth rate.
They find relatively large effects, a 10% increase in birthweight being associated with a
0.036 standard deviation increase in childhood math test scores. They find that this effect
is concentrated among those with LBW (below 2.5kg).
   Using all birth records for years 1978-2006 from Taiwan, Xie, Chou and Liu (2016)
report sibling and twin fixed effects estimates of the impact of birthweight on short-run child
health outcomes, medium-run academic outcomes and adult health outcomes, and long-run
schooling outcomes. In the short run, a 10% increase in birthweight is associated with an 11
deaths per 1,000 birth reduction in mortality for siblings (8.7 for male twins, 6.8 for female
twins). While in the medium run, there is a positive association between birthweight and
adult health, there is no significant relationship between graduating from a top high school or
entering private university. A 10% increase in birthweight is associated with a 0.5% increase
in the chance of entering private university. A 10% increase in birthweight is associated with
a one percentage point increase in the probability of completing college for sibling pairs, but
not for male or female twins. Finally, there is a positive association between birthweight and
completed years of schooling that matches the Royer (2009) estimate: a 200 gram increase
in birthweight would be associated with a 0.03-0.04 year increase in schooling. In a related
study Lin, Liu and Chou (2007) find substantial heterogeneity: more educated parents are
able to offset about 40% of the negative effect of low birthweight in Taiwan.
   Using universal data on Chilean births between 1992 and 2002 and universal data on
school test scores up to high school graduation, Bharadwaj, Eberhard and Neilson (2017)
follow the evolution of the association between children’s achievement and birthweight. Their


                                              37
findings are seemingly contradictory: negative estimates of the relationship between birth-
weight and test scores are persistent over the course of education if twin fixed effects are
included but are declining in magnitude if sibling fixed effects are included. The authors
argue that this reflects parental investments and that in particular parents invest more in
a less healthy child but do not differentiate across twins. Quantitatively, their results are
about the same as the results in Figlio, Guryan, Karbownik and Roth (2014), a 10% increase
in birthweight is associated with a one-twentieth of one standard deviation increase in test
scores.
   Bharadwaj, Lundborg and Rooth (2017) use universal administrative data on Swedish
twins born 1926-1958, to study the association between birthweigh and education, permanent
income, and other outcomes. They find that a 10% increase in birthweight is associated
with a 7-10 percentage point increase in the probability of high school completion and a 9%
increase in income between ages 25-33. Interestingly, they find fading effects on income for
males at later ages (above 50) but not for females.
   In a rare study of high birthweight, Cesur and Kelly (2010) find that we may be concerned
about birthweight being too high rather than too low for some individuals. Defining high
birthweight as above 4,500 grams and using data from the NLSY and the ECLS-K, the
authors find that having high birthweight is associated with lower test scores.


2.3.4     Summary

Recent studies on the impact of birthweight on educational outcomes find remarkably similar
quantitative estimates. A 10% or 200 gram increase in birthweight could be associated with
an approximately one-twentieth of one standard deviation increase in test scores, a 0.03-
0.04 year increase in schooling and a 1% increase in high school graduation rates. To the
extent that birthweight proxies for the in-utero environment, this suggests that in-utero
interventions that can impact birthweight could have substantial returns. The three main
caveats are that (1) relatively large increases in birthweight are needed for these impacts


                                             38
in educational outcomes, (2) birthweight may be correlated with the in-utero environment
but not be the actual cause of educational outcomes, which would suggest that increasing
birthweight itself would not be sufficient to improve educational outcomes, and (3) these
estimates typically rely on twin fixed effects designs which may be problematic is there if
large non-random variation in birthweight within twin pairs.


2.4     Child health and nutrition

2.4.1   Introduction

This section discusses studies linking postnatal early life physical health and nutrition to later
life outcomes. Following a methodological discussion, we cover the studies in this literature
in two parts. We first discuss research that uses geographic variation and policy changes to
study the historical disease environment of the US. Then we turn to studies that focus on
modern data and policies.
   This subsection is based on a systematic review which started with searching the eco-
nomics literature on Google Scholar using the search terms "child health" OR "childhood
health" OR "early-life health" OR "early life health" for years 2005-2017. Our
search returned an initial 121 results, however we only consider 13 studies that are relevant
to our review. These need to consider the impact of child health and nutrition on economic
outcomes, rather than the other way around, examine non-health endpoints (education or
economic outcomes), and be done in the US or other developed countries. In addition to
the Google Scholar search, we added a small number of studies that were referenced by
the studies we found through the systematic search but did not themselves come up in the
search (usually because they did not contain the keywords in their title). Mindful of the
slow publication process and the fast pace of some of the literature covered here, we also
included relevant NBER Working Papers from 2015-2017 from the Children, Health, and
Labor Studies programs.

2.4.2   Summary of methods

Compared to the in utero exposure literature that relies on geographic and time variation
generated by exposure events (e.g., pandemics, nuclear events) and the birtweight literature
that relies on twin fixed effets strategies, identification in the child health literature is much
more difficult for a number of reasons. Measurement of child health after birth is challenging:
while the date and place of birth (essential for in utero exposure studies) and birtweight
(essential for birthweight studies) are well-documented in birth records and administrative
data, child health is not universally documented in the United States. Hence US studies
need to rely on health measures reported in survey data (e.g., NHIS, HRS, NLSY79) for
the most part. Moreover, these self-reported measures are typically adults’ recalls of their
childhood health in surveys with the exception of studies that rely on height which the
authors of these studies take as an objective measure of childhood health. Aside from
studies using historical data, quasiexperimental variation in child health is hard to come
by. Therefore the studies in this literature are best thought of as establishing statistical
associations rather than causal relationships. The exceptions are studies of the historical
disease environment in the Southern United States and the studies of the consequences of
the improvement of healthcare for African Americans, but these have their own limitations
because of data availability. A common methodology used in the historical studies relies on
two sources of variation: geographic variation in pre-intervention rates of the condition and
temporal variation created by the intervention in question. The key assumptions are that
pre-intervention rates are not correlated with unobserved characteristics of areas and that
the timing of the intervention is not correlated with other changes.

2.4.3   Studies: Historical data

In the early 20th century, diseases that today we see in developing countries were endemic
in the American South and nutritional deficiencies were a problem in the United States
as well. Bleakley (2007), Bleakley (2010), and Barreca (2010) study this historic disease
environment, focusing on hookworm disease and malaria. Feyrer, Politi and Weil (2016) and
Niemesh (2015) study nutritional deficiencies, focusing on iodine and iron deficiency.
   In Bleakley (2007), the long-term impact of the eradication of hookworm disease in the
American South around 1910 is found to have increased school enrollment, attendance, and
literacy, leading to long-term income gains, possibly through an increase to the returns
to schooling. This study exploits variation across geographic areas in the levels of hook-
worm infection prior to the eradication campaign, and shows that areas with higher levels of
hookworm infection, that is, areas that experienced a larger change during the eradication
campaign, saw greater increases in school enrollment, attendance, and literacy. Following co-
horts who were in school during the eradication efforts, the author finds substantially higher
earnings for those more affected by the eradication. To put the paper’s quantitative esti-
mates in context, the author calculates that comparing a cohort with no childhood exposure
to a cohort with full childhood exposure to hookworm, a one standard deviation difference
in hookworm infection rates across areas is associated with an 11% wage difference. The
impact of the eradication of hookworm across cohorts could have increased adult wages by
as much as 43%. Importantly, much of this wage effect came through increases in returns
to schooling: hookworm exposure was associated with an around 50% drop in the returns
to schooling. The author attributes 22% of the North-South income gap in the period to
hookworm infection in the South.
   Bleakley (2010) finds that in utero and postnatal exposure to malaria in the United States
was associated with lower levels of educational attainment and higher levels of poverty among
those exposed to malaria. Using a research design very similar to the hookworm eradication
study, relying on pre-eradication variation across US states in malaria prevalence and the


                                             43
beginning of eradication campaigns around 1920, the paper shows that individuals born in
states and cohorts affected by malaria experienced greater gains in socioeconomic status. To
summarize his results, the author calculates that childhood malaria infection could reduce
adult income by approximately 50%.
   Barreca (2010) also studies the impact of exposure to malaria in the year of birth. In
addition to using malaria eradication as a source of variation, the author introduces an
instrumental variable strategy which uses temperature, a factor in how hospitable the envi-
ronment is to malaria, as an instrument for malaria. He uncovers large negative effects of
early life malaria exposure on educational attainment and earnings. Exposure to an environ-
ment with 10 additional malaria deaths per 100,000 is associated with 13% lower income (not
statistically significant), 0.4 fewer years of education, and a 5.1% reduction in the probability
of graduating from high school. The author estimates that malaria exposure can account for
25% of the difference in educational attainment across exposed and non-exposed states.
   In historical work using data from the US, Feyrer, Politi and Weil (2016) and Niemesh
(2015) study the impact of decreasing iodine and iron deficiency, respetively. Feyrer, Politi
and Weil (2016) follow a strategy similar to the hookworm and malaria studies in exploiting
two sources of variation: geographic variation in pre-intervention rates of iodine deficiency
and the 1924 introduction of iodized salt which creates a cohort discontinuity. To establish
the pre-intervention rates of iodine deficiency in different areas of the US, they use data from
the World War I draft on simple goiter, a condition caused by iodine deficiency. To study
impacts on cognitive ability, they use data from the World War II draft on test scores. They
uncover large — 15 point for affected regions, implying 3.5 point nationwide — differential
increases in IQ for men more affected by the introduction of iodized salt.
   Niemesh (2015) uses a similar strategy, but focuses on iron deficiency. The intervention
in his case is the 1943 mandate to fortify bread with iron to reduce iron deficiency. Areas
that had lower levels of iron consumption before the intervention and were therefore more
impacted by the internvention experienced faster increases in school enrollment and income.


                                               44
By 1970, adults who were more affected by the introduction of iron fortification experienced
larger income gains. The author estimates that the inexpensive iron fortification program
increased incomes at the individual level by 5.25% for those who were affected because they
previously suffered from iron deficiency, which came through a 1.82% increase in the number
of weeks worked (labor supply) and an implied 3.43% increase in hourly wage (productivity).
Part of this came through schooling: a one standard deviation difference in iron consumption
in this sample is associated with a 1 percentage point difference in school enrollment. In
addition to these contemporaneous impacts, the author estimates the individual long-term
impact of reducing iron deficiency for children through exposure to the program for all of
childhood. Children who were affected because they previously suffered from iron deficiency,
could have experienced a 2% income gain on average.


2.4.4      Summary: Historical data

The impact of different diseases and defficiencies is hard to compare with each other. The
studies discussed in this section suggest that historically, now eradicated diseases and nutri-
tional deficiencies had large economic impacts in the US. If similar diseases and nutritional
deficiencies were identified today, government policies to combat them could have large re-
turns. However, these seem less relevant today than focusing on overall child health discussed
in the next section.


2.4.5      Studies: Modern data

Case, Fertig and Paxson (2005) analyze data from the NCDS and find that childhood health
has a negative impact on educational attainment and SES in adulthood.2 The authors
find large and significant negative associations between childhood health and the number
of O-Level examiniations passed at age 16, self-reported health, and employment outcomes
measured at ages 23, 33, and 42 controlling for various measures of family background.
  2
      For more details on the NCDS, see Section 2.2.5.



                                                     45
Relative to an average of 2 O-Levels passed in the sample, a chronic condition at age 7 is
associated with 0.3 fewer O-Levels passed, an if the chronic condition is still present at age
16, it is associated with an additional 0.2 fewer O-Levels passed. Children who are born
with low birthweight pass 0.5 fewer O-Levels on average. An additional chronic condition
at age 16 is associated with a 4-5% lower probability of employment as an adult. These
are cross-sectional results in the sense that no exogenous shocks to childhood health are
exploited. Therefore these results are perhaps best interpreted as establishing associations
rather than causality.
   In a series of studies, Anne Case and Christina Paxson have documented the association
between height, taken as a proxy for early-life health, and later-life outcomes. Case and
Paxson (2008a) provide evidence that height is associated with a variety of outcomes mea-
suring adults’ height and wellbeing in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). This finding
is again cross-sectional, the essence is a correlation between height on the one hand and
educational attainment and occupational choice on the other hand, controlling for childhood
SES. Late-life cognitive ability is also found to be strongly correlated with height, controlling
for early-life SES. In its reliance on the HRS, a survey of older Americans, this study also
demonstrates that it is hard to come by reliable measures of childhood health connected
with reliable data on SES in the US. Extending these findings, Case and Paxson (2008b)
uses data from the UK and the US and finds that a lot of the association between height
and labor markets outcomes is explained by the association between height and cognitive
test scores, evidence of the association between children’s health and human capital accu-
mulation. The data come from the NCDS discussed above in Section 2.2.5, as well as the
British Cohort Study (BCS), and the 1979 National Longitudinal Study of Youth (NLSY79).
The BCS has followed all individuals living in Great Britain born in the week of April 5,
1970. The NLSY79 is a well-known American survey that has followed 13,000 Americans
who were originally entered into the survey as youth in 1979. In another extension, Case
and Paxson (2010), using data from the NLSY79 survey, presents further evidence using


                                               46
height data of the relationship between childhood health and later-life SES. This study is
also able to control for mother fixed effects, alleviating some of the concerns about unob-
served family background biasing estimates. A simple quantitative summary of the Case
and Paxson findings on height and earnings that is repeated throughout these papers is that
moving the height of men from the 25th to the 75th percentile (an increase by 4 inches)
is associated with a 9-10% increase in earnings. In related work, Case and Paxson (2009)
analyze data reported in the HRS on cognitive function in old age connected with childhood
disease environment and find significant association.
   Smith (2009) finds that poor childhood health has a quantitatively large effect on family
income, household wealth, individual earnings, and labor supply, but not on education.
Relying on a representative sample of 5,000 families in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics
(PSID), the author is able to control for family fixed effects, alleviating the concern that
instead of childhood health per se it is unmeasured family background and SES factors that
drive much of the results in other studies. The estimation exploits only variation in chidlhood
health within sibling pairs, but unfortunately still relies on retrospective recall of childhood
health by adults which can be problematic both because of measurement error and because
the causality between poor reported childhood health and adult economic status might be
reversed: it might be that poorer individuals recall being less healthy as children because
they are poorer, rather than them being poorer now because they were actually less healthy.
   Fletcher and Lehrer (2011) argue that genetic variation within families can be useful to
study the impact of mental health outcomes on educational outcomes. In a departure from
a literature that attempted to measure childhood health from adults’ recall in surveys, they
rely on the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent (Add Health) which collected genetic
information on participants in addition to data on their health and educational outcomes.
Estimation is done within a family fixed effects framework using genetic variation as an
instrumental variable for health. The key observation is that even within families, variation
across siblings in health can be correlated with unobserved factors, biasing estimates. The


                                              47
authors argue that using genetic variation as an instrument is helpful to arrive at causal
estimates of adolescent health on educational outcomes given this possible within-family
endogeneity.
   In a study of adolescent health, Lundborg, Nilsson and Rooth (2014) show from universal
Swedish registers that adolescent health is also strongly associated with adult labor market
outcomes. Several major challenges to the earlier literature relying on representative surveys
of the US population are solved by the universal Swedish register data exploited by this study.
The size of the data is much larger, allowing for improved precision. The quality of the data
is much better, not relying on self-reported measures and measures based on recall, reducing
measurement error and concerns about reverse causality (along the lines that poorer people
recall having worse health as children). The data is much broader, which means that the
authors don’t need to rely on one-dimensional measures like height to proxy for childhood
health. The authors are also able to include sibling and twin fixed effects and link the
adolescent health data with later life economic outcomes. They find large labor market
effects and also find that mental health conditions are the most important. For example,
using a global health measure and controlling for a variety of observable characteristics, such
as ability, moving someone from perfect health to health just above the level required for
military service is associated with a 10-15% earnings penalty.


2.4.6   Summary: Modern data

We take the literature on the relationship between child physical health and longer-term
outcomes using modern data to suggest that there is a strong relationship between child-
hood health and education and economic outcomes, but note that it is not obvious what
interventions would be beneficial. We interpret the first group of studies that we discussed
in this section—Case, Fertig and Paxson (2005), Case and Paxson (2008a), Case and Paxson
(2008b), Case and Paxson (2009), Case and Paxson (2010)—as providing evidence of a strong
association between childhood health and longer-term outcomes, rather than describing a


                                              48
causal pathway. They clearly show that individuals who were less healthy as children or are
less tall get less education and earn less. However, these studies don’t rely on any identifying
variation in health or height, which means that omitted factors could be important. The
other main limitation of this group of studies is that they rely on surveys, so measurement
error could be large. Nevertheless these studies are important in the literature connecting
childhood health to longer-term outcomes because they establish an important association
without relying on administrative data that is not available in the US. Chay, Guryan and
Mazumder (2009) and Chay, Guryan and Mazumder (2014) stand apart from the rest of the
studies because of their focus on the Black-White gap and hospital desegregation. An im-
portant contribution of their studies is showing that actual government policies can impact
childhood health and longer-term outcomes in the US. It is plausible that improving hospital
care for low-SES children could still yield gains in longer-term education and labor market
outcomes.


2.5     Child mental health

2.5.1   Introduction

A more recent literature has started examining whether in addition to physical health and
nutrition, childhood mental health can also be linked to educational achievement and adult
outcomes. The measurement of childhood mental health is even more difficult than the
measurement of childhood physical health and is likely to be more affected by variation and
potential endogeneity in diagnostic criteria and diagnosis rates. Nevertheless policy-makers
and researchers have become more concerned with mental health conditions, so in this section
we examine what has been learned about the long-term impact of childhood mental health.
   This subsection is based on a systematic review which started with searching the eco-
nomics literature on Google Scholar using the search terms "mental health" OR "psychological"
OR "depression" OR "ADHD" OR "behavioral") AND ("child" OR "childhood" OR "youth"
OR "adolescent") for years 2005-2017. Our search returned an initial 55 results, however

                                              49
we only consider 16 studies that are relevant to our review. These need to consider the im-
pact of children’s mental health on economic outcomes, rather than the other way around,
examine non-health endpoints (education or economic outcomes), and be done in the US or
other developed countries. In addition to the Google Scholar search, we added a small num-
ber of studies that were referenced by the studies we found through the systematic search
but did not themselves come up in the search (usually because they did not contain the
keywords in their title). Mindful of the slow publication process and the fast pace of some of
the literature covered here, we also included relevant NBER Working Papers from 2015-2017
from the Children, Health, and Labor Studies programs.


2.5.2   Summary of methods

The majority of the studies in the children’s mental health literature relies on surveys, most
commonly the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79), the National Longitudi-
nal Survey of Children and Youth (NLSCY) from Canada, and the National Longitudinal
Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). Most of the studies try to exploit the panel
structures of these surveys and most also rely on family fixed effects, in order to try to
account for unobserved family-level confounders by only comparing children in the same
family. As already discussed in other sections, while the inclusion of family fixed effects can
be important in order to account for some the obvious confounders, it is unable to account
for individual-level confounders that will likely vary even within families. Some articles in
this literature use administrative data from outside the US, from Canada (Currie, Stabile,
Manivong and Roos, 2010) and Denmark (Dalsgaard, Nielsen and Simonsen, 2014). Admin-
istrative data can allow for much bigger samples and more accurate measurement of both
mental health and the outcomes of interest, such as education or crime. In addition to panel
data combined with family fixed effects, a few studies use other identification strategies, such
as variation across physicians in ADHD treatment (Dalsgaard, Nielsen and Simonsen, 2014)
and discontinuity in treatment assignment (Cuellar and Dave, 2015). Another idea, used


                                              50
by Ding, Lehrer, Rosenquist and Audrain-McGovern (2009), is to rely on genetic markers
that are taken to be predetermined and as a valid instrument for the actual manifestation
of mental health conditions. In our view, for the most part, the studies of the impact of
mental health on children’s development should be seen as describing associations rather
than causal relationships.

2.5.3   Studies

In a pair of studies, Currie and Stabile (2006) and Currie and Stabile (2009) use data from
longitudinal surveys from the US and Canada to argue that childhood mental problems can
have substantial negative impacts on test scores and educational attainment, possibly a larger
impact than physical health. Their American data comes from the National Longitudinal
Survey of Youth (NLSY79) which has followed 12,000 youth from 1979 onwards and the
children of female respondents in the original survey sample from 1986 onwards. They
relate hyperactivity scores measured between 1990 and 1994 to children’s outcomes in the
later waves of the survey. Their Canadian data comes from the National Longitudinal
Survey of Children and Youth (NLSCY) which began in 1994. They relate mental health
screener scores measured in 1994 to children’s outcomes in the later waves of the survey.
Both studies are able to control for family fixed effects using siblings. Currie and Stabile
(2006) find that Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) has a substantial negative
impact on test scores and educational attainment; they claim that mental health can be more
important than physical health. For example, while having a score at the 90th percentile
of the hyperactivity score distribution increases the probability of grade repetition by 6-7%,
having a chronic condition like asthma does not change the probability of grade repetition.
Currie and Stabile (2009) extend the findings to some other mental problems, such as conduct
disorders and anxiety/depression, though ADHD has the largest and most consistent effect.
   Fletcher and Wolfe (2008) attempt to extend the findings in Currie and Stabile (2006)
to older children and broader measures of human capital. They rely on the National Longi-
tudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) which followed adolescents in the 1990s.
They rely on retrospective self-reports of young adults about whether they had ADHD as
children. They find that even though OLS estimates of the impact of ADHD are large and
negative, they are not robust to the inclusion of sibling fixed effects. On the other hand,
in follow up work, Fletcher (2014) connects ADHD with labor markets outcomes and finds
that childhood ADHD is associated with large reductions in employment and earnings. This


                                             54
study also relies on Add Health data and retrospective self-reports of ADHD diagnosis, but
for labor market outcomes the large and negative coefficients survive the inclusion of fam-
ily fixed effects. The author claims that childhood ADHD is associated with a staggering
10-14% reduction in adult employment and 33% reduction in earnings.
   In related work, using the same data from Add Health but studying adolescent depression,
Fletcher (2008) shows that there is negative correlation between adolescent depression and
various measures of educational attainment (high school completion, college enrollment,
quality of college), but only for females. Using the same data but now controlling for sibling
fixed effects, Fletcher (2010) also finds large negative effects of adolescent depression on
measures of educational attainment.
   Given that ADHD seems to be related to later-life outcomes, a possible policy prescription
would be increasing access to treatment. However, examining the impact of improved access
to ADHD medications through expanded insurance coverage for prescription drugs in Que-
bec, Currie, Stabile and Jones (2014) find little improvement in children’s medium-term and
long-term academic outcomes. As with their previous studies of ADHD in Canada, the data
come from the NLSCY and the authors exploit the panel structure of the survey combined
with the variation generated by the policy change. Since the policy that increased access to
ADHD medications was only introduced in Quebec and only starting in 1996, the authors
are able to arrive at estimates of the impact of increased access on use of these medications
and on academic outcomes, comparing the post-1996 period in Quebec to earlier years and
to children living in other provinces. While the use of ADHD medications is found to have
increased as they became more accessible, academic outcomes (test scores, grade repetition)
did not improve and possibly even worsened. Looking at the same issue in Denmark, but
exploiting variation in physicians’ propensity to prescribe, Dalsgaard, Nielsen and Simonsen
(2014) document decreased criminal behavior as a result of medication use in ADHD. This
study is able to use hospital and crime register data for the universe of Danish children born
in the 1990s. The obvious missing piece is an examination of educational outcomes: the


                                             55
reduced form relationship between ADHD medication use and crime is hard to understand
without considering the role of education.
   Ding, Lehrer, Rosenquist and Audrain-McGovern (2009) use variation in genetic markers
to identify the impact of ADHD, depression, and obesity on academic achievement. Their
data comes from the Georgetown Adolescent Tobacco Research (GATOR) study, which was
a small survey of students in five Northern Virginia high schools between 1999-2003. In
addition to questionnaires, the original study collected DNA samples which allowed the
authors to connect some genetic markers to ADHD, depression, and obesity. They use
genetic markers to instrument for health conditions. Depression and obesity are found to
have substantial negative effects on academic achievement, but ADHD does not seem to be
related to academic achievement in their data.
   Aizer (2008) studies the spillovers of ADD on peers using data from the Early Childhood
Longitudinal Survey – Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K). This dataset follows 20,000 children
who started kindergarten in 1998. Crucially, not only the parents of children were surveyed,
but their teachers too, which gives the researcher data on the participating child’s classroom.
From the parent surveys, the author is able to estimate the number of children with diagnosed
and undiagnosed ADD in the participating child’s classroom. A child is taken to have
undiagnosed ADD if she is diagnosed with ADD later in the data. Increasing the number
of children with undiagnosed ADD in a classroom by one standard deviation lowers the
average test scores in the classroom by 10 to 20% of a standard deviation. Exploiting the
panel nature of the data, the author controls for individual fixed effects and looks at what
happens to a child academic achievement when a peer is diagnosed with and treated for ADD.
The main finding is that when children are diagnosed and treated, their behavior improves
but their own academic achievement does not. However, the academic achievement of their
peers improves.
   Frank and Meara (2009) follow children from the NLSY79 survey to find that maternal
depression affects the social and emotional development of children. However, they fail to


                                              56
uncover any meaningful effect on cognitive development (reading and mathematics). Their
sample consists of 1,600 children of female respondents to the NLSY for whom all the data
is available. There are obvious empirical challenges such as reverse causation, meaning
that children’s problems could cause maternal depression and the usual concerns about
omitted variable bias caused by factors related to both maternal mental health and children’s
development. The authors try to get around these problems by exploiting the panel structure
of the survey. In particular, they rely on maternal mental health problems that precede the
time at which children’s outcomes are measured. This of course doesn’t solve the problem
that it is possible that unmeasured, latent problems impact maternal mental health which
are then taken to cause the children’s problems once those problems are measured. The
researchers also control for a wide set of variables and use propensity score models as well.
   Using sibling data from Manitoba, Currie, Stabile, Manivong and Roos (2010) find that
early physical health can be linked to young adult outcomes through young adult health,
while early mental health has predictive power for young adult outcomes even conditional
on future health and health at birth. This study relies on universal administrative health
insurance records for all, approximately 50,000, children born in the Canadian province of
Manitoba between 1979-1987. Moreover, it only relies on siblings for identification which
allows the authors to account for unobserved family-specific background measures. On the
outcome side, the researchers are able to link the healthcare data to universal administrative
data on education and on welfare uptake.
   Following siblings for 40 years in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), Smith
and Smith (2010) find that childhood psychological problems are associated with worse
educational attainment and substantially lower adult incomes. The strength of this study
is the long panel and the ability to control for sibling fixed effects. The weakness is that
childhood health is measured retrospectively, through a child health history addition to the
2007 PSID. As discussed earlier, the problem with retrospective measurement is that it is
possible that people who have worse SES recall being sicker in their childhood, leading to


                                             57
reverse causation. This study also clearly discusses the impacts of mental health problems
in dollar terms. The authors report that children affected by mental health problems go on
to earn 20% (or $10,4000) less and have $18,000 less in household assets. They estimate that
the lifetime costs of childhood mental health conditions amount to $300,000 in lost family
income.
   Salm and Schunk (2012), analyzing data from a German town, find that mental health
conditions, in particular hyperactivity, rather than physical health conditions, can explain
the transmission of human capital from parents’ education to children’s development. Their
data come from Osnabrück, a German town, and include the initial medical examination
records of all, approximately 4,000, children entering school between 2002 and 2005. Their
sibling sample include approximately 900 children. Their measures of cognitive development
also come from the same medical examinations. They find that physical health conditions
are not strongly associated with cognitive development, but mental health conditions, in
particular hyperactivity, can explain a lot of the variation in cognitive development at the
time children enter school.
   Webbink, Vujić, Koning and Martin (2012) find that childhood conduct disorder reduces
human capital accumulation and increases violent and criminal behavior. The data come
from the Australian Twin Registry (ATR). The approximately 4,300 twin pairs in the register
were born in the 1964-1971 period and were entered in the 1980-1982 period. They were then
surveyed in 1989-1992 and 1996-2000. The authors estimate the imapct of conduct disorder
and depression using variation within twin pairs. There is some evidence that educaitonal
attainment is reduced by both conditions. In the most stringent specification that relies on
identical twin pairs only, conduct disorder is associated with highly significant 15 percentage
point (13 percentage point for depression) increase in the probability of attacking others and
7 percentage point (no effect for depression) increase in the probability of being arrested. Of
course, one should be careful about interpreting these findings as causal effects.
   Cuellar and Dave (2015) examine the impact of mental health interventions for youth


                                              58
in the justice system and find lower drouput rates, increased high school completion, but
negative or non-significant effects on grades. The study relies on administrative data from
the state-wde juvenile justice system and the state-wide school system in Washington. The
authors assess the impact of being assigned to various mental health treatments (Multi-
systemic Therapy (MST), Functional Family Therapy (FFT), and Agression Replacement
Training (ART) under a state policy. While there is possibly strong selection in the uptake
of the various therapies, the researchers also exploit a discontinuity in the eligibility of youth
for mental health treatment. They also use assignment to a treatment as an instrument
for receiving that treatment. They find that behavioral interventions can have an effect on
school dropout and school completion.


2.5.4   Summary

Much like the in the case of the studies of childhood physical health, we understand the
studies presented in this section on childhood mental health as describing associations rather
than causal pathways from mental health to economic outcomes. The evidence suggests that
mental health is strongly correlated with longer-term outcomes, the correlation may even be
stronger than for physical health, likely because (latent) cognitive ability is more correlated
with mental than with physical health. As we already discussed mental health is one of the
most difficult areas to study because of reporting and measurement issues. We discussed
Cuellar and Dave (2015) which studies a mental health intervention for youth in the justice
system as an example of studies that look at actual interventions, however, there is ample

2.6.1   Introduction

This section discusses recent studies that have connected environmental exposures, in partic-
ular exposure to lead and to air pollution, that have a negative effect on health to longer-term
outcomes. Recent surveys of the economics literature that connect environmental health to
human capital and labor market behavior are presented in Graff Zivin and Neidell (2013)
and Currie, Zivin, Mullins and Neidell (2014). Graff Zivin and Neidell (2013) argue that this
literature has not only provided quasi-experimental evidence on the impact of air pollution
on health and economic outcomes but also shows that pollution can have negative long-term
impacts even if its present in quantities below regulatory standards. Currie, Zivin, Mullins
and Neidell (2014) conclude that there is strong evidence on the impact of pollution on
health, though we can still learn more about longer-term economic impacts. Both surveys
emphasize the contributions of economics to this particular field of research through the in-
troduction of conceptual models and credible identification strategies that allow researchers
to esimate causal effects.
   This subsection is based on a systematic review which started with searching the eco-
nomics literature on Google Scholar using the search terms ("environment" OR "environmental"
OR "pollution" OR "exposure" OR "lead" OR "pollen") AND ("child" OR "childhood"
OR "children" OR "long-term") for years 2005-2017. Our search returned an initial 64
results, however we only consider 9 studies that are relevant to our review. These need
to consider the impact of environmental exposures on economic outcomes, rather than the
other way around, examine non-health endpoints (education or economic outcomes), and be
done in the US or other developed countries. In addition to the Google Scholar search, we
added a small number of studies that were referenced by the studies we found through the
systematic search but did not themselves come up in the search (usually because they did
not contain the keywords in their title). Mindful of the slow publication process and the fast



                                              60
pace of some of the literature covered here, we also included relevant NBER Working Papers
from 2015-2017 from the Children, Health, and Labor Studies programs.


2.6.2   Summary of methods

The literature studying environmental health, most importantly air pollution and exposure
to lead has relied on stronger identification strategies than most of the literature studying
the long-term impact of childhood mental and physical health. This is possible because
many policies have affected the quality of the environment in geographically heterogeneous
ways, which presents useful identifying variation. In addition, in many cases, the evolution of
environmental quality is also well-documented at fine geographical levels, typically through
data from individual monitoring stations. Moreover, administrative data on test scores in the
education system have benefitted many studies, and in recent work administrative earnings
records have also been exploited.

2.6.3   Studies

A recent literature shows that lead exposure is connected to worse academic performance
and lower earnings and that when lead exposure is reduced by government policies, such as
the phasing out of leaded gasoline, outcomes improve.
   Using data from a city in Chile, Rau, Reyes and Urza (2013), connect lead exposure to
academic performance and earnings. The variation that they exploit is the dumping of more
than 20,000 tons of toxic waste in a city between 1984 and 1989 which interacted with the
city’s expansion, and led to lead exposure in a geographically heterogeneous way. They use
data in which they can identify the distance of families to the waste and information on
lead exposure. They connect these data on exposure to administrative data on test scores
and adult earnings. They find large reductions in test scores and a significant impact on
earnings.
   Using data from the NLSY79 and the NLSY97, Reyes (2015) connects lead exposure to
risky and antisocial behavior in adolescence. The identification in this paper is based on
the phaseout of leaded gasoline in the US between 1975 and 1990. Over successive cohorts,
blood lead levels were reduced over time but there was also some variation across states
in the speed of the reduction. The data on blood levels comes from the National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II) and is combined with government data on
leaded gasoline to establish the connection between the state-level geographic distribution
of leaded gasoline and blood lead levels. The author then estimates the impact of blood
lead levels on child behavioral problems, teen agression, and young adult criminal behavior,
finding significant effects.
   In Sweden, Grönqvist, Nilsson and Robling (2014) show reductions in criminal behavior
as response to the phasing out of leaded gasoline. The identificaiton strategy is similar
to Reyes (2015): leaded gasoline was phased out in Sweden in the 1970s and 1980s, but
there was geographic variation in lead levels. However, the data used in this study is much
better than in Reyes (2015). First, to study criminal behavior, the authors obtain data on


                                            63
every criminal conviction in Sweden since 1985. Second, they obtain comprehensive data
on every child born in three birth cohorts (1972-1974, 1977-1979, 1982-1984). Third, they
obtain data on the municipality-level moss lead level for 1,000 survey locations for three years
(1975, 1980, 1985). Connecting these datasets allows for a nuanced and precise analysis of
the effects of lead exposure on crime. The authors find a large, 7 to 14% drop associated with
the drop in blood levels caused by the phaseout and also describe substantial heterogeneity
and nonlinearity. They find that lead levels only affect crime above a threshold and that the
impact is larger among low-SES families.
   Aizer, Currie, Simon and Vivier (2016), using data from Rhode Island, show improve-
ments in test scores and argues that reduction in lead exposure is a major reason for the
decrease in the black-whie test score gap. The authors connect data on 57,000 children born
in Rhode Island with data from blood lead level tests (available for approximately 80% of
children in the state) and data on third grade test scores. The key variation that they ex-
ploit is generated by a 1997 policy that required the owners of rental properties to obtain
“lead-safe” certificates. Bringing in neighborhood-level data on the share of old (pre-war)
buildings that have much more leaded paint, the researchers exploit geographic variation in
the change of blood levels among children living in different neighborhoods. They find that
there is a strong negative association between elevated blood levels and test performance.
They argue that the reduction of lead exposure in Rhode Island can alone explain 37-76%
of the decline in racial disparities in test scores because African American children were
previously disproportionately exposed to lead.
   Currie et al. (2009) connect air quality data from Texas with school absences, finding a
strong relationship. They adopt a difference-in-difference-in-differences strategy that only
relies on variation in air pollution within schools and years, across attendance periods, six-
week periods within a school year. They connect data on absences by each public school
student in grades 1 to 8 studying at a school within 10 miles of a pollution monitor for the
years 1996-2001. They key outcome variable is a school-level average absentee rate for a six-


                                              64
week attendance period, which they relate to a local measure of pollution (carbon monoxide
(CO), ozone, and other small particulate matter (PM10)), namely for each pollutant, the
percent of days in the attendance period the level of the pollutant exceeded various per-
centages (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) of the EPA threshold. They find that the level of CO is
significantly and positively correlated with school absences.
   Using data Israel, the US, and Norway, respectively, Lavy, Ebenstein and Roth (2014),
Marcotte (2015), and Bensnes (2016) find that air pollution and pollen have large negative
impacts on high-stakes high school exam scores.
   Lavy, Ebenstein and Roth (2014) uses data on the test scores of all students (about half
of each cohort) who at the end of high school take the Bagrut exam, which is required to
enter universities, for the years 2000-2002. They are able to connect these test scores at
the individual student level to demographic information and to the fine particulate matter
(PM2.5) and CO measure from the monitoring station nearest to the student’s school. There
are 139 monitoring stations, so the geographic variation is observed at a relatively fine level.
Further strengthening identification, each student takes exams after each grade, the authors
are able to inlcude student fixed effects, using only within-student, across-exam variation.
They find a large and negative association between pollution and test performance. Since
these are high stakes exams that are important in university admissions, this means that the
allocation of students to higher education is also affected.
   In work very similar to Lavy, Ebenstein and Roth (2014), Bensnes (2016) uses universal
data on high school exams for the 2008-2011 period from Norway, connected to pollen spread
predicted from data collected at twelve stations across the country. Thus the variation
that the author exploits comes from the variation of pollen levels across time and across
municipalities. Additionally, he is able to include student fixed effects because each student
takes exams on multiple days. Therefore identification comes only from within-student,
across-exam date variation in pollen levels. He finds significant effects and argues that
because only a portion of students are actually sensitive to pollen, for these students the


                                              65
effects are even larger. Because the exams examined in the study are high stakes high school
exams, they also influence the way students sort into higher education.
   Marcotte (2015) is a closely related study which has less clean identification but uses data
from the US. The author obtained data on daily pollen counts for 16 monitoring stations
across America for the 2003-2012 period and connected it to third grade state test data from
48 school districts that are near the stations. He then estimates the relationship between
pollen counts on the day the state test was taken and the proportion of students scoring
proficient or advanced on the tests. He finds that pollen levels in the weeks leading up to
tests are negatively related to performance, but not as strongly as pollen levels on the day
of the test.
   Using variation created by the 1970 Clean Air Act Amendments, Isen, Rossin-Slater and
Walker (2016) find lower labor force participation and earnings among those exposed to air
pollution in their year of birth. The amendments lead to the designation of each US county
as an attainment or a nonattainment based on the level of pollution in 1970. Nonattainment
counties were forced to lower pollution levels and experienced large imporvements in air
quality. The authors use data from 148 counties in 24 states, connecting data on the change
in air pollution in these counties to the earnings records of 90% of the US population using
a longitudinal dataset from the Census Bureau. They show that as air pollution levels were
lowered, children born in these years went on to earn more.


2.6.4   Summary

The first group of studies discussed in this section on environmental health investigated the
impacts of exposure to lead on various longer-term outcomes. It appears that exposure to
lead, even below quantities below regulatory levels leads to worse academic outcomes, lower
earnings, and more criminal behavior. The studies here rely on quasi-experimental variation,
usually connected to the introduction of some policy (e.g., phase out of leaded gasoline) over
time. This is useful both to better identify causal impacts rather than just associations, and


                                              66
also because they show that feasible government policies can have substantial impacts in
this area. The second group of studies concentrates on air pollution, in particular, pollution
below regulatory levels. These are identified off of variation in weather which causes variation
in pollution. Air pollution clearly impacts student performance, though if we take this
literature together with the literature on air pollution and adult productivity discussed in
Section 3.2.3, it appears that at these levels of pollution, at least in these studies, it primarily
impacts one-time test scores rather than longer-term cognitive ability.


2.7    Summary

In this section we considered various aspects of childhood health and summarized what has
been found in the literature on the association of these aspects of childhood health and longer-
term outcomes. Clearly, childhood health, whether physical or mental health, in utero, early
childhood, or adolescent health, matters for education and labor market market success. If
one had to answer the question ”what matters most?”, ranking different areas of health, the
difficulty would be that some effects are large but less well-identified, while others are cleanly
identified but smaller. Studies of child mental health recover very large effects: children with
certain mental conditions go on to earn 10-20-30% less, but the mental health studies are
probably better understood as uncovering associations rather than causal effects. Historic
studies of nutrition and public health interventions also recover large effects, and they have
a more plausible claim at identification, but data limitation are of course important. The
non-historic studies of nutrition are suggestive of associations, rather than causal effects. On
the other hand, in utero exposure to negative shocks is associated with earnings declines
more on the order of 10% or even less, but these effects are generally cleanly identified in
a large number of studies, making use of both cross-cohort and cross-geography variation.
Studies of environmental health are perhaps somewhat less identified, but still relatively
clean, and usually find important though not huge effects. Birthweight studies uncover the
smallest effects. The twin research design used in these studies has been challenged, though


                                                67
birthweight studies are probably one of the most appropriate uses for this design. However,
there are still important open issues. Below we highlight two of these.
    First, the magnitude of the effect of various aspects of health on outcomes is often
hard to establish. Many studies do not report the magnitude of their estimates clearly,
they appear satisfied with finding that there is an effect but do not report it in easily
interpretable and comparable units or put it into context. To evaluate which aspects of
health are most important for longer-term outcomes and just as importantly in which areas
we could have cost-effective interventions we would need to have clear, interpretable, and
comparable estimates of magnitudes of effect sizes.
    Second, the majority of studies that we discussed do not study interventions, but either
rely on naturally arising variation or study exogeneous shocks. This means that we do not
have a direct handle on what sorts of interventions would be effective. Therefore one of
the important directions for future research is the study, either through natural experiments
relying on different times/places of introduction or through randomized controlled trials, of
interventions that affect health and longer-term outcomes.



3     Adult health

3.1    Introduction

This section focuses on the impact of adult health on labor market outcomes, including
labor force participation, employment, hours, and earnings. There are several ways in which
health can impact labor market outcomes. In generic terms, it can affect both the costs and
benefits of work. People in worse health might find it harder to work or be less productive
at work. People with high out-of-pocket medical costs might also need to attain higher
income. The generosity and other features of available social insurance programs will have
a large impact on the association of health and labor market outcomes. For example, in
the United States, job lock, the phenomenon that some people need to keep working at an


                                             68
employer to keep their health insurance is another distinct channel through which health
can affect employment. Currie and Madrian (1999) present a comprehensive review of the
literature connecting adult health and labor makets generated between about 1980 and
1999. The authors conclude that poor health is associated with lower earnings and labor
force participation, but the magnitude of the association is sensitive to the dimension of
health measured. In this section, we describe more recent contributions linking health and
labor market outcomes.
   One of the reasons that it is difficult to make progress in this literature is that researchers
have not been allowed to connect US administrative data on health with administrative data
on labor market outcomes, such as wages and labor force participation. Much of the literature
using US data is based on surveys, such as the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and
the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Surveys have some important limitations: health
and labor market outcomes are typically self-reported which means measures are potentially
imprecise and endogeneous and sample sizes are small.
   There is a literature that relies on US Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) data,
though much of this literature is concerned with the impact of receiving disability insurance
(DI) payments, rather than with the effects of health on labor market outcomes, such as
transition to disability. There are also studies that are able to rely on high-quality adminis-
trative data from Western and Northern European countries. Another recent strand of the
literature has studied the dynamic relationship between health and labor market oucomes:
instead of investigating whether people in poor health fare worse in the labor market, re-
searchers have looked at what happens to the labor market oucomes of an individual when
a negative health shock hits. An advantage of studying the response to health shocks over
studying health status is that estimates are now within individual. Essentially, the ques-
tion asked is holding a person’s other characteristics fixed, what happens when her health
“suddenly” worsens. The dynamics of health can also be endogeneous, though some of the
factors causing endogeneity might be observable in administrative panel data.


                                               69
   We organize this section around six main themes: (1) environmental health and produc-
tivity, (2) disability, (3) the consequences of physical health shocks, (4) within-household
spillovers from health, (5) cancer, (6) mental health.


3.2     Environmental health and productivity

3.2.1   Introduction

A large literature, disussed in Section 2.6 establishes the consequences of the in utero and
childhood environment on adult outcomes. This section focuses on recent work that estimates
the impact of environmental health conditions on adults’ contemporaneous productivity and
wages. The most important environmental factor that has been linked to productivity is air
pollution. The impact of different types of air pollution can be large even for workers working
inside and need not be limited to developing countries. The studies that we discuss in this
section have demonstrated the impact of air pollution on the productivity of agricultural
workers in California, call-center workers in China, and the general working population in
Mexico City.
   This subsection is based on a systematic review which started with searching the eco-
nomics literature on Google Scholar using the search terms ("environment" OR "environmental"
OR "pollution" OR "exposure" OR "air") AND ("productivity" OR "labor") for years
2005-2017. Our search returned an initial 132 results, however we only consider 5 studies that
are relevant to our review. These need to consider the impact of environmental exposures
on economic outcomes, rather than the other way around, examine non-health endpoints
(economic outcomes), and be done in the US or other developed countries. In addition to
the Google Scholar search, we added a small number of studies that were referenced by
the studies we found through the systematic search but did not themselves come up in the
search (usually because they did not contain the keywords in their title). Mindful of the
slow publication process and the fast pace of some of the literature covered here, we also
included relevant NBER Working Papers from 2015-2017 from the Health and Labor Studies

                                              70
programs.


3.2.2      Summary of methods

From a methodological perspective, the studies that are discussed in this section can be
put into two groups. The first group includes Graff Zivin and Neidell (2012), Chang, Graff
Zivin, Gross and Neidell (2016a), and Chang, Graff Zivin, Gross and Neidell (2016b). These
studies rely on detailed productivity and wage data from a single company combined with
day-to-day variation in pollution. The measurement of productivity is aided by the fact that
workers are paid based some kind of piece rate (e.g., number of berries picked, phone calls
made), which means that the companies keep precise measures of output and workers are
incentivized to maximize output. Moreover, hours are also logged, allowing the researchers
to distinguish extensive margin (work or not), intensive margin (hours worked), and produc-
tivity (output per hour worked) effects. Using panel data that follows the same worker across
days, the authors are also able to control for worker fixed effects, further strenghtening the
identification.
    The second group of studies includes Lehmann and Wadsworth (2011) and Hanna and
Oliva (2015). These studies rely on more general variation in environmental conditions across
cohorts, the exposure to nuclear fallout from Chernobyl and exposure to air pollution from
an oil refinery, respectively. In these studies, the measurement of productivity is less precise,
since they rely on a proxy for productivity, namely wages. Moreover, it is possible that
other things change over time in addition to the change in the environment. Since large
populations are affected, these studies are also measuring more general equilibrium type
effects.

3.2.3   Studies

In Section 2.2.5 we discussed studies of the in utero impact of nuclear fallout, including
the fallout from Chernobyl. Turning to adults, Lehmann and Wadsworth (2011) study the
impact of Chernobyl on adulth health and labor market outcomes. Their data comes from
the 2003, 2004, and 2007 waves of the Ukranian Longitudinal Monitor Survey (ULMS) which
surveyed about 9,000 Ukranians on their health and labor market outcomes, but also asked
them about their place of residence in 1986. The authors use 1986 place of residence as a
source of variation in exposure to fallout from the catastrophe. They find that adults who
resided relatively close to Chernobyl are 13 percentage points more likely to report poor
health 20 years later. This negative impact on health translates into worse labor market
performance.
   Graff Zivin and Neidell (2012) document the impact of ozone pollution on productivity.
The authors exploit variation across work days in ambient ozone concentration at a large
farm in the Central Valley in California connected with daily measures of agricultural worker
productivity. Worker productivity is typically difficult to measure, but in this context workers
are paid through piece rate contracts, depending on the number of blueberries and grapes
that they pick. This contract design allows the researchers to measure worker productivity
precisely, as the number of pieces harvested, and to study the impact of environmental
conditions on productivity. Moreover, they are able to observe the decision to work and
the number of hours worked, which turn out not to be affected by ozone concentration.
This is crucial for isolating the effect on productivity. The main finding is that higher
ozone concentration has a substantial negative effect on worker productivity: a 10 ppb
(approximately the cross-day standard deviation of ozone pollution and also the decrease in
federal ozone standard proposed by the EPA) increase in average ozone exposure decreases
worker productivity by 5.5 percent.
   In the same vein, Chang, Graff Zivin, Gross and Neidell (2016a) connect data on Chinese
call-center workers’ productivity to daily measures of pollution and weather. Employees


                                              73
receive performance pay and productivity can be measured precisely as the number of phone
calls made, the length of phone calls, and the amount of time that a worker is available to
take calls. Pollution is measured as an air pollution index, based on particulate matter in
the air on a given day. The main finding is that productivity decreases substantially with
higher pollution levels and the productivity decrease happens because workers take longer
breaks when pollution is higher. The main estimate presented by the authors suggests that
a 10-unit increase in their air pollution increase (relative to a mean of 66 units) is associated
with a 0.35 percent drop in the number of calls per workday.
   In another related study, Chang, Graff Zivin, Gross and Neidell (2016b) study the impact
of air pollution on pear packers working indoors. Fine particulate matter has a significant
negative impact on their productivity, while pollutants that do not go indoors do not impact
output. As in the previous studies, workers are paid based on output (number of boxes
packed), allowing the researchers to measure productivity precisely. In line with previous
findings, indoor air pollution also does not affect labor supply but affects the productivity of
labor. The main estimate points to a 6 percent decrease in worker productivity associated
with a 10-unit (roughly one standard deviation) change in pollution.
   Environmental health can potentially affect labor supply in addition to productivity.
Hanna and Oliva (2015) use the closure of a large oil refinery in Mexico City as a plausibly
exogenous shock to air pollution in the city. The authors first show that the closure of
the refinery had a significant negative impact on the level of sulfur-dioxide, a pollutant
with known negative health effects, in the air. Using labor market data from the National
Employment Panel Survey of Mexico (ENEU), the authors show that the improvement in
air quality in turn had a positive effect on labor supply, people on aveage worked an extra
1.3 hours (3.5%) more.

3.2.4     Summary

The studies discussed in this section demonstrate that environmental conditions or envi-
ronmental health impact the productivity of labor significantly. The magnitudes are hard
to compare across various pollutants but we consider the micro evidence presented well-
identified. Beyond improving observable health, interventions that can improve environmen-
tal conditions are likely to improve the productivity of labor and perhaps even increase labor
supply.


3.3       Disability

3.3.1     Introduction

Disability may be thought of as a reduction in one’s ability to work or as very bad health.
Receiving disability insurance (DI) payments can be regarded as a labor market outcome in
itself, possibly as a consequence of health shocks. Several recent studies have analyzed the
impact of becoming disabled on worker’s earnings but also workers’ transitions to DI from
working following health shocks.
   This subsection is based on a systematic review which started with searching the eco-
nomics literature on Google Scholar using the search terms ("disability" OR "disabled")
AND ("labor" OR "earnings" OR "income") for years 2005-2017. Our search returned an
initial 41 results, however we only consider 5 studies that are relevant to our review. These
need to consider the impact of disability (and not disability insurance) on economic outcomes,
rather than the other way around, examine non-health endpoints (economic outcomes), and
be done in the US or other developed countries. In addition to the Google Scholar search,
we added a small number of studies that were referenced by the studies we found through
the systematic search but did not themselves come up in the search (usually because they
did not contain the keywords in their title). Mindful of the slow publication process and the
fast pace of some of the literature covered here, we also included relevant NBER Working

Papers from 2015-2017 from the Health and Labor Studies programs.


3.3.2    Summary of methods

Typically in this literature studies rely on panel data, looking at what happens to a person
over time and mostly use data from surveys such as the Panel Study of Income Dynamics
(PSID) and the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). One of the key challenges in this
literature has been the endogeneity of reported disability status to labor market outcomes.
This concern is exacerbated in studies of disability rather than general physical health. While
general physical health can also be endogeneous to labor market outcomes (i.e., a person’s
health can worsen when she loses her job, rather than the person losing her job because
her health worsened), there are at least some relatively objective measures of health (e.g.,
did the person have a stroke?) and some studies are able to measure physical health from
administrative data, such as hospital claims. On the other hand, disability status is not
an objective condition. First, in surveys, it’s quite probable that people are more likely to
report themselves as being disabled if they are not working. (This likely happens with general
physical health as well to some extent.) Second, we know that people are more likely to claim
disability when their labor market prospects worsen or more generally as a substitute for
other social programs (see e.g., Black, Daniel and Sanders, 2002; Autor and Duggan, 2003;
Borghans, Gielen and Luttmer, 2014). The studies we discuss in section generally use some
variant of work-limiting conditions rather than disability program participation as a measure
of disability.
   The general approach in this literature is to use panel data that follow individuals over
time and look at what happens to individuals as they become disabled. This approach is
able to account for personal characteristics that are fixed over time, but not for variables
that may change in parallel with disability (e.g., labor market conditions). Some studies use
matching methods to create a control group that does not become disabled and then compare
the treatment and control groups rather than just relying on the within-person changes over


                                              76
time. This matching method is credible to the extent that we think that individuals matched
on observables are truly comparable.

3.3.3   Studies

Charles (2003) uses data from the PSID for the 1968-1993 period to study what happens
to the earnings of an individual when their self-reported ability to work becomes limited
because of a physical impairmtnet which the paper takes as its definition of disability. An
important limitation is disability is defined to work-limiting condition, which may introduce
an upward bias in the effect of disability on earnings if people whose impairments reduce
their earnings are more likely to report that they have such an impairment than people
who are able to better adapt to their impairments. The paper relies on person fixed effects
to eliminate bias due to person-specific factors. It also takes into account the evolution of
self-reported disability after onset, a possible measure of the extent to which the disability is
chronic. The main finding of the paper is that the onset of disability is followed by a sharp
drop in earnings, followed by strong recovery around two years after the onset, and then
by a slower upward trend in the following years. On balance, disability causes substantial
earnings losses. Initial earnings losses are larger and recovery is weaker for older, nonwhite,
and less educated individuals. In follow-up work, however, Mok, Meyer, Charles and Achen
(2008) revised the original estimates in Charles (2003) and found that earnings losses are in
fact several times larger and recovery is somewhat weaker. Using PSID data extended to
2009, Meyer and Mok (2013) also report large declines in earnings and consumption.
   In related work, focusing on near-elderly (ages 50-64) workers, Cutler, Meara and Richards-
Shubik (2011) study the extent to which older workers transition to DI from working when
they experience a major adverse event. Using longitudinal data from the HRS, the authors
follow individuals after they experience a major health shock, and analyze their job char-
acteristics, earnings, and welfare program takeup. They find that at this age, major health
events make people apply for DI at high rates but that there is also a lot of variation both
across demographic groups and by underlying health status.
   Using German survey data, Lechner and Vazquez-Alvarez (2011), study the effect of
becoming disabled on employment, unemployment, labor force participation, and earnings.


                                               79
The German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) a large panel study of West German residents
aged 40-59 for the years 1984-2002 contains detailed information of individuals’ health, labor
market variables, and other characteristics. Since disability is measured as a continuous
rather than as a binary variable, the authors defined becoming disabled as moving from 0%
disability to over 30% disability. They use matching to create a control group of individuals
who don’t become disabled. While employment is reduced by 9-13%, loss of income is small
(due to the welfare state) and unemployment does not increase, that is, disabled individuals
who would like to work are able to find jobs.


3.3.4   Summary

The studies we summarized on the impact of becoming disabled suggest that disability is
associated with declines in employment. However, it is important to note that it is difficult
to define disability, at least in survey data in the US, independent of transitioning from
employment to DI. Clearly important research is missing on the possibility of transitioning
back from DI to employment and on the employability of workers whom we currently consider
disabled. Whether the decline in employment at the onset of disability is associated with
a decline in earnings is dependent on the particular DI system of each country. In the US,
DI payments are not particularly generous and being on DI makes it virtually impossible
to work due to strict earnings rules. In European welfare states, DI payments are more
generous but receiving partial DI payments and working at the same time is also possible.
From a policy perspective, understanding how introducing some of the policies that are used
in other countries (e.g., partial disability) would be a great avenue for further research.


3.4     Health shocks

3.4.1   Introduction

A large and growing part of the literature that connects health to economic outcomes for
adults relies on health shocks for identification. The key idea behind this approach is that

                                              80
while cross-sectional estimates are likely to suffer from omitted variable bias and reverse
causality, estimates that rely on longitudinal data “within” a person are able to account for
persistent individual-level unobservables. Moreover, the extent to which health shocks are
sudden or exogeneous is testable by estimating the extent to which they are associated with
pre-trends on average. The impacts of health also may manifest over time, thus following
indivudals year-to-year before and after a health event can be especially informative.
   This subsection is based on a systematic review which started with searching the eco-
nomics literature on Google Scholar using the search terms "health shock" OR "health
event" OR "injury" OR "injuries" OR "accident" for years 2005-2017. Our search re-
turned an initial 92 results, however we only consider 13 studies that are relevant to our
review. These need to consider the impact of health shocks on economic outcomes, rather
than the other way around, examine non-health endpoints (economic outcomes), and be
done in the US or other developed countries. In addition to the Google Scholar search, we
added a small number of studies that were referenced by the studies we found through the
systematic search but did not themselves come up in the search (usually because they did
not contain the keywords in their title). Mindful of the slow publication process and the fast
pace of some of the literature covered here, we also included relevant NBER Working Papers
from 2015-2017 from the Health and Labor Studies programs.


3.4.2   Summary of methods

The studies we discuss in this section use longitudinal data to follow individuals before and
after they suffer a health shock, like a hospitalization. The earlier papers rely on surveys
like the HRS in the US, the GSOEP in Germany, and the European Community Household
Panel (ECHP) in comparisons of several European countries. More recent work has utilized
administrative data from Denmark, Austria, and the Netherlands. Administrative data,
which allows researchers to connect health shock measures (e.g., claims from hospitalizations)
with outcomes (e.g., income) at the individual level, allows for a lot more precision than


                                             81
surveys. Not only does administrative data give precise measurements of the timing and size
of shocks and of economic outcomes, it can also reduce selection concerns. Typically studies
in this literature estimate event studies, effectively plotting outcomes over time relative to a
health shock, which also allows us to assess whether there were pre-trends in outcomes before
the shock happened, which could bias estimates of the impact of the shock and could also
be indicative of endogeneity. In addition to event studies that include person fixed effects,
many of the studies also use matching methods, comparing individuals who experienced a
shock with a matched control group of individuals who did not.

3.4.3   Studies

A relatively early study connecting health events to labor supply is McClellan (1998). Relying
on data from just two waves of the HRS, the author studies what happens to individuals who
experience a major health event, chronic illness, or accident relative to those who don’t. The
main limitation of this study relative to later studies that use health shocks is the shortness of
its panel: it only contains two data points per person, which makes it impossible to evaluate
pre-trends which can lead to selection. Health shocks have a large negative impact on labor
supply. The author finds that health events are more prevalent among people with lower
socioeconomic status, and have varying consequences depending on the type of the event.
Major new health events make people much more likely to leave the labor force and to retire,
new chronic illnesses have a weaker but still substantial effect on retirement. Accidents on
the other hand can make people not work for some time, but do not push them to retire.
   In another study using the HRS, Bound, Schoenbaum, Stinebrickner and Waidmann
(1999) find that health changes, as opposed to health levels, are very important in explaining
labor force transitions among older workers. Controlling for initial health levels, people whose
health declines are more likely to leave the labor force, primarily applying for DI. There is
also evidence of adaptive behavior in the form of job changes following declines in health.
   In similar work, Smith (2005) extends this analysis to five waves of the HRS. This allows
the author to present evidence on trends in economic outcomes preceding health events.
There is a natural downward trend in labor force participation and earnings as people age,
however, new health events are associated with large drops in the probability of working
and in income. In addition to these immediate impacts, there is substantial spillover to
later years, the drop in labor force participation and income continues. The intensive mar-
gin (hours worked) response is smaller than the extensive margin (probability of working)
response. The immediate drop and the cumulative impact are both smaller for hours worked.
   In the European context, Riphahn (1999) uncovers very large effects using survey data
from Germany. Her data come from eleven waves of the GSOEP for the years 1984-1994.


                                               85
Defining health shocks as sudden deteriorations in a person’s health, she finds effects much
larger than the studies in the American context: the probability of dropping out of the labor
force triples, unemployment goes up by 90%. These impacts are associated with significant
drops in income, though government welfare programs allow people to recover some of the
income they lose from not working. A useful way to reconcile the American and European
estimates might be to consider that labor force impacts are dependent on the availability
of government welfare programs and the replacement rates under these programs. If the
deterioration of health is associated with an increase in the disutility of working or lower
wages, people will be more likely to stop working if they can rely on other sources of income.
   Extending earlier findings for Spain presented in Garcı́a-Gómez and López Nicolás (2006),
Garcı́a-Gómez (2011) uses the European Community Household Panel (ECHP), a panel
survey that covered nine European countries (Belgium, Denmark, France, Greece, Ireland,
Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain), for 1994-2001, to study the effect of health
shocks on employment and discusses how these effects differ across countries and welfare
regimes. The author relies on propensity score matching techniques to come up with what
she considers a suitable control group for individuals who suffer health shocks. A health
shock is defined in two ways as: (i) the change of health status from “good” or “very good”
to “fair”, “bad”, or “very bad” across survey waves, (ii) the report of a chronic physical or
mental health problem, illness, or disability that changes across survey waves. In seven out of
nine countries, the probability of employment drops significantly after a health shock, while
in two countries (France and Italy) the drop is not statistically significant. Importantly, there
is significant heterogeneity across countries in the size of the drop. The author argues that
this heterogeneity is associated with the disability policy of each country. The key parameters
of the disability programs that matter are generosity and the ability to work while drawing
DI. In some countries, the generosity of unemployment insurance (UI) policies can also have
an impact because after a health shock individuals can transition to either DI or UI.
   In another study comparing several European countries, Trevisan and Zantomio (2016)


                                               86
focus on particular kinds of acute health shocks (myocardial infarction, stroke, and cancer)
and older workers. The set of countries included is wider and allows for a broader comparison
of what the authors refer to as four different welfare models: Nordic (Sweden, Denmark,
and Netherlands), the Anglo-Saxon (England), the Continental (Austria, Germany, France,
Belgium, and Switzerland), the Mediterranean (Spain, Italy, and Greece), and the Eastern
European (Czech Republic, Poland, Estonia, and Slovenia). The data used in this study
come from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing and the Survey of Health, Ageing
and Retirement in Europe for the years 2002-2013. The authors compare the labor market
outcomes of individuals who experience one of the types of health shocks and matched
individuals who do not experience a shock. Labor market impacts of experiencing these
kinds of health shocks are found to be large, and slightly higher for women. Interestingly,
lower educated men are more likely to exit the labor force than higher educated men, but
for women the relationship is reversed.
   Focusing on only the Netherlands, Garcı́a-Gómez, van Kippersluis, O’Donnell and van
Doorslaer (2013) study the impact of health shocks on a variety of economic outcomes. The
authors use administrative data from Dutch hospitals connected with administrative em-
ployment and earnings records, as well as DI and UI records. Health shocks are defined as
acute hospitalizations, unscheduled admissions that require immediate treatment. The au-
thors employ propensity score matching and a difference-in-differences estimator to estimate
the impact of health shocks on economic outcomes. Connecting high-quality administrative
records from the entire Dutch population allows the authors to derive precise estimates and
analyze heterogeneity along various dimensions. They are also able to connect households
and estimate spillover effects. The panel structure of the data allows them to analyze the
time path of economic outcomes before and after the health shock. Their findings suggest
that health shocks in the form of acute hospital admissions are associated with large re-
ductions in employment and earnings with little recovery, and high rates of DI transition.
The effects are larger for older workers and lower-income individuals. There are important


                                             87
spousal spillovers as well, larger for male spouses.
   Møller Danø (2005) conducts a similar analysis using road injuries as plausibly exogeneous
health shocks. The author relies on an administrative panel dataset that contains a 10%
random sample of the Danish population for the years 1981-2000. She focuses on individuals
ages 20-54 and connects employment and earnings data with hospital admissions for road
accidents. As in other studies, a matching estimator is used to compare people who have an
accident with people who don’t have an accident but are otherwise similar. There are large
impacts for men but little impact for women, both in terms of employment and earnings.
The author suggests that this might be because women are much more likely to be employed
in the public sector and therefore enjoy higher job security. Effects are also larger for lower-
income workers.
   Using matched employer-employee data from New Zealand, Crichton, Stillman and Hys-
lop (2011) find large drops in employment and earnings for injured workers relative to
matched non-injured workers. These effects are concentrated among workers who suffer in-
juries that result in a longer duration of injury compensation by insurance, which we might
think of as more serious injuries. The heterogeneity of these estimates is consistent with
findings from other studies: impacts are larger for women, older workers, and individuals
who have lower incomes and weaker labor market attachment.
   In another study of unexpected accidents, Halla and Zweimüller (2013) study what hap-
pens when workers are injured while commuting to work. Using administrative workers’
compensation data connected to social security data covering all Austrians, they follow indi-
viduals who have an accident in the years 2000-2002 and a matched sample of workers who
do not have an accident. They study labor market outcomes in a difference-in-differences
framework and find that people who have an accident are more likely to be unemployed and
also to transition to disability retirement. There is some suggestive evidence that women,
older workers, and blue-collar workers are more likely to be unemployed or leave the labor
market after health shocks.


                                              88
      Using the National Child Development Survey (NCDS) study sample from the UK, Lin-
deboom, Llena-Nozal and van der Klaauw (2016), study the impact of health shocks on labor
market outcomes and disability transitions. We discussed several studies in the section on
children that use this dataset.3 For this study, the authors rely on individuals in the panel
survey who are included after they turn 23 in 1981. Defining health shocks as hospitaliza-
tions for accidents, the authors find that people who have such accidents are much more
likely to transition to disability, but if they don’t transition to disability, their employment
is unaffected.
      A recent study by Dobkin, Finkelstein, Kluender and Notowidigdo (2016) uses hospital
admissions data from California linked with consumer credit reports, as well as HRS survey
data to study the financial consequences of hospital admissions among the elderly and among
non-elderly with and without health insurance. The authors of this study take an event study
approach, essentially describing the time path, following individuals using panel data, of the
financial outcomes under study relative to a hospitalization event. The consequences that
they consider are out-of-pocket medical expenses, income, and credit report outcomes, such
as unpaid bills and bankruptcy. They find that even when they have health insurance,
non-elderly individuals face significant economic risks as they can lose their uninsured labor
earnings.


3.4.4      Summary

The first group of studies that we considered in this section demonstrate that in the US
context, new health shocks are an important driver of labor market transitions in the form
of reduced labor supply, retirement, and DI. The second group of studies shows a similar
phenomenon in European countries. How much health shocks affect labor market behavior
is very much dependent on the institutional environment in each country, particularly the
generosity of DI and UI programs. Finally, in a recent US-based study Dobkin, Finkelstein,

Kluender and Notowidigdo (2016) demonstrated that in the US there is significant financial
risk associated with health shocks. Taken together, the studies in this section suggest that
studying the consequences of health shocks in adulthood is important for understanding
labor market behavior and understanding what policies can be implemented to reduce their
adverse consequences is an important area for future research.


3.5     Within-household spillovers

3.5.1   Introduction

Economic theory and empirical research has addressed within-household economic decision-
making and intra-household dependencies in outcomes such as female labor supply starting
with the seminal work of Gary Becker and Jacob Mincer in the 1960s. It is natural to also
analyze the impact of health on labor market outcomes in the household context, studying
outcomes such as the impact of health shocks on spousal labor supply. Like the impact
of own health on labor supply, a priori the impact of spousal health on labor supply also
has an ambigous sign. It depends on the extent to which the labor supplies of couples
are complements (one may want to spend more time with or care for a sick spouse) or
substitutes (if someone is unable to work, their spouse might need to work more to recover
income for the household). The structure and generosity of social insurance will also impact
labor supply decisions in response to spousal health, much like it does for own health. This
section summarize a relatively novel set of empirical studies of within-household spillovers
of health on labor market outcomes.
   This subsection is based on a systematic review which started with searching the eco-
nomics literature on Google Scholar using the search terms "health" AND ("couples" OR
"spouses" OR "spousal" OR "household") for years 2005-2017. Our search returned an
initial 83 results, however we only consider 8 studies that are relevant to our review. These
need to consider the spillover effects of health, examine non-health endpoints (economic
outcomes), and be done in the US or other developed countries. In addition to the Google

                                             90
Scholar search, we added a small number of studies that were referenced by the studies we
found through the systematic search but did not themselves come up in the search (usually
because they did not contain the keywords in their title). Mindful of the slow publication
process and the fast pace of some of the literature covered here, we also included relevant
NBER Working Papers from 2015-2017 from the Health and Labor Studies programs.


3.5.2   Summary of methods

Most of the studies discussed in this section rely on surveys because in the US connecting
administrative health data to administrative records of labor market outcomes and connect-
ing administrative records pertaining to spouses has not been possible. On the other hand,
surveys like the HRS often explicitly incorporate households, interviewing all members’ of
a participant’s household. In a novel study using Danish data, Fadlon and Nielsen (2015)
connect administrative records on the health of spouses and their labor market behavior.
The predominant empirical approach in these studies is an event study strategy, studying
what happens to individuals before and after the health of their spouse declines.

3.5.3   Studies

Using data from the HRS, Coile (2004) studies how older workers and their spouses change
their labor supply after a health shock. Using 1992-2002 data, she defines a health schock
as either an acute health event (heart attack, stroke, new cancer), the onset of new chronic
illnesses (diabetes, lung disease, heart failure, arthritis), or an accidental injury or fall. There
are large labor supply effects when a worker herself or himself experiences a health shock,
the effects are larger for men. When one’s spouse experiences a shock, in most cases we
can’t reject no response by women, though in some cases they actually decrease their labor
supply, while for men there is a small increase.
   Van Houtven and Coe (2010) study the impact of health shocks on spousal retirement
decisions, taking into account financial incentives. The authors use the HRS data for the
1992-2006 waves linked to Social Security Administration (SSA) data. This means that they
have access to health information (from the HRS) and employment and pension information
(from the SSA). They use various definitions of health shocks, including heart attacks, new
cancer diagnoses, new functional limitations, and inpatient hospitalizations. They conclude
that financial incentives are more important for retirement decisions than health shocks in
terms of effect sizes. Men are responsive to their wives’ health shocks in terms of employ-
ment and hours worked, but do not retire earlier as a response to spousal health shocks.
On the other hand, women are not response to their husbands’ health shocks in terms of
employment and hours worked, but do retire more quickly when their husband has a new
chronic condition.
   Gupta, Kleinjans and Larsen (2015) compare the impact of severe health shocks on
the labor force participation of older (ages 56-64) workers in Denmark and in the US. In
Denmark workers have universal health insurance with low out-of-pocket costs, while in the
US workers typically have employer-provided health insurance and potentially face high out-
of-pocket costs. Their US data comes from five waves of the HRS between 1994 and 2002,
while from Denmark they use a 20% random sample of the universal population register


                                                93
between 1993 and 2001. Contrary to expectations that Americans would be more likely to
continue working after a health shock because of large out-of-pocket costs and insurance job
lock, the authors find little difference in the probability of remaining employed in the two
countries. Examining effects by country and gender, in both countries, the diagnosis of a
new cancer makes people 5-10 percentage points less likely to work and a stroke or heart
attack makes them around 20 percentage points less likely to work, with the exception of
Danish men for whom the effect is only 8 percentage points. The authors argue that the
lack of differential impact between the two countries is explained by differences in diagnostic
propensities, treatments, and differential survival that counteract the work incentives created
by the different health insurance regimes.
   In early work examining spousal spillovers of health shocks, Charles (1999) used data from
the first two waves (1992 and 1994) of the HRS to study the impact of of one’s husband’s
or wife’s health and disability status on one’s labor supply. Individuals’ own disability has a
large negative impact on their labor supply. But importantly, spousal health and disability
has a different impact depending on gender. Husbands reduce their labor supply when their
wives are in poor health, but wives increase their labor supply when their husbands are in
poor health.
   In a similar study, Wu (2003) uses the first two waves (1992 and 1994) of the HRS to
study the economic consequences of health shocks for couples. Health shocks are defined
as heart conditions, strokes cancers, lung diseases, and diabetes with an onset between the
two waves. Economic status is defined as total household wealth. The main finding of the
paper is that the impact of a health shock experienced by a wife is much larger than the
impact of a health shock experienced by a husband. The earnings impact of health shocks
comes through retirement decisions, and there is also some medical expenditure impact. The
author argues that the asymmetry arises because illness experienced by wives results in an
increase in living expenses but illness experienced by husbands does not.
   Au, Crossley and Schellhorn (2005) use data from four waves (1994-1995, 1996-1997,


                                              94
1998-1999, and 2000-2001) of the Canadian National Population Health Survey (NPHS) to
study the impact of health shocks on the employment outcomes of older (ages 50-64) workers.
They use both self-reported health measures and an objective health index and find that
for both genders, a one standard deviation increase in health is associated with a 15-20
percentage point increase in the probability of being employed.
   In a similar study, using data from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) for 1991-
1998, Disney, Emmerson and Wakefield (2006) analyze the role health shocks play in older
workers’ (ages 50-64) retirement decisions. The BHPS is a representative longitudinal survey
of British workers. The longitudinal structure of the data allows the authors to analyze the
impact of changes in health on changes in labor force status and retirement. The main
finding of the paper is adverse health shocks have a strong predictive effect for retirement
behavior and this effect might well be symmetric.
   In recent work, Fadlon and Nielsen (2015) use comprehensive administrative data from
Denmark to study the impact of spousal health shocks and spousal death on labor supply.
Their dataset contains all married and cohabiting Danish couples from 1980 and 2011, which
allows the authors to minimize selection concerns and provide precise estimates of any im-
pacts. 500,000 households experienced a spousal death, while 70,000 households experienced
a severe health shock (heart attack or stroke) which did not result in death. Importantly,
instead of comparing households that experience a death or severe health shock to house-
holds that do not, the authors are able to compare households who experience the shock
with households who would experience the shock in the future. The main empirical finding
of the paper is that widows increase their labor force participation by 11% on average when
their husband dies, while widowers decrease their labor supply when their wife dies. On the
other hand, there is no economically significant labor supply response by either gender to a
severe spousal health shock, which is likely explained by the fact that Danish workers are
well-insured against the economic consequences of health shocks.

3.5.4   Summary

The issue of within-household spillovers remains an important open area for research. With
the exception of the recent Fadlon and Nielsen (2015), all studies rely on surveys, which
means that sample sizes and precision are limited. The existing literature in this area
establishes that within-household spillovers should be a first-order consideration for policy
as labor supply responses to spousal health shocks, especially women’s response to health
shocks experienced by their husbands, are large. There is virtually no research on children’s
response to health shocks experienced by their parents. The most important limitation in
this area appears to be access to US administrative data in which family members could be
linked to each other.


3.6     Cancer

3.6.1   Introduction

A number of studies have focused specifically on the consequences of cancer, including its
impact of labor supply. Cancer may be a physical health condition particularly amenable
to study because its diagnosis is relatively objective and treatment guidelines are relatively
uniform. We may also think that some forms of cancer can be interpreted as exogeneous
health shocks or at least more so than many other health problems that could be endogeneous
to labor market outcomes.
   This subsection is based on a systematic review which started with searching the eco-
nomics literature on Google Scholar using the search terms "cancer" AND ("labor" OR
"work" OR "earnings" OR "income") for years 2005-2017. Our search returned 6 results.
In addition to the Google Scholar search, we added a small number of studies that were
referenced by the studies we found through the systematic search but did not themselves
come up in the search (usually because they did not contain the keywords in their title), for
a total of 9 studies. Mindful of the slow publication process and the fast pace of some of


                                             96
the literature covered here, we also included relevant NBER Working Papers from 2015-2017
from the Health and Labor Studies programs.


3.6.2   Summary of methods

Four of the studies discussed in this section (Bradley, Neumark, Bednarek and Schenk,
2005; Bradley, Neumark, Luo and Bednarek, 2007; Bradley, Neumark and Barkowski, 2013;
Moran, Short and Hollenbeak, 2011) are quite unique in their use of datasets and surveys
that are specifically focused on individuals with cancer and cancer survivors. The advantage
of using surveys specific to cancer survivors is that very detailed information is available
on these individuals and there is much more power to estimate effect sizes for them. The
disadvantage of these datasets is that there is no clear control group to which cancer sur-
vivors can be compared. The authors bring in data from other surveys, the CPS and the
PSID, and use matching techniques to establish a control group, but in general this is a less
credible empirical approach than studies focused on one consistent population part of which
experiences cancer. One study (Bradley, Bednarek and Neumark, 2002) relies on HRS data
connected with social security earnings data. Three studies (Heinesen and Kolodziejczyk,
2013; Kolodziejczyk and Heinesen, 2016; Heinesen et al., 2017) use administrative data from
Denmark and one study (Jeon, 2017) uses census and administrative data from Canada. The
empirical approach in all of these studies is to follow individuals with cancer diagnoses over
time and compare their labor market outcomes to the outcomes of a matched control groups.
In addition, to increase credibility, Heinesen and Kolodziejczyk (2013) and Kolodziejczyk and
Heinesen (2016) also present estimates based on comparing people who have been diagnosed
with cancer with people who would be diagnosed in the future.

3.6.3   Studies

Connecting data from the first 1992 wave of the HRS with longitudinal social security earn-
ings data, Bradley, Bednarek and Neumark (2002) study what happens to women who survive
breast cancer relative to women who never had breast cancer. They find that breast cancer
survivors are approximately 10 percentage points less likely to work. However, conditional
on working, they work longer hours at higher wages, resulting in higher total earnings. The
authors think that the counterintuitive finding of higher wages, hours, and earnings is not
driven by selection bias but might be consistent with survivors needing to replenish financial
assets, survivors’ need for a full-time job for health insurance, and other causal mechanisms.
   In related work, Bradley, Neumark, Bednarek and Schenk (2005) use data from the
Metropolitan Detroit Cancer Surveillance System (MDCSS) database to identify women
diagnosed with breast cancer and analyze how their labor market attachment changes in the
six months following diagnosis. They use a sample of women from the Current Population
Survey (CPS) as controls for women diagnosed with cancer. The authors find a 17 percentage
point drop in employment six months after diagnosis. The effect is about twice as strong for
African-American women.
   In a pair of studies Bradley, Neumark, Luo and Bednarek (2007) and Bradley, Neumark
and Barkowski (2013) study how insurance impacts women’s labor market response to breast
cancer diagnosis. The authors follow 500 employed, married women after they are diagnosed
with breast cancer. Initially, these women either have employment-contingent health insur-
ance offered by their employer or are covered by their spouses’ health insurance. They also
construct a control group using the CPS. As expected, women whose health insurance is de-
pendent on being employed have a weaker labor supply response to breast cancer diagnosis.
The difference in the probability of remaining employed is small and usually not statistically
significant. The reduction in hours worked is 8-11% smaller for women who continue to work
and need their job for health insurance. The authors also present results from a survey where
they ask respondents about their reasons for continuing to work, these are also consistent

with health insurance induced job lock after cancer diagnosis.
   Using survey data on cancer survivors from the Penn State Cancer Survivor Survey
(PSCSS), Moran, Short and Hollenbeak (2011) study the longer-term employment conse-
quences of surviving cancer. The PSCSS followed a sample of 1,800 cancer survivors from
four large medical centers in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The authors also create a
matched control sample from the PSID. This study is focused on younger workers, ages 28-
54, relative to studies that use the HRS. Relative to people who are not cancer survivors,
the employment rate of cancer survivors is 28-30 percentage points lower if they develop
new cancers, and 3-4 percentage points lower if they remain cancer free. On average, the
reduction in hours worked is about 16 hours for the group with new cancers and 3-4 hours
for survivors without new cancers.
   Using administrative data from Denmark, Heinesen and Kolodziejczyk (2013) study what
happens to people diagnosed with colorectal or breast cancer relative to individuals not
diagnosed with these cancers. The richness of the comprehensive administrative data which
contains all Danes diagnosed with breast cancer or colorectal cancer in the years 2000-2004
allows for several credible identification strategies. First, the authors use propensity score
matching to identify a control group and then employ a difference-in-differences estimator
to analyze the differences in outcomes over time between the cancer and the control group.
They are also able to match people who are diagnosed with cancer with people who would
be diagnosed with cancer later. They are also able to study heterogeneity by education and
other factors. Three years after a cancer diagnosis, individuals with basic education are 10
percentage points more likely to be out of the labor force (9 percentage points more likely
to be on disability pension). The estimates are smaller for people with vocational education
(7 percentage points for labor force participation and 5.5 percentage points for disability
pension) and for people with further or higher education (4.5 percentages points for labor
force participation and 3.5 percentage points for disability pension). In follow-up work,
Kolodziejczyk and Heinesen (2016) show that there are differences in the consequences of


                                             100
cancer between the public and the private sector, and in particular the education gradients
are different. While in the public sector the impact of breast cancer on the likelihood of
being out the labor force is 11.5 percentage points vs 3.8 percentage points for the low- and
high-educated (a significant difference), in the private sector the corresponding estimates
are 6.2 and 3.2 percentage points (a marginally significant difference). In another follow-up
article, Heinesen et al. (2017) bring in survey data matched with the same administrative
datasets to consider the extent to which job satisfaction before cancer diagnosis can explain
heterogeneity in return-to-work behavior after diagnosis. They find that return-to-work
probability is correlated with job satisfaction but cannot explain the observed educational
gradient.
   Jeon (2017) links data from the Canadian Cancer Registry to administrative income
records. Using matching techniques to adjust for differences between individuals who survive
cancers and individuals who never have cancer, the author finds that cancer survivors are
5 percentage points less likely to work and earn 10% less on average than individuals who
didn’t have cancer.


3.6.4   Summary

Studies of cancer consistently find large labor supply effects, though naturally the magnitude
would vary across contexts and types of cancer. In the US, our best evidence comes from
a series of small-scale studies of women who survived breast cancer, while Heinesen and
Kolodziejczyk (2013) present complementary evidence using Danish administrative data. As
highlighted in other sections, important evidence is still lacking on what sorts of interven-
tions could decrease the impact of cancer on labor market outcomes. To understand what
interventions may be helpful, understanding the mechanisms through which cancer reduces
employment will be important.

3.7     Mental health

3.7.1   Introduction

As we make progress on physical health, the relative importance of mental health in deter-
mining labor market outcomes may be increasing. However, research on this topic is quite
difficult because even the measurement of mental health is challenging. Moreover, the en-
dogeneityof mental health to labor market outcomes is likely quite strong and stronger than
for physical health. This section summarizes the sparse literature on the impact of mental
health on labor market outcomes with the caveat that most identification methods are not
as credible as what we have seen for physical health.
   This subsection is based on a systematic review which started with searching the eco-
nomics literature on Google Scholar using the search terms ("mental" OR "psychiatric"
OR "depression") AND ("labor" OR "work" OR "earnings" OR "income") for years 2005-
2017. Our search returned an initial 74 results, however we only consider 11 studies that
are relevant to our review. These need to consider the impact of mental health on economic
outcomes, rather than the other way around, examine non-health endpoints (education or
economic outcomes), and be done in the US or other developed countries. In addition to
the Google Scholar search, we added a small number of studies that were referenced by
the studies we found through the systematic search but did not themselves come up in the
search (usually because they did not contain the keywords in their title). Mindful of the
slow publication process and the fast pace of some of the literature covered here, we also
included relevant NBER Working Papers from 2015-2017 from the Health and Labor Studies
programs.


3.7.2   Summary of methods

Studies of the impact of mental health on labor market outcomes rely on various surveys such
as the National Comorbidity Survey (NCS). Given the endogeneity of mental health to labor



                                            102
market outcomes and the likely importance of important unobservables, several instrumental
variables strategies have been proposed in the literature. The four most common instruments
are (i) pre-18 mental health conditions, (ii) parents’ mental health, (iii) religiosity, and (iv)
the availability of social services and support. Studies usually report OLS estimates and
2SLS estimates using these instruments. The key methodological consideration is whether
these instruments can be thought of as truly exogeneous. It is quite unlikely that in most
cases they would not be associated with labor market outcomes except through their effect
on mental health.

3.7.3   Studies

Ettner, Frank and Kessler (1997) use data from the National Comorbidity Survey (NCS),
a 1990-1992 interview survey of approximately 4,500 Americans of ages 15-54 to study the
impact of mental health conditions on labor market outcomes, including employment, hours,
and earnings. Mental health problems are measured as diagnosis of a set of conditions,
including depression, anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and others. In addition to simple OLS
and probit regressions of labor market outcomes on mental health diagnoses, the authors use
an instrumental variables approach, instrumenting for adult mental health with psychiatric
disorders experienced before age 18 and psychiatric disorders exhibited by the respondent’s
parents. The authors find that recent psychiatric problems reduce employment rates by
around 11 percentage points. Conditional on working, the reduction in hours is small, but
the reduction in earnings in substantial. The authors take this as evidence of a wage effect,
which we might interpret as a negative impact of mental illness on productivity.
   Using a survey of approximately 250 Montreal residents for the years 1985-1987, Hamil-
ton, Merrigan and Dufrense (1997) study the impact of mental health on employment. Men-
tal health is measured using the Psychiatric Symmptom Index (PSI). In order to account
for the endogeneity of mental health to employment, the authors use a maximum likelihood,
simultaneous equation generalized probit model. They find that employment status affects
mental health, but also mental health has a strong effect on employment.
   In a rare study of a medical intervention, Berndt et al. (1998) study the productivity
effects of providing individuals suffering from chronic depression with one of two antide-
pressant drugs for 12 weeks. The data come from a medical randomized clinical trial of
Zoloft, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) drug which was compared to an older
antidepressant drug called imipramine. 635 entered the trial and 493 completed it. Depres-
sion severity is measured using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), while work
performance is measured using six different indices which included questions on the subjec-
tive evaluation of work performance (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Cornell Dysthymia


                                            105
Rating Scale, L.I.F.E., Beck Inventory Scale, Quality of Life Questionnaire, and SAS-SR).
The authors find strong evidence that when antidepressants reduce depressive symptoms,
the subjective evaluation of work productivity improves.
   In another study of short-term productivity, Kessler et al. (1999) use data from the NCS
and the Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS) surveys. The authors report the
correlation between 30-day major depression and short-term work disability. They find that
the two are strongly related. People with major depression have 1.5 to 3.2 more short-term
work disability days.
   Using data from the Ontario Health Survey’s Mental Health Supplement from 1990-1991,
Dewa and Lin (2000) describe the impact of mental health problems on productivity. They
find that controlling for SES variables and work conditions, mental health conditions have
the largest impact on the number of partial effort and extra effort days. In other words,
when people with mental health problems show up for work, they require greater effort to
function at work.
   Alexandre and French (2001) study the relationship between depression and substance use
and employment in a poor area, Miami-Dade County, Florida. They use survey data collected
locally in 1996 and 1997 and measure depression using the Zung Self-Rating Diagnosis Scale.
They instrument for depression using religiosity and the availability of social support services.
They find that depression is strongly associated with employment. In an environment where
only 43 percent of the non-depressed are employed, employment is 24 percent, 19 percentage
points lower for the depressed. Even conditional on working, the depressed worked 7 to 8
weeks less per year than the non-depressed.
   In another analysis using the NCS, Marcotte and Wilcox-Gök (2003) estimate the impact
of mental health at different points of the earnings distribution. They use family history of
mental illness as an instrument for whether a worker suffers from mental health problems,
measured using the diagnostic interview measurement from the survey. The authors find
that mental illness has a much larger than average earnings effect at the lower tail of the


                                              106
earnings distribution.
   Chatterji, Alegria, Lu and Takeuchi (2007) use data from the National Latino and Asian
American Study (NLAAS), a 2002-2003 survey of approximately 2,600 Latinos and 2,100
Asians. Mental health is measured by whether the individual met diagnostic criteria for
at least one of fourteen mental health disorders in the past years. The authors use several
methods to attempt to control for the endogeneity of mental health to employment, includ-
ing controlling for a large set of demographic and other background variables, controlling for
past mental health in order to isolate the impact of current mental health, and using various
instruments for mental health (past mental health, religious activity). The authors find that
mental health problems have a large negative effect on the labor market outcomes of Latino
men and women. The reduction in employment for Asian men is large, but particularly
among Asian women, the negative labor market consequences of recent mental health prob-
lems are weaker and less consistent. The authors argue that this difference between Latinos
and Asians might arise because Asians are much more educated on average, and they have
better resources to cope with mental health problems.
   In another paper Chatterji, Alegria and Takeuchi (2011) use the National Comorbidity
Survey-Replication (NCS-R), a nationally representative survey from 2001-2003 to study
the impact of psychiatric disorders on labor market outcomes, including employment, hours
worked, and earnings. The definition of mental health diagnosis is similar to their previous
paper. In addition to OLS and bivariate probit estimates, the authors also try to come up
with plausibly exogeneous instruments for mental disorders. They use the early onset of a
disorder and parental mental health, controlling for a vector of personal characteristics as
their instruments. They also present results from an alternative selection on observables
approach, proxying for selection along unobserved dimensions with selection along observed
dimensions. They find that mental disorders have a strong negative impact on the labor
force participation and employment of males, the association is somewhat less stable for
women. The impact of mental health on labor market outcomes is along the extensive


                                             107
margin: conditional on working, they find no impact on hours or earnings.
   Ojeda, Frank, McGuire and Gilmer (2010) study how the impact of mental health on
work behavior differs between men and women and between immigrants and natives. They
use data from the 2002 National Survey on Drug Use and Health and define mental illness
based on the K6 scale of Mental Health and on the presence of Mania and Delusions symp-
toms. They attempt to instrument for mental illness using social support. They find that
immigrants’ labor supply is less responsive to mental health problems than the labor supply
of natives.
   Frijters, Johnston and Shields (2014) use panel data in order to overcome some of the
identification challenges inherent in the cross-sectional studies. Their data comes from ten
waves, between 2002 and 2011, of the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia
(HILDA) survey. This is a fairly large (approximately 14,000 participants) and representative
survey of the Australian population. They define mental health using the standard Short-
Form General Health Survey (SF-36) measure. In addition to using the panel structure of
the data to study the impact of changes in mental health on employment, they also employ
an instrumental variable, the death of a close friend. They find that declines in mental health
reduce employment significantly and the response is stronger for older workers.


3.7.4   Summary

As we have already highlighted, studying mental health is much more difficult than studying
physical health for a number of reasons: diagnoses are less clear and studies tend to rely
on surveys with small samples and a lot of potential measurement error. Nevertheless,
studying the impact of mental health on labor market outcomes is becoming more and more
important as treatments for physical health problems become more available and the health
burden shifts more towards mental health. The opioid epidemic presents its own challenges
not only for the healthcare system but for the labor market.

3.8     Summary

In this section we have highlighted several aspects of health that have well-identified and
large impacts on labor market outcomes. Studies have produced micro evidence that envi-
ronmental health impacts productivity negatively, health shocks are important in explaining
labor market transitions, and cancer and mental health issues are important conditions for
adult health and labor market outcomes. Here we highlight open issues and challenges in
the literature.
    The first issue is data access. In most of the subsections on adult health, there is typically
one study from a Scandinavian country that brings well-identified evidence using adminis-
trative data on the consequences of health issues. However, currently virtually no studies in
the American context are able to rely on administrative data to understand the impacts of
health on labor market outcomes because data from the two contexts are not possible to link.
Because the labor market impact of health is dependent on institutions (e.g., the generosity
of disability insurance), extrapolating from evidence produced using Scandinavian data is
difficult.
    The second issue is the importance of within-household spillovers. There is some evidence
establishing that health shocks impact spousal labor supply, but there is clearly more to do
on this question, and there is no work on spillover on children’s labor market outcomes. This
is partly also a data issue as data linked across family members is required to make progress
on these questions.
    The third issue is the importance of mental health. Studying mental health is more
difficult than studying physical health because of measurement issues. However, mental
health problems are becoming increasingly important for understanding adults’ labor market
outcomes. For example, the recent opioid epidemic affects groups with weak labor market
attachment, and so it has potentially large labor market consequences.
