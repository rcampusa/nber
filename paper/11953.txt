                                           ABSTRACT

The modern economic role of women emerged in four phases. The first three were evolutionary; the

last was revolutionary. Phase I occurred from the late nineteenth century to the 1920s; Phase II was

from 1930 to 1950; Phase III extended from 1950 to the late 1970s; and Phase IV, the "quiet

revolution," began in the late 1970s and is still ongoing. Three aspects of women's choices

distinguish the evolutionary from the revolutionary phases: horizon, identity, and decision-making.

The evolutionary phases are apparent in time-series data on labor force participation. The

revolutionary phase is discernible using time-series evidence on women's more predictable

attachment to the workplace, greater identity with career, and better ability to make joint decisions

with their spouses. Each of these series has a sharp break or inflection point signifying social and

economic change. These changes, moreover, coincide by birth cohort or period. The relationship

between the development of modern labor economics and the reality of women's changing economic

role is explored. The paper concludes by assessing whether the revolution has stalled or is being

reversed. Women who graduated college in the early 1980s did not "opt-out,"but recent cohorts are

too young to evaluate.

I. Evolutionary and Revolutionary Phases

       Women’s increased involvement in the economy was the most significant change in labor

markets during the past century. Their modern economic role emerged in the U.S. in four

distinct phases. The first three were evolutionary; the last was revolutionary. The revolution

was a “quiet” one, not the “big-bang” type. The evolutionary phases led, slowly, to the

revolutionary phase. I will first discuss the three evolutionary phases and how they led to the

revolutionary phase. I will then describe the changes that occurred during the revolutionary

phase, and end with whether the revolution, as some have claimed, is stalled or being reversed.

       I am not using the terms “evolution” and “revolution” lightly. By the term evolution and

the shift to revolution I mean something quite specific. The distinction between the two pertains

to three aspects of women’s choices and decisions. The first concerns “horizon.” That is,

whether at the time of human capital investment a woman perceives that her lifetime labor force

involvement will be long and continuous or intermittent and brief. The second concerns

“identity.”1 That is, whether a woman finds individuality in her job, occupation, profession, or

career. The third concerns “decision making.” Here the distinction is whether labor force

decisions are made fully jointly, if a woman is married or in a long term relationship, or, on the

other hand, whether the woman is a “secondary worker” who optimizes her time allocation by

taking her husband’s labor market decisions as given to her.

       Thus the transition from evolution to revolution was a change from static decision-

making, with limited or intermittent horizons, to dynamic decision making, with long-term

horizons. It was a change from agents who work because they and their families “need the

money” to those who are employed, at least in part, because occupation and employment define

affects their social interactions.

one’s fundamental identity and societal worth. It involved a change from “jobs” to “careers,”

where the distinction between these two concepts concerns both horizon and human capital

investment.2 Those in the evolutionary phases married early enough that their adult identity was

formed after marriage, whereas those in the revolutionary phase married late enough that their

identity formation could precede marriage. It was a change from passive actors, who take the

income and time allocation of other members as given, to active participants who bargain

somewhat effectively in the household and the labor market.

        The shift from evolution to revolution, moreover, did not occur only to more highly

educated women although they will be a focus of this essay. Rather, the changes were far more

universal, as can be seen in data on the age at first marriage, divorce, number and timing of

children, relative earnings, and labor market attachment.

        A chronology of the evolutionary phases is needed to understand the forces that led each

to morph into the other and ultimately to the revolutionary phase. Some change occurs to

cohorts and some is by period. Because working women range in age, typically from their late

teens to their sixties, these precise dates should be considered with respect to women in their

thirties. The chronology may be a bit different if another age group is chosen.

        Phase I occurred from the late nineteenth century to the 1920s; Phase II, a transition era,

was from about 1930 to 1950; and Phase III, the “roots of the revolution,” took place from 1950

to around the mid- to late-1970s. I date Phase IV, the quiet revolution, as beginning in the late-

2
  The distinction used here between “job” and “career” concerns the degree to which the individual
believes she will be in the labor force for a sufficient time to engage in substantial human capital
investment both in formal schooling and on-the-job training. Those whose participation will be
intermittent will take positions that involve less depreciation during work absences, whereas those with a
long time horizon of employment will take positions that require more formal education, involve more
internal promotion, and have a greater loss from out-of-work spells. These notions are similar to those in
Jacob Mincer and Solomon Polachek (1974) and are consistent with the dictionary definition of “career”
(e.g., “in mod. language [after Fr. carrière] freq. used for: A course of professional life or employment,
which affords opportunity for progress or advancement in the world” Oxford English Dictionary).


                                                            Goldin, Quiet Revolution, Ely Lecture 2
1970s, when the birth cohorts of the late 1940s were in their early thirties, and continuing to the

present, for the revolution is not over.

       What economic and social indicators reveal the outcomes of the phases? The primary

series used to demonstrate economic and social change is labor force participation as well as the

related series on annual hours of work and full-time work. But these series, I will show, reveal

more about the evolutionary phases rather than the revolutionary phase. One must seek other

series for evidence of the revolutionary phase.

       The series on labor force participation, full-time work, and annual hours of work are

fairly continuous, albeit with some periods of quickening. Although they do not reveal sharp

changes, the increase in participation and the greater number of hours worked by women was a

critical prerequisite for the transition from the evolutionary to the revolutionary phase. More

important, though, is that labor force participation by itself is not revolutionary in the sense that I

am using the word. Increased participation and greater hours of work need not involve changes

in horizon, identity, and decision-making. Women in poor countries, for example, are often

employed in the paid labor force to a considerable degree but few would claim they were part of

a societal and economic revolution. Adult women were employed in the United States

historically. Yet prior to the 1940s employed married women came disproportionately from the

lower part of the education distribution. Their identities, just like that of women in poor

countries, were not found in their occupations. Their decisions were made as secondary workers

and their market work effort evaporated when family incomes rose sufficiently.3

       The various series that disclose the revolutionary phase are wide ranging. They include

the expectations of future employment by teenaged girls, the determinants of life satisfaction,

various investments in human capital (such as college enrollment and graduation, college majors,

enrollment and graduation from professional and graduate schools), earnings relative to

comparable men, labor force participation of women with infants, lifetime labor force

participation, the age at first marriage, and the fraction of one’s life spent married. Each of these

series contains a sharp break or inflection point signifying social change. These inflection

points, moreover, are remarkably coincident in the approximately ten series I will present.

       The revolutionary part of the process—like many revolutions—was preceded by

fundamental, long-run, and evolutionary changes that were necessary but not sufficient for the

revolutionary phase. Before I get to the revolutionary phase, I must first explore the three

evolutionary phases, convince you that there was evolutionary and then revolutionary change,

and account for the changes. I will, in addition, link the evolutionary changes to pioneering

contributions to the subject of labor economics, mainly labor supply. I will then turn to the

revolutionary period and address whether an authentic, long-lasting revolution occurred or

whether the revolution has stalled or reversed. Although much that I have to say is well known

and widely accepted, I promise to provide newly uncovered facts and interpretations.



II. The Three Phases of Evolutionary Change and the Birth of Modern Labor Economics

       The evolutionary period, as I have noted, occurred in three phases. The shifts from one

phase to the next were due to various exogenous changes. These changes include the increased

relative demand for female office workers in the early twentieth century that made “nice” jobs

available and the growth of educational institutions at the secondary level from the 1910s to the

1940s that greatly increased the supply of potential office workers. Changes in household

production technology from the 1920s to the 1940s also altered female labor supply as did




                                                         Goldin, Quiet Revolution, Ely Lecture 4
institutional changes that made part-time work readily available and dispensed with barriers to

the employment of married women.

       Each of the phases produced different magnitudes for the two key parameters of labor

supply: the own-wage (compensated) elasticity and the income elasticity of the Slutsky equation.

When considerable social stigma existed concerning the paid work of wives, the income effect

was large (and negative). When, at the same time, the substitution effect was small, increased

demand could do little to increase women’s paid employment and higher incomes for husbands

operated in the opposite direction. Thus, the growth of married women’s employment had to

await various changes that altered the two parameters of the Slutsky equation. For various

reasons that will become clear, the substitution elasticity of labor supply eventually grew and the

income effect (in absolute value) shrank. In the late 1940s and 1950s labor demand began to

shift out across a rather elastic female labor supply function. The effect continued and married

women’s labor force participation rates climbed. Because the elasticities changed in each of the

phases, so did the relative importance of labor supply and labor demand in explaining the

increase in labor force participation and hours worked.

       Each evolutionary phase, moreover, led to major advances in the field of modern

empirical and theoretical labor economics that mirrored the reality of women’s changing role.

The study of labor was once mired in the institutions of the labor market. As women’s

employment expanded, economists began to study labor supply and the decisions made by

families and households. My discussion of the evolution of modern labor economics will stop

with developments in the 1960s as the field was firmly established by then and the list of

economists who made major contributions since the 1960s is too large to include here.

       Women’s labor market choices and decisions have become central to the field of labor




                                                          Goldin, Quiet Revolution, Ely Lecture 5
economics, as a perusal of any undergraduate text will demonstrate.4 It would not be much of an

exaggeration to claim that women gave “birth” to modern labor economics, especially labor

supply. Economists need variance to analyze changes in behavioral responses and women

provided an abundance of that. Men, by and large, were not as interesting since their

participation and hours varied far less in cross section and over time.

    A. Phase I: Late nineteenth century to the 1920s—The Independent Female Worker

       From the late nineteenth century to the 1920s female workers in the labor market, as

opposed to those working in the household or family business, were generally young and

unmarried. They were often piece workers in manufacturing or labored in the service sector as

domestics and laundresses. These women experienced little or no learning on the job and saw

only slight gain from formal human capital beyond common or elementary school, if that.5 A

scant minority were professional workers, often teachers, and clerical employees, a group that

expanded enormously beginning in the 1910s. The vast majority of women workers were poorly

educated, often from low-income households and those headed by a foreign-born individual.

During this phase the average married woman worker was less educated than the population

average, suggesting that the income effect greatly swamped the substitution effect.

       Prior to the 1920s women almost always exited the workforce at marriage although some

in poorer homes and among the more highly educated did not. Substantial social stigma

regarding the work of wives outside the home existed due in large measure to the nature of the

importance of research on women’s labor force participation, hours, earnings, occupations, household
production, human capital investment, and so forth. The index listing for “women” is more than three
times longer than that for “men,” and there are additional listings under “gender,” “discrimination,”
“maternity benefits,” and others relating directly to women.

  About 47 percent of all female workers in manufacturing in 1890 were paid by the piece and more than
30 percent of all white female workers in 1890 were in the service sector. In two surveys of working
women in 1907 in which formal education was asked the return to a year of education was between 1 and
2 percent estimated around six years of education (Goldin 1990, table 4.1).


                                                          Goldin, Quiet Revolution, Ely Lecture 6
work. Jobs were often dirty, dangerous, repetitive, and long in hours per day and days per week.

        The income elasticity was therefore large whereas the substitution elasticity was small,

although its precise magnitude is uncertain. The end result was that the (negative) income effect

from increased husbands’ income greatly exceeded the (positive) substitution effect from

increased wives’ earnings.6

        With a very inelastic labor supply function, the increase in female labor force

participation rates from 1890 to 1930—9.5 percentage points for women 25 to 44 years and 7.3

for married women 35 to 44 years (Figure 1)—must have resulted largely from shifts in the labor

supply function. In addition, the large negative income effect means that positive supply shifts

had to have been substantial in magnitude to outweigh the negative effect of increased husbands’

income.7

        The field of modern labor economics, like that of market work for married women, was

nascent at the dawn of the twentieth century. Female workers were of interest to economists

because of social policy issues, such as wage equity, the minimum wage, and maximum-hours

laws. Edith Abbott was among the most prolific of the economists researching women in the

early 1900s.8 She was also a historian who reminded her readers that lower-class women had

always worked if not in the market then at home, and that they faced a life no different from that

  See Goldin (1990), table 5.2 for data on the wage (uncompensated) elasticity (η), the own-substitution
(compensated wage) elasticity (ηs), and the income elasticity (ε) as estimated in eight cross-city studies
from around 1900 to 1970 and one time-series study for 1950 to 1980. The own-substitution
(compensated wage) elasticity (ηs) is calculated from the Slutsky equation: η = ηs – α·ε, where α = wife’s
full-time income divided by husband’s (or family’s) actual income.

  Positive supply shifters include the greatly increased education of young women, decreased fertility, the
greater number of “nice” jobs for women, and the related change in norms regarding women’s work.

  Edith Abbott published thirteen articles in the Journal of Political Economy from 1904 (two years
before she received her Ph.D. in economics from the University of Chicago) to 1911 (nineteen from 1904
to 1925), and she had six in the American Journal of Sociology from 1908 to 1911. She also published
about twenty books in her lifetime, most of which concerned progressive social reform issues such as
housing, immigrants, crime, prisons, and truancy, in addition to women’s employment and its history.

of their grandmothers. But the woman’s movement, the first generations of college women, and

the drive for the franchise held the promise of real change for Abbott, who observed that middle-

class workingwomen were embarking on a “social revolution” (Abbott 1906). Richard T. Ely, a

founder of the American Economic Association, its first secretary and sixth president, and whom

this lecture memorializes, called the period the “Era of Woman” and in reaction to a call for

restrictions on women to protect men’s jobs averred, “Revolutions do not go backward.”9

Despite the optimism of Abbott and Ely, the revolution in women’s work would take another

seventy-five years and some today believe it is going backwards, a view I will evaluate in this

essay.

    B. Phase II: 1930s to 1950—Easing the Constraints on Married Women’s Work

         From 1930 to 1950 the labor force participation rate for married women 35 to 44 years

old increased by 15.5 percentage points, or from about 10 percent to 25 percent (Figure 1).

Whereas just 8 percent of employed women were married in 1890, 26 percent were in 1930 and

47 percent were in 1950. The fraction of single women in the labor force had not declined by

much. Rather the labor force participation of married women had increased substantially.

         The shift from Phase I to Phase II came about because of several complementary factors

that were, in large measure, exogenous to female labor supply. The most important were the

greatly increased demand for office and other clerical workers beginning in the early 1900s with

the arrival of new types of information technologies and the enormous growth in high school

enrollment and graduation from 1910 to 1930. The fraction of the female labor force (non-farm)

employed as clerical workers rose from 6 percent in 1900 to 23 percent in 1930; whereas women

the 1890s it may not have required a reference since it was so well known.

were 24 percent of clerical workers in 1900 they were 52 percent of them in 1930.10 Nationwide,

high school graduation rates increased from 9 percent in 1910 to 27 percent in 1928. In the

states outside the South the increase was from 11 percent to 32 percent and to 56 percent by

1938.11

          Both the increased demand for clerical workers and the increased supply of high school

graduates meant that, prior to marriage, young women entered nicer, cleaner, shorter-hour, and

thus more “respectable” jobs. Some remained employed after marriage, although levels were

insubstantial until the 1940s. Part of the exodus at marriage was due to the institution of

marriage bars, which were regulations that forced single women to leave employment upon

marriage and barred the hire of married women. These bars existed in many school districts and

some clerical employments especially in the 1930s but were almost entirely eliminated after the

early 1940s.12

          As work for women became more accepted, particularly by their husbands, the income

effect declined. At the same time the substitution effect rose substantially. One of the reasons

for the increase substitution effect concerns the rise of part-time work. Although weekly hours

of work had been substantially reduced from 1900 to 1930, part-time work was a rarity.13 The

absence of hours and days flexibility placed bounds on the substitution elasticity. As the real

wage for women rose, the margin of change was participation, not hours. In consequence a

smaller increase in both hours and employment could occur than had there been greater

   Hours of work in private, non-agricultural employment decreased from about 60 per week in 1900 to
below 45 per week in 1930, just before the large, and mainly temporary, decline during the Great
Depression (Goldin 2000). On the paucity of part-time work in the pre-1940 era see Goldin (1990,
chapter 6).

flexibility in hours (and days) of work. With the creation of scheduled part-time work in the

1940s and its enormous diffusion in the 1950s, the substitution effect became larger.

Reinforcing factors include the almost complete diffusion of modern, electric household

technologies, such as the refrigerator and the washing machine and the previous diffusion of

basic facilities such as electricity, running water, and the flush toilet.14 The reduced price of

these appliances served to decrease women’s reservation wage and increase the elasticity of the

aggregate female labor supply function.

        The reason for the increase in female labor force participation during Phase II is

complicated by changes in both the income and substitution elasticities of female labor supply.

The factors responsible for increased female labor force participation in the early part of the

phase were primarily shifts in the labor supply function, similar to the discussion for Phase I,

since supply was rather inelastic. But in the second part of Phase II, labor supply became more

elastic and both supply and demand shifts played a role in increasing female participation. As

labor supply became even more elastic, as will be discussed for Phase III, labor demand shifts

would swamp those on the supply side.

        As married women began to enter the labor market in greater numbers, labor economists

analyzed female labor supply decisions in the context of the family unit, rather than the

individual, and inquired about the influence of husband’s income on wife’s “gainful

  Jeremy Greenwood, Ananth Seshadri, and Mehmet Yorukoglu (2005, figure1), who emphasizes the
role of household technology in increasing women’s labor market participation, has compiled data on
adoption percentages for “basic facilities,” such as electricity and indoor plumbing, and household
electrical appliances. Most basic facilities had been adopted in 60 to 90 percent of households by 1950.
In terms of appliances 80 percent had refrigerators by 1950, and about 60 percent had vacuum cleaners
and electric washers. Omitted from this work is the use of market substitutes for home appliances. About
70 percent of the households in the 1917/19 Cost of Living Survey, which included primarily middle-
income families, used commercial laundry services and spent enough to do 6 to 7 pounds per week; 33
percent ate meals in restaurants; and 16 percent employed servants (Moehling 2001).

employment.”15 Interest initially emerged from an investigation of backward bending labor

supply functions by Paul H. Douglas (1934, 1937 with Erika H. Schoenberg). By exploring the

labor supply of men and women across cities Douglas noticed that married women’s gainful

employment was negatively related to husband’s income. The evidence suggested a rather large

income effect, “a freeing of married women from the necessity of working outside the home”

(1937, p. 61). But this large negative income effect would soon begin to decline in (absolute)

magnitude. Had it not, married women’s labor force participation would never have greatly

increased.

     C. Phase III: 1950s to 1970s—Roots of the Revolution

        Married women’s labor force participation continued to expand in the 1950s to 1970s,

greatly at first for an older group of women (45 to 54 years old) and with soaring rates later for a

younger group (25 to 34 years old). For married women in the 35 to 44 year old group,

participation increased from 25 to 46 percent from 1950 to 1970 (Figure 1).

        In the 1940s and 1950s female labor supply had become considerably more elastic and

thus more responsive to changes in wages. At the same time, the income effect continued its

downward trend as work for married women became more acceptable.16 The average married

workingwoman by the 1940s was more educated that the average married women in the

population, a reverse of my previous observation and another indication that the substitution

effect had begun to swamp the income effect.

        Many factors contributed to the increase in the own-wage elasticity. One was the


15
   The distinction between labor force participation and “gainful employment” is that the former concept
was introduced with the 1940 census, whereas previously the question asked was the occupation in which
the individual was “gainfully employed.”
16
   See Goldin (1990, table 5.2) for labor supply elasticity estimates from 1900 to 1980. The evidence for
1940 to 1960 relies on cross-city estimates from the work of Bowen and Finegan (1969), Mincer (1962),
and Cain (1966).

creation of scheduled part-time employment. The availability of part-time work by firms led to

an increase in those working less than 35 hours per week from 18 percent of the female labor

force in 1940 to 28 percent in 1960 and from 14 percent of the female sales sector in 1940 to 40

percent in 1960. Another factor was the greater acceptance of married women in the labor force

and the almost complete end of marriage bars.

        Labor supply had become sufficiently elastic and the income elasticity sufficiently small

that most of the increase in female labor force participation and hours of work during Phase III

was demand driven. The demand function for labor increased rapidly over a relatively stable and

highly elastic female labor supply function.

        But despite large gains in employment, married women were still the secondary earners

in their households. They took the labor supply decisions of their husbands as given; they were

tied stayers at times and tied movers at others. Their human capital continued to increase, but

the investments occurred mainly off the job in formal education or vocational training, rather

than on the job. Secretaries, teachers, nurses, social workers, and librarians, among others, came

to their jobs with most of the necessary skills. Some advancement was possible in offices and

elsewhere but not much, according to most estimates of earnings functions. Interviews for first

jobs, even those of college graduate women, often began with the straightforward question:

“How well do you type?”17



17
  In a U.S. Department of Labor, Women’s Bureau survey of college women who graduated in the class
of 1957, a surprisingly large fraction remarked that they were asked how well they could type in their first
job interview (Source: 1957/64 College Graduate Survey, see Goldin 1990, p. 230). Supreme Court
Justice Sandra Day O’Connor has often recounted that her first job interview, obtained through personal
contacts, after graduating near the top of her 1952 Stanford Law School class landed her a position as a
legal secretary and no California law firm offered her a position as a lawyer. In Rona Jaffe’s best-selling
novel and movie, The Best of Everything (1958), the main character graduated from Radcliffe in the
1950s and assumed a secretarial position in a publishing house with the hopes of becoming an editor.
Among college graduate women 30 to 34 years old in the 1950 U.S. federal population census, 9.7

        Even though many would eventually be employed for a significant portion of their lives,

their expectations of future employment, when they were young, were quite different. Women

born from 1931 to 1940, for example, were eventually employed for more than 40 percent of

their post-schooling years (up to around age fifty); the figure is 55 percent for those born from

1941 to 1950.18 Most of these women had anticipated brief and intermittent employment in

various jobs, not generally in a career. Some trained for the remote possibility that they would

have to support themselves later in life. College, for many, was a way to meet a suitable spouse

rather than a way to embark on a career. Their investments in education and training were

consistent with their expectations. But they were in for a great surprise.

        The Phase III decades were ones of great expansion of the female labor force and also

immense strides in modern labor economics. Clarence Long (1958) picked up where Paul

Douglas had left off.19 Long was an empirical economist who explored the large increase in

married women’s labor force participation from 1890 to the 1950s and was puzzled by an

apparent inconsistency. Cross-section labor supply estimates for 1940 from the U.S. census and

for 1951 and 1956 from the Current Population Reports revealed substantial negative effects

from increases in husband’s income.20 The time series data clearly showed growth in female

labor supply. Because husbands’ income had increased substantially the two findings were

apparently inconsistent. Long’s attempt to resolve the paradox between the cross section


percent were secretaries and 19 percent were clerical workers. The occupation of “secretary” was the
second most numerous behind teaching and was slightly more important than that of “nurse.”
18
   These figures are calculated from the Panel Study in Income Dynamics (PSID), 1968 to 2003, and are
for the unweighted sample of white women.
19
   John D. Durand (1948) also added to the literature on the causes of change and emphasized altered
customs and norms fostered by what he termed “the succession of generations.”
20
   Clarence Long (1958, chapter 7) used aggregated data at the city level. The 1950 census published
tables were not yet available. Note that Long did not directly consider the existence of a substitution
effect in addition to an income effect. Although he tried to assess the effects of increased female
education he compared the relative levels of education for older men with those of various groups of
women rather than assessing the differences these levels meant for women’s employment and earnings.


                                                           Goldin, Quiet Revolution, Ely Lecture 13
estimates and the time series data was to argue that the female labor supply function shifted

outward and to explore some of the reasons, such as advances in household production. He

concluded that although these factors moved in the right direction, their magnitude was

insufficient.

        Jacob Mincer (1962) resolved the apparent paradox between the time series and cross

section results by considering both the income and substitution effects.21 He also recognized that

individual-level cross-section estimates of the income effect would be potentially biased upwards

for use in time-series simulations. The reason was that husband’s incomes in cross section

contain a transitory component to which wives would respond, whereas the time series averages

had less of the transitory and more of the permanent component. According to Mincer, the use

of city-level data reduced the transitory component of husband’s income and produced

coefficient estimates appropriate for use in the time series simulation. The resulting substitution

effect was considerably greater than the income effect and the apparent paradox was resolved.

As real incomes rose, the labor force participation rate of married women increased even though

the earnings of women relative to those of men advanced only slightly.

        Major advances in labor economics, mostly associated with the work of Gary Becker,

extended the analysis of women as part of a family unit.22 Fertility became an endogenous

variable; marriage was analyzed as a market; divorce was a possibility and a threat point. The


21
   Mincer, in an interview with me in 2002, recounted the course he took from Albert Rees during his
post-graduate stint at the University of Chicago. “Al Rees spent that particular quarter reporting on the
book by Clarence Long … [and] this paradox that if the husband’s income was high the woman was
unlikely to be in the labor force. But over time income grew for both husband and wife, and there was an
increase in participation rather than a decrease … I was sitting in Al Rees’ class and I asked myself “what
about taking two variables rather than one?” We had income and prices or wages. Shouldn’t that tell
what was going on? It could, if the price effect was stronger than the income effect. But then you have to
bring in the family.”
22
   See Gary S. Becker (1981), although many of the articles on marriage, fertility, and the family were
first published in the 1960s and 1970s.


                                                             Goldin, Quiet Revolution, Ely Lecture 14

III. The Quiet Revolution—Phase IV: Late 1970s to the present

     A. Revolutionary indicators

          Most labor force participation measures do not divulge that there was a revolution in

women’s economic status since the late 1970s. An exception is the labor force participation rate

for married women (20 to 44 years old) with a child under the age of one year, which soared

from 0.20 in 1973 to 0.62 in 2000.24 But in general participation rates for married women, as

well as rates for the fraction working full-time, reveal only small increases in the past several

decades.25 In contrast, married women’s labor force participation increased greatly in

evolutionary Phases II and III. As I discussed earlier, the labor force participation rate, by itself,

is not a reliable indicator of a social and economic revolution. The increase in participation

during Phase III, however, was to become an important precondition for the quiet revolution for

reasons that will become clear.

          If soaring participation rates are a precondition but not a sign of the revolution, then what

are its indicators? Revolutionary indicators are found in various series that reflect the three

Marjorie B. McElroy and Mary Jean Horney (1981), as well as a novel version by Shelly Lundberg and
Robert A. Pollak (1993).
24
   March Current Population Survey (CPS), for white non-Hispanic women. A decline since the year
2000 may be apparent to some but it has lasted for too brief a period and in too sluggish a macro-
economy for any definitive statement concerning whether the labor force participation rate of mothers
with infants has declined.
25
   The decreases in the last five years are probably due to macroeconomic phenomena since participation
rates for men have also dropped.


                                                           Goldin, Quiet Revolution, Ely Lecture 15
changes mentioned previously: horizon, identity, and decision-making.26 I will mainly discuss

the first two. In almost all cases the turning points of the indicator series are strikingly similar by

cohort. For marriage age, college graduation, and professional school enrollment, the turning

points were all around 1970. Changes in occupations occurred in the early 1970s. For earnings

relative to comparable men, the turning point was a bit later, around 1980. Expectations

regarding future work, social norms concerning women’s family and career, and factors

accounting for women’s life satisfaction began to change in the late 1960s and 1970s. Some of

the changes were preconditions for others, such as college majors, professional school

enrollment, and occupational change. Their synchronicity should not be surprising. The series,

taken together, present a logical progression.

        1. Expanded horizons

        By expanded horizons I mean that women more accurately anticipated their future work

lives.27 With more accurate expectations they could better prepare by investing in formal

education and they could assume positions that involved advancement. That is, they could plan

for careers rather than jobs.

        The revolutionary phase began with cohorts born in the late 1940s who were teenagers in

the mid-1960s. These young women began to perceive that their adult lives would differ

substantially from those of their mothers’ generation. Their expectations of future employment

when they were in their mid to late teens can be gleaned from the National Longitudinal Survey


26
   On decision-making and bargaining during Phase IV, see the evidence in Dora Costa and Matthew
Kahn (2000), which suggests greater equality in location decisions, at least among college graduates.
That bargaining with one’s employer may not be female-friendly, see Linda Babcock and Sara Laschever
(2004).
27
   They did not, however, do a very good job forecasting their future family size. A far greater fraction of
women in the College and Beyond data set (to be discussed) responded as freshmen (in the Astin survey)
that they expected to have children than actually did—82 percent (at about 18 years old) said they
expected to have children but only 69 percent actually did (by 37 years old).


                                                             Goldin, Quiet Revolution, Ely Lecture 16
of Young Women, which began with 14 to 24 year olds in 1968, and the National Longitudinal

Survey of Youth, which began with 14 to 21 year olds in 1979. Both surveys asked similar

questions about expectations of paid employment at age 35. Their responses can be linked by

respondent age to see how expectations changed over time for young women of various ages

(Figure 2).

        Young women in their late teens, during the 1970s, upwardly revised their expectations

of being in the paid labor force when they were older. They began with expectations similar to

the actual participation of their mothers’ generation (their prediction was around 0.33 whereas

their mothers’ actual rate was about 0.3). But in the next ten years young women began to

correctly anticipate, and in fact slightly overstate, their future labor force participation rates. By

1974 young women were predicting their participation rate to be in the 0.55 to 0.65 range.

Actual rates for 35 year olds had risen to 0.46 in 1974, but women in their late twenties had

experienced large increases in the early 1970s, suggesting greater future advances for those in

their thirties. By the late 1970s young women were predicting participation rates above 0.80,

whereas the actual rate in 1978 was 0.56. By the time the NLS youth were thirty-five years old

the participation rate was about 0.75.28 Young women gained horizon and perceived that their

lives would differ from their elders.29 Their revised expectations of future employment, in turn,

led young women to continue with college and graduate.30


28
   Actual labor force participation rates are from the CPS and are for married, white women averaged for
ages 34 to 36. The figure of 0.3 for their mothers is for 1962. Data from the two NLS surveys are for
white females only.
29
   Young women in the early 1970s may have been enabled to make more informed extrapolations
because the resurgence of feminism at the time supported challenging older ways and norms.
30
   Goldin, Lawrence F. Katz, and Ilyana Kuziemko (2005) find that among female pre-college teens (who
were 14 to 18 years old in 1968) those who stated that they would be in the labor force when they were 35
years old had eventual college graduation rates that were 14.3 percentage points higher than those who
said they would be “at home, with family” at age 35 years. Those in the former group had a mean
graduation rate of 32.8 percent whereas the mean graduation rate for the latter group was 18.5 percent.


                                                           Goldin, Quiet Revolution, Ely Lecture 17
        Girls, in the 1970s and 1980s, began to take more college preparation courses in high

school and narrowed the gap between their science and math course-taking and that of boys.

Relative to boys, girls increased their aptitude scores in math and reading. They increased their

math scores by one-quarter of a standard deviation and their reading scores by one-fifth of a

standard deviation, so that in 1992 girls who were high school seniors were just slightly behind

boys in math and considerably ahead in reading.31

        In consequence, females greatly increased their college going and graduation rates

relative to males beginning with birth cohorts in the late 1940s. For the earliest birth cohorts

shown in Figure 3, from 1877 to the 1910s, college attendance rates were fairly equal, in part

because women often attended two-year teacher training schools. With the cohorts born in the

late 1910s and 1920s large differences emerged between male and female college going and

graduation rates. From the cohorts born in the 1930s to the late 1940s males had a 10 percentage

point lead in attendance and almost the same for graduation. But with the cohorts born in the

late 1940s the lead was swiftly eliminated for both attendance and graduation.

        A set of related changes during the same period occurred to college women. The median

age at first marriage increased by an astounding 2.5 years for college graduate women born

between 1949 and 1956, that is for those married in the early 1970s to those married in the early

1980s (Figure 4). The age at first marriage continued to climb by another year during the next

decade. A similar increase in the age at first marriage also occurred to women who attended but

did not graduate from a four-year college.

        The median college graduate woman from the 1950s to the early 1970s was married


31
  The relative increases in math and science courses and math and reading aptitude test scores are from a
comparison of the NLS72 and the NELS88. The changes are consistent with those from the National
Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), although somewhat larger, and U.S. Department of
Education transcript surveys (Goldin, Katz, and Kuziemko 2005).


                                                            Goldin, Quiet Revolution, Ely Lecture 18
within a year after college graduation—at 22.5 years old. But by the early-1980s the median

college graduate woman married at 25 years old. With a later age at first marriage women could

take college more seriously. Most women who had married within a year of graduation must

have met their future husbands while in college, possibly in the same college. Although some

aspects of college social life did not differ much across these generations, the pressure to meet a

spouse while in college diminished considerably.

       Not only did women increase their attendance and graduation from college more than did

men, they also began to close the gap with men in college majors. Whereas in 1970 a standard

dissimilarity index for college majors between men and women exceeded 0.5, it fell to about 0.3

in 1985 (Goldin 2005). Both men and women increased their majors in business administration,

but women did to a greater extent and reduced their concentrations in the more traditional female

fields of education, literature, languages, and home economics. Women’s majors shifted from

those that were “consumption” related to those that were “investment” related.

       Women also began to further their education in professional and graduate schools around

1970 (Figure 5). Whereas in the late 1960s one in twenty entering law school students was a

woman, two out of five were in 1980, and parity was reached in the early 2000s. A similar trend

occurred for medical students. The increase in the fraction female also rose for other

professional programs including dentistry, business administration, veterinary medicine,

optometry, and pharmacy. Most important is that the turning points for the four professions

given in Figure 5 all occurred during the early 1970s.

       With longer and more informed horizons, years of accumulated job experience increased

and the returns to job experience increased as well. Most estimates of returns to experience from

the 1970s and 1980s show that returns increased for women by a very large amount but that




                                                         Goldin, Quiet Revolution, Ely Lecture 19
returns increased by a rather small amount for men.32 Greater and more appropriate levels of

human capital investment are one possible reason why returns to job experience increased for

women relative to men. Other possible reasons include antidiscrimination laws and

governmental interventions to enforce them.

        2. Altered identities

        The revolution can also been seen in the changed outlook of women concerning their

individual identities. As women married later, they could “make a name” for themselves before

having to chose to change their name. In the 1970s and continuing to the 1980s more women

retained their surname upon marriage, particularly among those who had advanced degrees.

Virtually all married women took their husband’s name in the early 1970s. By 1990 about 20

percent of all college graduate women retained their surname at marriage, although during the

1990s the percentage declined somewhat (Goldin and Maria Shim 2004).

        Ever since the mid-1960s a significant fraction of American college freshmen have been

surveyed about their future personal satisfaction and the relative roles of family, finances,

community, meaningful philosophy of life, helping others, and career success. Beginning in the

early 1970s, women placed greater emphasis on coworker recognition and career success in the

factors they believed would be important to their personal satisfaction and they placed far less

emphasis on their concern with others.33 Their responses, moreover, became more similar to


32
   On the increase in returns to experience see Francine Blau and Lawrence Kahn (1997), Claudia Olivetti
(2001), and June O’Neill and Polachek (1993). On the increase in hours of work due to the increase in
returns, see Olivetti (2005). Although all agree that returns increased more for women than men, the
magnitudes reported differ. Blau and Kahn, and O’Neill and Polachek report a doubling of the returns to
women. Olivetti shows for a somewhat longer period (1970s and 1990s) that women’s returns increased
by around 25 percent and men’s by from 6 to 9 percent.
33
   Concern with others can be observed in the objectives “helping others who are in difficulty,”
“participating in community action program,” and “helping to promote racial understanding.” All of
these objectives declined in importance and fell more for women than men in terms of their overall
significance to the individual.


                                                           Goldin, Quiet Revolution, Ely Lecture 20
those of comparable men entering college. In the Survey of American Freshmen (Alexander W.

Astin, et al. 2002), females increased the weight they placed on recognition by colleagues and

financial success; males increased their relative weight on family (Figure 6). By the early 1980s

men and women gave about equal weight to recognition and family. Women had changed

considerably and were far more concerned with their own personal success and family, although

men still placed more weight on financial success.

        Alterations in identity are reflected in continued changes to the parameters of the Slutsky

equation. Both income and substitution elasticities decreased substantially in (absolute)

magnitude for all education groups of women in the 1980s and again in the 1990s.34 The

decrease in the income elasticity continued its twentieth century trend downward. The decrease

in the substitution effect sharply reversed its trend upward in the first two-thirds of the century.35

By the 1990s income and substitution effects of the labor supply function, while still somewhat

greater for women than for men, were more similar than estimated values at any other time.

        Changes in the income and substitution effects reflect a fundamental transformation in

how women view their employment. Rather than jobs, most see employment as part of a long-

term career. Most perceive their work as a fundamental aspect of their satisfaction in life and

view their place of work as an integral part of their social world. They have added identity to

their decision about whether to work or not to work given changes in wages and incomes. In

consequence women have become stickier in their labor force attachment. Leaving the

workplace involves a loss in identity for a woman, just as being unemployed or retired has

34
   According to Blau and Kahn (2005) married women’s own wage elasticity (with respect to hours of
work) fell by 50 to 56 percent from 1980 to 2000 and the elasticity of hours with respect to husband’s
income fell by 38 to 47 percent. Similar results are found for participation. Their results are robust to
alternative specifications and corrections for various types of selectivity bias.
35
   The unit of observation in Blau and Kahn (2005) is the individual whereas that in the eight studies for
the pre-1970s period is the city. The Blau and Kahn finding of a reduction (in absolute value) in the two
elasticities within the 1980 to 2000 period allows one to make inferences about the longer period.


                                                             Goldin, Quiet Revolution, Ely Lecture 21
commonly involved a loss of prestige and social belonging to most men. Income and

substitution effects changed for women in low and high-income families alike and for those at

almost all levels of schooling. Ethnographic research corroborates the empirical finding that low

income and even poor women increased their attachment to the workplace as a source of

personal identity.36

        3. Relative earnings and occupations

        The result of expanded horizons and altered identities was that younger cohorts of

women were considerably better prepared to enter the labor market and were determined to have

careers. These changes are reflected in their occupations and earnings relative to those of men.

The earnings of women relative to those of men began to increase around 1980 after remaining

flat since the 1950s (Figure 7).37 Much of the increase was due to women’s greater job

experience and to their more market relevant skills as reflected in the increased return to

experience.38 Occupations shifted, not surprisingly, from those that had been considered

traditional ones for women, such as teacher, nurse, librarian, and social worker, to a varied group

of professions including lawyer, physician, professor, and manager (Figure 8). But it has also

been noted that even within cohorts the earnings of women increased relative to those of men,

suggesting that change may have diffused to those in their middle-age and was caused, at least in


36
   Typical of the findings in the ethnographic literature is Lillian Rubin (1994) who did a similar study
two decades before. “Universally, the women I interviewed work because they must. Almost as often
they find a level of self-fulfillment and satisfaction on the job that they’re loath to give up” (p. 81). With
regard to changes in their sense of fairness in the labor market, Rubin writes: “Now all the women, even
those who greeted the idea with reservations two decades ago, endorse the principle of equal pay without
equivocation” (p. 83). With greater attachment to their positions, they demanded to be treated as the
equals of men.
37
   The ratio of female to male hourly earnings is higher than that for full-time, year-round workers
because men work more hours even among those working full-time.
38
   O’Neill and Polachek (1993) decompose the increase in relative earnings for women and find that
increased returns to experience accounts for a larger fraction of the difference than the increase in work
experience. They do not, however, explain the increase in returns to experience in terms of better
preparation for the labor market or better treatment by the labor market.


                                                               Goldin, Quiet Revolution, Ely Lecture 22
part, by changes within the labor market or imposed on it by anti-discrimination legislation.

   B. What caused the revolution?

       Jacob Mincer was right. In the 1950s and 1960s labor demand increased greatly and for

women it raced across a relatively stable and rather elastic labor supply function. But many of

the women in Phase III were caught by surprise. They had incorrectly anticipated their future

labor force participation. They were often trapped in positions that involved little advancement.

College women had majored in fields that were more consumption than investment oriented.

Few had continued to professional and graduate schools.

       But the next generation observed the large increase in participation and in full-time work

of their immediate predecessors. They extrapolated on that basis to form more accurate

expectations for their futures. In doing so they were better prepared to invest in human capital.

As high school students they took more college preparation courses and their aptitude test scores

rose relative to those of boys. They greatly increased their college attendance and graduation.

At college they altered their college majors toward those that were more valuable in the labor

market and less valuable at home, and they continued with post-graduate education to a far

greater extent than did previous generations.

       The age at first marriage for college women increased with cohorts born around 1950.

Marriage delay enabled women to take formal education more seriously and led to changes in

their relationship to work. The period divorce rate began to increase in the 1960s. The

combination of the increase in divorce and the later age at first marriage for all women meant

that the fraction of their lives they would spend married plummeted and economic independence

became more valuable (Figure 9). These changes altered the identity of women and shifted it

from a family and household centered world to a wider one that was more career oriented.




                                                        Goldin, Quiet Revolution, Ely Lecture 23
        One of the reasons for the increase in the age at first marriage was the introduction of the

contraceptive “pill.” Although the pill was approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a

contraceptive in 1960 and quickly diffused among married women, young single women found it

harder to obtain due to restrictive state laws. Legal changes at the state level, such as mature

minor decisions and the increased age of majority that mainly occurred from the late 1960s and

early 1970s, enabled young women to obtain the pill, even though the rulings and legal changes

were not normally intended for that purpose.39 As the pill diffused through the young, unmarried

population a potent reason for early marriage disappeared. With a larger group of single

individuals others could afford to wait and a multiplier effect added to the increased age at first

marriage.40 As the age at first marriage increased, women could be more serious in college, plan

for an independent future, and form their identities before marriage and family.41



IV. Has the Quiet Revolution Stalled?

     A. Is there a “natural rate” of female labor force participation?

        Female labor force participation rates and the fraction working full-time are no longer

soaring, let alone rising. Participation rates for women of almost all ages, education levels, and

marital statuses seem to have leveled off since around 1990 after rising non-stop for at least the

last century (Figure 1). The participation rate of married college graduate women in their


39
   In fact, many states increased their age at majority after passage of the Twenty-Sixth Amendment to the
U.S. Constitution in July 1971 that lowered the minimum voting age to eighteen.
40
   Goldin and Katz (2002) describe the model that generates an increased age at first marriage with the
diffusion of the pill and provide evidence concerning the timing of the pill’s spread among young women.
41
   Why divorce increased is a more contentious issue. Some thought the increase was due to the legal
changes of the 1960s that relaxed divorce statutes in various states and allowed unilateral divorce. Others
posited, along the lines of the Coase Theorem, that the legal changes should not have mattered. The
empirical literature shows that the immediate effect of the laws was to increase divorce but that after a
decade divorce rates revert to their initial levels. For a summary of the debate and an empirical analysis
of the short and long-run effects of legal changes, see Justin Wolfers (2003).

thirties, for example, has hovered around 76 percent since 1990. For high school graduate

married women in their thirties a rate of about 72 percent has been sustained for the past fifteen

years.42 Thus a plateau in female labor force participation appears to have been reached a decade

and a half ago.43 The participation rate for women with infants may have even declined. These

facts have led many to wonder if some type of “natural rate” of female labor force participation

has been reached. Since participation rates are bounded above by one, the question is really

whether the natural rate is lower than some had thought it would be.

        Whether or not the data support a natural rate hypothesis depends on the particular age

group examined. For women in their thirties, a natural rate does not appear to have been

reached, even though a leveling off has occurred. The reason the evidence does not yet support

the natural rate notion concerns changed demographics.

        With a later age at marriage and a delay of child bearing, women in their thirties now

have a higher probability of having a child under the age of six than they did twenty-five years

ago and about an equal probability as in the mid-1960s (Figure 10).44 Despite this greater child

burden, participation rates for women in their thirties are higher today than in the early 1980s

and far higher than in the 1960s. During the past two decades, the participation rate of this group

has remained relatively stable and substantial. Thus, rather than peaking or declining, their

participation rates appear to be keeping up given the changed demographics.

        The participation rate for 33 to 37 year old married college women, for example, was 77


42
   The data given are from the March Current Population Survey (CPS). Similar data for women in their
forties show slightly higher rates.
43
   The plateau in most labor force participation series began in the early to mid-1990s during a weak
economy but was sustained during the boom economy of the late 1990s. Therefore, it would not appear
that the macro-economy was solely to blame. The dip in participation in the early 2000s, however, was
due to the low employment growth.
44
   The number of children per mother was greater in the past even though the fraction with children under
the age of six years is greater today.


                                                            Goldin, Quiet Revolution, Ely Lecture 25
percent in 1999 while the fraction with children under the age of six was 61 percent (Figure

10).45 In 1965 just 40 percent were in the labor force and 57 percent had children under six years

old. Participation rates increased from 1965 to 1999 by 37 percentage points while the child

burden actually increased, by 4 percentage points.46 From 1980 to 1999 participation rates rose

11 percentage points while the kid burden rose 12 percentage points, and from 1990 to 1999 both

participation rates rose and the kid burden rose by about 2.5 percentage points.

        The notion that a natural rate has been reached does not appear to be supported for these

“thirty-something” year olds. Rather, these women appear to be committed to the labor force

probably because they were in the labor force far longer before they married, invested more in

formal and informal training, and shaped their identities before having children.

        What about women in their twenties? Once again, consider the college graduate woman,

this time for all marital statuses. Labor force participation rates for women 25 to 29 years old

have been very high, in the 90 percent range through the 1990s, but these rates, too, have been

very flat (and have, like others, declined a bit through the downturn of the early 2000s). As

opposed to the group in their thirties and early forties, these women have not had any increase in

their child burden. In fact, the fraction with young children declined substantially to the mid-

1980s and has been flat ever since. Thus both their participation rates and their child burdens

remained fairly constant since 1990 at the latest. If a natural rate has been reached, then this

group might provide confirmation. But, in the 1990s, participation rates of women in their late




45
   The rate was 74 percent in 2004. But in all cases, including that of men, participation rates from 2000
to 2004 were depressed relative to previous rates and reflect the sluggish labor market in general rather
than anything specific to women. Because of the macroeconomic slowdown, I use 1999 data.
46
   “Child burden” measures whether there is a child under six years old, not the number of children.


                                                             Goldin, Quiet Revolution, Ely Lecture 26
twenties were not much different from those of comparable men.47

     B. Opting out of the revolution?

        Back in the 1950s when Americans were concerned that women were dropping out of

college to get married, many questioned whether women should attend college at all. Recently, a

similar issue has been raised.48 Even women who have graduated from the best universities and

finest professional schools are reported to be fleeing the labor force for the comforts of home and

family and the identities of mother and wife. Rather than being “pushed out” or “forced out,”

they have, according to some, made a conscious decision in their late twenties and early thirties

to “opt out.”49 Does the current evidence support the notion that the quiet revolution is

unraveling?

        To evaluate the opt-out assertion requires longitudinal or retrospective data of a sufficient

time-span. The individual who opts out today may return to the workplace tomorrow and the

woman who left the corporate law office yesterday may wind up on the city council in a year.

Young women who see romance and comfort in being “stay at home Moms,” may change their

minds long before they receive their diplomas. The requisite data must also include a large

number of female and male graduates from top-ranked institutions of higher education since the

opt-out assertion generally pertains to women who, by virtue of their undergraduate institution,

are thought to have opted for careers. A reasonable evaluation also requires comparisons with

similar men.

47
   Further confirmation is provided by Heather Boushey (2005) who finds that the child penalty—the
lower labor force participation of women with young children—decreased from 1984 to 2004, controlling
for year effects and demographics.
48
   A moment of déjà vu can be found in a review by Caroline Hill in the Journal of Political Economy of
Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s book. Hill remarked: “The conservative has had his innings since about 1900
… because a few highly educated women have abandoned their specialties for their families, they are
used as illustrations of the futility of opening graduate schools to women” (Hill 1904, p. 410).

out revolution” and the firestorm that ensued in newspapers across the nation.

        The College and Beyond data set of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation meets these

stringent criteria. The data set consists of administrative data for individuals from thirty-four

“selective” universities and colleges and the results of a survey.50 The entering class of 1976 is

examined here because it is one of the latest college cohorts for which information exists to their

mid-life. The survey was completed in 1995/96 when the respondents were around 37 years old

by which time most of the women had completed their child bearing years, although career and

other demographic transitions would continue.51 College and Beyond contains the largest

sample of college graduates from selective institutions that currently exists with data relevant to

the issues at hand.52 Using these data I explore out-of-work spells among college graduate

women and how these spells were affected by family, further education, and occupation.53 Only

non-education related spells are considered and only spells of more than six months were

recorded in the survey.

        In the more than fifteen years since receiving their baccalaureate degrees the median

woman who graduated from one of the thirty-four selective colleges was never out-of-work for

more than six months at a time, and that was true even among those who had at least one child




50
   Because of confidentiality requirements, the College and Beyond data set is restricted. I thank the
Andrew W. Mellon Foundation for making the data available to me for this and other research. For more
information on the College and Beyond survey, see the data appendix in William G. Bowen and Derek
Bok (1998).
51
   After age 37 the probability of having any birth for a college graduate woman born from 1955 to 1959
was 0.136, whereas the total number of births this group would have to age 44 was 1.424. The
probability of a first birth after age 37 for this group was 0.03 (Goldin, Katz, Qingyan Shang, and Bruce
Weinberg in progress).
52
   Lawrence F. Katz, Bryce Ward, and I are currently compiling similar data for various entering classes
beginning in 1969 from one highly selective college. These data will be more current than are those in
the “College and Beyond” and will contain better demographic and occupational data.
53
   The College and Beyond data do not include information on the birth dates of the children. Only data
on the number of children were collected, although the no-work spell information includes whether the
spell was for “family reasons.”


                                                            Goldin, Quiet Revolution, Ely Lecture 28
(Table 1).54 The sum of all out-of-work spells was just 1.55 years; that for women with children

was 2.08 years and that for women without children was 0.41 years or just 5 months. Among all

women, less than one-quarter had out-of-work spells totaling two years or more and among

women with children the figure is less than one-third. For most women, the sum of all out-of-

work spells during their first fifteen years after graduation was remarkably short. The spells

were, to be sure, larger than those for comparable men who logged 0.244 years (or 3 months)

total in out-of-work spells but they were, nonetheless, a small fraction of their years since

graduation. Of the fraction of the time since graduation, not spent to advance their education,

these women were away from work just 11 percent of the time, and only 7 percent were away

from work for more than 50 percent of the time.

        In a regression context, children were the most important factor related to out-of-work

spells for women and a clear non-linearity exists in the impact of successive numbers of children.

One child increased total time not at work by just 0.36 years on average, two children by 1.41

years, and three (or more) by 2.84 years.55 The opposite effect holds for men. The first child

decreased out-of-work spells by 0.14 years, the next by 0.18 years, and beyond that by 0.21

years. Women with advanced degrees had far briefer spells than other women and the effect

holds even for those with children. In fact, almost all of the difference between the out-of-work

spells of those with advanced degrees and others is due to the shorter duration of their spells for

having children. Those with medical degrees had the shortest no-work spells; doctorates were




54
   Because I include education spells for which the respondent also gave another reason (e.g., family
responsibilities) out-of-work spells are likely to be a bit overstated.
55
   Coefficients on the number of children are from a regression including marital status, race, and the
various professional and graduate degrees. Controls for college selectivity and the individual’s SAT
scores did not affect the estimates.


                                                             Goldin, Quiet Revolution, Ely Lecture 29
next and then lawyers. African American women had the briefest spells of all.56

        Evidence from the Current Population Surveys (CPS) and the College and Beyond data

set does not indicate that college graduate women, particularly those from selective institutions,

have opted out in significant numbers and that the phenomenon has increased.57 But because

data, to be meaningful, must reveal the full longitudinal view from late in life, the path of the

most recent generations cannot yet be judged. There are, however, some hints. Evidence on

aspirations from the Astin freshman survey does not suggest major changes in the factors that

young people expect will yield satisfaction in life. Data on the age at first birth from U.S. Vital

Statistics shows a continued increase among college graduate women and a slight, but

noticeable, increase in the number of births to those with four or more years of college. As for

the validity of the opt-out theory, the jury must remain out for at least another decade.



V. Three Evolutions, the Quiet Revolution, and Beyond: A Summary

        What forces propelled the three evolutions in the lives of adult women and brought about

the quiet revolution? At the risk of simplifying a complicated social and economic

transformation that unleashed the most momentous change in the labor force of the twentieth

century, I will summarize my argument.

        I separated the approximately first three-quarters of the twentieth century into three

phases of evolutionary change. During Phase I, few adult and married women were in the labor

force. The income elasticity of female labor supply was large (and negative) and the substitution

56
   Attendance at a woman’s college decreased out-of-work spells but only because women’s college
graduates in this sample had fewer children, due in part because a lower percentage married.
57
   The opt-out thesis can also be evaluated with regard to whether women in the 1976 entry class who
earned advanced degrees were in occupations in 1995 that were directly degree-related. The vast majority
of women who trained to be medical doctors were employed as physicians when in their late thirties; the
same is true for women who received law degrees and lawyers. Women in these graduating classes,
moreover, stuck with their specialties to about the same degree as did comparable men.


                                                           Goldin, Quiet Revolution, Ely Lecture 30
elasticity of labor supply was small. Virtually all change in participation had to come from shifts

in labor supply. Until the two elasticities of the Slutsky equation changed, economic growth and

the consequent increase in real earnings for women would not elicit an increase in the

participation of adult and married women. But change they did during Phase II.

        The income elasticity decreased considerably in (absolute) magnitude with the arrival of

nice jobs that reduced the stigma surrounding married women’s work outside the home and with

the increase in high school attendance and graduation rates that made nice work a possibility for

many young women. The substitution effect increased substantially with the reduction in hours

(and days) of work, the initial stirrings of part-time work, and the rapid diffusion of the electric

household. Also of some importance, although often exaggerated, was the impact of World War

II in demonstrating, to women and their families, that the workplace could be respectable and

showing employers that women were profitable to employ.58

        By Phase III female labor supply was rather elastic. The large increase in aggregate

demand, especially in the 1960s, and the accommodation of married women with the expansion

of part-time work, led to an enormous increase in married women’s labor force participation.

Put succinctly, demand raced over an elastic labor supply function. But these changes could

hardly have been accurately predicted by the participants. Most—even those with college

degrees—had not made plans to be in the workforce for an extended period. Work was a job to

“fall back on,” not a career. The skill set of these women was not commensurate with their

eventual life cycle labor force participation. But all of that would also change.


58
  Goldin (1991a) demonstrates the relatively short-lived nature of the increase in women’s employment
in the 1940s. Daron Acemoglu, David H. Autor, and David Lyle (2004) identify that female labor supply
did shift because of war-time work. Using a similar identification strategy, Raquel Fernandez, Alessandra
Fogli, and Olivetti (2004) find that wartime work not only increased female labor supply but had a
multiplier effect through a change in work preferences. The sons of working women who lived through
the early 1940s were more willing to have a working wife.


                                                           Goldin, Quiet Revolution, Ely Lecture 31
       Young women growing up in the 1960s could see that adult and married women had

participation rates that were rapidly increasing. The young began to extrapolate to their own

lives, possibly influenced by the resurgence of feminism that cautioned them to think

independently. Two other important changes took place. One was the contraceptive innovation

known as the pill. Aided by changes in state laws, the pill diffused to young, single women. The

other was the enormous increase in divorce in the 1960s. The advent of the pill for young

women allowed them to plan their careers before planning for their families and to be taken more

seriously by their employers and advisors. A consequence of the pill was that the age at first

marriage increased. Together with the rise in divorce, a far smaller fraction of a woman’s life

would be spent married. Young women in the 1960s and 1970s were better able to predict what

their future lifetime employment would be. As a result they increased their investments in

formal schooling, majored in career-oriented subjects, and continued to professional and

graduate schools in far greater numbers. They had longer horizons than did previous generations

and an altered identity that placed career ahead or on equal footing with marriage.

       Wives were less often secondary workers, the flotsam and jetsam of the labor market.

The income and substitution effects of labor supply changed once again, mainly in the 1980s and

1990s. No longer was women’s labor supply highly elastic. It was influenced even less than

before by husband’s earnings. The earnings of women rose relative to those of men, occupations

changed from more traditional ones to those that had been considered nontraditional.

       The quiet revolution was set in motion by the generation born in the late 1940s, but a

noisier revolution, led by some in the older cohorts, preceded it.59 As opposed to the noisy

revolution, the quiet revolution was accomplished by many who were unaware that they were

59
 The noisy revolution began in the 1960s as part of the Civil Rights and, somewhat later, anti-war
movements. The younger cohorts transformed it in the early 1970s and created the women’s liberation
movement. See the excellent summary by Rosen (2000).

part of a grand transformation. They were the unwitting foot soldiers of an upheaval that would

alter women’s employment, education, and family. But was Ely correct in asserting that

“Revolutions do not go backward”? There is little evidence that this one has, at least for now.

Notes: Individuals surveyed were freshmen. The data given are weighted to produce a nationally
representative college freshmen average. An objective, goal, or value is given full weight (100)
if the individual listed it as “essential” or “very important” and no weight (0) otherwise.
Individuals could choose any number of factors from the 12 to 19 possible objectives, goals, or
values listed on the survey in each year.

Notes: Sample includes only those who received a bachelor’s degree from 1978 to 1985. Of
those women with a graduation date listed in the survey 98 percent received their degrees
between 1978 and 1985 and 94 percent did between 1979 and 1981. Out-of-work spells are
defined in the survey as those greater than 6 months each. The possible reasons for no work
include: family responsibilities, layoffs, retirement, could not find a suitable position, did not
want to work, and personal illness. Spells that were solely for educational reasons are excluded
here. Professional or graduate degrees include doctorates (e.g., Ph.D.), professional degrees
(e.g., M.D., D.S.S., D.V.M.), and law degrees but not master’s degrees (e.g., M.A., M.B.A.).
“Children” is the number listed by the respondent and may include adopted or stepchildren (or be
missing).
