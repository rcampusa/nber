                      The Competitive Position of
                       U.S. Manufacturing Firms
                                 ABSTRACT


    This paper distinguishes between the competitive position of U.S.   firms
and that of the U.S. and other countries as geographical locations for pro-

duction. While the share of the U.S. in world exports of manufactures fell

more than 40 per cent between 1957 and 1977, the share of all TJ.S. firms

from all locations declined much less and the share of U.S. multinational

enterprises increased.

    The comparative advantage of U.S. multinational firms, as measured by

the industry distribution of their exports from all locations, changed very

little between 1966 and 1977. At the same time, there were large shifts in the

comparative advantage of the parent firms in the U.S., their overseas affil-

 iates, and foreign firms. The changes for the U.S. parents and their affil-

 iates reflected differences among industries in the extent to which export

production shares moved from the U.S. to the affiliates' host countries. The

shift took place in all the industry groups but was largest for metals and chem-

 icals and smallest for transport equipment.

    The rise in the share of world exports accounted for by U.S.   multinational
firms   and the decline in the share of the U.S. as a geographical location

suggests that the search for causes of the changed position of the U.S. should

be directed not to deficiencies in American industrial or technological

leadership but to other price and cost determining influences, such as produc-

tivity, wage setting, taxation, domestic inflation, and exchange rates.

             The Competitive Position of U.S. Manufacturing Firms

                              RESEARCH SUMMARY


Synopsis

    Issues: What have been the changes in the competitiveness (share in

           world exports) of U.S. firms in their worldwide activities, and

           in their comparative advantage (distribution among industries)?

           How do they compare with the competitiveness and comparative ad-

           vantage of the U.S. as a geographical location and to those of

           foreign firms?

               If IJ.S.—owned and managed firms, including their operations

           at home and abroad, have fared well in international competition,

           while production facilities located in the TJ.S. have not, the

           inference is that the deterioration of the U.S. position is due

           to factors others than management or technology.

   Results: While the share of the U.S. in world exports of manufactures

           fell more than 40 per cent between 1957 and 1977, that of all

           U.S. firms from all their locations around the world declined

           much less and the share of U.S. multinationals increased. The

           comparative advantage of U.S. multinational firms, as measured

           by the industry distribution of their exports from all locations,

           changed very little between 1966 and 1977, while there were sub-

           stantial shifts in the distribution of exports from the U.S.,
                                      —2-

             from foreign affiliates of U.S.—firms, and from non-U.S. firms

             in foreign countries. There was also a shift in export produc-

             tion, in terms of shares in total exports, from U.S. parents to

             their foreign affiliates. This took place in all industry groups

             but was largest in metals and chemicals.

    The comparative advantage of foreign firms, as shown by the distribu-

tion of their exports, became more similar to that of U.S. multinationals.

That was particularly true in the developing countries, where the impor-

tance of food industries declined and that of machinery industries

increased.


Policy Implications

    If, as we have hypothesized, the competitiveness and comparative advan-

tage of U.S. firms reflects their managerial and technological abilities,

there is little indication here of any serious erosion of these advantages

or shifts in their industry distribution. This casts doubt upon explana-

tions that attribute the U.S. trade deficit to unfavorable aspects of U.S.

management, such as an undue focus on short—term profits or lack of

measures that enlist the support of workers. It suggests that the search

for causes for the deterioration in the American position be sought in fac-

tors that determine relative U.S. prices as costs, such as monetary and

fiscal policy and wage and productivity behavior. For example, subsidies

to R & D or technological progress might produce gains in U.S.

multinationals' shares of world markets without affecting the extent of

production in the U.S.

 Introduction

         The decline in the U.S. shares of world exports and world manufac-

 tured goods exports since the 1950's has often been noted and commented on as

 a measure of the declining competitiveness of the United States. While that

 interpretation is questionable for a number of reasons (see Lipsey, 1984), we

will use the term here for convenience. Our main purpose in this paper is to

distinguish between the trade of the U.S. as a geographical location and the

trade of U.S. companies, wherever their production takes place, and to ana-

lyze the trends in these two aspects of U.S. competitiveness and comparative

advantage. While exports from the United States had declined by 1977 to less

than 15 per cent of world exports of manufactures, exports from all locations

by U.S. multinational firms accounted for more than 1/5 of the world total,

and exports by all U.S. firms for more than 1/4.1

         Exports by American owned and managed firms thus fared well, while

exports from the territory of the U.S. did not. The implication is that the

deterioration of the U.S. position in world trade, at least for the decade

ending in 1977, was not due primarily to deficiencies in management, as is

sometimes claimed.

         The share of world exports originating in the territory of the U.S.

reflects U.S. competitiveness, as determined by the characteristics of the

U.S. domestic economy. These include U.S. monetary and fiscal policy, through

effects on exchange rates and prices, and U.S. wage and productivity behavior.

       The share of U.S. companies in world exports, on the other hand, is an


  1The data on multinational firms are mainly from the 1957, 1966 and 1977
official surveys of U.S. multinational enterprises (U.S. Department of
Commerce, 1960, 1975 and 1981). To match the definitions used in these sur—
veys, the scope of "manufactures" in this paper includes manufactured foods
and edible oils but excludes manufactured fuels.

indicator of U.S. companies' competitiveness reflecting the firms' own

characteristics, such as their managerial and technological abilities and

skills. These can 'be exploited by U.S. companies by producing in the U.S. or

in foreign countries. A policy aimed at affecting TJ.S. domestic inflation or

exchange rates may affect the U.S. share of exports, while one aimed at tech-

nological advantage, such as subsidization of R & D, might have more

influence on the share of U.S. firms in world production, wherever it is

located, and the share of U.S. firms in world exports, wherever they are pro-

duced. This outcome would fit with the now common 'belief that it is the

existence of firm—specific assets, particularly knowledge, technology, and

management techniques, that account for much of the phenomenon of direct

investment.

         We will refer in this paper to two characteristics of the U.S. and

of U.S. firms. One is their competitiveness, a term we will use, as mentioned

above, as shorthand for shares in world exports of manufactured goods. The

other is their comparative advantage, which we will use as shorthand for the

industry or commodity distribution of their exports, relative to those of

other companies or of the U.S. and other countries.

geographical entity, of U.S. firms, and of U.S. multinational firms in world

exports of manufactures are given in Table •2 The decline in U.S. shares

Further   Research

    The story should be extended beyond 1977, but this must await the

availability of data from the 1982 census of U.S. direct foreign

Investment. It would also be desirable to examine the issue studied here in

terms of a more detailed breakdown than the broad industry divisions upon

which reliance has necessarily been placed in the present work. Such a

breakdown or, better still, access to individual company reports to the

Commerce Department would open the possibility of studying the effects of

R & D and of changes in technology upon export shares. Further insight into

the changes in competitiveness and comparative advantage could be obtained

from U.N. production data.

of exports by all market economies and by developed countries, frequently

cited as evidence of falling U.S. competitiveness, was more than 40 per cent

over the twenty years from 1957 to 1977, and was large in both halves of that

period (Lines 1 and 2). The share of 13.5.—owned firms, including operations

in the U.S. and overseas, also declined, but the change was much smaller,

only about half as large (Lines 3 through 6). The source of the difference

between the two sets of ratios is suggested by the figures for U.S. multina-

tional enterprises (Lines 7 through 12), although most of them are available

only for 1966 and 1977. While the share of U.S. firms in world exports

declined, the share of U.S.—owned multinational enterprises remained constant

or increased slightly. That difference between the share of multinationals

and that of all U.S. firms could have reflected both the export performance

of firms that were already multinational in 1966 and the entry of additional

U.S. firms into status as multinationals. The sources of difference cannot be

precisely distinguished, but we have some indication that the latter element

was probably not the major one.3




 3The number of manufacturing company parents recorded in 1977 (1,841) was
actually smaller than the nuniber of reporters recorded in 1966 (1,872). The
figures cannot be regarded as conclusive because the definition of a
reporter in 1966 was not identical to that of a parent in 1977, and it is
likely that some 1977 parents filed multiple reporter forms in 1966,
exaggerating the apparent decline in numbers of parents. However, the
number of such multiple reporters within firms was not large enough in 1966
to negate the implication that it was the greater success of multinational
firms in increasing exports rather than a tendency for more U.S. firms to
become multinational that accounted for the rise in the multinationals'
share in exports. Furthermore, there is other evidence for the relatively
greater export growth of multinationals. U.S. industries with high propor-
tions of firms not investing abroad have tended to be those having severe
problems with import competition. And within industries, multinational
firms have tended to grow more rapidly than others. (Lipsey, Kravis, and
O'Connor, 1983).

         For TEs we can distinguish between their exports from the U.S.

(parent exports) and their exports from foreign production locations. The

shares of parent company exports from the U.S. in world and developed—country

exports of manufactures (Lines 13 and 14) declined between 1966 and 1977, but

by much less than U.S. exports in general, as was clear from the increase in

parent companies' share of U.S. exports. What produced the constancy or small

gains mentioned above in U.S. multinationals' shares in world and developed—

country exports were the substantial increases in the shares of U.S.—owned

overseas affiliates in exports of countries other than the TJ.S., this in a

period when the exports of these countries were growing much faster than U.S.

exports. The shares of majority—owned affiliates in world exports rose from

about 6 per cent in 1957 to 91/2 per cent in 1977 (Line 16) and increased in

both developed— (Lines 17 and 21) and developing— (Lines 9 and 12) countries'

exports. The latter gain was particularly large, from less than 1 per cent in

1957 to over 5 per cent in 1977. If we include our rough estimates for

exports by minority—owned affiliates, which must also have reflected to some

degree the firm—specific advantages of the U.S. multinationals, the increases

were even larger between 1966 and 1977.

         Another way of putting this development is that there was a large

shift in the geographical origins of exports by U.S. firms. For U.S. com-

panies in general, the share of exports supplied by the overseas affiliates

of multinationals increased from 171/a percent in 1957 to over 40 per cent

(over 45 per cent including minority—owned affiliates) in 1977 (Lines 19

and 23). For the MEs, the share of their exports supplied from majority—

owned affiliates outside the U.S. rose from less than 40 per cent in

1966 to almost half in 1977 and the share from all affiliates reached over

half (Lines 18 and 22). Thus U.S. firms overcame some of the relative decline
                                        -7-

in the competitiveness of the U.S. as a production location by shifting to

other countries the sites from which they exploited their firm—specific com-

petitive advantages. Fxports of U.S. firms other than multinationals dropped

from 6.1 per cent of world exports in 1966 to 3.5     per   cent in 1977 (Line 2

minus Line i).

The Competitiveness and Comparative Advantages of U.S. Multinationals

          The competitiveness of U.S.—owned multinational firms might be best

renresented by their shares in worldwide production and their comparative

advantage by   the   distribution of their production among various industries,

as compared with production by others. However, since production data are not

readily available on a comprehensive basis, we have relied on information

about shares in worldwide exports and exports of individual industry groups.

         In assessing the role of U.S. multinationals, we examine separately

their exports from the U.S. compared with those of non—multinational U.S.

firms, their exports from other countries compared with those of non—U.S.

firms, and their worldwide exports compared with those of other U.S. and

foreign firms. The first comparison, between U.S. exports of multinational

(parent) and non—multinational firms, reflects the effects of multinationa—

lity. Worldwide production and distribution facilities may lead to an

increase in the firm's share of foreign markets, part of which may come

through exports from the United States of components or smaller—volume ele-

ments of a line of products. On the other hand, the multinational firm, even

if it has a comparative advantage in an industry, may substitute exports by

subsidiaries   in other countries for exports by the parent from the U.S.

These choices depend on location—specific rather than firm—specific advan-

tages.

         The second comparison, between exports of affiliates and those of
                                      —8-

 non—U.S. firms from foreign countries, should reflect the advantages of the

U.S. base for a company: the factors that make U.S. firms competitive with

foreign firms producing in the same location. This comparison should reflect

firm—specific competitiveness because location—specific influences have been

eliminated except for interactions between firm—specific and location—

specific factors.

         The third comparison is between exports by U.S. multinational firms

from all locations and all other exports including those of non—multinational

firms from the U.S. and of non—U.S. firms from foreign countries. This should

give the best measure of U.S. firms' comparative advantage, because it eli-

minates from the comparison the effects not only of location—specific advan-

tages themselves but also of any interactions between firm—specific and

location—specific advantages.

         In making these three sets of comparisons we rely on data on the

exports of U.S. multinationals by country of origin from official surveys and

on U.N. export data for the U.S. and host countries which we have

reclassified to make reasonably comparable with the multinational export

data. The latter are available by country only for seven broad manufacturing

groups. We can, therefore, identify the comparative advantage of U.S. multi-

nationals from export data only at this level and not, as would be desirable,

for a more detailed classification.

Exports from the U.S. by U.S. Multinationals and by Other U.S. Firms

         The exports of non—multinational U.S. firms should reflect the com-

petitiveness and the comparative advantages of the U.S. as a production loca-

tion. Exports from the U.S. by U.S. multinationals (parent exports) reflect

the combination of the influence of the U.S. production location and of the

multinational nature of these firms. The distributions of exports by the two
                                    —9-.

types of firms are compared in Table 2 in two ways. One is based on exports

classified by commodity group, the preferable way, since it is the basis for

classifying aggregate U.S. exports and should, therefore, give better estima—

tes for exports by non-multinational firms. The second is by industry group

of parent firm; this is the only comparison that can be made for 1966 as well

as 1977, and for this purpose we also calculate aggregate exports in such a

way that figures for the two years are comparable.

         It is clear from the commodity—group classification that the largest

differences between multinational and other U.S. firms in 1977 were in the

shares in transport equipment and "other manufacturing" exports. Despite the

fact that motor vehicle companies (but not aircraft companies) were in one of

the most multinational of U.S. industries, in the sense of having the highest

share of its activity overseas, multinationals accounted for almost 85 per

cent of exports of transport equipment from the U.S., about 2/3 of which was

by motor vehicle and parts manufacturers. This is an industry in which

multinationals appear to have had an advantage relative to other firms in

exporting from the U.S. Almost all of the exports of motor vehicle companies

were of parts and components to their own overseas affiliates, while aircraft

exports were almost entirely to unaffiliated foreigners (Kulchycky and

Lipsey, 1984, Table 2). The other case of a large advantage for multina-

tionals is machinery, also an industry in which a large part of companies'

activity tended to be overseas.

         On the other side, in foods, chemicals, and other manufacturing,

especially the last, either multinationals did not have any advantage over

other U.S. firms in exporting from the U.S., or any such advantages were out-

weighed by the advantages of other locations from which they could export.

         To observe changes in comparative advantage between 1966 and 1977,

we can use only the data by industry group.4 Between 1966 and 1977 there was

a general increase in the competitiveness of U.S. multinationals relative to

other U.S. firms, as shown by the increase in their share of U.S. exports.

This increase took place in every industry group, but it was substantial only

in chemicals and transport equipment. As can he seen from the industry

distribution of exports, there was an apparent decline in U.S. comparative

advantage in foods, chemicals, and particularly metals, shared by both multi-

nationals and other firms. There was a gain in the comparative advantage of

multinational firms relative to non—multinational firms, in transport equip-

ment and a shift toward machinery on the part of non—multinational firms.

Exports by U.S. Firms' Foreign Affiliates and their Host Countries

         Further evidence on the competitiveness and comparative advantages

of U.S. multinationals is given by the comparison between exports by their

affiliates and exports by other firms in the same areas. The distribution of

exports from an area by both U.S. and other firms reflects the comparative

advantages of that area. The differences in distribution between U.S. affi-

liates and other firms reflect the comparative advantages of the U.S. firms

relative to others in that area. Finally, the shares of U.S. firms in exports

can be thought of as reflecting both the comparative advantages of U.S. firms

and their competitiveness relative to other firms. For example, U.S. firms

might account for a large part of exports of food products from an area or

country because of the superior marketing abilities of U.S. companies in

general, but the share of food products in U.S. firms' exports from that area

might be low relative to that of local firms because U.S. firms have no corn—


  4mese suffer from a defect that makes them more suitable for observing
changes over time than for comparing the relative advantages of the two groups
of U.S. firms. The classification of parent exports by parent industry places a
substantial amount of exports under the wrong category for comparison with
aggregate IJ.S. export data. A notable example is that over 20 per cent of
exports by the transportation equipment industry are machinery, and over a
quarter of machinery exports are made by parent companies in other industries.

parative   advantage in that industry.

           These calculations have been performed separately for several areas

because U.S. affiliates' relative competitiveness and comparative advantage

may differ among countries. The areas are Canada, developed countries other

than Canada, developing countries, and two groups of developing countries

that make up much of the set of countries often referred to as NICs, or newly

industrializing countries. The data for majority-owned and minority—owned

(where available) U.S. affiliates are summarized in Table 3.

           Aside from Canada, where the ratios tend to be distorted by the

Canadian—U.S. Auto Agreement5, several results are common to most areas. U.S.

multinationals tend to have a comparative advantage in the machinery

industry. It is particularly large in developing areas, where it applies to

both electrical and non—electrical machinery, but exists in developed

countries also for the latter. U.S. firms also appeared to have comparative

advantages relative to local firms in chemicals and transport equipment in

the developed countries and the developing countries as a group, but not for

transport equipment in the Asian NIC's, where the other exporters probably

include many affiliates of Japanese auto companies.

           At the other side of the scale, U.S. ME's did not seem to have any

comparative advantage over local and other foreign firms in the manufactured

foods and metals industries. That is not to say that no U.S. firms had such

advantages over local firms, since their presence in these countries implies


  5The agreement encourages two—way trade between auto parents and their
affiliates, to a far larger extent than in other industries or countries. A
calculation using net exports for these companies, as an approximation to net
exports for these products, might give a more accurate picture of U.S. firms'
comparative advantage.

the presence of some firm—specific advantages. However, comparative advan-
tages in foods and metals industries do not seem to be characteristic of U.S.

multinationals as a group.

         The competitiveness of U.S. multinationals as a group is suggested

1w their shares in total manufactured exports. The shares grew in both deve-

loped and developing countries, but the most noteworthy increases were in the

latter. The U.S. firms' shares almost doubled despite the fact that tiese

countries' exports were increasing rapidly relative to those of other

countries. The data thus suggest that the U.S. affiliates probably played an

important role in these export expansions.

         One of the major changes in comparative advantage that took place

between 1966 and 1977 was the shift toward machinery industries in developing

country exports. Both U.S. and non—U.S. firms moved strongly in this direc-

tion, but the change was larger for the U.S. firms, even in percentage terms,

despite their much higher initial levels. In developed countries, on the

other hand, the U.S. firms' comparative advantage in this industry declined

while that of foreign firms rose, remaining, however, well below the U.S.

firms' level. In transport equipment, U.S. multinationals retained some

advantage over others in both groups of countries, but there was some

catching up by foreign firms within developed countries. Outside of machinery

and transport equipment we find mostly declines in the comparative advantage

of U.S. affiliates in developing countries, and mixed results in developed

countries.

         There is no evidence of any tendency for U.S. affiliates to gravi-

tate toward the distribution of domestic firm exports over time as far as we

can judge, given the number of missing observations for 1966. The 1977 affi-

liate export pattern was more similar to that of 1966 than to the domestic

firm product distribution in either 1966 or 1977. The product composition of
                                           — 16   —




 affiliate     exports also was less like that of the domestic firms in 1977 than

in 1966.6

Exports from all Locations by U.S. Multinationals

              Another way to view the comparative advantage of U.S. multinational

firms, escaping the effects of their choices of location, is to look at their

exports from all locations, including those from the parents in the U.S. and

those from their affiliates overseas. The distribution of these exports,

by industry, in 1966 and 1977 was as follows:

an industry's share in exports by majority—owned U.S. affiliates and D the
same share for non—U.S. and U.S. minority—owned firms, and 77 and 66 refer to
1966 and 1977. The full data set would have consisted of 5 product shares in
exports (the "other" category was excluded) for each of 29 countries of which
16 were developed and 13 developing. The number of available pairs of com-
parable shares was around 75 due mainly to the suppression of data by the ori-
ginal source owing to disclosure rules. The most serious omissions are some
1966 data for the metals, machinery, and transportation equipment industries
for the developing areas and U.S. affiliate exports from Japan in the all—area
totals. A very large part of U.S. affiliate activity in Japan was in
minority—owned affiliates, for which trade data were not collected in the
Commerce Department surveys.

          Over this eleven—year period there was remarkably little change in

the industry distribution of exports: slight declines in foods and metals and

small increases in chemicals and transport equipment. These changes were

much smaller than those for parents alone (Table 2) or for affiliates alone

(Table 3). The implication is that the comparative advantages of U.S. multi-

nationals remained virtually constant; the shifts we observed for parents in

the U.S. and for their affiliates abroad must have represented changes in the

comparative advantages of production locations.

          We can also compare the comparative advantage of U.S. multinational

companies, as represented by their worldwide operations, with those of other

U.S. companies and those of foreign companies, described in the earlier

tables.

          Relative to non—multinational U.S. firms and to foreign firms,

TJ.S.—based multinationals appear to have had a comparative advantage in

transport equipment and in machinery in 1977 ("best estimates" in Table 4).

Non—multinational U.S. firms had a relative advantage in chemicals, non—U.S.

firms in developed countries in metals, and non—U.S. firms in developing

countries in foods and in other manufacturing.

          Between 1966 and 1977, the comparative advantage of U.S. multina-

tionals remained very stable, as mentioned earlier, while that of other U.S.

firms shifted toward machinery and other manufacturing and away from chemicals

and transport equipment. 'oreign firms shifted toward the comparative advan-

tage of U.S. multinationals, particularly foreign firms in developing

countries. In all the cases but one in which the share of their exports in an

industry was substantially above that of the U.S. multinationals in 1977, they

had decreased that share in the previous eleven years and in the cases in

which their share was below that of U.S. multinationals, they had increased

Shifts in the Geographical Origin of Exports by U.S. Multinationals

              Since the comparative advantage of U.S. multinationals remained vir-

tually constant between 1966 and 1977 while those of the parent firms in the

U.S. and of their overseas affiliates each changed, there must have been

shifts in the advantages of production in different geographical locations.

Such changes are reflected in the following data on changes in the sources of

exports by U.S. multinational firms:

           There was a substantial shift away from the United States in the

sources of U.S. ME's exports. The shift was largest for metals and next for

chemicals, and least for transport equipment. From these data we might infer

that the sharpest decline in comparative advantage for the U.S. as a
                                     - 20   -



 geographical entity was in metals, not too surprising given the problems of
both the iron and steel and nonferrous metals industries. The lack of change

in transportation equipment is more surprising, but it probably reflects the

retention of U.S. comparative advantage in the aircraft industry and the very

large trade in motor vehicles and components with Canada. Also, some of the

changes that have attracted public attention may have accelerated after 1977.

         The changes in the sources of exports are all measured in percentage

terms. They do not involve actual decreases in the value of exports from the

U.S., but rather slower increases in the U.S. than in foreign countries.

It cannot be inferred that the slower growth in exports from the U.S. was the

result of the more rapid increases abroad; in fact, multinational firms

increased exports from the U.S. more than did the non—multinationals.

Conclusions

         The main conclusions of this paper reflect the importance of

distinguishing between the competitiveness and comparative advantages of U.S.

firms and those of the U.S. and other countries as geographical locations for

production. The competitiveness of U.S. firms, as measured by their share in

world exports of manufactured goods, decreased much less than did that of the

U.S. as a geographical entity. The share of U.S. multinationals in world

exports, including exports by all their foreign affiliates, actually

increased. The reasons for the difference are that U.S. multinationals

increased their exports from the U.S. faster than did firms with no overseas

operations and increased exports from their foreign affiliates still more.

        Relative to non—multinational U.S. firms and to foreign firms, the

comparative advantage of U.S. multinationals was in transport equipment

and machinery. That of non—multinational U.S. firms was in chemicals, that of

foreign firms in developed countries was in metals, and that of foreign firms
                                      — 21   —


in   developing countries was in foods and other manufacturing. While there were

some considerable shifts in the comparative advantages of foreign firms and of

U.S. firms without overseas manufacturing operations, the comparative advan-

tage of U.S. multinational firms   hardly    changed at all between 1966 and 1977.

Thus, the changes in the comparative advantage of their U.S. operations,

mainly decreases in foods and metals and increases in transport equipment,

reflected the redistribution of the location of their production for export.

The largest shift away from the U.S. as a location for export production was

in the metals industry, followed by chemicals, and the smallest was in

transport equipment.

           The comparative advantage of foreign firms, as represented by the

industry distribution of their world—wide exports, converged toward that of

U.S. multinationals. That was particularly the case for foreign firms in

developing countries, shifting away from exports of food and chemical products

and towards machinery.

          The implication is that the decline in U.S. shares in world manufac-

tures exports in the late 1960's and 1970's was not, as sometimes alleged, to

be found in deficiencies in American management or declines in American tech-

nological leadership. The share of exports produced under U.S. management —

that   is, by U.S. multinational firms operating at home and abroad —   actually
increased. The decline in the U.S. share, it may be inferred, reflects a rela-

tive diminution in the advantage of the U.S. as a production location.

         include substantial amounts of non—manufactured products but were the

         we used a better approximation to exports of manufactured goods from
         Lipsey and Kravis (1982), Table B-i. Both of the 1977 figures were
         then corrected by adding exports from Taiwan, from Table A—7.

            industry and geographical area. Some combinations of areas
            and/or industries had to be ide because of disclosure problems.
            Exports from countries for which elements of this calculation
