                                           ABSTRACT

We propose uncertainty shocks as a new shock that drives business cycles. First, we demonstrate that
microeconomic uncertainty is robustly countercyclical, rising sharply during recessions, particularly
during the Great Recession of 2007-2009. Second, we quantify the impact of time-varying uncertainty
on the economy in a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with heterogeneous firms. We
find that reasonably calibrated uncertainty shocks can explain drops and rebounds in GDP of around
3%. Moreover, we show that increased uncertainty alters the relative impact of government policies,
making them initially less effective and then subsequently more effective.

    1     Introduction
    Uncertainty has received substantial attention as a potential factor shaping the depth and
    duration of the Great Recession. For example, the Federal Open Market Committee minutes
    repeatedly emphasize uncertainty as a key factor driving the 2001 and 2007-2009 recessions,
    while Stock and Watson (2012) state that “the main contributions to the decline in output
    and employment during the [2007-2009] recession are estimated to come from …nancial and
    uncertainty shocks.”
        This paper seeks to evaluate these claims in two parts. In the …rst part, we develop
    new empirical measures of uncertainty using detailed Census microdata from 1972 to 2010,
    and highlight four main results. First, the dispersion of plant-level shocks to total factor
    productivity (TFP) is strongly countercyclical, rising steeply in recessions. For example,
    Figure 1 shows the dispersion of TFP shocks for a balanced panel of plants for the last
    two full years before the recent recession (2005 to 2006) and two years during the recession
    (2008 to 2009). This shows that plant-level TFP shocks increased in variance by 76% during
    the recession. Figure 2 shows that the dispersion of output growth increased even more,
    rising by a striking 152% during the recession. Surprisingly, higher microdata moments like
    the coe¢ cient of skewness and kurtosis are not signi…cantly countercyclical. So recessions
    appear to be characterized by a negative …rst-moment and a positive second-moment shock
    to the establishment-level driving processes.1
        Second, uncertainty is also strongly countercyclical at the industry-level. That is, within
    SIC 4-digit industries the yearly growth rate of output is negatively correlated with the
    dispersion of TFP shocks to establishments within the industry. Hence, both at the industry
    and at the aggregate level, bad times, de…ned in terms of low growth rates of output, are
    also uncertain times in terms of increased cross-sectional dispersion of TFP shocks.
        Third, this industry-level increase in variance during periods of slow growth does not
    appear to be due to the slowdown itself. We use trade reforms and exchange rate changes
    to instrument for industry growth rates and …nd no signi…cant causal impact on industry
    uncertainty. In other words, we …nd no evidence that changes in uncertainty are driven by
    …rst moment shocks.
        Finally, we show that for plants owned by publicly traded Compustat parent …rms,
    large plant-level TFP shocks are highly correlated with more volatile daily parent stock
    returns. Hence, daily stock returns volatility, a popular high-frequency …nancial measure
    of uncertainty, is tightly linked to yearly plant TFP shocks, our low-frequency real measure
    of uncertainty.
1
    To be precise we …nd that the coe¢ cients (rather than levels) of skewness and kurtosis are acyclical, where
    the coe¢ cient of skewness=M 3=M 23=2 and kurtosis=M 4=M 22 , and M x is the level of the xth centered
    moment. Data available at http://www.stanford.edu/~nbloom/RUBC.zip

       Given the robust evidence that uncertainty appears to rise sharply in recessions, in the
    second part of the paper we build a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model.
    Various features of the model are speci…ed to conform as closely as possible to the standard
    frictionless real business cycle (RBC) model as this greatly simpli…es comparison with exist-
    ing work. We deviate from this benchmark in three ways. First, uncertainty is time-varying,
    so the model includes shocks to both the level of technology (the …rst moment) and its vari-
    ance (the second moment) at both the microeconomic and macroeconomic levels. Second,
    there are heterogeneous …rms that are subject to idiosyncratic shocks. Third, the model
    contains non-convex adjustment costs in both capital and labor. The non-convexities to-
    gether with time variation in uncertainty imply that …rms become more cautious in investing
    and hiring when uncertainty increases.
       Simulations allow us to study the response of our model economy to an uncertainty
    shock. Increased uncertainty makes it optimal for …rms to wait, leading to signi…cant falls
    in hiring, investment and output. In addition, we show that increased uncertainty also
    reduces productivity growth because it reduces the degree of reallocation in the economy.
    Higher uncertainty leads productive plants to pause expanding and unproductive plants to
    pause contracting, which in the model as in the U.S. economy drives much of aggregate
    productivity growth.2
       We then build on our theoretical model to investigate the e¤ects of uncertainty on policy
    e¤ectiveness. We use a simple illustrative example to show how time-varying uncertainty
    initially dampens the e¤ect of an expansionary policy and then later increases it. The key
    to this initial policy ine¤ ectiveness is that a rise in uncertainty makes …rms very cautious
    in responding to any stimulus. Once the uncertainty shock has begun to pass, the increased
    dispersion in actual TFP starts to increase the impact of policy, leading to a medium term
    increase in policy e¤ectiveness.
       Our work is related to several strands in the literature. First, we add to the extensive
    literature building on the RBC framework that studies the role of TFP shocks in causing
    business cycles. In this literature, recessions are generally caused by large negative tech-
    nology shocks.3 The reliance on negative technology shocks has proven to be controversial,
    as it suggests that recessions are times of technological regress.4 As discussed above, our
    work provides a rationale for falls in measured productivity. Countercyclical increases in
2
  In the actual U.S. economy, reallocation is a key factor driving aggregate productivity. See, for example,
  Foster, Haltiwanger, and Krizan (2000, 2006), who report that reallocation, broadly de…ned to include entry
  and exit, accounts for around 50% of manufacturing and 80% of retail productivity growth in the US.

  See, for example, the review of this literature in King and Rebelo (1999) and Rebelo (2005).

  This reasoning has lead many researchers to study models with other disturbances, which also mostly focus
  on …rst-moment (levels) shocks. A partial list of these alternative shocks includes oil shocks, investment-
  speci…c shocks, monetary shocks, government expenditure shocks, news shocks, and terms-of-trade shocks.
  Yet, in most models, negative technology shocks continue to be an important driver of economic downturns.



                                                      2
    uncertainty lead to a freeze in economic activity, substantially lowering productivity growth
    during recessions. In our model, however, the drop in productivity is not causing the reces-
    sion, but rather an artifact of a recession that is caused in turn by an increase in uncertainty.
        Second, the paper relates to the literature on investment under uncertainty. A rapidly
    growing body of work has shown that uncertainty can directly in‡uence …rm-level investment
    and employment in the presence of adjustment costs.5 Many of the most recent papers have
    started to focus on stochastic volatility and its impacts on the economy, particularly focusing
    on the current recession.6 Finally, the paper also builds upon a recent literature that studies
    the role of microeconomic rigidities in general equilibrium macro models.7
        The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the behavior
    of uncertainty over the business cycle. In Section 3 we formally present the model, de…ne
    the recursive equilibrium, and present our non-linear solution algorithm. The model is
    calibrated and simulated in Section 4, and in Section 5 we study the role of uncertainty
    shocks in driving the business cycle. Section 6 decomposes the e¤ect of an uncertainty
    shock on the economy. Section 7 studies the impact of policy shocks in the presence of
    time-varying uncertainty. Section 8 concludes.


    2    Measuring Uncertainty over the Business Cycle
    Before presenting our empirical results, it is useful to brie‡y discuss what we mean by
    time-varying uncertainty in the context of our model.
        We assume that a …rm, indexed by j; produces output in period t according to the
    following production function

                                         yj;t = At zj;t f (kj;t ; nj;t );                                (1)

    where kt;j and nt;j denote idiosyncratic capital and labor employed by the …rm. Each …rm’s
    productivity is a product of two separate processes: an aggregate component, At , and an
    idiosyncratic component, zj;t . More generally, we can think of this as a revenue function so

    that demand shocks will also be incorporated into the process for At and zj;t .8
       We assume that the aggregate and idiosyncratic components of business conditions follow
    autoregressive processes:

                                                    A                       A
                                  log(At ) =            log(At     1)   +   t 1 t                      (2)
                                                    Z                       Z
                                 log(zj;t ) =           log(zj;t   1)   +   t 1 j;t :                  (3)

    We allow the variance of innovations,       A   and      Z,   to move over time according to two-state
                                                t            t
    Markov chains, generating periods of low and high macro and micro uncertainty.
       There are two assumptions embedded in this formulation. First, the volatility in the
    idiosyncratic component, zj;t , implies that productivity and demand dispersion across …rms
    is time-varying, while volatility in the aggregate component, At , implies that all …rms are
    a¤ected by more volatile shocks. Second, given the timing assumption in (2)                 (3), …rms
    learn in advance that the distribution of shocks from which they will draw in the next
    period is changing. This timing assumption captures the notion of uncertainty that …rms
    face about future business conditions.
       These two shocks are driven by di¤erent statistics. Volatility in zj;t implies that cross-
    sectional dispersion-based measures of …rm performance (output, sales, stock market re-
    turns, etc.) are time-varying, while volatility in At induces higher variability in aggregate
    variables like GDP growth and the S&P500 index. Next we turn to our cross-sectional and
    macroeconomic uncertainty measures, details of the construction of which are contained in
    Appendix A.

    2.1    Microeconomic Uncertainty over the Business Cycle
    In this section we present a set of results showing that shocks at the establishment-level,
    …rm-level and industry-level all increase in variance during recessions. In our model in
    Section 3 we focus on units of production, ignoring multi-establishment …rms or industry-
    level shocks to reduce computational burden. Nevertheless, we present data at these three
    di¤erent levels to demonstrate the generality of the increase in idiosyncratic shocks during
    recessions.
       Our …rst set of measures come from the Census panel of manufacturing establishments.
    In summary, with extensive details in Appendix A, this dataset contains detailed output
    and inputs data on over 50,000 establishments from 1972 to 2010. We focus on the sub-
    set of 15,673 establishments with 25+ years of data to ensure that compositional changes
    do not bias our results, generating a sample of almost half a million establishment-year

    See also Hopenhayn and Rogerson (1993), in which they discuss how productivity shocks at the microeco-
    nomic level are isomorphic to consumer taste shocks shifting the demand curve.

    observations.9
       To measure uncertainty we …rst calculate establishment-level TFP (b
                                                                         zj;t ) using the stan-
    dard approach from, for example, Foster, Haltiwanger, and Krizan (2000). We then de…ne
    TFP shocks (ej;t ) as the residual from the following …rst-order autoregressive equation for
    establishment-level log TFP:


                                    log (b
                                         zj;t ) = log (b
                                                       zj;t   1)   +   j   +   t   + ej;t ;                     (4)

    where       j   is an establishment-level …xed e¤ect (to control for establishment-level di¤erences)
    and     t   is a year …xed e¤ect (to control for cyclical shocks). Since this residual will also
    contain plant-level demand shocks that are not controlled for by 4-digit price de‡ators
    (see Foster, Haltiwanger and Syverson (2008)) our measure will combine both TFP and
    demand shocks. Because our model is isomorphic in idiosyncratic productivity and demand
    shocks this is not a theoretical problem, but it does highlight the di¢ culty in empirically
    distinguishing productivity shocks from demand shocks.
                                                                           b
                                                                           Z
       Finally, we then de…ne microeconomic uncertainty,                   t 1,    as the cross-sectional dispersion
    of ej;t calculated on a yearly basis. This is shown in Figure 3 as the interquartile range (IQR)
    of this TFP shock within each year, displaying a clearly countercyclical behavior. This is
    particularly striking for the recent Great Recession of 2007-2009, which displays the highest
    value of TFP dispersion since the series begins in 1972.
       Table 1 more systematically evaluates the relationship between the dispersion of TFP
    shocks and recessions. In column (1) we regress the cross-sectional standard-deviation (S.D.)
    of establishment TFP shocks on an indicator for the number of quarters in a recession during
    that year.10 We …nd a coe¢ cient of 0.065 which is highly signi…cant (a t-statistic of 6.5).
    In the bottom panel we report that this S.D. of establishment TFP shocks also has a highly
    signi…cant correlation with GDP growth of -0.458.11 In columns (2) and (3) we examine
    the coe¢ cient of skewness and kurtosis of TFP shocks over the cycle and interestingly
    …nd no signi…cant correlations.12 This suggests that recessions can be characterized at the
9
   The sampling issues arise both from the cyclicality of exit and from the sample strati…cation rules for the
   Census, which rotates out smaller establishments at 5-yearly intervals. By restricting the sample to 25+
   year lived establishments we eliminate cyclical frequency in sampling ‡uctuations.
10
   So, for example, this variable has a value of 0.25 in 2007 as the recession started in quarter IV, and values
   of 1 and 0.5 in 2008 and 2009 as the recession continued until quarter II in 2009.
11
   Two other recent papers have also reported similar …ndings of countercyclical increases in the variance of
   productivity shocks. Bachmann and Bayer (2011) use a panel of public and private German …rms spanning
   manufacturing and retail, showing signi…cant increases in the variance of innovations to productivity during
   recessions. Kehrig (2011) like our paper uses the U.S. Census data, but takes a di¤erent approach to sampling

Notes: Each column reports a time-series OLS regression point estimate (and standard error below in parentheses) of a measure of uncertainty on a recession indicator. The
recession indicator is the share of quarters in that year in a recession in columns (1) to (5), whether that quarter was in a recession in column (6), and whether the month was in
recession in columns (7) and (8). Recessions are defined using the NBER data. In the bottom panel we report the mean of the dependent variable and its correlation with real GDP
growth. In columns (1) to (5) the sample is the population of manufacturing establishments with 25 years or more of observations in the ASM or CM survey between 1972 and
2009, which contains data on 15,673 establishments across 39 years of data (one more year than the 38 years of regression data since we need lagged TFP to generate a TFP shock
measure). We include plants with 25+ years to reduce concerns over changing samples. In column (1) the dependent variable is the cross-sectional standard deviation (S.D.) of the
establishment-level ‘shock’ to Total Factor Productivity (TFP). This ‘shock’ is calculated as the residual from the regression of log(TFP) at year t+1 on its lagged value (year t), a
full set of year dummies and establishment fixed effects. In column (2) we use the cross-sectional coefficient of skewness of the TFP ‘shock’, in column (3) the cross-sectional
coefficient of kurtosis and in column (4) the cross-sectional interquartile range of this TFP ‘shock’ as an outlier robust measure. In column (5) the dependent variable is the
interquartile range of plants’ sales growth. In column (6) the dependent variable is the interquartile range of firms’ sales growth by quarter for all public firms with 25 years (100
quarters) or more in Compustat between 1962 and 2010. In column (7) the dependent variable is the interquartile range of firms’ monthly stock returns for all public firms with 25
years (300 months) or more in CRSP between 1960 and 2010. Finally, in column (8) the dependent variable is the interquartile range of industrial production growth by month for
manufacturing industries from the Federal Reserve Board’s monthly industrial production database. All regressions include a time trend and for columns (1) to (5) Census year
dummies (for Census year and for 3 lags). Newey-West standard errors (one lag) are applied in all columns to control for any potential serial correlation. *** denotes 1%
significance, ** 5% significance and * 10% significance. Data available on-line at http://www.stanford.edu/~nbloom/RUBC.zip.
  microeconomic level as a negative …rst-moment shock plus a positive second moment shock,
  with no shocks to higher moments. In column (4) we use an outlier-robust measure of
  cross-sectional dispersion, which is the IQR range of TFP shocks, and again …nd this rises
  signi…cantly in recessions.13 In column (5) as another robustness test we use output growth,
  rather than TFP shocks, and …nd a signi…cant rise in recessions. We also run a range of
  other experiments on di¤erent indicators, measures of TFP, and samples and always …nd
  that dispersion rises signi…cantly in recession.14 For example, Figure 4 plots the correlation
  of plant TFP rankings between consecutive years. This shows that during recessions these
  rankings churn much more, as the increase in microeconomic variance leads plants to change
  their position within their industry-level TFP rankings more rapidly.
      In column (6) we use a di¤erent dataset which is the sample of all Compustat …rms with
  25+ years of data. This has the downside of being a much smaller selected sample containing
  only 2,465 publicly quoted …rms, but spanning all sectors of the economy, and providing
  quarterly sales observations going back to 1962. We …nd that the quarterly dispersion of
  sales growth in this Compustat sample is also signi…cantly higher in recessions.
      One important caveat when using the variance of productivity ‘shocks’to measure uncer-
  tainty is that the residual ej;t is a productivity shock only in the sense that it is unforecasted
  by the regression equation (4), rather than unforecasted by the establishment. Hence, it
  parallels the de…nition of a macro productivity shock by Kydland and Prescott (1982) in
  being a forecast error from an AR(1) equation rather than necessarily a shock to economic
  agents. To address this concern in column (7) we examine the cross-sectional spread of
  stock returns, which re‡ects the volatility of news about …rm performance, and again …nd
  this is countercyclical, echoing the prior results in Campbell et al. (2001). In fact we …nd
  that establishment-level shocks to TFP are signi…cantly correlated to their parent’s stock
  returns, so that, at least part of, these establishment TFP shocks are new information
  to the market.15 Finally, column (8) examines another measure of uncertainty, which is
   selection rules (keeping those with 2+ or 38+ years rather than 25+ years) and again found the results
   robust, as shown in Appendix Table A1.
13
   Kehrig (2011) …nds that the dispersion of TFP increases in recessions mostly for durables. We run column
   (4) separately for durables and nondurables. We …nd that in our sample the rise of IQR of TFP shocks for
   durables is larger, with a point estimate (standard error) of 0.077 (0.028), but that there is also a signi…cant
   increase in dispersion for nondurables, with a point estimate (standard error) of 0.044 (0.019).
14
   For example, IQR of employment growth rates has a point estimate (standard error) of 0.051 (0.012), the
   IQR of TFP shocks measured using an industry-by-industry forecasting equation version of (4) has a point
   estimate (standard error) of 0.070 (0.021), using 2+ year samples for the S.D. of TFP shocks we …nd a point
   estimate (standard error) of 0.048 (0.014), using a balanced panel of 38+ year establishments we …nd a
   point estimate (standard error) of 0.077 (0.015), and using the IQR of TFP shocks measured after removing
   state-year means, and then applying (4) has a point estimate (standard error) of 0.063 (0.020). Finally,
   using the IQR of TFP shocks measured after removing …rm-year means, and then applying (4) has a point
   estimate (standard error) of -0.028 (0.011).

   We match public …rms from the Census dataset to Compustat and regress the mean of a …rm’s monthly stock
   returns at year t+1 on the sales weighted mean over the …rm’s plants of TFP shocks calculated between t

  the cross-sectional spread of industry-level output growth rates, …nding again that this is
  strongly countercyclical.
      Hence, in summary plant-level, …rm-level, and industry-level measures of volatility and
  uncertainty all appear to be strongly countercyclical, suggesting that microeconomic uncer-
  tainty rises in recessions.16

  2.2    Industry Business Cycles and Uncertainty
  In Table 2 we report another set of results which highlights the generality of the relationship
  between uncertainty and recessions. To do this we exploit the size of our Census dataset to
  examine the dispersion of productivity shocks within each SIC 4-digit industry year cell. The
  size of the Census dataset means that it has a mean (median) of 27.1 (17) establishments per
  SIC 4-digit industry-year cell, which enables us to examine the link between within-industry
  dispersion of establishment TFP shocks and industry growth.
      Table 2 displays a series of industry panel regressions in which our dependent variable
  is the IQR of TFP shocks for all establishments in each industry-year cell. The explanatory
  variable in column (1) is the median growth rate of output in the industry-year cell, with
  a full set of industry and year …xed e¤ects also included.17 Column (1) of Table 2 shows
  that the within-industry dispersion of TFP shocks is signi…cantly higher when that industry
  is growing more slowly. Since the regression has a full set of year and industry dummies,
  this is independent of the macroeconomic cycle. So at both the aggregate and industry-
  level slowdowns in growth are associated with increases in the cross-sectional dispersion of
  shocks.
      One immediate question is why within industry dispersion of shocks is higher during
  industry slowdowns. Maybe this is because industry slowdowns impact some types of es-
  tablishments di¤erently? To investigate this columns (2) to (9) run a series of estimations
  checking whether the increase in within industry dispersion is larger given some particular
  characteristics of the industry. In column (2) we interact industry growth with the median
  growth rate in that industry over the full period. Perhaps faster growing industries are more
  countercyclical in their dispersion? We …nd no relationship, suggesting long-run industry
  growth rates are not linked to the increase in dispersion of establishment shocks they see in
  recessions. In column (3) we interact industry growth with the dispersion of industry growth
  rates. Perhaps industries with a wide spread of growth rates across establishments are more
   and t+1, including a full set of …rm and year …xed e¤ects. We …nd that the coe¢ cient on the mean TFP
   shocks is highly signi…cant with point estimate (standard error) of 0.0051 (0.0006).
16
   Berger and Vavra (2010) look at changes in product-level prices (e.g. the price of a 2-litre bottle of Coke)
   and …nd that these are also more dispersed during recessions.
17
   We use the median rate of output growth in the industry-year to ensure the results are robust to establishment
   outliers. Results for column (1) using the mean of output growth across establishments are in fact slightly
   larger with a point estimate (standard error) of -0.151 (0.017).

Notes: Each column reports the results from an industry-by-year OLS panel regression, including a full set of industry and year fixed effects. The dependent variable in every
column is the interquartile range (IQR) of establishment-level TFP ‘shocks’ within each SIC 4-digit industry-year cell. The regression sample is the 16,451 industry-year cells of
the population of manufacturing establishments with 25 years or more of observations in the ASM or CM survey between 1972 and 2009 (which contains 446,051 underlying
establishment years of data). These industry-year cells are weighted in the regression by the number of establishment observations within that cell, with the mean and median
number of establishments per industry-year cell 27.1 and 17 respectively. The TFP ‘shock’ is calculated as the residual from the regression of log(TFP) at year t+1 on its lagged
value (year t), a full set of year dummies and establishment fixed effects. In column (1) the explanatory variable is the median of the establishment-level output growth in that
industry-year. In columns (2) to (9) a second variable is also included which is an interaction of that explanatory variable with an industry-level characteristic. In columns (2) and
(3) this is the median and IQR of industry-level output growth, in columns (4) and (5) this is the median and IQR of industry-level establishment size in employees, in columns (6)
and (7) this is the median and IQR of industry-level capital/labor ratios, in column (8) this is the IQR of industry-level TFP levels (note the mean is zero by construction), while
finally in column in (9) this interaction is the dispersion of industry-level concentration measured using the Ellison-Glaeser dispersion index. Standard errors clustered by industry
are reported in brackets below every point estimate. *** denotes 1% significance, ** 5% significance and * 10% significance.
     countercyclical in their dispersion? We again …nd nothing. The rest of the table reports
     similar results for the median and dispersion of plant size within each industry (measured by
     the number of employees, columns (4) and (5)), the median and dispersion of capital/labor
     ratios (columns (6) and (7)), and TFP and geographical dispersion interactions (columns
     (8) and (9)). In all of these we …nd insigni…cant coe¢ cients on the interaction of industry
     growth with industry characteristics.
        So, in summary, it appears that: …rst, the within-industry dispersion of establishment
     TFP shocks rises sharply when the industry growth rates slow down; and second, perhaps
     surprisingly, this relationship appears to be broadly robust across all industries.

     2.3    Is Uncertainty a Cause or E¤ect of Slowdowns?
     An obvious question regarding the relationship between uncertainty and the business cycle
     at the aggregate and industry-level is the direction of causality. Does uncertainty drive the
     cycle, or do recessions drive increases in uncertainty? A recent literature has suggested a
     number of mechanisms for uncertainty to increase endogenously in recessions, so identifying
     the direction of causation is clearly important in highlighting the extent to which counter-
     cyclical uncertainty is a shock driving cycles versus an endogenous mechanism amplifying
     cycles.18
        To do this we need some kind of natural experiment or instrument that causes changes
     in the …rst moment, that we can use to investigate its causal impact on the second moment.
     Unfortunately no obvious instrument exists at the macro level because as Kocherlakota
     (2010) noted “the di¢ culty in macroeconomics is that virtually every variable is endoge-
     nous.”But at the industry-level we do have two sets of instruments for …rst-moment shocks
     that we can use to evaluate the causal impact of …rst-moment shocks on the second moment.
        The …rst approach uses Chinese accession to the WTO as a natural experiment, which
     led to the abolition of import quotas on Chinese textiles and apparel in 2005. The origin
     of these quotas dates back to the 1950s when the U.S. started putting quotas on Japanese
     imports, which by 2005 appear to vary seemingly randomly across four-digit industries.19
     We use the initial level of these quotas as an instrument for the growth of industry output
     between 2004 and 2006, because industries with high initial quotas should and did see
     substantially lower growth rates than those without quotas. Since the Chinese accession
     to the WTO was agreed many years before, our anticipated instrument should not directly
     in‡uence uncertainty itself.20

   (2006), on experimentation in Bachmann and Moscarini (2011), on contracting by Narita (2011), and on
   search by Petrosky-Nadeau (2011).

   Even if the trade reform did in some way directly raise uncertainty, our instrumental variables estimator


                                                      8
    Table 3 starts in column (1) with the baseline results, copied from column (1) of Table
2, and shows that within-industry dispersion of TFP rises when industry growth rates fall.
In column (2) we report the same results for the subset of textiles and apparel industries,
which forms our China WTO quota instrument sample, and again see a signi…cant negative
relationship. Column (3) is our key result, which shows that once we instrument output
growth at the industry-level using the abolition of quotas, the relationship with uncertainty
reverses sign and becomes insigni…cant. Thus, despite having a good instrument for the
…rst moment (a …rst-stage F-statistic of near 10), we …nd no signi…cant second-stage impact
of …rst-moment shocks on uncertainty.
    One obvious question is to what extent our instrumental variables estimates could be
biased if the exclusion restriction fails, for example due to correlations between the instru-
ment and other drivers of uncertainty? One potential concern is that the abolition of quotas
should increase exit, trimming the left tail of plants in the U.S. and causing a downward
bias in our measure of uncertainty after the trade shock. So in column (4) we use the fully
balanced panel of plants and again …nd an insigni…cant positive coe¢ cient.
    Finally, in column (5) we use a di¤erent instrumental variables approach, which exploits
movements in industry exchange rates to identify changes in industry growth. To generate
industry exchange rates we follow Bertrand (2004) in de…ning for each industry its trade
weighted exchange rate for every major trade destination. For example, if industry A
trades 75% with Canada and 25% with Mexico, this industry’s exchange rate would be a
75% weight on the U.S.-Canada rate and a 25% weight on the U.S.-Mexico exchange rate
(details in Appendix A). Looking at column (5), we see from the …rst stage, in the bottom
panel, that industry exchange rates are e¤ective at predicting industry output growth, but
once again the second stage, in the top panel, shows no signi…cant causal impact of the …rst
moment on within-industry variance of TFP shocks.
    So in summary, Table 3 …nds no evidence that …rst-moment shocks drive second-moment
increases in within-industry TFP spreads. Obviously these estimates have large standard
errors around them so the results are far from conclusive, but they are not supportive of
the view that uncertainty shocks are primarily driven by …rst-moment shocks.

2.4    Are Establishment-Level TFP Shocks a Good Proxy for Uncertainty?
The evidence we have provided for countercyclical aggregate and industry-level uncertainty
relies heavily on using the dispersion of establishment-level TFP shocks as a measure of
uncertainty. To check this, Table 4 compares our establishment TFP shock measure of
uncertainty with other measures of uncertainty, primarily the volatility of daily and monthly
would be biased downwards, which would work against our reported results rather than strengthening them.

the interquartile range (IQR) of establishment-level TFP ‘shocks’ within each SIC 4-digit industry-year cell. The regression sample in column (1) is the 16,451 industry-year cells
of the population of manufacturing establishments with 25 years or more of observations in the ASM or CM survey between 1972 and 2009 (which contains 446,051 underlying
establishment years of data), in columns (2) and (3) is the apparel and textiles subset of this dataset, in column (4) is a balanced panel version of the apparel and textile sample, and
in column (5) is this dataset less the data for 1972 (since Bretton Woods created fixed exchange rates until 1971). These industry-year cells are weighted in the regression by the
number of establishment observations within that cell. The TFP ‘shock’ is calculated as the residual from the regression of log(TFP) at year t+1 on its lagged value (year t), a full
set of year dummies and establishment fixed effects. Columns (1) and (2) are estimated by OLS while columns (3), (4), and (5) are estimated by instrumental variables (IV) with
the first-stage results shown in the bottom panel below. The instrument in columns (3) and (4) is the share of industry trade covered by quotas on Chinese exports before China
joined the WTO in 2005 (details in the Appendix), while the instruments in column (5) are the industry-level exchange rates (details in the Appendix). Standard errors clustered by
industry are reported in brackets below every point estimate. *** denotes 1% significance, ** 5% significance and * 10% significance.

Notes: The dependent variable is the mean of the absolute TFP shock at the firm-year level (columns (1) to (4)) and industry-year level (column (5)). This TFP shock is calculated
as the residual from the regression of log(TFP) at year t+1 on its lagged value (year t), a full set of year dummies and establishment fixed effects. The regression sample in
columns (1) to (4) are the 25,302 firm-year cells of the population of manufacturing establishments with 25 years or more of observations in the ASM or CM survey between 1972
and 2009 which are owned by Compustat (publicly listed) firms. This covers 172,074 underlying establishment years of data. The regression sample in column (5) is the 16,406
industry-year cells of the population of manufacturing establishments with 25 years or more of observations in the ASM or CM survey between 1972 and 2009. The explanatory
variables in columns (1) to (3) are the annual standard deviation of the parent firm’s stock returns, which are calculated using the 260 daily values in columns (1) and (3) and the
12 monthly values in column (2). For comparability of monthly and daily values, the coefficients and S.E for the daily returns columns (1) and (3) are divided by sqrt(21). The
daily stock returns in column (2) are normalized by the (equity/(debt+equity)) ratio to control for leverage effects. In column (4) the explanatory variable is the standard deviation
of the parent firm’s quarterly sales growth. Finally, in column (5) the explanatory variable is the standard deviation of the industry’s monthly industrial production data from the
Federal Reserve Board. All columns have a full set of year fixed effects with columns (1) to (4) also having firm fixed effects while column (5) has industry fixed effects. Standard
errors clustered by firm/industry are reported in brackets below every point estimate. *** denotes 1% significance, ** 5% significance and * 10% significance.
     …rm-stock returns, which have been used commonly in the prior uncertainty literature.21
        In column (1) we regress the mean absolute size of the TFP shock in the plants of public
     traded …rms against their parent …rms within year volatility of daily stock-returns (plus a
     full set of …rm and year …xed e¤ects). The positive and highly signi…cant coe¢ cient reveals
     that when plants of publicly quoted …rms have large positive or negative TFP shocks in
     any given year, their parent …rms are likely to have signi…cantly more volatile daily stock
     returns over the course of that year. This is reassuring for both our TFP shock measure of
     uncertainty and stock market volatility measures of uncertainty, as while neither measure
     is ideal the fact that they are strongly correlated suggests that they are both proxying for
     some underlying measure of …rm-level uncertainty. In column (2) we use monthly returns
     rather than daily returns and …nd similar results, while in column (3) following Leahy and
     Whited (1996) we leverage adjust the stock returns and again …nd similar results.
        In column (4) we compare instead the within-year standard deviation of …rm quarterly
     sales growth against the absolute size of their establishment TFP shocks. We …nd again a
     strikingly signi…cant positive coe¢ cient, showing that …rms with a wider dispersion of TFP
     shocks across their plants tend to have more volatile sales growth within the year. Finally,
     in column (5) we generate an industry-level measure of output volatility within the year by
     taking the standard deviation of monthly production growth, and we …nd that this measure
     is also correlated with the average absolute size of establishment-level TFP shocks within
     the industry in that year.
        So in summary, establishment-level TFP shocks are larger when the parent …rms have
     more volatile stock returns and sales growth within the year, and the overall industry has
     more volatile monthly output growth within the year. This suggests these indicators are all
     picking up some type of stochastic volatility process for uncertainty, which we will model
     in Section 3.

     2.5   Macroeconomic Measures of Uncertainty
     The results discussed so far focus on establishing the countercyclicality of idiosyncratic
     (establishment, …rm, and industry) uncertainty. Looking instead at macroeconomic uncer-
     tainty, there is already a growing literature providing evidence that this is also countercycli-
     cal, for example Schwert (1989), Campbell, Lettau, Malkiel, and Xu (2001) and Engle and
     Rangel (2008).
        Rather than repeat this evidence here we simply include one additional model-speci…c
     empirical measure of aggregate uncertainty, which is the conditional heteroskedasticity of
     aggregate productivity At . This is estimated using a GARCH(1; 1) estimator on the Basu,
21
     See, for example, Leahy and Whited (1996), Schwert (1989), Bloom, Bond, and Van Reenen (2007) and
     Panousi and Papanikolaou (2011).

     Fernald, and Kimball (2006) data on quarterly TFP growth from 1972Q1 to 2010Q4. We
     …nd that conditional heteroskedasticity of TFP growth is strongly countercyclical, rising

     3     The General Equilibrium Model
     We proceed by analyzing the quantitative impact of variation in uncertainty within a DSGE
     model. We consider an economy with heterogeneous …rms that are subject to both …rst-
     moment and second-moment shocks.
         In the model, each …rm uses capital and labor to produce a …nal good. Firms that
     adjust their capital stock and employment incur non-convex adjustment costs.
         As is standard in the RBC literature, …rms are subject to an exogenous process for
     productivity. We assume that the productivity process has an aggregate and an idiosyncratic
     component. In addition to these …rst-moment shocks, we allow the second moment of the
     innovations to productivity to vary over time. That is, shocks to productivity can be fairly
     small in normal times, but become potentially large when uncertainty is high.

     3.1     Firms
     3.1.1    Technology

     The economy is populated by a large number of heterogeneous …rms that employ capital
     and labor to produce a single …nal good. We assume that each …rm operates a diminish-
     ing returns to scale production function with capital and labor as the variable inputs.23
     Speci…cally, a …rm indexed by j produces output according to

                                    yj;t = At zj;t kj;t nj;t ;   +   < 1:                                (5)

     Each …rm’s productivity is a product of two separate processes: aggregate productivity,
     At , and an idiosyncratic component, zj;t . Both the macro- and …rm-level components of
     productivity follow autoregressive processes as noted in equations (2) and (3). We allow
     the variance of innovations to the productivity processes,             A   and   Z,   to vary over time
                                                                            t         t
     according to a two-state Markov chain.
22
   We also estimated a GARCH(1; 1) for monthly industrial production, including as many as twelve lags and
   …nd very similar results. We also experimented with di¤erent speci…cations, such as ARCH(1) or using GDP
   growth rates, and results again were very similar.
23
   An alternative model has monopolistically competitive …rms in which each …rm produces a di¤erentiated
   good. Note that the assumption of decreasing returns to scale allows us to pin down the …rm’s size.

     3.1.2      Adjustment Costs

     We allow for the presence of various types of convex and non-convex adjustment costs in
     capital and labor. As is well known in the literature, it is the presence of the non-convex
     adjustment costs that leads to a real options or wait-and-see e¤ect of uncertainty shocks.
         To be consistent with the existing evidence regarding the presence of multiple types of
     adjustment costs, we include the following forms of adjustment costs: in capital we allow
     for partial irreversibility, while in labor we allow for a …xed cost when changing the stock of
     labor, as well as hiring and …ring costs.24 We elaborate on these adjustment costs in what
     follows.
         With respect to capital, we assume that a …rm’s capital stock evolves according to the
     standard law of motion
                                              kj;t+1 = (1          k )kj;t   + ij;t ;                       (6)

     where      k   is the rate of capital depreciation and ij;t denotes investment. The capital adjust-
     ment cost we consider is a partial irreversibility. Resale of capital occurs at a price that is
     only a share (1        S) of its purchase price.
         Similarly, we assume that the law of motion for hours worked, given labor adjustment
     value sj;t , is governed by
                                              nt;t = (1       n )nj;t 1      + sj;t :                       (7)

     At each period a constant fraction                n   of hours worked is exogenously destroyed due to
     retirement, illness, maternity leave, exogenous quits, etc.25
         We assume that whenever the …rm chooses to adjust its stock of hours relative to (1
      n )nj;t 1 ,   it incurs a …xed cost F L independently of the size of the change in hours. We
     also allow for hiring and …ring costs which represent, for example, variable interviewing and
     training costs or severance packages. In our model, we assume that this cost is identical for
     hiring and …ring and expressed as a share H of the annual wage bill per worker. Note that
     these adjustment costs in labor imply that nj;t                1   is a state variable for the …rm.

     3.1.3      The Firm’s Value Function

     We denote by V (k; n                    A;   Z;
                                 1 ; z; A;             ) the value function of a …rm. The seven state vari-
     ables are given by (1) a …rm’s capital stock k, (2) a …rm’s hours stock from the previous
24
   See the literature focused on estimating labor and capital adjustment costs, including, Nickell (1986), Ca-
   ballero and Engel (1999), Ramey and Shapiro (2001), Hall (2004), Cooper and Haltiwanger (2006), and Merz
   and Yashiv (2007). We incorporate all types of adjustment costs that have been estimated to be statistically
   signi…cant at the 5% level in Bloom (2009).
25
   The assumption of exogenous separations is common in search models such as the Diamond-Mortensen-
   Pissarides model. For consistency with the prior business cycle literature we assume hiring adds to the labor
   force immediately and investment adds to the capital stock with a one period lag, although experimentation
   with these timing assumptions reveals they are not important for the results.

3.2      Households
The economy is populated by a large number of identical households that we normalize to
a measure one. Households choose paths of consumption, labor supply, and investment in
…rm shares to maximize lifetime utility. We use the measure                                                                  to denote the one-period
shares in …rms. The dynamic problem of the household is given by

     3.4   Sketch of the Numerical Solution
     We brie‡y describe the solution algorithm, which heavily relies on the approach in Kahn and
     Thomas (2008) and Bachmann, Caballero and Engel (2008), with fuller details in Appendix
     B, and the full code available on-line.27
         The model can be simpli…ed substantially if we combine the …rm and household problems
     into a single dynamic optimization problem. From the household problem we get

                                                         UN (C; N )
                                           w =                                                              (12)
                                                         UC (C; N )
                                                         UC (C 0 ; N 0 )
                                           m =                           ;                                  (13)
                                                         UC (C; N )

     where equation (12) is the standard optimality condition for labor supply and equation
     (13) is the standard expression for the stochastic discount factor. We assume that the
     momentary utility function for the household is separable across consumption and hours
     worked,
                                                         Ct1               Nt
                                        U (Ct ; Nt ) =                          ;                           (14)
                                                         1
     implying that the wage rate is a function of the marginal utility of consumption,

                                                              1
                                              wt = Nt                  :                                    (15)
                                                                  Ct

     We also de…ne the intertemporal price of consumption goods as p(A;              Z;   A;   )    UC (C; N ).
     This then allows us to rede…ne the …rm’s problem in terms of marginal utility, denoting the
     new value function as V~ pV . The …rm problem can then be expressed as

           V~ (k; n 1 ; z; A; A ; Z ; ) =
                 (                                                                                          )
                    p(A; A ; Z ; ) y w(A;h A ; Z ; )n i AC k (k; k               0
                                                                                i)    AC n (n      1 ; n)
           max                                                       0                                      (16)
                                                                                                             :
           fi;ng                        + E V~ (k 0 ; n; z 0 ; A0 ; A ; Z0 ; 0 )

     To solve this problem we employ nonlinear techniques that build upon Krusell and Smith
     (1998). Again, detailed discussion of the algorithm is provided in Appendix B.

Notes: The model parameters relating to preferences, technology, and adjustment costs are calibrated as referenced above. The uncertainty process calibration is
explained in detail in the main text and is based on the moments of the cross-sectional interquartile range of the establishment-level shock to estimated
productivity in the Census of Manufactures and Annual Survey of Manufactures manufacturing sample, along with the moments of estimated heteroskedasticity
of the US aggregate Solow residual based on a GARCH(1,1) model. Both sets of calibrated moments from the data are computed from 1972-2010.
     Frequency and Preferences We set the time period to equal a quarter. The household’s
     discount rate,     , is set to match an annual interest rate of 5%:                      is set equal to one
     which implies that the momentary utility function features an elasticity of intertemporal
     substitution of one. Following Kahn and Thomas (2008) and Bachmann, Caballero and
     Engel (2008) we make the simplifying assumption that the Frisch labor supply elasticity is
     in…nite, corresponding to        = 1. This assumption implies that we do not need to forecast
     the wage rate in addition to the forecast of p because when                     = 1 we get

                                                wt =        1   =        :

     We set the parameter         such that households spend a third of their time working in the
     non-stochastic steady state.

     Production Function, Depreciation, and Adjustment Costs                                  We set   k   to match
     a 10% annual capital depreciation rate. The annual exogenous quit rate of labor is set to
     35%. This estimate is based on Shimer (2005). We set the exponents on capital and labor
     in the …rm’s production function to be          = 0:25 and              = 0:5, consistent with a capital cost
     share of 1=3.
         The existing literature provides a wide range of estimates for capital and labor adjust-
     ment costs.28 We set our adjustment cost parameters to match Bloom (2009), which to our
     knowledge is the only paper that jointly estimates capital and labor convex and non-convex
     adjustment costs. The resale loss of capital amounts to 34%. The …xed cost of adjusting
     hours is set to 2:1% of annual wages, and the hiring and …ring costs equal 1:8% of annual
     wages.

     Aggregate and Idiosyncratic TFP Processes Productivity, both at the aggregate
     and the idiosyncratic level, is determined by AR(1) processes as speci…ed in equations (2)
     and (3). The serial autocorrelation parameters                 A   and     Z   are set to 0.95, similar to the
     quarterly value used by Kahn and Thomas (2008).

     The Calibrated Process for Uncertainty                     Since we are interested in studying the e¤ect
     of uncertainty shocks we assume that the uncertainty process is independent of the …rst-
     moment shocks. We assume for simplicity that the stochastic volatility processes,                       A   and
                                                                                                             t

     Since we cannot directly observe the stochastic process of uncertainty in the data, the
     calibration has to be guided by the impact of uncertainty on observable cross-sectional and
     aggregate time series moments. There are eight parameters that need to be calibrated:
      A;     A;   Z;   Z;        A       A           Z           Z
      L      H    L    H        L;H ;   H;L ;       L;H   and   H;L .   As a simpli…cation to ease computational
     constraints we assume that a single process determines the economy’s uncertainty regime,
     since empirically we see both microeconomic and macroeconomic uncertainty rising and
     falling together through the business cycle. This reduces the number of parameters to six: :
      A;    A;    Z;   Z;                                   A           Z
      L     H     L    H        L;H and H;L         since       and         follow the same Markov process but with
     di¤erent levels of         A and Z .29

           We calibrate these six parameters against eight moments from U.S. data. At the mi-
     croeconomic level, we target the mean, standard deviation, skewness, and autocorrelation
     of the time series of the cross-sectional interquartile range of establishment TFP shocks
     computed from our annual Census sample covering 1972-2010. We display these moments
     in Table 6. At the macro level, we target the same four moments based on the time series
     of estimated heteroskedasticity in the annualized quarterly growth rate of the U.S. Solow
     residual, again covering 1972-2010.
           In the model, we simulate 5000 …rms for 5000 quarters and compute each of the eight
     moments discussed above, reporting the results in Table 6.30 The simulated data generally
     reproduces well the time series properties of volatility measures in the U.S. data. At the
     microeconomic level, the model implies a high level and standard deviation of cross-sectional
     dispersion, similar to the data, with somewhat lower serial correlation and skewness than
     in our Census sample. At the aggregate level, the model successfully produces lower mean
     levels of volatility and ‡uctuations in volatility for the Solow residual, both consistent with
     the U.S. data. We are also successful at reproducing the high persistence and skewness
     evident in U.S. aggregate volatility.31
29
   That is, we assume one underlying two-state Markov chain Se 2 fL; Hg governing the timing of uncertainty
   shocks for both microeconomic and macroeconomic volatility. When Se = L, microeconomic and macroeco-
   nomic volatility are equal to their low values Z      A         e
                                                  L and L . When S = H, microeconomic and macroeconomic
                                              Z      A
   volatility are equal to their high values H and H .
30
   We discard the …rst 500 periods of this 5000-period simulation to eliminate the impact of initial conditions
   upon the business cycle statistics.
31
   When computing the microeconomic moments in the model data, we …rst aggregate to annual frequency
   and then compute measured TFP for each …rm, using a capital share of 1/3 and a labor share of 2/3 to
   approximate the factor share approach we use in the Census data. We also account for measurement error
   in our Census sample by adding noise to the underlying …rm-level measures in the simulated data, assumed

Notes: The micro data moments are calculated from the Census of Manufactures and Annual Survey of
Manufactures sample using annual data from 1972-2010. Micro data moments are computed from the cross-
sectional interquartile range of the estimated shock to establishment-level productivity, in percentages. The model
micro moments are computed in the same fashion as the data moments, after correcting for measurement error in the
data establishment-level regressions and aggregating to annual frequency. The macro data moments refer to the
estimated heteroskedasticity from 1972-2010 implied by a GARCH(1,1) model of the annualized quarterly change
in the aggregate Solow residual, with quarterly data downloaded from John Fernald's website on May 17, 2012. The
model macro moments are computed from an analogous GARCH(1,1) estimation on simulated aggregate data. All
model results are based on a simulation of 5,000 firms for 5,000 periods.

Notes: The first panel contains business cycle statistics for quarterly US data covering 1972-2010. All business
cycle data is current as of May 17, 2012. Output is real gross domestic product, investment is real gross private
domestic investment, and consumption is real personal consumption expenditures. The hours series refers to total
nonfarm business sector hours. FRED codes are GDPC96, GPDIC96, PCECC96, and HOANBS. The second panel
contains analogous business cycle moments for the baseline model, computed from a simulation of 5,000 firms for
5,000 quarters. All series are HP-filtered in logs with smoothing parameter 1600, expressed as percentages.
      Based on our preferred calibration we …nd that periods of high uncertainty occur with a
 quarterly probability of 5%. The period of heightened uncertainty is quite persistent with a
 quarterly probability of 92% of staying in the high uncertainty state. Idiosyncratic volatility
 is set to a low value of 3:9% and approximately triples in the heightened uncertainty state.
 Aggregate volatility is at a low of 0:58% and approximately doubles when an uncertainty
 shock hits.

 4.2     Business Cycle Statistics
 Table 7 illustrates that this calibration generates second-moment statistics that resemble
 their empirical counterparts in U.S. data.32 As in the data, investment and hours commove
 with output. Output and consumption commove, although not as much as in the data.
 Investment is more volatile than output, while consumption is less volatile. Interestingly the
 model also generates a realistic volatility of hours relative to output, which has traditionally
 been di¢ cult to achieve in RBC models.33


 5     The E¤ects of an Uncertainty Shock
 As has been known since at least Scarf (1959), non-convex adjustment costs lead to Ss
 investment and hiring policy rules. Firms do not hire and invest until productivity reaches
 an upper threshold (the S in Ss) or …re and disinvest until productivity hits a lower threshold
 (the s in Ss). This is shown for labor in Figure 5, which plots the distribution of …rms by
 their productivity/labor (Az=l) ratios after the micro and macro shocks have been drawn
 but before …rms have adjusted. On the right is the …rm-level hiring threshold (right black
 line) and on the left the …ring threshold (left black line). Firms to the right of the hiring
 line will hire, …rms to the left of the …ring line will …re, and those in the middle will be
 inactive for the period.
      An increase in uncertainty increases the returns to inaction, shown by the increased
 hiring threshold (right gray line) and reduced …ring threshold (left gray line). When un-
 certainty is high …rms become more cautious as labor adjustment costs make it expensive
 to make a hiring or …ring mistake. Hence, the hiring and …ring thresholds move out, in-
 creasing the range of inaction. This leads to a fall in net hiring, since the mass of …rms is
   to have an equal variance to the underlying TFP shocks, based on Collard-Wexler (2011).
     To compute aggregate moments from the model data, we compute the aggregate annualized changes in the
   quarterly Solow residual, imposing labor and capital shares of 2/3 and 1/3. These shares are approximately
   equal to those used in the construction of John Fernald’s quarterly measure in U.S. data.
32
   We simulate the model for 5000 …rms over 5000 periods and compute the standard set of business cycle
   statistics.

shocks. Finally, we plot a histogram of productivity/labor ratios in our sample of firms.

fluctuations from period 5 onwards are due to echo effects arising from lumpy adjustment costs.

     right-shifted due to labor attrition. A similar phenomena happens with capital, whereby
     increases in uncertainty reduce the amount of net investment.

     5.1    Modelling a Pure Uncertainty Shock
     To analyze the aggregate impact of uncertainty, we simulate 400 economies, where each
     economy has 20,000 …rms. Each economy is of 100-quarter length. In the …rst ten periods
     of the economy we force uncertainty to be low. We then force uncertainty to jump in period
     11. Uncertainty is then left to freely evolve according to its Markov transition process. We
     exclude the …rst 25 economies that are used to initialize the distribution over z; k; and n               1;
     and we average the results over the remaining 375 simulated economies.
         The impact on output is plotted in Figure 6, displaying a drop of just over 3% within
     one quarter, and then a recovery to close to level within one year. This is substantial and
     suggests that uncertainty shocks can be quantitatively important in driving business cycles.
         These dynamics in output arise from three channels: labor, capital, and the misallocation
     of factors of production, shown in Figure 7. First, in the top-left panel we plot the time path
     of the aggregate labor force. When uncertainty increases most …rms pause hiring, and the
     labor force starts to drop because workers are continuing to attrit from …rms without being
     replaced. Importantly, in the model this rate of attrition is assumed to be constant over
     the cycle. This is consistent with Shimer (2005) and Hall (2005), which show that around
     three quarters of the movements in the volatility of unemployment are due to job-…nding
     rates and not to the cyclicality of the destruction rate.
         Second, in the top-right panel we plot the time path of investment, which drops rapidly
     due to the increase in uncertainty. Since investment falls but capital continues to depreciate,
     there is also a drop in the capital stock. Finally, in the bottom-left panel we show that
     productivity, measured as the Solow residual, also drops after the uncertainty shock.34 This
     occurs because uncertainty increases the misallocation of factors across …rms. In normal
     times, unproductive …rms contract and productive …rms expand, helping to maintain high
     levels of aggregate productivity. But when uncertainty is high, …rms reduce expansion
     and contraction, shutting o¤ much of this productivity-enhancing reallocation. This slow-
     down in reallocation manifests itself as a fall in measured aggregate TFP. The bottom-right
     panel of Figure 7 provides another measure of the reduction in reallocation in terms of an
     increase in misallocation. It plots the cross-sectional variation of the marginal product of
     labor (MPL) across plants in the model. This steady-state value is positive since adjustment
     costs prevent instant reallocation of factors across plants. But once the uncertainty shock
     hits the economy there is an increase of about 25% in this measure of misallocation, due to
34
     The Solow residual is de…ned as log(Yt )  log(Kt )    log(Lt ), where Yt , Kt , and Lt are aggregate output,
     capital, and labor, and and v are the decreasing returns to scale production elasticities.

average from its value in quarter 0. For labor misallocation we simply plot the cross-economy average in percent.

     uncertainty impeding …rms’ability to e¢ ciently reallocate labor.35
         In the longer run, labor, investment, and TFP all start to recover to their steady state
     as the uncertainty shock is temporary. As uncertainty falls back …rms start to hire and
     invest again to address their pent-up demand for labor and capital. But the pace of the
     rebound is tempered by the desire of consumers to smooth consumption, leading to a slow
     gradual recovery. Hence, an uncertainty shock generates a short and sharp recession and a
     prolonged recovery.
         In Figure 8 we plot the time pro…le of consumption. When the uncertainty shock occurs
     consumption jumps up in the …rst quarter, before subsequently falling back below trend
     for several quarters. The reason for the initial spike in consumption is that the freeze
     in investment and hiring reduces the resources spent on capital and labor adjustment,
     "freeing" up consumption. From period two onwards investment and labor rebound, so
     that consumption falls.
         This overshoot in consumption may seem surprising, because uncertainty makes risk-
     averse consumers want to increase their precautionary savings. But o¤setting this desire to
     increase precautionary savings is the fact that the returns to savings have now decreased.
     Consumers can only save through capital, and the returns to capital have also become more
     risky with the rise in uncertainty. Hence, on impact the uncertainty shock both temporarily
     reduces prices (increasing the attractiveness of consumption) and increases the riskiness of
     capital (reducing the attractiveness of saving), leading to an overshoot in consumption.
         Clearly, this rise in consumption at the start of recessions is an unattractive feature of a
     pure uncertainty shock model of business cycles. Several options exist, however, to try and
     address this. One is to allow consumers to save in other technologies besides capital, for
     example, in foreign assets. This is the approach Fernandez-Villaverde, Guerron-Quintana,
     Rubio-Ramirez, and Uribe (2009) take in modelling risk shocks in small open economies.
     In an open economy model a domestic uncertainty shock induces agents to increase their
     savings abroad (capital ‡ight). In our closed model this is not possible, but extending the
     model to allow a foreign sector would make this feasible although computationally more
     intensive. Another option would be to use utility functions such as those in Greenwood,
     Hercowitz, and Hu¤man (1998). Due to the complementarity between consumption and
     hours in such preference structures, they should reduce the overshoot in consumption. As
     we discuss below, another option is to augment our uncertainty shock with a small …rst-
     moment shock. Adding a negative …rst-moment shock reduces the supply of goods during
     a recession, eliminating the initial consumption overshoot.
35
     Note that since the real options mechanism a¤ects both capital and labor inputs, the increase in misallocation
     also occurs in capital as well, with the dispersion of the marginal product of capital (MPK) following a path
     qualitatively similar to that of misallocation in the MPL.

     5.2    First-Moment and Second-Moment Shocks
     The evidence in Section 2 suggests that recessions are periods of both …rst- and second-
     moment shocks. So, to generate an empirically more realistic simulation we consider the
     combination of an uncertainty shock and a              2% …rst moment shock. Speci…cally, we con-
     sider an economy where both a negative …rst-moment and a positive second-moment shock
     hit the economy at the same period, namely period one in Figure 9.36
         As Figure 9 suggests, this additional shock magni…es the drop in output and investment.
     The size of these ‡uctuations are now large enough to account for the drop and rebound in
     output even during the most recent recession. The addition of the …rst-moment shock also
     leads to a fall in consumption on impact.
         Hence, both empirically and in the simulation we …nd that recessions appear to be well
     characterized as a combination of a negative …rst-moment shock and a positive second-
     moment shock. Having a …rst-moment component of the shock helps to …t the time series
     of consumption. Having a second-moment component of the shock helps to reduce the size
     of the …rst-moment shock necessary to lead to recessions, while also generating a U-shaped
     path of output over the business cycle.


     6     Decomposing the Impact of Uncertainty
     How do the e¤ects of uncertainty shocks di¤er across a General Equilibrium (GE) framework
     and Partial Equilibrium (PE)? To address this question we plot in Figure 10 the impact of
     an uncertainty shock in three di¤erent economies. The black line (                symbols) depicts again
     the e¤ects of an uncertainty shock in our GE model economy, the red line (+ symbols)
     depicts the same response but with PE only (all prices and wages are held constant and the
     consumer side of the economy ignored), while the blue line (o symbols) depicts the e¤ects
     of an uncertainty shock in PE economy with no adjustment costs at all.
         As the blue line (o symbols) suggests, when there are no adjustment costs of any type
     in a PE economy, output actually increases following an uncertainty shock. The reason for
     this result is related to the Oi (1961), Hartman (1972) and Abel (1983) e¤ect, whereby a
     higher variance of productivity increases investment, hiring, and output because the optimal
     capital and labor choices are convex in productivity.37
         As the red line (+ symbols) suggests, the addition of adjustment costs to the PE setup
36
     See Appendix B for a description of the algorithm.
37
     To be precise, if Y = AK a Lb with a + b < 1; the per period rental cost of capital is r; and the wage rate is
                                                                                          1                    1
     w, then without adjustment costs the optimal choice of K and L are K = 1 A 1 a b and L = 2 A 1 a b
     where 1 and 2 are functions of a; b; r and w: Hence, K and L are convex in A; so that higher variance
     in A will increase the average levels of K and L, which is commonly known as the Oi-Hartman-Abel e¤ect
     after Oi (1961), Hartman (1972), and Abel (1983).

The general equilibrium response is the baseline simulation. Partial equilibrium simulations impose fixed output prices and
consumption, with or without adjustment costs for capital and labor inputs.




                                                                                                                                               5
     dramatically changes the e¤ect of an uncertainty shock. Now, on impact there is a fall in
     aggregate output. The reason is the increase in uncertainty moves …rms’labor and capital
     Ss bands out, temporarily pausing hiring and investment. If all …rms pause hiring and
     investment, aggregate labor and capital drop due to labor attrition and capital depreciation.
     But this pause is short-lived, as once uncertainty drops back …rms start to hire and invest
     again. So in the medium-run the Oi-Hartman-Abel e¤ect dominates and output rises above
     its long-run trend.38
         While these forces are also present in the baseline GE and adjustment cost economy,
     the curvature in the utility function (i.e. the endogenous movement in the interest rate)
     moderates the rebound and overshoot.39 The overshoot in the PE economy requires big
     movements in investment and labor, which would lead to excessively large swings in con-
     sumption. The curvature in utility slows down the rebound of the GE economy, generating
     a smoother and more persistent output cycle.
         Intriguingly, in the …rst period, however, GE has very little impact on output because
     the Ss bands have moved so far out that there is almost no density of …rms near the hiring
     or investment threshold to respond to prices. Hence, the short-run robustness of the impact
     of uncertainty shocks to GE suggested by Bloom (2009) seems to be present, while the
     medium-run sensitivity to GE highlighted by Thomas (2002) and Khan and Thomas (2003,
     2008) is also present.


     7    Policy in the Presence of Uncertainty
     In this section, we analyze the e¤ects of stimulative policies in the presence of uncertainty
     shocks. It is important to emphasize that any such policy is not optimal within the con-
     text of our model, as the competitive equilibrium is Pareto optimal. Rather, we see our
     policy experiments as a means of documenting the e¤ects of such policies in times of height-
     ened uncertainty. It is also worth noting that this ignores the direct impact of policy on
     uncertainty, as this is too complex to include in this model.40
         The policy experiment we consider is a policy that attempts to temporarily stimulate
     hiring by reducing the e¤ective wage paid by …rms. More speci…cally, the policy consists of
38
   Interestingly, this overshoot is actually more persistent than with PE and no adjustment costs because the
   introduction of adjustment costs smooths the overshoot and rebound, similar to the results on the smoothing
   e¤ects of microeconomic rigidities in, for example, Caballero and Engel (1993).
39
   This is similar to the di¤erence between PE and GE economies’convergence to the steady state when starting
   with a capital stock below the steady state. A PE economy converges within one period to the steady state
   value. In a GE economy, due to the curvature in utility, the convergence is slower. This e¤ect is also present
   in small open economy models that are de facto PE economies. In such models, absent adjustment costs,
   the behavior of investment is very volatile.
40
   For a discussion and literature review of the impact of policy on uncertainty see, for example, Baker, Bloom,
   and Davis (2012).



                                                        22
an unanticipated 1% wage bill subsidy paid for one quarter and …nanced through a lump-
sum tax on households. We simulate this policy impulse once during an uncertainty shock
and also in an economy that is not hit by an uncertainty shock. By comparing the e¤ect in
those two cases, we attempt to identify the e¤ect of uncertainty on policy e¤ectiveness.
    Figure 11 depicts these experiments. The black line (        symbols) is the impact of the
1% wage subsidy in an economy that is not hit by an uncertainty shock. Not surprisingly,
the arti…cially reduced wage stimulates hiring and increases output which then gradually
returns to its long run trend. The red line (+ symbols) shows the net impact of the 1% wage
subsidy applied at the same time as the uncertainty shock hits. The presence of uncertainty
reduces the e¤ects of the wage policy by 26% on impact (by 46% over the following four
quarters). The reason is that as soon as uncertainty rises, the Ss thresholds jump out,
so most …rms are far away from their hiring and investment thresholds, making them less
responsive to any policy stimulus.
    Finally, the blue line (o symbols) in Figure 11 represents the impact of the policy when
implemented four quarters after the uncertainty shock. Now, the e¤ectiveness of the policy
is above its baseline value during periods of low uncertainty, with output increasing by 9%
more on impact than during normal times (and by 15% more than normal times over four
quarters). The reason is that as the distribution of …rm-level TFP fans out towards the
thresholds there is now more density near the hiring threshold, so the economy is more
responsive to wage subsidies than usual.
    Overall, this highlights how uncertainty shocks lead to time-varying policy e¤ectiveness.
At the instant an uncertainty shock hits, policy is not as e¤ective relative to normal times,
while once uncertainty starts to drop down, policy becomes more e¤ective. Hence, uncer-
tainty shocks not only impact the economy directly, but also indirectly change the response
of the economy to any potential reactive stabilization policy.


8    Conclusions
Uncertainty has received substantial attention as a potential factor shaping the depth and
duration of the Great Recession. We formally model this as a shock helping to drive
business cycles. The …rst part of the paper uses Census microdata to show that measured
uncertainty is indeed strongly countercyclical. This is true both at the aggregate and the
industry-level: slower industry growth is associated with higher industry uncertainty. Using
trade and exchange rate instrumental variables we show that this slower industry growth is
not causing the rise in uncertainty. Instead, uncertainty appears to be an exogenous process,
suggesting recessions are driven by a combination of …rst- and second-moment shocks.
    The second part of the paper then builds a DSGE model with heterogeneous …rms, time-

Notes: Simulated for 400 separate economies with 20,000 firms each. For a subsidy in normal times, we allow all exogenous
processes to evolve naturally and provide a one-quarter 1% wage bill subsidy in quarter 1, plotting the percent deviation of the
average output level in a given period from quarter 0. In normal times, the choice of quarter for a subsidy does not affect the output
response. For a subsidy in quarter x paired with an uncertainty shock in quarter 1, we impose an uncertainty shock in quarter 1
together with a wage bill subsidy of 1% in quarter x. We plot the difference between the percent deviation of average output from
quarter 0 in the wage bill and subsidy case and the percent deviation of average output from quarter 0 in the case of an uncertainty
shock in quarter 1 with no wage bill subsidy.
varying uncertainty, and adjustment costs to quantify the impact of these second-moment
shocks. We …nd that they typically lead to drops of about 3% in GDP, with a sharp drop
and slow recovery. This suggests that uncertainty could play an important role in driving
business cycles. We also …nd that because uncertainty makes …rms cautious but also makes
…rm-level outcomes more volatile, it substantially changes the response of the economy to
stimulative policy.
   In future research we would like to extend the theoretical work by including trade ‡ows,
modelling a more sophisticated policymaking process under uncertainty, and allowing for
a distinction between durable and nondurable consumption, with real options e¤ects on
durable consumer behavior.

     A     Appendix: Census Uncertainty Data
     We use data from the Census of Manufactures (CM) and the Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM)
     from the U.S. Census Bureau to construct an establishment-level panel. Using the Compustat-
     SSEL bridge (CPST-SSEL) we merge the establishment-level data with Compustat and CRSP high
     frequency …rm-level …nancial and sales data which allows us to correlate …rm and industry-level
     cross-sectional dispersion from Census data with stock returns volatility measures. For industry-
     level de‡ators, and to calculate production function elasticities, we use industry-level data from the
     NBER-CES productivity database, the Federal Reserve Board (prices and depreciation), the BLS
     (multifactor productivity) and the BEA (…xed assets tables). We use exchange rates and product-
     level quotas and trade data to construct industry-year …rst-moment instruments. In this appendix
     we describe each of our data sources, the way we construct our samples, and the way each variable
     is constructed. In constructing the TFP variables we closely follow Syverson (2004).

     A.1     Data Sources
     A.1.1    Establishment Level
     The establishment-level analysis uses the CM and the ASM data. The CM is conducted every 5
     years (for years ending 2 and 7) since 1967 (another CM was conducted at 1963). It covers all
     establishments with one or more paid employees in the manufacturing sector (SIC 20-39 or NAICS
     31-33) which amounts to 300,000 to 400,000 establishments per survey. Since the CM is conducted
     at the establishment-level, a …rm which operates more than one establishment …les a separate report
     for each establishment. As a unique establishment-level ID we use the LBDNUM variable which
     allows us to match establishments over time within the CM and between the CM and the ASM. We
     use the FIRMID variable to match establishments to the Compustat-SSEL bridge which allows us
     to match to Compustat and CRSP …rm’s data using the Compustat CUSIP identi…er.
         For annual frequency we add the ASM …les to the CM …les constructing a panel of establishments
     from 1972 to 2010 (using the LBDNUM identi…er).41 Starting 1973, the ASM is conducted every
     year in which a CM is not conducted. The ASM covers all establishments which were recorded in
     the CM above a certain size and a sample of the smaller establishments. The ASM includes 50,000
     to 75,000 observations per year. Both the CM and the ASM provide detailed data on sales, value
     added, labor inputs, labor cost, cost of materials, capital expenditures, inventories and more. We
     give more details on the variables we use in the variables construction subsection below.

     A.1.2    Firm Level
     We use Compustat and CRSP to calculate volatility of sales and returns at the …rm level.42 The
     Compustat-SSEL bridge is used to match Census establishment data to Compustat and CRSP …rm’s
     data using the Compustat CUSIP identi…er. The bridge includes a mapping (m:m) between FIRMID
     (which can be found in the CM and ASM) and CUSIP8 (which can be found in Compustat and
     CRSP). The bridge covers the years 1976 to 2005. To extend the bridge to the entire sample of our
     analysis (1972-2010), we assigned each FIRMID after 2001 to the last observed CUSIP8 and before
     1976 to the …rst observed CUSIP843 .
         From the CRSP data set we obtain daily and monthly returns at the …rm level (RET). From
     Compustat we obtain …rm-level quarterly sales (SALEQ) as well as data on equity (SEQQ) and debt
     (DLTTQ and DLCQ) which is used to construct the leverage ratio (in book values).

     A.1.3    Industry Level
     We use multiple sources of industry-level data for variables which do not exist at the establishment
     or …rm level including price indices, cost shares, depreciation rates, market to book ratio of capital,
41
   The 2010 ASM data became available only very recently. To avoid repeating extensive census disclosure
   analysis, in Tables 2, 3 and 4 we use data only up to 2009.
42
   The access to CRSP and Compustat data sets is through WRDS: https://wrds-
   web.wharton.upenn.edu/wrds/.
43
   We do this assignment for 2002-2005, since the bridge has many missing matches for these years.


                                                       29
     import-export data and industrial production.
          The NBER-CES Manufacturing Industry Database is the main source for industry-level price
     indices for total value of shipments (PISHIP), and capital expenditures (PIINV).44 It is also the
     main source for industry-level total cost of inputs for labor (PAY). The total cost variable is used
     in the construction of industry cost shares. We match the NBER data to the establishment data
     using 4-digit SIC87 codes for the years 1972-1996 and 6-digit NAICS codes starting 1997.45 We
     complete our set of price indices using FRB capital investment de‡ators, with separate de‡ators for
     equipment and structures, kindly provided to us by Randy Becker.
          The BLS multifactor productivity database is used for constructing data on industry-level cost
     of capital and capital depreciation.46 In particular data from the tables “Capital Detail Data by
     Measure for Major Sectors” is used. From these tables we obtain data on depreciation rates (table
     9a: EQDE, STDE), capital income (table 3a: EQKY STKY), productive capital (table 4a: EQPK,
     STPK), and an index of the ratio of capital input to productive stock (table 6b: EQKC, STKC). All
     measures are obtained separately for equipment and for structures (there are the EQ and ST pre…x
     respectively). We use these measures to recover the cost of capital in production at the industry
     level. We match the BLS data to the establishment data using 2-digit SIC87 codes for the years
     1972-1996 and 3 digit NAICS codes starting 1997.
          We use the BEA …xed assets tables to transform establishment-level capital book value to market
     value. For historical cost we use tables 3.3E and 3.3S for equipment and for structures respectively.47
     For current cost we use tables 3.1E and 3.1S.
          The industrial production index constructed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
     System (FRB) is used to construct annual industry-level volatility measures.48 The data is at
     a monthly frequency and is provided at NAICS 3-digit to 6-digit level. We match the data to
     establishment-level data using the most detailed NAICS value available in the FRB data. Since
     ASM and CM records do not contain NAICS codes prior to 1997, we obtain for each establishment
     in our sample a modal NAICS code which will be non-missing in the case that the establishment
     appears for at least one year after 1996. For establishments who do not appear in our sample after
     1996 we use an empirical SIC87-NAICS concordance. This concordance matches to each SIC87 code
     its modal NAICS code using establishments which appear in years prior to 1997 and after 1997.
          We use data from Peter K. Schott’s website for exports and imports originally purchased from
     the U.S. Census Bureau and given in 4-digit SIC87 codes.49 We use the Cost, Insurance, and Freight
     (CIF) de…nition of imports by industry from this data set when we construct weighted industry-level
     exchange rate indices which are used as instruments for …rst-moment shocks. We match the data
     to establishment-level data using SIC87 codes. Since SIC87 codes are not available for all years, we
     follow the procedure described above for NAICS to assign SIC87 codes for all establishments.

     A.1.4    Additional Data Sets
     We use three additional data sets in the construction of the instruments for demand shocks. The
     IMF IFS website is used for downloading exchange rates between local currencies of 15 countries and
     the U.S. dollar.50 We focus on G-20 countries as these have large diversi…ed economies so should
     have exchange rate movements which are exogenous to shocks to any particular industry. Within
     the G-20 we exclude Argentina, Brazil, and Russia since these have hyperin‡ations over this period,
     making the construction of real exchange rates problematic. We obtain price de‡ators for the 15
     countries from the OECD website.51
         For the construction of the trade instruments, we use data on the change in quotas on imports
     from China constructed by Bloom, Draca, and Van Reenen (2011), and provided to us by the authors
44
   See: http://www.nber.org/data/nbprod2005.html for the public version. We thank Wayne Gray for sharing
   his version of the dataset that is updated to 2009.
45
   The NBER-CES data are available only through 2009. 2010 industry-level data are therefore projected using
   an AR(4) regression for all external datasets.

     (see the data appendix in their paper for more details on construction of the quotas).

     A.2     Sample Selection
     We have …ve main establishment samples which are used in our analysis of the manufacturing
     sector. The largest sample includes all establishments which appear in the CM or ASM for at
     least two consecutive years (implicitly implying that we must have at least one year from the ASM,
     therefore ASM sampling applies). In addition we exclude establishments which are not used in
     Census tabulation (TABBED=N), establishments with missing or nonpositive data on total value
     of shipments (TVS) and establishments with missing values for LBDNUM, value added (VA), labor
     inputs or investment. We also require each establishment to have at least one record of capital stock
     (at any year). This sample consists of 211,939 establishments and 1,365,759 establishment-year
     observations.
         The second sample, which is our baseline sample, keeps establishments which appear for at
     least 25 years between 1972 and 2009. This sample consists of 15,673 establishments and 453,704
     establishment-year observations.52
         The third sample we use is based on the baseline sample limited to establishments for which
     …rms have CRSP and Compustat records, with nonmissing values for stock returns, sales, equity
     and debt. The sample includes 10,498 establishments with 172,074 establishment-year observations.
         The fourth sample uses a balanced panel of establishments which were active for all years be-
     tween 1972 and 2009. This sample consists of 3,449 establishments and 127,182 establishment-year
     observations.
         Our last sample (used in Figures 1 and 2), is based on the …rst sample, but includes only
     establishments that were active in 2005, 2006, 2008 and 2009.
         When calculating annual dispersion measures using CRSP and Compustat (see Table 1), we use
     the same sampling criteria as in the baseline ASM-CM sample, keeping only …rms which appear for
     at least 25 years.

     A.3     Variable Construction
     A.3.1     Value Added
     We use the Census value added measure which is de…ned for establishment j at year t as
                                           vj;t = Qj;t    Mj;t    Ej;t ;
     where Qj;t is nominal output, Mj;t is cost of materials and Ej;t is cost of energy and fuels. Nominal
     output is calculated as the sum of total value of shipments and the change in inventory from previous
     year (both …nished inventory and work in progress inventory).
         In most of the analysis we use real value added. In this case, we de‡ate value added by the
     4-digit industry price of shipment (PISHIP) given in the NBER-CES data set.

     A.3.2     Labor Input
     The CM and ASM report for each establishment the total employment (TE), the number of hours
     worked by production workers (PH), the total salaries for the establishment (SW) and the total
     salaries for production workers (WW). The surveys do not report the total hours for non-production
     workers. In addition, one might suspect that the e¤ective unit of labor input is not the same for
     production and non-production workers. We calculate the following measure of labor inputs
                                                      SWj;t
                                             nj;t =          P Hj;t :
                                                      W Wj;t

     A.3.3     Capital Input
     There are two issues to consider when constructing the capital measure. First, capital expenditures
52
     As the 2010 ASM data became available only very recently, whenever 2010 data is used we keep the sample
     of establishments unchanged. For example, we choose establishments that were active for 25 years between
     1972 and 2009, but use data for these establishments also from 2010.


                                                         31
     rather than capital stock are reported in most survey years, and when capital stock is reported
     it is sensitive to di¤erences in accounting methods over the years. Second, the reported capital
     in the surveys is book value. We deal with the latter by …rst converting book to market value
     of capital stocks using BEA …xed asset tables which include both current and historical cost of
     equipment and structures stocks by industry-year. We address the …rst issue using the perpetual
     inventory method, calculating establishment-level series of capital stocks using the plant’s initial
     level of capital stock, the establishment-level investment data and industry-level depreciation rates.
     To apply the perpetual inventory method we …rst de‡ate the initial capital stock (in market value)
     as well as the investment series using FRB capital investment de‡ators. We than apply the formula
                                    53
     Kt = (1        t ) Kt 1 + It :    This procedure is done separately for structures and for equipment.
     However, starting in 1997, the CM does not separately report capital stocks for equipment and
     structures. For plants which existed in 1992, we can use the investment data to back out capital
     stocks for equipment and structures separately after 1992. For plants born after 1992, we assign the
     share of capital stock to equipment and structures to match the share of investment in equipment
     and structures.

     A.3.4     TFP and TFP Shocks
     For establishment j in industry i at year t we de…ne value added based total factor productivity
     (TFP) zbj;i;t as
                                                S        S       E        E       N
                   log (b
                        zj;i;t ) = log(vj;i;t ) i;t log(kj;i;t ) i;t log(kj;i;t ) i;t log(nj;i;t );
                                                                                  S
     where vj;i;t denotes value added (output less materials and energy inputs), kj;i;t represents the
                                   E represents the capital stock of equipment and n
     capital stock of structures, kj;i;t                                               j;i;t the total hours
     worked as described above.
           S ; E ; and N are the cost shares for structures, equipment, and labor. These cost shares
           i;t   i;t      i;t
     are recovered at 4-digit industry level by year, as is standard in the establishment productivity
     estimation literature (see, for example, the survey in Foster, Haltiwanger and Krizan, 2000). We
     generate the cost shares such that they sum to one. De…ne cxi;t as total cost of input x for industry

         We use industry-level data to back           out cxi;t . The total cost of
                                                                           labor inputs cN
                                                                                         i is taken from
     the NBER-CES Manufacturing Industry Database (PAY). The cost of capital (for equipment and
     structures) is set to be capital income at the industry level. The BLS productivity dataset includes
     data on capital income at the 2-digit industry level. To obtain capital income at 4-digit industry
     level we apply the ratio of capital income to capital input calculated using BLS data to the 4-digit
     NBER-CES capital data.
         Given the cost shares, we can recover log (b  zj;i;t ). We then de…ne TFP shocks (ej;t ) as the
     residual from the following …rst-order autoregressive equation for establishment-level log TFP:
                                  log (b
                                       zj;i;t ) = log (b
                                                       zj;i;t        1)   +   i   +   t   + ej;i;t ;            (19)
     where    i   are plant …xed e¤ects and      t   are year dummies.

     A.3.5        Microeconomic Uncertainty Dispersion-Based Measures
     Our main micro uncertainty measures are based on establishment-level TFP shocks (ej;t ) and on
     establishment-level growth in employment and in sales. For variable x we de…ne establishment i’s
     growth rate for year t as xi;t = (xi;t+1 xi;t )=(0:5 xi;t+1 + 0:5 xi;t ).
          Aggregate Level: In Table 1, to measure uncertainty at the aggregate level, we use the interquar-
     tile range (IQR) and the standard deviation of both TFP shocks and sales and employment growth
     by year. We consider additional measures for TFP shocks that allow for more ‡exibility in the AR
     regression (19) used to back out the shocks. In particular we report the dispersion of TFP shocks,
53
     The stock is reported for the end of period, therefore we use last period’s stock with this period’s depreciation
     and investment.


                                                                32
which were calculated by running (19) at the 3-digit industry level (industry by industry), e¤ectively
allowing for and for t to vary by industry.
     We use three additional aggregate uncertainty measures which are not based on Census data.
We use CRSP to calculate the …rms’cross-sectional dispersion of monthly stock returns at a monthly
frequency, and Compustat to calculate the cross-sectional dispersion of sales’growth at a quarterly
frequency, where sales growth is de…ned as (xi;t+4 xi;t )=(0:5 xi;t+4 + 0:5 xi;t ). We use the
industrial production index constructed by the FRB to calculate the cross-sectional dispersion of
industry production growth (xi;t+12 xi;t )=(0:5 xi;t+12 + 0:5 xi;t ) at the monthly level.
     Firm Level: In Table 4, to measure uncertainty at the …rm level, we use the weighted mean
of the absolute value of TFP shocks and sales growth, where we use establishments’total value of
shipments as weights. As an example, the uncertainty measure for …rm f at year t using TFP shocks
is calculated as                      P
                                          j2f   T V Sj;t jej;t j
                                           P                       ;
                                                j2f   T V Sj;t
and it is calculated similarly for growth measures.
    Industry Level: At the industry level we use both IQR (Table 2 and Table 3) and weighted mean
of absolute values (Table 4) as uncertainty measures.

A.3.6    Micro Volatility Measures
Using CRSP, Compustat, and FRB data, we construct …rm-level and industry-level annual volatility
measures which are used in Table 4.
    Firm Level: At the …rm level we construct volatility measures using …rms’ stock returns. We
use standard deviation of daily and monthly returns over a year to generate the stock volatility of
a …rm. For the monthly returns we limit our samples to …rms with data on at least 6 months of
returns in a given calendar year. For monthly returns we Windsorize records with daily returns
which are higher or lower than 25%. As an alternative measure we follow Leahy and Whited (1996)
and Bloom, Bond, and Van Reenen (2007) in implementing a leverage-adjusted volatility measure
which eliminates the e¤ect of gearing on the variability of stock returns. To generate this measure
we multiply the standard deviation of returns for …rm f at year t by the ratio of equity to (equity
+ debt), with equity measured using the book value of shares (SSEQ) and debt measured using the
book value of debt (DLTTQ + DLCQ). To match the timing of the TFP shock in the regressions
(calculated between t and t + 1, see (19)), we average over the standard deviation of returns at year
t and the standard deviation at year t + 1.
    For volatility of sales we use the standard deviation over a year of a …rm’s annual growth
calculated at a quarterly rate (xi;t+4 xi;t )=(0:5 xi;t+4 + 0:5 xi;t ).

    Industry Level: For industry level measures of volatility we use the standard deviation over a year
of an industry’s annual growth calculated at a monthly rate (xi;t+12 xi;t )=(0:5 xi;t+12 +0:5 xi;t )
using the industrial production index constructed by the FRB.

A.3.7    Industry Characteristics
In Table 2 we use measures for industry business conditions and for industry characteristics. To
proxy for industry business conditions we use either the mean or the median plant’s real sales growth
rates within industry year. Industry characteristics are constant over time and are either level or
dispersion measures. For levels we use medians, implying that! a typical measure would look like
                                                             T
                                                    1X
                                     M edianj2i            xjt ;
                                                    T
                                                       t=1
where xjt is some characteristic of plant j at year t (e.g. plant total employment). The industry-
level measure is calculated as the median over all plants in industry i of the within plant mean over
time of xjt . The dispersion measures are similar but use the IQR instead of medians:
                                                      T
                                                            !
                                                  1X
                                      IQRj2i             xjt :
                                                  T
                                                           t=1


                                                      33
     One exception is the measure of industry geographic dispersion, which is calculated as the Ellison-
     Glaeser dispersion index at the county level.

     A.3.8    First-Moment Instruments
     In Table 3 we use two instruments for …rst-moment shocks, both are at the industry level. The …rst
     instrument is based on the abolishment of the China textile quotas in 2005, which translated to a
     negative …rst-moment shock to the local textile industry. The second instrument is in the spirit of the
     instruments in Bertrand (2004). It is constructed as a weighted industry-level exchange rate index,
     where the weight of a particular country’s exchange rate is given by the exposure of the industry to
     the particular currency. An increase in the industry exchange rate is a negative …rst-moment shock
     to this industry in the U.S. since it reduces the demand for exports from this industry and increases
     import of goods for the particular industry.
          Textile Quotas Instrument: The relaxation of quotas for China started when it joined the WTO
     in 2001, and peaked in 2005 when the quotas were completely removed. The removal of the quotas
     generated an increase in the imports of Chinese goods in the categories for which the quotas were
     removed. We use the 2005 quota variable constructed by Bloom, Draca, and Van Reenen (2011).
     For each 4-digit industry this variable stores the trade weighted proportion of product categories
     that were covered by a quota in 2005 by 4-digit industry categories.54 The instrument is then
     constructed as the interaction between the quota level and a dummy which takes the value of 1 for
     all years starting 2005. We limit the analysis to industries which are similar to the treated group,
     thus focusing on the textile and related industry (SIC codes 22, 23, 28 and 29, which were the 2-digit
     industries including sub-industries impacted by the quotas). We restrict the analysis to a 7-year
     window around the change (2002-2008).
          Exchange Rate Instrument: We use the OECD and IMF data to construct 15 series of real
     exchange rates for Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan,
     Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Republic of Korea, Turkey, and the UK. Three of these
     countries (Germany, France and Italy) are part of the Eurozone, therefore changed their currency to
     euro on January 1st 1999. To keep the exchange rate series smooth for these countries we convert the
     euro series to the currency used in the country prior to 1999 using the December 31, 1998 exchange
     rate.55 We then use the data from Peter K. Schott’s website on imports and exports to generate
     a weighted exchange rate by industry. The weights are based on the Cost, Insurance, and Freight
     (CIF) de…nition of imports. These are collapsed to the sum of imports at the country-industry level
     over 1972 to 2005 (so weights are …xed over time), and zeros are assigned for missing values. For
     industry i at time t, the instrument is constructed
                                                     X as
                                    exc_insti;t =          wi;c log (excc;t ) ;
                                                      c
     where c is index for country, and the weights wi;c are de…ned as
                                                      CIFi;c
                                              wi;c = P         :
                                                      c CIFi;c

    Household Optimality Conditions: To tractably compute general equilibrium, we combine house-
hold optimization with an individual …rm’s problem. Household optimization implies standard ex-
pressions for labor supply in terms of the wage w and for a household’s stochastic discount factor
m, given by:
                                       UN (C; N )            UC (C 0 ; N 0 )
                               w=                 ;m =                       .
                                       UC (C; N )            UC (C; N )
    The ‡ow utility function for a household takes the following separable form across consumption
C and hours worked N :
                                                      C1      N
                                      U (C; N ) =                   ,
                                                      1
so that the wage rate w and the stochastic discount factor m relevant for the …rm are given by
                                            N     1          C0
                                      w=              ;m =          :
                                            C                C
    Transformed Firm Problem: We de…ne the intertemporal price of consumption p UC (C; N ),
equal to the marginal utility of consumption for households. We then rede…ne a …rm’s value function
V in terms of marginal utility and consider the new …rm value function V~ pV . A new and entirely
equivalent …rm recursive optimization problem can then be expressed as
                               e )=
            V~ (k; n 1 ; z; A; S;
                  8                                                                                 9
                  < p(A; S; e ) y w(A; S;
                                       e )n i AC k (k; k 0 )                     AC n (n   1 ; n)
                                                                                                    =
            max                         h                                i                              ,
            fi;ng :                 + E V~ (k 0 ; n; z 0 ; A0 ; Se0 ; 0 )                           ;
where discounting now occurs at the …xed rate .
    Note that as discussed in the calibration section in the text, we assume that the transition be-
tween high and low uncertainty states occurs with identical timing at the idiosyncratic and aggregate
levels. We therefore replace the aggregate and idiosyncratic volatility states A and Z above with
Se 2 fL; Hg, where Se is the two-state Markov process for uncertainty.
    Also, note that based on our discussion of the household problem, in equilibrium the wage
rate depends on the marginal utility of consumption and on labor input in the current period.
For computational convenience and following Kahn and Thomas (2008), we further simplify this
relationship by calibrating the model to match a unit intertemporal elasticity of substitution ( = 1)
and an in…nite Frisch elasticity of labor supply ( = 1). Together these parameter values imply
that w = C 1 = p , or that the wage rate is a function of the intertemporal price of consumption
only.
    Forecast and Price Rules: The aggregate states of the economy are economy-wide productivity A;
uncertainty S; and the distribution of individual …rm capital stocks, labor input, and idiosyncratic
productivity (k; n 1 ; z). However, the distribution          is a numerically intractable state. We
therefore follow Krusell and Smith (1998) by replacing the distribution in the …rm’s problem with
a small set    of moments of the distribution. Further, in the expectations embedded in the …rm’s
optimization we replace the law of motion for this distribution 0 = (A; S;      e ), with a simpli…ed
forecast rule b 0 for next period’s moments 0 . Finally, we also assume that during optimization,
…rms make use of an approximate pricing rule pb to predict the intertemporal price p. Given our
parameter calibration, the pricing rule pb also predicts the equilibrium wage rate, implying that an
additional wage rule is unnecessary.
    Algorithm: Armed with the transformed …rm problem and notation de…ned above, we now dis-
cuss the solution algorithm in detail. Essentially, numerical solution of the model involves calculation
of pricing and forecast rules consistent with the simulated behavior of the model given …rm opti-
mization and the evolution of the exogenous stochastic processes. First, we choose speci…c log-linear
approximate pricing and forecast rules to be used by …rms:

                                               log pb = p0 (A; S)         e
                                                                      1

         As evident from these formulas, in our application we replace the set of moments   with the
                                                                                        p
     aggregate capital stock K , and we allow for general dependence of the coe¢ cients   and K on
     some of the aggregate states of the economy. Given the explicit functional form above for the
     forecasting and pricing rules, we now state the algorithm for solving the model:

                                                      b 0(0) and pb(0) based on initial guesses for the coe¢ -
        1. Initialize the forecasting and price rules K
                    p         K
           cients       and       .
                       b 0(l) and pb(l) , solve a discretized version of the dynamic optimization problem of
        2. Given rules K
           an individual …rm using value function iteration to determine V     e (l) .
        3. Simulate the economy for a large number of periods, computing equilibrium prices p in each
           period without the use of the pricing rule pb.
                                                         b 0(l) and pb(l) to obtain K
        4. Based on the simulated data, update the rules K                          b 0(l+1) and pb(l+1) .

                        b 0(l) and pb(l) are su¢ ciently close to the rules K
        5. If the rules K                                                   b 0(l+1) and pb(l+1) , stop. If the
           rules have not converged, return to step 2.

          In step 2, we compute V  e (l) using value function iteration on a discretized state space. For each
     of the endogenous state variables idiosyncratic capital, idiosyncratic labor, and aggregate capital
     k; n 1 ;and K , we assign a log-linear grid with sizes nk ; nn ; and nK ; respectively. Firms assume that
     the equilibrium price within a period is given exactly by the rule pb(l) and anticipate next period’s
     value assuming that the forecasting rule K       b 0(l) predicts K 0 exactly. In order to approximate the
     expectations operator applied over the exogenous stochastic processes for idiosyncratic productivity
     z , aggregate productivity A, and uncertainty Se, we …rst compute discrete approximations to the
     productivity processes, following Tauchen (1986). The resulting discretized stochastic processes for
     z and A vary over grids of size nz and nA . Using the transition matrices of the discretized processes
     for z and A, together with the transition matrix for the two-state Markov process for uncertainty
     Se itself, we compute discrete approximations to the expectations in the …rm problem.
          In step 3, we simulate the behavior of a large number nF of …rms for a large number of quarters
     T , computing discrete approximations to integrals over the …rm distribution in our theoretical model.
     In the …rst period, we initialize …rm idiosyncratic capital and labor states to points in the middle of
     their respective grids, discarding the …rst Terg periods of our simulation to eliminate the impact of
     this initialization choice.56 In this simulation step 3 it is important to note that we do not use the
     pricing rule pb. Instead, given simulated series for uncertainty and aggregate productivity, along with
     nF distinct simulated series of idiosyncratic productivity, in each period we solve for the equilibrium
     consumption price p in that period using golden section search. For each guess of p in the golden
     section search algorithm, we reoptimize …rm investment and hiring policies based on that guess for p
     and our value function solution V    e (l) . More precisely, given a guess for p, we solve the optimization
     problem n                                                                h                          io

          fi;ng
     for each …rm. Given …rm adjustment policies, output, and investment resulting from this optimiza-
     tion problem, we then compute consumption
                                   Z             C(p) implied by the goods market clearing condition
                                  C(p) =           y+i      AC k     AC n       (dkdn      1 dz):

56
     We choose the particular values nk = 110 (idiosyncratic capital), nn = 45 (idiosyncratic labor), nz = 5
     (idiosyncratic productivity), nA = 5 (aggregate productivity), nK = 25 (aggregate capital), T = 5; 000
     (total number of periods), Terg = 500 (number of periods discarded), and nF = 5; 000 (number of …rms):


                                                               36
          A given value of p is the equilibrium price, and the golden section search routine stops, if p
     satis…es the …xed point condition p = UC (C(p); N (p)) = UC (C(p))57 , or in other words if the
     goods market clearing value of consumption given p implies a value for the marginal utility of
     consumption equal to p itself.
          In step 4, updating the pricing and forecasting rules to Kb 0(l+1) and pb(l+1) based on the simulated
     data is equivalent to updating the coe¢ cients       p     e and K (A; S)
                                                            (A; S)               e . For each combination of
                                                             e
     aggregate productivity and uncertainty values (A; S) on their discrete grids, we collect the subset
     of periods in which (A; S)e was realized. Then, on this subset of periods, we estimate p (A; S)     e and
       K      e
         (A; S) using ordinary least squares regression.
          The converged forecasting and pricing rules K   b 0 and pb from the above algorithm are quite suc-
     cessful in explaining aggregate outcomes, with a mean R2 of 0.99 in the updating regressions for
       K
          and a mean R2 of 0.89 in the updating regressions for p . Regardless of the conditioning ag-
     gregate state (A; S)e , the signs of all coe¢ cients are also reasonable: higher values of the aggregate
     capital stock today are predictive of higher capital tomorrow as well as lower intertemporal prices
     or marginal utility today.
          We use MATLAB to implement the solution technique outlined above. The code used to produce
     all of the results in this paper, as well as a document explaining the code, is available on Nicholas
     Bloom’s website at the following address: http://www.stanford.edu/~nbloom/RUBC.zip.

     B.2     Simulating an Uncertainty Shock
     Having solved the model following Kahn and Thomas (2008), as laid out in the previous subsection,
     we compute the responses of this nonlinear model to an uncertainty shock by averaging over the
     responses to such a shock in a large number of economies, each with a di¤erent set of realizations
     for the driving productivity and uncertainty processes.
          As in the solution algorithm, we approximate the continuum of …rms in our model with a large
     but …nite number of …rms (20,000), at all times computing discrete approximations to the integrals
     in our theoretical model. Then, we initialize the labor and capital states of each …rm to a point
     in the middle of the idiosyncratic labor and capital grids. Finally, we simulate 400 economies of
     25-year, or equivalently 100-quarter, length. In each economy, we impose low uncertainty for 10
     periods. In the next quarter, we impose an increase in uncertainty from its low level to its high
     level, the uncertainty shock itself. Afterwards, in each economy, we allow the duration of the high
     uncertainty state to be determined by the natural evolution of the two-state Markov process for
     uncertainty.
          For convenience, we serially simulate the 400 distinct economies of 100-quarter length using a
     string of 40,000 quarters. To eliminate the e¤ects of our initial choice of capital and labor grid
     points for each …rm on our results, we discard the …rst 25 economies (2500 periods), using the
     remaining 375 economies to compute the responses discussed in the text. Then, for each period in
     each economy, we compute all aggregate or cross-sectional quantities of interest, for example output,
     labor, investment, or labor misallocation, using the distribution of …rm states and policies in that
     period and economy. To compute levels of the series of interest in an “average” economy in a given
     period, we compute the cross-economy average of that series’level in that period. More concretely,
     if the value of the series X in period t and simulated economy e is given by Xet , the average level
     upon which our …gures are based is given by
                                                           375
                                                      1 X
                                                X t=      Xet :
                                                     375
                                                           e=1

         The …gures in the text further transform the resulting cross-economy average levels X t to percent
     deviations of these series from their values in period 0, i.e. the period immediately preceding the
     uncertainty shock. Therefore, we plot x bt , where
                                             bt = 100 log (X t =X 0 ):
                                             x
57
     The second equality holds here because we calibrate     = 1 to achieve an in…nite Frisch elasticity of labor
     supply.

B.3     Alternative Experiments
We perform two alternative experiments in addition to simulating a baseline uncertainty shock.
First, we compute the response of the model to an uncertainty shock coincident with a shock to
the level of aggregate productivity. Second, we compute the response of the economy to a wage
bill subsidy in normal times, coincident with an uncertainty shock, and several periods after an
uncertainty shock. We describe both experiments in turn.

B.3.1    An Uncertainty Shock Coincident with a Productivity Shock
In order to compute the response of the model to an uncertainty shock occurring in the same
quarter as an adverse aggregate productivity shock, we simulate a large number of economies with
di¤erent realizations of the model’s exogenous processes, averaging over their response to coincident
uncertainty and productivity shocks. The number of …rms (20,000), total number of economies (400),
periods per economy (100), number of initial discarded economies (25), and timing conventions are
identical to those used to simulate a baseline uncertainty shock, with the exception that we now also
impose an aggregate productivity shock as well.
    We construct the productivity shock to yield an average reduction in aggregate productivity
across simulated economies of 2%. Given our discretized grid A     e = (A e1 ; :::; A
                                                                                    en ) for exogenous
                                                                                      A
aggregate productivity, such a productivity shock is not in general equivalent to a deterministic
reduction of aggregate productivity by a …xed number of grid points in each economy. Instead, we
convexify the drop in A in period 1, the period of the joint uncertainty and productivity shock, by
randomly imposing a drop in aggregate productivity to its lowest grid point. More precisely, for
each economy e in period 1, we draw both a uniformly distributed shock e 2 (0; 1) along with
an unrestricted candidate value Ae 2 A   e for Ae1 drawn from the unrestricted discretized Markov
process for A. We set
                                                e1 ; if
                                                A         <
                                       Ae1 =                    ;
                                                Ae ; if
    where was chosen to guarantee that the cross-economy aggregate productivity average declines
by 2%. Equivalently, was chosen to guarantee that

                                       375
                                   1 X
                                       log (Ae1 =Aeo ) =        0:02:
                                  375
                                       e=1
    Since the probability of a drop in the aggregate productivity process to its lowest grid point is
increasing in , the cross-economy average above is decreasing in . Based on this relationship, we
determine by iteratively guessing values of until the equation above is satis…ed.

B.3.2    A Wage Bill Subsidy Policy Experiment
We consider the simulated impact on output of a stimulative wage bill subsidy of one-quarter duration
in three context: in normal times, concurrent with an uncertainty shock, and after an uncertainty
shock. The number of …rms (20,000), total number of economies (400), periods per economy (100),
and number of initial discarded economies (25), are identical to those used to simulate the impact
of a baseline uncertainty shock.
     A Wage Bill Subsidy in Normal Times: To compute the impact of a wage bill subsidy in normal,
i.e. low uncertainty, times, we …rst simulate exogenous aggregate and idiosyncratic productivity
shocks for all 400 economies, imposing low uncertainty throughout. Then in period 1 for each
economy, the same quarter in which we also impose an uncertainty shock in alternative simulations,
we implement a wage bill subsidy of 1%. In period 1 …rms face marginal wage rates equal to (100-
1)% of the equilibrium wage rate, with the subsidy …nanced through a lump-sum tax on households.
For aggregate output Y , we compute the percent deviation each period from the quarter preceding
the subsidy of the level of the relevant series averaged across economies. For later reference, we refer
to this series of percent output deviations as ybsub;t .


                                                  38
     A Wage Bill Subsidy Concurrent with an Uncertainty Shock: To compute the impact of a wage
bill subsidy contemporaneous with an uncertainty shock, we …rst simulate the aggregate productivity,
idiosyncratic productivity, and uncertainty processes exactly as in the case of a baseline uncertainty
shock. That is, we impose low uncertainty for 10 periods, then in a quarter labeled period 1 for
convenience we shock the economy with a transition to high uncertainty, afterwards allowing the
level of uncertainty to vary according to its calibrated Markov chain. Productivity series at the
aggregate and idiosyncratic levels evolve naturally, given the series for uncertainty. In period 1 we
also implement a wage bill subsidy of 1%. For aggregate output Y , we de…ne ybunc+currsub;t to
be the percent deviation from period 0 of the average economy in period t, given the concurrent
uncertainty shock and wage bill subsidy in period 1.
     A Wage Bill Subsidy after an Uncertainty Shock: To compute the impact of a wage bill subsidy
after, as opposed to concurrent with, an uncertainty shock, we again simulate all exogenous processes
exactly as in the case of a baseline uncertainty shock. This uncertainty shock occurs in period 1.
Then, in period 3, we implement a 1% wage bill subsidy. For aggregate output Y , we de…ne
ybunc+af tersub;t to be the percentage deviation from period 0 of the average economy in period t,
given the uncertainty shock in period 1 and the wage bill subsidy in period 3.
     After computing each of the three responses ybsub;t , ybunc+currsub;t , and ybunc+af tersub;t described
above, together with the model’s output response to a baseline uncertainty shock ybt , we plot three
series: ybsub;t (the impact of a wage bill subsidy in normal times), ybunc+currsub;t ybt (the impact of
a wage bill subsidy with an uncertainty shock), and ybunc+af tersub;t ybt (the impact of a wage bill
subsidy after an uncertainty shock).

Notes: Each column reports a time-series OLS regression point estimate (and standard error below in parentheses) of a measure of uncertainty on a recession indicator. The
recession indicator is the share of quarters in that year in a recession. Recessions are defined using the NBER data. In the bottom panel we report the mean of the dependent
variable and its correlation with real GDP growth. In columns (1) to (5) the sample is the population of manufacturing establishments with 2 years or more of observations in the
ASM or CM survey between 1972 and 2009, which contains data on 211,939 establishments across 39 years of data (one more year than the 38 years of regression data since we
need lagged TFP to generate a TFP shock measure). In columns (6) to (10) the sample is the population of manufacturing establishments that appear in the 38 year (1972-2009) of
the ASM or CM survey, which contains data on 3,449 establishments. In columns (1) and (6) the dependent variable is the cross-sectional standard deviation (S.D.) of the
establishment-level ‘shock’ to Total Factor Productivity (TFP). This ‘shock’ is calculated as the residual from the regression of log(TFP) at year t+1 on its lagged value (year t), a
full set of year dummies and establishment fixed effects. In columns (2) and (7) we use the cross-sectional skewness of the TFP ‘shock’, in columns (3) and (8) the cross-sectional
kurtosis and in columns (4) and (9) the cross-sectional interquartile range of this TFP ‘shock’ as an outlier robust measure. In columns (5) and (10) the dependent variable is the
interquartile range of plants’ sales growth. All regressions include a time trend and Census year dummies (for Census year and for 3 lags). Newey-West standard errors (one lag)
are applied in all columns to control for any potential serial correlation. *** denotes 1% significance, ** 5% significance and * 10% significance. Data available online at
