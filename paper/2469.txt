       Quits, Moves, Spatial Equilibrium and Workplace Relocation




                                ABSTRACT




When worker commutes are suboptimal, quits and moves are related. Either

a quit, a move, or both can achieve an optimal commute. However, with

fixed costs to quitting and moving, a quit or move alone is more likely

than both together. Payroll records of a firm which relocated from the

central business district to a suburb of a major metropolitan area

confirm this. They demonstrate that white employees rarely quit and move

at the same time. Simultaneous bivariate probit estimates of move and

quit behavior demonstrate that uncontrolled shocks to quits and moves

are negatively correlated. Furthermore, during the spatial dislocation

caused by the firm's relocation, quits and moves were direct sub—

stituts. Employees who quit were approximately 29< less likely to move.

Those who moved were approximately 4O< less likely to quit.

Quits and moves are discrete react ions to a variety of individual cii'—

cumstances. In one circurstance, that of spatial dsequiHbrium, they

are related. Workers whoe commute is unsatisfactory have three possible

remedies. They can move to find a residence nearer their workplace, they

can quit to find a workplace more convenient to their residence, or they

can both quit and move. This paper investigates the considerations under

which workers choose between the three.




   Changes in residence location change commuting costs and housing

prices in opposite directions. A utility—maximizing model of the

worker/consumer demonstrates that the optimal residence location

balances the opposing gains and losses. Similarly, at the optimal

workplace location, opposing changes in commuting costs and wages caused

by changes in workplac. location also balance. In the absence of fixed

costs, workers would adjust both workplace and residence locations, at

their margins, to changes in optimal commute distance.




   However, if moving or quitting incurs fixed costs, commutes must be

substantially suboptimal before workers would adjust them at all. If an

adjustment is necessary, workers are more likely to accomplish it

through a move or quit alone, rather than both. The payroll records of a

sinole company, covering all white employees over seven years,

demonstrate that quits and moves alone are much more frequent than quits

and moves together.




  Multivariate analyses confirm that quits and moves are, to some

extent, spatial 'substitutes'. Simultaneous bivariate probit estimates


                                  —1—
of move and quit propensities demonstrate a pervasive negative correla-

tion between the effects of random shocks on quit and move probabil—

 ties. Furthermore, they demonstrate that, following the firm's reloca-

tion from the central business district to a suburb of the same large

metropolitan area, quits and moves substituted directly. Employees were

4O less likely to leave the company if they moved, and 29V less likely

to change their residence if they quit.




       I. Th Theory o Residence and Workplce Choice




Within an urban area, moves ——   residential   relocations —— may take place

to accomodate changes in family structure, social status, investment

preferences or neighborhood amenities. Quits ——     workplace relocations ——

may enable professional advancement and occupational change, or derive

from choices with regard to labor force participation and work environ-

ment. Many of the stimuli for moves neither arise from nor affect at-

titudes towards employer and workplace. Similarly, attitudes towards

residence and residence location are   frequently    independent of the

conditions which induce quits.




   However, quit and move decisions may not be independent, for two

reasons. First, they may be correlated if both depend on the same per-

sonal characteristics. Second, they depend directly upon each other

because their relationship determines the      conditions   of spatial equi—


                                    —2—
librium. This second dependency is the subject of this paper.




      If   a   worker/consumer ts in spatial disequilibrium, quits and moves

are obvious remedies. Either quits or moves, individually, are suff I—

dent to reestablish spatial equilibrium. Without fixed costs, marginal

adjustments to both residence and workplace locations adjust suboptimal

commute distances. With fixed adjustment costs, ordinarily only one or

the other will be chosen.




      A simple model of utility maximization for employed consumers

demonstrates the important considerations in the maintenance of spatial

equilibrium in an urban area. Utility is a function of housing consurnp—

tion, h, leisure, L, and an index of consumption for all other goods, xz



                          U =   U(x,h,L)
                                                                           (1)




Leisure is the time remaining from the time endoment, L0, after work

hours, e, and.conuting time, C:



                          LL 0 —e—c
                                                                           (2)




      Distances from the city center represent residential location,

and workplace location, rW. The city is circular, uniform along the

circle at any distance fran the center. Therefore, all workers choose

residence and workplace along the same ray 4rm the city center. Connut—

ing    time, c, is an increasing function of residential location and a

                                           -3-
decreasing function of workplace location:



                     c     c(r ,
                                   h rw ),


with c1 > 0, C11 < 0, C2       <
                                   0, C22 > 0




   The index comodity, x, is          also       the numeraire. Out—of—pocKet comut—

ing costs are PC per unit co.wuuting time. Housing prices and wages var>'

spatially. Prices per unit of housing services fall with distance from

the city center (Muth):


                                                           >
                     h"' h <                      '
                                                      'h

Compensation per unit time at work also falls with distance from the

city center:



               w =   wr,           w' < 0, WI' < 0




   These prices define the monetary budget constraint:



                                      h
                                                 w(rw )e

                               h''        )h =




This equations in combination with equation 2, yields the overall budget

constraint:

      The optimizing worker/consumer maximizes utility (equation 1) subJect

to the budget constraint (equation 3) by forming a Lagranglan expression

with the two. The solution to this problem includes the traditional

requirements that ratios of marginal utility equal relative price

ratios:

This is the classical condition for equilibrium in residential location

(Muth, 4or example). At      the optimal rt, increases (decreases) in rh
generate increases (decreases) in conmuting costs and savings (in-

creases) in housing costs which are o4 equal magnitude and opposite

Si 911.




    The condition in   equation   4 and the derivative of the Lagrangian with

respect to rW   imply that

                                     c    2



This condition is the analogue to equation 5 for workplace location. At

the optimal r, increases (decreases) in          generate reductions (in-

creases) in ccnwnuting costs and in wages which ire of equal magnitude

and completely o44settlng.




    This result demonstrates the theme on which this study is based; in

some sense moves and quits are 'substitutes'. Here, residence and

workplace locations move in       opposite directions in response to the sane
shock. For example, il conwnuting costs increase through an exogenous
                                                                     h
increase In p, equality in equation 5 requires reductions in r until

the resulting reductions in c and Increases in h balance. In this
                                                                 w
circumstance, equality in equation 6 requires increases in r until the
resulting reductions    in   c and w balance.

  This model Illustrates the trade-offs which are essential to spatial

equilibrium or worker/consumers. The marginal adjustments described by

this model demonstrate the tendency for residence and workplace changes

to differ in direction. However, these adjustments neglect the discon—

tinuities which characterize actual spatial changes. Adjustments to rh

require moves. Adjustments to rW require quits. Both actions are dis-

crete, and subject to fixed costs.




  These costs are fixed temporally; they only happen once per move or

quit, regardless of the expected duration of tenure at the next

residence or workplace. More importantly, In the context of this paper,

they are fixed spatially. Quitting or moving entail some costs regard-

less of whether the new workplace or residence is next door to or many

miles from the old. These costs constrain the worker/consumer's ability

to alter workplace and residence locations in response to spatial dii—

equilibria.




   The budget constraint in equation 3, incorporating fixed costs,

becomes



 w(rW)10 = (w(rW)   +   p )c(rh,ru) + w(rW)L   +   Ph(r )h 4 x   4 PICM 4
                                                                                (6)


where CM and CQ represent •the fixed costs of moving and quitting,

respectivel>.M =    I   if drh * 0 (if a move occurs), 0 otherwise. Q =     1    if

drW * 0 (if a quit occurs), 0 otherwise.




                                      —7-
      With this condition, the marginal *nalysis above I; insufficient to

solve the the worker/consumer's maximization problem. In effect the

worker/consumer now has 4our different budget constraints. Each cor-

responds to one of the four dif4erent choice pairs for (M, 0); (0,0),

(1,0), (0,1) and (1,1). Optimization requires comparing the optimal

choices under each budget constraint to determine the (M, 0) pair that

yields the global utility maximum.




      Intuitively, the effect of these fixed costs must be to reinforce

'substitution' of    quits   and moves. If a conwnute is suboptimal, complete

adjustment through workplace or residence relocation alone incurs only

one fixed cost. Adjustment through simultaneous workplace and residence

relocations achieves the same goal, but incurs the fixed costs of both.

This strategy can only dominate under unusual combinations of wage and

housing price gradients. Ordinarily, moves or quits, Individually,

should be sufficient to reestablish equilibrium.




                                                2
      An example demonstrates this intuition.       For convenience, assume

that housing consumption and hours of work are constant, and c(rh,r) _

c(rh — rw ). Assume that utility maximization requires a cotnute shorter

       with Cobb—Douglas utility. This &roblem appears intra:table because
       the modei is very nonlinear in r . Workplace location affects not

and choosing some pair r and r simultaneously. Assume                             —

   Moving from      to r reduces cowwting costs but increases per—unit

housing prices. The net savings to moving, with workplace r, are:




     [w(r')
                    C c(r —    ri') — c(r           —

The net savings to moving, following a quit to workplace r, are:


         w                h    w     —         h —       vi               h

     Cw(r2) + p3 C c(r1 —                                                    —
                               r2)           c(r2        r2)]                    p(r1)    3




  Moving is sensible only If the associated savings exceed CM. Is this

more likely when moves occur without or with quits? Savings to moving

without quitting exceed those to moving and quitting if




                 w(r') + PC     c(r —         r) c(r r)
                                                     —           —

                                                     —           —
                 w(r2) + p C    c(r1 —        r1)         c(r2       r1)                       (7)



The ratio (w(r") 4 p3/tw(r) +                  exceeds one. If             the time cost of
conwutes increases linearly or faster with distance rh — rW, the ratio
                                         —
tc(r'—r) —    c(r—r)3/1c(r_r7)               c(r—r')3           is less than one. In these

circumstances, moving without quitting generates larger savings than

moving following a quit.
     14, as assumed above, the time cost of coninuting increases more

slowly than distance, inequality 7 holds where the wage gradient is

sufficiently   'steeper' than the conwiwte function. This restriction is

plausible, because workplaces are more centralized than residences in

contemporary urban areas.      If   the wages in central workplaces did not

more than compensate for the costs of connuting to the central city, all

workers would prefer maximum values for r1' ——               to   take advantage of the

                 —— and rv =
gradient in                     rh,   implying, presumably, c0. ll workers

would try to live and work at the city boundary.




     With these considerations, moving without quitting is more likely to

generate larger savings than moving following a quit. Therefore, the

benefits of moving are more likely to exceed CM, the fixed costs of

moving, without quits than with. Moves are more likely to take place if

quits do not.




     The analysis of quits is analagous. Quitting from r to r reduces

comuting costs but also reduces wages. The net savings to quitting

without moving are:



        w            h w              w                  h w                w        w
 C[w(r1)          c(r1—r1) —   Ew(r2) + p)            c(r1—r2)]) — e ( w(r1) —    w(r2)   ]




The    net savings to quitting following a move are:

                     h w          w                      h w                w        w

in    either case, quitting    is   sensible     if    these savings exce1?d
                                                                                C.

                                          — 10    —
   Inequality 7 d.scribes the conditions under which the savings to

quits without moves exceed those to quits following moves, a; wefl as

those in which moves without quits yield higher savings than moves

following quits. Furthermore, this inequality holds for increases, as

well as reductions in comutes. Under the general conditions for which

it holds, moves are more likely to take place without quits, and quits

are more likely to take place without moves.




  II. Quits Moves. Fixed Costs and SDatiul Disequilibrium




An unusual 'experiment' provides an opportunity to compare the empirical

relationships between quits and moves to the hypotheses above. In 1971,

a firm employing nearly 800 employees and located in the central busi-

ness district (CSD) of a large U.S. metropolitan area announced that it

would relocate to a near suburb as of March, 1974.   This same firm has

made available its annual payroll records for eight years, those between

1971 and 1973, inclusive. These records document employee move and quit

behavior both in response to this relocation, and in periods when the

workplace was fixed.




    Andrulis draws similar conclusions from a model with uncertainty.
    Weinberg/Frie&nan/Mayo demonstrate the importance of fixed costs in

   Employee—years for white employees of this company comprise the

sample ana1yzd here.         In the 3558 usable employee years, average

employee age    Is   nearly 35 years. Average tenure is nearly 8 years.

Average weekly earnings are slightly above $300 in 1980 dollars.



   The company payroll records record end—of—year addresses and employ-

ment status. Employees whose end—year addresses differ 4rom one year to

the next have 'moved'.          WIth this definition, moves are determinate for

only employees with more than one year of tenure, observed during the

seven calendar years 1972 through 1978. Employees who separated volun-

tarily have 'quit'.

      Specifically, employees whose successive end—year addresses are in
      different 'Transportation Analysis Zones' have moved. The
      metropolitan council of governments divides the metropolitan area
      Into approximately 1200 Transportation Analysis Zones. These zones
      are similar to census tracts in size. Area zip codes contain as few
      as one and as many as twenty. A matrix of travel times between all
      zore pairs, provided by the council of governments, is the only
      source for employee co.iwnute times. This definition of 'moves' in-
      cludes only those residence relocations which can yield changes in
      measured corrnute times.

   Table 1 presents, for white employees during the period 1972 through

1978, the distribution of employee—years over the four possible (M,O)

pairs discussed in the previous section. In spatial equilibrium, or with

substantial fxed costs, quits and moves should be infrequent. One or

the other of these conditions appears to characterize much of the

sample; neither moves nor quits occurred in nearly 71 of the employee—

year sample.




   The discusion of the previous section predicts that, because of

fixed costs in particular, either moves or quits would be more likely

than both in spatial disequilibrium. Table 1 is consistent with this

prediction, as well. Of those employee—years in which at least a quit or

move occurred, in only 7.2<   did   both.




   Comparisons between quit and move frequencies for those employees

directly affected by the workplace relocation emphasize both the impor-

tance of spatial equilibrium and the importance of fixed moving and

quitting costs. Employees who worked at the original workplace prior to

1974 were reacting to spatial disequilibria, attributable to the

workplace relocation, in 1974 and 1975. These employees in these years

were in 'transition' between equilibria with the CBD and suburban

workplaces.




   ong white employees with service in 1974 at the suburban workplace,

472 had previously worked at the CBD workplace. 04 these, the 1973

residences of 211 had been closer to the new than to the old workplace

by automobile.    This   group was in disequilibrium alter the relocation,

but because its members had gained welfare through the reduction in

their coniutes. They might have further increased their welfare, for

example, by moving into more distant suburbs, trading some    of   the com-

mute reduction for increased housing consumption as dictated by equation

5. However, with fixed costs, many would have been content to enjoy

their gainssolely asadditional leisure.




   In contrast, the 261 white workers whose 1973 residences were more

distant, by automobile, from    the new than from the old workplace su4—
fered from the relocation. If they moved, they might ultimately reap

substantial welfare gains because the new workplace was suburban, more

convenient to desirable housing than the old. 14 they quit, they might

reasonably expect to reestablish their old equilibria through employment

with a different company still located in the CBD. In either case, these

employees had substantial incentives to reequilibrate.




   Table 2 confirms these expectations. Employees whose commutes were

reduced ——   'winners'   —— by the relocation were ten percentage points

more likely to neither move nor quit than were 'losers', whose commutes




    Employee cowiute times are the times for automobile trips between
    transportation analysis zones of residence and of workplace. Company
    surveys indicated that approximately 9OY of white workers commuted
    to the CD workplace by car, even though this destination was better
    served by mass transit than any other in the metropolitan area. That
    proportion was plausibly much higher at the suburban orkpIace,
    where bus service was poor.

plentiful as quitters. nong losers, moves were slightly more frequent

than among winners, but quits were nearly twice as frequent.




  At th. same time, table 2 is inconsistent with the pattern of mar-

ginal adjustments that would result from workplace relocation if fixed

moving and quitting costs were Insignificant. Despite the relocation,

more than 60% of all losers made no spatial adjustments at all. More

than 70% of all winners chose to take their gains solely in the form of

reduced connutes.




   All these employees chose to accept dramatic changes in their comiwt—

ing costs, rather than incur the fixed costs of moving and quitting. The

average automobile camnute of losers at year—end 1974 was 27.9 minutes.

             UI. Econometric Model of Quits snd Moves



The descriptive results of the last section support the suggestion that

quits and moves are subject to substantial fixed costs which cause them

to substitute for each other in the maintenance of spatial equilibrium.

However, the simple correlation in the entire sample between quits and

moves is —.026 and insignificant, because of the multitude of employee—

years in    which neither moves nor quits take place. Multivariate
analyses, which control for many exogenous determinants of quit and move

behavior, demonstrate this substitution explicitly.




   Simultaneous probit models are the appropriate statistical repre-
                                                                       8
sentations for joint estimates of quit and move probabilities.             Simul-

taneous probit models allow estimates of the correlation between random

shocks to move and quit propensities, and, if      identified,    direct es—

timates of the interactions between quits and moves. These models are

  X11 and X2 contain Individual—, neighborhood— and year—specific

variables, in addition to a constant. Both contain all individual—

specific varitxbles recorded in the company payroll tapes —— durmny vari-

ables for males and clerical workers, continuous variables for age, age

squared, tenure, tenure squared, natural logarithms of current and past

real earnings.




      In this paper, automobile coimwting time is a 'neighborhood' at-

tribute defined by transportation analysis zones. X21 contains the

automobile time between the current residence zone and the current

workplace, and the difference between current and past     automobile   times.


X11
       contains   only the past time, because the current time at year—end is

endogenous to the choice of moving during the year.




      The 1970 census tract of residence defines the neighborhood for the

measurment of other neighborhood characteristics. The determinants of

move propensities include characteristics which may index neighborhood

amenities, stability and mode choice. These are percents of blacks in

tract population, high school graduates among tract adults, tract

population aged greater than five that had not moved between 1965 and




       Successful estimations of this model require large samples. In
       consequence, estimates below represent the pooled sample of all
       employee-years. Individual employees vary in the number of times
       they enter this sample. This 'unbalanced design' rendei's estimation
       of individual—specific effects difficult, if not impossible. There-
       fore, these estimates disregard them.

1970, 1970 tract housing units vacant, and 1970 tract resident workers

coomuting to work by bus; 1969 tract median income and 1970 tract median

owner—occupied housing value.




   The determinants of quit propensities,
                                            X2. ,   include characteristics
which measure neighborhood income and stability. ong these.are the

percent of tract population aged greater than five that had not moved

between 1965 and 1970, 1969 median tract income, and 1970 tract male and

female unemployment rates. X2. also contains the only year—specific

variable; the metropolitan area unemployment rate.




  Model 1 in table 3 presents this specification, estimated for the

entire sample. Parameter estimates are plausible: Moves are less likely

with age, more likely with higher current earnings given past earnings,

less likely with higher past earnings given current earnings,        and




   Annual indexes for consumer prices and housing expenditures, ex-
   perimentally included in X11, contributed nothing to model ex-
   planatory power.

   These coefficients imply that moves are a significant positive
   function of earnings growth. Coefficients on log current and past
   earnings estimate effects of earnings growth according to the fol-
   lowing equation:

   Pwin w + Pw-1 In w—1 = (Pw4 Pw-1 ) in w — P    (in w — ln w  )
                                              w-1            -1
   The coefficient on log previous earnings, with positive sign,  is the
   implied coefficient on earnings growth. The estimated standard error
   of this coefficient is valid regardless of whether it is interpreted
   as the effect of log previous earnings or of earnings growth. Under
   the reformulation in terms of growth, th. coefficient of log current
   earnings is positive, relatively small andmarginally significant.

  The correLation coefficient in this model verifies the hypothesis

that moves and quits substitute in the maintenance of spatial equi—

librium. it is large, -.25, and significant at better than 1. It im—

p1 us   that   random shocks which encourage moves are likely to be accoun—

panied by shocks which discourage quits, and vice versa.




   The probability of a simultaneous move and quit is very sensitive to

the magnitude of the correlation coefficient. The derivative of this
                                                                      16
probability with respect to the correlation coefficient is .509.

This corresponds to an elasticity of the probability of a simultaneous

move and quit with respect to the correlation coefficient equal to —6.5




      Sex has no significant effect on quits. This result is consistent
      with those in earlier papers. Haber/Lamas/Green also find no gender
      differences in separation rates after controlling for income.
      Blau/Kahn draw a similar conclusion from their simulations. Meitzen
      asserts that female quit propensities increase with tenure while
      male quit propensities decrease. However, his equations also
      demonstrate that female quit propensities decrease markedly with
      age, to which male propensities are insensitive. These comparisons
      suggest that, as the maximum tenure in his sample is 2.5 years, his
      analysis say not adequately distinguish between the effects of age
      and tenure.
 16
      Zax (1980) gives the formula for this derivative. Here, it is calcu-
      lated •at the estimated value for P, values of .741 and .966 for
      and     respectively. These are reasonable values at which to calcu-
      late this derivative because, first, the bivariate normal distribu-
      tion function gives the probability of (M,Q)    (1,1) to be 2.IX with
      these values, equal to the sample frequency. In addition, these
      values yield total quit and total move probabilities which are
      proportioral to the sample frequencies. Values which reproduced the
      actual sample frequencies for quits and moves would be preferable,
      if they existed. However, no two values of    and K, can simul-
      taneously satis4y th. three conditions of reproducing the sample
      frequencies for total moves, total quits and simultaneous moves and
      quits.

at the estimated correlation and the sample frequency for (M,Q)     (1,1).




  A simulation further demonstrates the magnitude of substitution

implied by this correlation coefficient. Model I as estimated predicts

that the average probability of both a quit and a move in observations
                                     17
of this sampi? is equal to .0177 •        the spatial relationship be-

tween quits and moves was unimportant, model I would estimate the cor-

relation coefficient to equal zero. Model I with a zero correlation

predicts the average probability of simultaneous moves and quits to be

.0276, 5& higher than that predicted with the estimated correlation.




   This correlation coefficient demonstrates the 'weak form' hypothesis

of section 1; the imperatives of spatial equilibrium with fixed moving

and quitting costs imply that shocks which encourage quits should dis-

courage moves, and vice versa. The discussion of section 1 also impi es

a 'strong form' hypothesis; quits made for the purposes of establishing

spatial equilibrium should discourage moves directly, and vice versa.




  Model 1 does not estimate these direct effects. However, several

exogenous variables appear in only the specification for X11 or that for

X2.. Formally, these 'exclusion restrictions' permit identification of

the direct effects of quits on moves, and moves on quits.




    Probit estimation is not constrained to 'go through the means'. In
    other words, predicted probabilities at average values for the
    exogenous variables are not, as a rule, equal to the sample fre—
    quenc es.


                                 — 23 -
   Quit effects on moves can be estimated by first estimating a single

probit equation for quits, where the vector of explanatory variables

contains all exogenous variables in either X or X21. The product of

this vector and the coefficient estimates from the single probit, X. )',

can be entered into a move equation as an 'instrumented' value for

quits, O. The coefficient on       in this equation will consistently

estimate the true effect of quits on moves. 'Instrumented' values for
                                                         18
moves, M*, can similarly be entered In quit equations.




  As many moves and quits take place for reasons unrelated to con-

siderations of spatial equilibrium, quits and moves should not hive

systematic affects on each other in the sample as a whole. The

specification of model 2, augmented with instrumented quits and moves

among the explanatory variables, confirms this. It yields insignificant
                                                                        19
estimates of quit and move effects on moves and quits, respectively.




   However, 'transition' employee—years uniformly represent conditions

of spatial disequilibrium. Reestablishing equilibrium should therefore

have been a more important stimulus for quits *nd moves during this

period. Model 2 in table 3 tests this proposition. It includes the

instrumented values for quits and moves during the period of   workplace
relocation as separate variables, in addition to these variables for the



 18
      This procedure Is analogous to three-stage—least—squares with con-
      tinuous dependent variables. Mallar derives it formall. Maddtla
      provides a useful sunwnary. They reconwnend the use of 0 and M ,
      ratherthan   te value of the normal distribution function associated
      with 0 &nd M     in part to insure that identification does not
      depend solely on functional form.

whole sample.




   This model emphatically supports the 'strong form' hypothesis. In-

strumented quts and moves for the whole sample are insignificant in the

move and quit equations. In contrast, with better than IX significance,

quits during relocation reduce the probability of moves and moves during
                                               21

      These effects are substantial. For an employee whose probability of

moving was equal to the sample frequency 04 .182, a transition quit

would reduce that probability by 29.1X, to .129 . For an employee whose

probability of quitting was equal to the sample frequency of .132, a
                                                                     22
transition move would reduce that probability by 40.2Y., to .079

       also be among the instruments for move propensities. Because moves
       and current coomute times are simultaneously determined, this would
       be Improper.
 21
       Only one other paper considers interactions between quits and moves.
       Weinberg estimates significant positive effects of moves on quits
       and quits on moves for individuals in eleven groups defined b'
       gender, ethnicity and residential tenure. These results may derive
       from his sample, in which individuals do not have connon workplaces,
       do not report incomes or tenure and may not be employed. They may
       also beartifacts of his statistical technique. Unfortunately, he
       obtains these estimates from seemingly—unrelated linear regression
       models in which the original durimy variables for moves and quits
       serve as dependent variables in one equation and explanatory vari-
       ables in the other. This procedure is severely biased.
 22
       The derivatives of quit and move probabilities yield similar com-
       parisons. They are probably less useful than these siriiulations
       because moves and quits are not continuous variables.

   Table 4 presents parameter estimates which reiterate the above dis—

tinction between move and quit interactions in equilibrium and disequi—

I ibrium periods. Model 3 duplicates the specification of Model 1, with

the exception that it alls for      correlation           coefficients to differ for

employer—years prior to the workplace relocation (1972 an 1973, period



                                    -   26   -

workplace (1976 through .978, period 3).




   These correlation coefficients are all negative, consistent again

with the hypothesis of substitution. They        also provide   additional

evidence that quit and move interactions are particularly strong in

periods   of spatial dislocation. The transition correlation, —.37, is

quite large. Finally, the strong negative correlation in period 3, —.27,

provides evidence that shocks to quits and moves remain negatively

correlatedwhen workplaces are stable.




   As measured by a likelihood ratio test, model 3 is not significantly

better than model 1. Nevertheless, models 4 through 6 of table 4

validate these observations. These three models duplicate the specitica-

tion of model 2 for periods I through 3, individually. Collectively,

their explanatory power   is significantly      greater than that of model 2.

24 The correlation coefficients in each are similar to the three of


model 3, though that of model 4, for period 1, is somewhat smaller and

that of model 5, for the transition period, is even larger.




   Moreover, these models confirm that the strong form substitution

 hypothesis holds uniquely for   periods   of    spatial   dislocation. In the

                           1V Conclusion




Moves and quits may be spatially disequilibrating for individuals with

tenuous attachments to a specific job or coiunity. For example, workers

quitting to accept new jobs in other cities or regions will naturally

move, as well. For them, either a quit or a move may cause dis.qui—

libriwn for which the other is the solution. Such individuals appear to

be rare in th.e sample examined here.




   The intuition developed here is that, for individuals who intend to

stay in the same metropolitan area, moves and quits are equilibrating.

Spatial equilibrium can fail for many reasons. For example, if utility

Is not separable in leisure, price changes for any other consumption

good will ordinarily render the current confnute suboptimal. When spatial

equilibrium fails, either a move or a quit is sufficient to restore it.




   The empirical results strongly support the hypothesis that quits and

moves substitute for each other in the maintenance of spatial .qui—



                                  - 28 -
librium. At atl   times, s?ocks which encourage one tend to be associated
with shocks which dicouge the other. At times of spatial dislocation,

quits and moves substitute directly; the occurence of one substantially

reduces the probability of the other.




   These results will not surprise multi—plant employers, who often have

a policy of providing relocation bonuses for employees they transfer

between plants. In the language of this paper, the transfer creates

spatial disequilibrium. eloc*tion bonuses reduce the fixed costs of

moving without changing those of quitting. Without bonuses, employees

might use quits to reequilibrate. With them, moves become more likely,

instead. Simiariy, they will be familiar to employers who have relo-

cated (presumb)y with selective or no relocation bonuses) for the

purpose of enocouraging voluntary separations among unwanted employees.




   The policy implications of these results derive from the recognition

that quits occur for reasons of spatial equilibrium, as well as for

reasons related to workplace conditions. 'Voluntary restrictions' on

imports of inexpensive automobiles, the construction of a highway or a

subway, the abandonment of a bus route or the institution of a substan-

tial gasoline tax will create spatial disequilibria. The results here do

not estimate the costs of these disequilibria. however, they demonstrate

conclusively that worker/consumers will move or quit to reequilibrate.

Particularly in 'tight' housing markets, policies which alter the

 'prices' of commutes may provoke unexpected changes in job mobility.
