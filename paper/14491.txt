The Flattening Firm and Product Market Competition: The Effect of Trade Liberalization

JEL No. L2,M2,M52

                                             ABSTRACT

This paper establishes a causal effect of competition from trade liberalization on various characteristics
of organizational design. We exploit a unique panel dataset on firm hierarchies (1986-1999) of large
U.S. firms and find that increasing competition leads firms to become flatter, i.e., (i) reduce the number
of positions between the CEO and division managers (DM), (ii) increase the number of positions reporting
directly to the CEO (span of control), (iii) increase DM total and performance-based pay. The results
are generally consistent with the explanation that firms redesign their organizations through a set of
complementary choices in response to changes in their environment.

1.      Introduction

     Firm hierarchies are becoming flatter. Spans of control have broadened and the number of

levels within firms has declined. These trends are suggested and documented in a number of

academic papers (e.g., Osterman, 1996; and Whittington, et al., 1999; Rajan and Wulf, 2006) and

are often discussed in the business press. However, much less is known about the causes behind

these trends. In this paper, we investigate the role of changes in the firms’ product markets and,

in particular, product market competition resulting from trade liberalization as a potential driver

of organizational change.1 In doing so, we shed some light on the possible reasons behind certain

organizational choices and on the importance of communication and decision-making processes

inside firms.

     Our main finding is that greater international competition following trade liberalization leads

to flatter firms. U.S. firms in manufacturing industries more exposed to the trade liberalization

reduce the number of hierarchical levels, broaden the span of control for the CEO, and increase

total pay and incentive-based pay for division managers. Furthermore, firms appear to adjust

organizational elements in a coordinated manner: certain changes appear to occur together.

     We use a unique panel dataset of the internal organization of large U.S. manufacturing firms

in various industries. We exploit variation within firms (and within division manager positions)

in an array of organizational variables -such as hierarchical depth, CEO span of control, pay and

incentives- over a 14-year period. This allows us to address concerns about unobserved

heterogeneity.




1The economic importance of organizational change is non-negligible since the internal hierarchy of the firm
(Liberti, 2006; Garicano and Hubbard, 2007) and organizational and workplace practices (Black and Lynch, 2001)
have a significant impact on productivity.



                                                                                                            2
    In order to identify a potential causal effect of foreign competition on organizational change,

our primary identification strategy exploits the Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement of

1989 (FTA) that eliminated tariffs and trade barriers between the two countries (Trefler, 2004).

This can be thought of as a quasi-natural experiment that implied a greater reduction in entry

barriers (a larger increase in competition) for firms in industries with high U.S. tariffs on

Canadian imports prior to 1989 allowing us to implement a difference-in-differences strategy. 2

Since the trade liberalization was bilateral, it also implied a reduction in Canadian tariffs on U.S.

exports potentially leading to market expansion opportunities for our U.S. firms. However, while

we find significant effects of these market expansion opportunities on other outcomes (such as

firm size and market value), they had no significant impact on the firm’s hierarchy: all the effect

is driven by the fall in import tariffs. Finally, we show that our results are not driven by

alternative factors that could also lead to flattening, such as increases in expenditures on IT,

changes in business scope, location of activities, and a host of other potential factors.

    Our findings suggest that it is the increased competition from falling U.S. tariffs that causes

firms to simultaneously reorganize along several dimensions.. These results are consistent with

theories arguing that complementarities exist among a firm’s organizational design elements

(e.g. Milgrom and Roberts, 1995). As such, our paper is related to the limited empirical research

on the existence of complementary human resource management practices (e.g. Ichniowski,

Shaw, and Prennushi, 1997; and Bresnahan, Brynjolfson, and Hitt, 2002; Cockburn, Henderson

and Stern, 2004). Within this literature, an important contribution of our paper is that we show



2 When studying competition, it is important to exploit exogenous changes to entry barriers, instead of standard
measures of product market competition, such as, industry Herfindahl indices and average price cost margins. These,
as is well known, are subject to numerous concerns: they do not measure the underlying competition parameter (the
entry barrier), they are endogenous to changes in the competitiveness of markets, and they are non-monotonic in
competition (Sutton, 1991; Schmalensee, 1989).



                                                                                                                 3
that following an exogenous shock to the firm’s competitive environment firms redesign their

organizations arguably to “fit” the environment in which they operate.3 To our knowledge, much

of the research on adoption of complementary work practices does not capture responses to

exogenous shocks.4

    While we establish a robust causal relationship between the trade liberalization and the

flattening of firms, an important question remains: what is the economic mechanism driving this

change? Management scholars have long argued that increased competition leads firms to search

for new organizational practices in an attempt to replace traditional hierarchical structures. Since

additional layers in the hierarchy impede information flows, firms eliminate layers (i.e.,

“delayer”) to improve response times to changes in competitive forces. Moreover, firms

decentralize decision-making to respond more quickly to changes in the business environment

and to exploit the knowledge of lower level managers.5 Alternatively, in a world with X-

inefficiency, firms may eliminate layers in an attempt to cut costs when faced with more

competition. We provide a set of additional results that explore the different potential

mechanisms. Our findings show little support for the cost-cutting story and are more consistent

with flattening as reflecting changes in decision-making in response to more competition. In this

sense, we complement Bloom, Sadun and Van Reenen (2007) who document a cross-sectional

relationship between competition (measured by import penetration and survey responses) and

greater decision-making authority of plant managers across countries.

  This idea is captured in the following quote: “Achieving high performance in a business results from establishing
and maintaining a fit among three elements: the strategy of the firm, its organizational design, and the environment
in which it operates. (Roberts, 2004, pg. 12).

the ownership structure of trucking firms.

  Refer to Whittington, Pettigrew, Peck, Fenton and Conyon (1999) for a review of the relevant literature in
management. For early works that discuss the link between organizational change and the environment, refer to
Lawrence and Lorsch (1967).


                                                                                                                  4
     There are certainly other reasons why firms may change their organizational structures.

Information technology is a prominent candidate and a number of papers have explored the

relationship between IT and organizational characteristics including work practices (Bresnahan,

Brynjolfsson and Hitt, 2002), skill-biased organizational change (Caroli and Van Reenen, 2001),

adoption of new management practices (Bartel, Ichniowski, and Shaw, 2007), firm boundaries

(Baker and Hubbard, 2004) and delegation of authority (Acemoglu, Aghion, Lelarge, Van

Reenen and Zilibotti, 2007). Even though our main focus is whether there is a causal effect of

changes in product markets on the observed flattening of firms, we acknowledge and address the

importance of information technology in our analysis.

     Given that we find a significant effect from a specific trade liberalization, it is likely that

increasing domestic and foreign competition from other sources (such as deregulation and

reductions in trade, communication and transport costs) is also an important contributor to the

flattening of firms. Analyzing these other drivers of increasing competition is beyond the scope

of this paper. However, to the extent that one thinks that these are major forces, this paper is an

important step in the understanding of the role of product markets in explaining organizational

change.

     The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the related theoretical

literature on organizational design and discusses the potential links between the competitive

environment, internal hierarchies, and managerial incentives. Section 3 describes the data and

our empirical strategy. Section 4 outlines our results and discusses potential interpretations.

Section 5 concludes.



2.      Theoretical Background




                                                                                                  5
   M-form organizations, as described and documented in the pioneering work of Alfred

Chandler (1962), are comprised of a central administrative unit or “headquarters” and operating

units or divisions. Economic models typically characterize headquarters (or the CEO) as the

principal with the objective of maximizing firm profits and division managers as self-interested

agents that are better informed about local markets. The optimal design of an organization

depends on trade-offs associated with various characteristics such as information, incentives, and

coordination which in turn are a function of the environment in which the firm operates (Roberts,

2004).

   An external shock to the environment, such as an increase in the intensity of product market

competition, can cause firms to reorganize along various dimensions. One traditional explanation

is that firms are not optimizing and that competition forces firms to eliminate organizational

slack or X-inefficiency (Liebenstein, 1966). However, explicit changes to organizational design

need not be the result of earlier inefficient behavior, but could be an optimal response to the

trade-offs inherent in distinct strategic and design choices.

   For example, under certain theories of hierarchies, firms have to trade-off adaptation and

coordination: decentralized decision-making may replace centralized structures as quick

adaptation to local markets becomes paramount. Yet, local decisions by autonomous business

unit managers may be more costly for corporate headquarters to coordinate (e.g., Alonso,

Dessein, and Matouschek, 2008). Firms may also trade-off loss of information and loss of

control when making organizational decisions as the delegation of decision rights can encourage

generation of higher quality information, but comes at a cost of lack of control (e.g., Aghion and

Tirole, 1997). A further dimension that firms can optimize is the generation and processing of

information. The elimination of management levels may facilitate faster and more accurate flow




                                                                                                6
of information throughout the hierarchy, but broader spans of control associated with fewer

levels can lead to loss of control and the inability to process information by headquarters (e.g.,

Williamson, 1967). Firms also choose the appropriate level of incentive provision as the return to

managerial effort increases: the optimal performance-pay sensitivity depends on the

characteristics of the environment (Raith, 2003).

    Finally, decentralization and incentive provision may also interact (e.g., Mookerjee, 2006)

and decentralized decision-making can be coupled with higher performance pay to appropriately

align incentives (e.g., Prendergast, 2002; Wulf, 2007). However, local incentives can be costly as

they fail to realize synergies across business units (e.g. Athey and Roberts, 2001). 6

    But beyond making explicit the existence of a series of trade-offs facing firms, an important

result of organizational theory highlights the interactions and potential complementarities among

different subsets of organizational design choices. Milgrom and Roberts (1995) analyze

complementarities among different features of modern production technologies, while

Holmstrom and Milgrom (1994) examine levels of incentives to elicit effort for various tasks and

the interactions among incentives, asset ownership and job restrictions. Other more recent papers

include Friebel and Raith (2007), Dessein, Garicano and Gertner (2007) and Athey and Roberts

(2001), each of which examines the determination of incentives and decision-making authority

from various perspectives.

    As a consequence of changes in the competitive environment, firms are likely to face

different costs and benefits of various trade-offs. This will cause firms to adjust their set of


6
 There is a growing theoretical literature in economics that relates to each of these features. Several models explore
the role of a hierarchy in enabling a firm to process and communicate information among agents (e.g. Radner, 1993;
Bolton and Dewatripont, 1994; Garicano, 2000). More recent research focuses on the trade-off between information
and authority or control (e.g. Aghion and Tirole, 1997 and Alonso, Dessein and Matouschek, 2008). The early
theoretical work which is less central to this paper considers hierarchies as a means to create incentives (e.g. Lazear
and Rosen, 1981), to supervise workers (e.g. Williamson, 1967; Calvo and Wellisz, 1978) or to assign talent (e.g.
Rosen, 1982).


                                                                                                                     7
complementary organizational practices including, but not limited to, the location of decision

rights, the layers in a hierarchy, and the design of incentives. Rantakari (2008) models these

choices and makes predictions about interactions among different organizational design

parameters and the joint fit with the volatility of the firm’s environment.

    Other related work that explicitly links product market competition to the internal

organization of firms is Marin and Verdier (2003). They develop a model of hierarchies based on

Aghion and Tirole (1997) and show that greater international competition leads to a delegation of

authority from the CEO to the managers.7 In addition to altering the location of decision rights,

increased competition is likely to change the importance of incentives provided through pay

independently of the effect on hierarchies (e.g. Raith, 2003; Cuñat and Guadalupe, 2006).

    In sum, the effect of competition on various organizational choices—hierarchy, location of

decision rights, and performance pay--is ultimately an empirical issue.

    Of course there are other explanations besides intensified competition for the flattening of

firms, the most obvious being the rise of information technology. Managers receive, process,

and transmit information, and improvements in the technology of communication and

computation may directly affect organizational design and may have differential effects in more

competitive environments. For example, improvements in communication technology may allow

more efficient processing of information thereby increasing spans of control, and this effect may

be more pronounced in competitive environments in which quick decision-making is essential.

As discussed in the introduction, a number of empirical papers demonstrate that IT is an



7
 Askenazy, Thesmar and Thoenig (2006) consider how new technologies increase the value of innovation which
causes firms to design more “reactive” organizations. Thesmar and Thoenig (2000) show that an increase in the rate
of creative destruction (the arrival of new products) has an impact on organizational choice. Finally, Conconi,
Legros and Newman (2008) develop a trade model to examine how liberalization affects the ownership structure of
firms.


                                                                                                                8
important determinant of organizational design and we will address its role in our empirical

analysis.

      Finally, increased competition can affect organizational design through many channels,

including, but not limited to: changes in business scope, the reduction of organizational slack (or

X-inefficiency), and outsourcing or offshoring. While it is beyond the scope of the paper to

consider each of these various channels, we will attempt to consider several of these mechanisms

in our empirical specifications.

3.       Data and Empirical Strategy

3.1      Organizational Data

      The primary dataset from which we draw our sample is an unbalanced cross-industry panel

of more than 300 publicly traded U.S. firms over the years 1986-1999. This dataset includes

detailed information on job descriptions, titles, reporting relationships, and reporting levels of

senior and middle management positions. The dataset is rather unique because it allows us to

identify changes in hierarchies within firms over a 14-year period that is characterized by

significant organizational change.

      The data are collected from a confidential compensation survey conducted by Hewitt

Associates, a leading human resources consulting firm specializing in executive compensation

and benefits. The survey is the largest private compensation survey (as measured by the number

of participating firms). The survey participants are typically the leaders in their sectors and the

survey sample is most representative of Fortune 500 firms. For a more detailed description of

the data and their representativeness, see Rajan and Wulf (2006).

      An observation in the dataset is a managerial position within a firm in a year. This includes

both operational positions (e.g., Chief Operations Officer and Division Managers) and senior




                                                                                                 9
staff positions (e.g., Chief Financial Officer and General or Legal Counsel). The data for each

position include all components of compensation including salary, actual bonus, and grants of

restricted stock, stock options, and other forms of long-term incentives (e.g., performance

units)8; as well as position-specific characteristics such as job title, the title of the position that

the job reports to (i.e., the position’s boss), number of positions between the position and the

CEO in the organizational hierarchy, and both the incumbent’s status as a corporate officer and

tenure in position.

    We analyze changes in organizational structure by focusing on two characteristics: breadth

and depth of the hierarchy. These can be defined consistently across firms and over time and

reflect important information about two important positions in the hierarchy, namely the division

manager and the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). We also analyze changes in division manager

pay—both levels and performance sensitivity.

    Our first measure, span, is a firm-level measure that captures a horizontal dimension or

breadth of the hierarchy. It measures CEO span of control and is defined as the number of

positions reporting directly to the CEO. One obvious question when using this variable is: what

information is reflected in a direct reporting relationship to the CEO? First, the CEO should

have direct authority over the manager in the position (i.e., his subordinate). Second, presumably

the exchange of information between the CEO and the manager is more direct than it would be if

the “chain of command” included other intermediary positions. Since the CEO is at the top of the

lines of authority and communication, his job involves decision-making at the highest level, but

also includes a role as coordinator of information and decisions that are associated with a

complex, multidivisional firm.

8
 The Hewitt database is thus far more comprehensive than the SEC filings which form the basis for the ExecuComp
database. Because firms are required to only file information on the top five executive officers, information on
division managers is rarely included in these sources.


                                                                                                             10
      Our other measure, depth, is defined at the division level and represents a vertical dimension,

or steepness, of the hierarchy. It is defined as the number of positions between the CEO and the

division manager. Division managers (DM) are the highest authority in the division, where a

division is defined as “the lowest level of profit center responsibility for a business unit that

engineers, manufactures and sells its own products.” We focus on the division manager position

for two reasons: (i) it is the position furthest down the hierarchy that is most consistently defined

across firms; and (ii) it is informative about the extent to which responsibility is delegated in the

firm.

      Figure 1 displays an example of a hierarchy that demonstrates both measures of span and

depth. In this example, the measure of span equals 4 -- there are four positions reporting directly

to the CEO -- and the measure of depth equals 2 — there are two positions between the CEO and

the division manager. Average span increased from 4.5 positions in 1986 to 7 positions in 1999

and average depth fell from around 1.5 to 1.

      In this paper, we focus on the subset of firms that operate in the manufacturing sector for

which we have data on tariffs. This leads to a sample of approximately 1962 firm-years and 5702

division-years that includes 230 firms and 1524 divisions. We will report both firm-level

regressions (span of control is a firm level variable) and division-level regressions (division

depth and division manager pay will vary by division within the firm).

      We also have information on division level sales and employment and the above data are

supplemented with financial information from Compustat. Finally, we construct a number of

variables that are used as controls and that we will describe in the results section (see Table A3

on how these are built).

3.2      Product Market Changes: The 1989 Canada U.S. Free Trade Agreement




                                                                                                  11
   In January 1989, U.S. President Reagan and Canadian Prime Minister Mulroney signed the

Canada U.S. Free Trade Agreement (FTA) to eliminate trade barriers, and in particular, all tariffs

between Canada and the United States. In October 1987, when the details of the agreement were

first revealed, they encountered substantial opposition in Canada. By early 1988, the Liberal

Party announced that it would use its majority in the Senate to block passage of the free trade

agreement until Canadian voters decided the agreement's fate in a general election. The Liberal

party had an advantage of 20 points in the polls over the Conservative party. The highly

contested election took place in October 1988 with a narrow Conservative victory. Three months

later the agreement came into effect and the first round of tariff reductions took place.

   The advantages of this turn of events for our empirical strategy are threefold (see discussion

in Trefler, 2004). Since the passage of the agreement was highly improbable and unexpected, it

can be interpreted as an exogenous shock. Furthermore, it was not a response to a

macroeconomic shock, but rather to the lack of progress in the Tokyo round, so that it was

unaccompanied by other economic packages that could affect industries simultaneously. Finally,

there were no other important trade agreements during that period so that the shock to trade with

Canada is unlikely to be confounded with other factors.

   This reduction of U.S. tariffs on imports from Canadian firms affected a substantial fraction

of U.S. trade since the U.S.-Canada trade relationship is the world’s largest in volume and

Canadian imports represented an average of 20% of total U.S. imports at the time (in comparison

to Mexico at around 5%). In addition, Canada is similar to the U.S. in terms of product

specialization, so that Canadian products are likely to compete directly with U.S. products. In

fact, Head and Ries (2001) estimate the elasticity of substitution between U.S. and Canadian

goods at approximately 8, suggesting a potentially large response of Canadian imports from the




                                                                                               12
tariff reductions. They also document substantial trade-distorting non-tariff barriers suggesting a

potentially even larger effect from the trade liberalization. Below we discuss the effect the

liberalization had on North-American trade.

     In order to evaluate the effect of the trade agreement on organizational change, we exploit the

fact that U.S. firms in industries with high tariffs on Canadian imports prior to 1989 suffered a

bigger ‘competitive shock’ following the liberalization than firms facing low tariffs. We define

AvT89 s to measure the level of exposure of the firm to the liberalization. This is the average

tariff on Canadian imports by industry s for the period between 1986 and 1988 (Feenstra et al.,

1996),9 where tariffs are defined as duty divided by customs value by 4 digit SIC (or 3 digit SIC)

by year, and we take the average of the three years before 1989.10 Our dependent variables are a

set of organizational variables ORG dst by division d (or firm), industry s and year t. For example,

division-level depth, division manager pay, and CEO span of control (defined at the firm level),

such that our basic empirical specification is as follows:

            ORG     dst   = θ 3 AvT 89 s * Post 89 t + X dst ' β + d t + η d + η d * t + ε dst                          (1)

     Where AvT89 s is the level of tariffs on Canadian imports in the industry pre-89, Post89t is

a dummy that equals one after 1989, X dst are division (or firms) characteristics such as size,

d t are year dummies, η d are division fixed effects that absorb any permanent cross-sectional

division/firm/industry differences and ε dst is an error term. This is a standard quasi-difference in

differences specification that exploits the trade liberalization, where AvT89 s (the “treatment”) is

continuous. The coefficient of interest, θ 3 , captures the differential effect of the liberalization on

 We report the average tariff by industry (3 digit SIC) for firms in our sample and list examples of Canadian firms
operating in these industries (see Tables S1 and S2 in the Supplemental Appendix). Unfortunately, we do not have
non-tariff barriers, however to the extent that these are correlated with tariffs, we can interpret the tariff effect as the
overall trade-liberalization effect (Trefler, 2004).


                                                                                                                        13
firms according to their trade exposure prior to 1989, net of the general change post 1989 and net

of possible permanent differences across industries.11 Finally, we also include division specific

trends in the organizational variable, η d *t.

     One concern in estimating equation (1) is that our organizational variables—both span and

depth--exhibit a strong trend over time (as suggested in Figures 2 & 3) leading to autocorrelated

errors. Not surprisingly, a test of autocorrelation strongly rejects the null of no autocorrelation,

even when allowing for division-specific time trends (F statistic of 431.2). This implies that the

fixed effects (within) estimation is inefficient. We estimate equation (1) in first-differences, since

this removes the autocorrelation (F statistic of 2.6), and thus is the efficient estimator in this case.

Furthermore, since AvT89 s is defined at the industry level, we cluster standard errors by four

digit SIC in all specifications to allow for correlation across observations within an industry.

     A. Validity of the trade liberalization as a “Quasi-natural experiment”

     We argued earlier that the agreement itself was largely unexpected and therefore one can

consider it as an exogenous shock to the different industries. In order to make sure that there are

no differential pre-existing trends in organizational variables that are correlated with tariff

levels, we include division trends. We will also run a “placebo” test on the main specification, to

assess potential anticipation effects of the liberalization. A potential source of endogeneity is the

phase-out schedule of the tariffs. Some tariff reductions took effect immediately, while others

were scheduled to be phased out over a period of five or ten years. Since that choice is




11
  Firms and divisions are assigned the industry reported as the firm’s primary four digit SIC in the first year they
appear in the sample using historic SICs. This industry classification is not allowed to vary over time since these
changes are endogenous and we use three digit SICs if four digit SICs are not reported. 70% of the firms in the
sample appear before 1989; for those that appear after, we keep the first SIC reported. We conduct a series of
robustness tests using a variety of methods in classifying the industry or industries in which a firm operates.


                                                                                                                14
  endogenous and subject to lobbying, we treat all industries equally regardless of their phase-out

  schedule.12

      But even if the implementation of the agreement was unexpected, and if we do not allow for

 endogenous phase-out of tariffs to identify our results, we still need to address the fact that the

 pre-89 level of tariffs is not necessarily random. We do this in two different ways. Trefler (2004)

 argues that one source of tariff endogeneity is that declining industries may have high tariff

 levels. He addresses this concern by controlling for industry specific trends. We address this

 concern by controlling for division specific time trends (η d * t ) that absorb the industry secular

 trends. We further control for other pre-existing industry characteristics that are typically related

 to tariff protection: skill intensity, capital intensity and TFP growth of U.S. industries. The

 vector Z s includes the averages of each of these measures by industry before the FTA (between

 1986 and 1988). Analogous to our tariff measure, we also allow organizational change to vary

 along these dimensions after 1989 through the interaction term ( Z s * Post 89t ) .

      Once we include these variables and take first differences, the regression we estimate is:

Δ ORG dst = θ 3 Δ AvT 89 s * Post 89 t + Δ X dst ' β + Δ d t + η d + Δ ( Z s * Post 89 t )' ϕ + Δ ε dst (2)

      B. Economic Significance of the FTA for U.S. firms

      A final question before we proceed to the results is to what extent we could expect the FTA

 to significantly affect U.S. firms. Clausing (2001) studies the FTA using disaggregated data at

 the commodity level (10 digit product categories) and finds that the increase in U.S. imports

 from Canada was larger the larger the tariff reduction (the higher the pre-1989 tariff). For

 imports that saw a tariff reduction in excess of 5%, trade doubled in size between 1989 and 1994

 and over half of the $42 billion increase in imports from Canada between 1989 and 1994 was the

 12
    We also run a robustness check that shows that the effect of the liberalization on organizational change was larger
 in industries with faster reductions in tariffs.


                                                                                                                   15
result of the trade agreement. Head and Ries (2001) and Romalis (2007) also find a sizable effect

of the tariff reductions on trade volumes.
                                                                                                             13
     So, overall the trade liberalization increased bilateral trade flows and import penetration,

which is consistent with an increase in competitive pressure for firms on both sides of the border.

In fact, there is substantial micro-econometric work documenting the effect of the FTA on

Canadian firms. For example, Trefler (2004) finds a substantial increase in labor productivity of

Canadian companies following the agreement. Further, the paper finds that the reduction in U.S.

tariffs on exports from Canada led to a 6 % expansion of the most productive, export-oriented

plants (and to a contraction of the most import-competing). This suggests that the liberalization

allowed them to expand production, increase sales to the larger U.S. market, and move down

their average cost curve.

     Regarding the effect of the FTA on U.S. firms, Feinberg and Keane (2006) study the

import/export behavior of U.S. multinationals (and their Canadian subsidiaries) and show that

the reduction in tariffs led to a substantial increase in arms-length exports of U.S. multinationals

to Canada (20% increase) and of their Canadian subsidiaries to the U.S. (29.8% increase). They

also find increases in U.S. domestic sales and employment for these firms. Changes in tariffs

explain most of the change in arms-length trade, but not changes in intra-firm trade (trade

between affiliates and their U.S. parents).

     In this study, we also found a significant effect of the FTA on firms in our sample (Table

A1). In fact, we found a qualitatively different response to U.S. tariff reductions (that implied

more import competition) than to Canadian tariff reductions (that presented more export

opportunities). Using the same specification as in equation (2), we found that reductions in U.S.

13
  The evidence on whether the increase in trade was at the expense of trade with other countries is more mixed:
Clausing (2001) and Head and Ries (2001) find no evidence of trade diversion, but Romalis (2007) does.



                                                                                                            16
tariffs on Canadian imports led to reductions in average price-cost margin for our firms

suggesting a significant negative effect of competition on accounting measures. However, we

found no significant changes on market value (excess returns) or employment. On the other

hand, Canadian tariff reductions14 did raise firm employment and excess market returns (and had

no effect on price-cost margins), which is consistent with the market expansion interpretation

and with earlier results by Feinberg and Keane (2001, 2006). Even though a thorough analysis of

the effect of the liberalization on productivity and the profitability of U.S. firms is beyond the

scope of this paper, the overall evidence suggests that the FTA led to greater competitive

pressure from the reduction in U.S. tariffs, but also increased opportunities for market expansion

from Canadian tariff reduction. Next, we assess the organizational response to the liberalization.

4.       Results

4.1      Trade Liberalization and the Flattening Firm: Changes in Division Depth and CEO

         Span of Control

      In this section, we focus on the effect of the trade liberalization on changes in division depth

and CEO span of control as the main organizational variables. In a subsequent section, we will

explore how other aspects of organizations (in particular, levels of pay and incentive

compensation for division managers) are also changing over time in order to provide a fuller

picture of organizational change and to explore the possible mechanisms by which these changes

occur.

      Before turning to the regression results, let us begin by discussing Figures 2 and 3 that show

the main variation that we exploit in our empirical analysis. We divide firms and divisions


14
   This is the average Canadian tariff by 4 digit SIC (3 where 4 is missing) on US exports, measured as the mean
tariff between 1986 and 1989 (computed in an analogous way to U.S. AvT89). The data on Canadian tariffs are from
Trefler (2004), and we use a converter provided by the author to convert Canadian industry codes into US SIC
codes.


                                                                                                             17
according to whether the firm is in an industry with a tariff above or below the median tariff pre-

1989. We plot the average span (Figure 2) and depth (Figure 3) by year for the two subgroups.

While we observe trending in organizational variables in both groups, there is a distinct

difference in the change in trend after 1989 between the groups. Firms in high tariff industries

increase their span by more and decrease depth by more after the trade liberalization in

comparison to firms in low tariff industries. The patterns suggest that firms in industries facing

increased competition alter the shape of their organizational hierarchy--greater span and

decreased depth. 15 These graphs restrict the sample to firms that are present in the data before

1989 to avoid compositional changes driving these patterns (we observe even starker patterns in

the whole sample). While the figures depict raw differences in organizational change of firms in

industries facing different competitive shocks, they do not take into account firm or division

characteristics, unobserved heterogeneity, or the overall time trend. For this, we turn to our

regression analysis.

     Clearly, changes in span and depth are correlated. As division managers get closer to the top

of the hierarchy and are more likely to report directly to the CEO, span increases.16 In Tables 2

and 3, we report our results of the effect of the FTA on division depth and CEO span of control

respectively. The tables have a similar structure with specifications reported in roughly the same

order. Since these organizational variables are related, we will describe and discuss our findings

for both depth and span in parallel to provide a more coherent picture. In the depth regressions




15
   In the Figure S1 in the Supplemental Appendix, we illustrate an example of the changes in a firm’s hierarchy pre-
and post-FTA. This firm operated in the textile manufacturing industry which faced average Canadian tariffs on US
imports of 8.8%. The firm flattened through the elimination of an intermediary position (Chief Operating Officer)
and in the process moved the division manager positions one level closer to the CEO. As a result, span increased
from 5 to 7 and average depth decreased from 2 to 1.
16
    In Section 3 and Table S5 of the Supplemental Appendix, we show that this relationship is not simply a
mechanical one.


                                                                                                                18
(Table 2) the unit of observation is the division-year (there are 1524 divisions in the data); while

in the span regressions (Table 3), it is the firm-year (230 firms).17

     All regressions follow the structure of equation (2) and include year dummies and controls

for firm size (as the natural logarithm of sales) and the endogeneity of tariffs through interactions

of industry characteristics (skill intensity, capital intensity and TFP growth) with a post 89

dummy. Standard errors are clustered at the industry level. The regressions also account for

permanent unobserved heterogeneity (firm or division) that might bias our estimates. This is a

big advantage of this dataset, in that the estimates are exclusively identified from within firm

variation in their exposure to the FTA (and not from differences across firms).

     The coefficient of interest is the interaction of the average tariff in the industry before the

1989 FTA with a post 89 dummy (variable AvT89*Post89). The agreement specified that all

tariffs be eliminated (within a time frame) after 1989. As such, we expect the agreement to

reflect a greater increase in competitive pressure (i.e., a larger fall in entry barriers) in industries

with high tariffs relative to low tariff industries.

     The main results are shown in column 1 of Tables 2 and 3. In column 1 of Table 2 (depth)

the coefficient on the interaction term is negative and statistically significant. This suggests that

firms in industries with higher tariffs prior to the trade liberalization decreased division depth

more over the period as their product markets faced greater competition due to a decline in

tariffs. A firm in an industry with average U.S. tariffs on Canadian imports (4 %) decreased

division depth by 0.146 positions following the trade liberalization (3.661*0.04). This represents



17
   It is important to run the depth regressions at the division level –instead of averaging by firm- in order to look at
changes of the same division over time, and to be able to control for division size. Given that the coverage of
divisions within a firm can fluctuate (firms do not report all divisions in the data), changes in average depth within
firms may be capturing compositional changes. We also checked whether the coverage of divisions (as the fraction
of total sales represented by the divisions in the sample out of total firm sales as reported by Compustat) changed
with the experiment, and found that it did not (column 1 Table S3 in the Supplemental Appendix).


                                                                                                                    19
11.2 % of average depth in the sample. One way to interpret the magnitude of this effect is to

imagine a firm with six division managers each with one position between them and the CEO

(i.e., depth of 1). Following the trade liberalization, a firm with average tariffs would move one

of the six division managers to report directly to the CEO. Since this only requires a change in

the level of reporting for a subset of the divisions, it is relatively easy to implement and, as we

will show, most of the change occurs within the first year.

   Turning to span of control, in Table 3 column 2, we find a positive and statistically

significant coefficient suggesting that firms increase span of control more in response to a greater

fall in tariffs in their industries. A firm with average tariffs before 1989 increased span by 0.324

positions following the trade liberalization (8.106*0.04), or 6 % of average span in the sample.

This implies that one of every three firms in our sample increased the CEO’s span of control by

one position.

   In Table 2 (depth) columns 2 through 10, we also control for division specific time trends

and for division size (the log of division employment). We lose around 700 observations where

division employment is missing, but this does not substantially alter the results. Perhaps not

surprisingly, larger firms have greater depth and larger divisions within firms are closer to the

top. Controlling for division employment also allows us to indirectly control for the potential

down-sizing of divisions due to outsourcing, or off-shoring of certain activities, since this would

possibly lead to a reduction in employment. The stability of the main coefficient of interest

suggests that outsourcing is unlikely to be driving our main findings. Even conditional on

division size, we find that divisions in firms more affected by the FTA repositioned their DMs

closer to the top of the hierarchy.




                                                                                                 20
     Column 2 of Table 3 (span) controls for firm specific time trends, and we obtain a similar

though slightly larger effect than in column 1 (coefficient of 9.9 instead of 8.1). This indicates

that the result is not driven by pre-existing trends in span that may have pre-dated the

liberalization agreement.18

     Next, since the trade liberalization implied not only a fall in U.S. tariffs on Canadian imports,

but also a reduction of Canadian tariffs on U.S. exports, we allow for an effect of this second

aspect of the liberalization. Column 3 includes an interaction of the average Canadian tariff on

U.S. exports with a post 1989 dummy (labeled as Export AvT89 and defined in an analogous

way to U.S. AvT89). The effect is positive for depth and negative for span, suggesting that on

average the market expansion possibilities given by easier exporting to Canada by U.S. firms led

to increases in depth and decreases in span, relative to the trend. This is the opposite effect of

what we find for import tariffs, and since this effect is never statistically significant, it seems that

increasing competitive pressure leads firms to flatten rather than greater export opportunities.

What might explain this? One explanation is that the Canadian market is small relative to the

U.S. market, so that the market expansion opportunities are not substantial. But this is unlikely

since we do find that employment and market value increased significantly for these firms (Table

A1). Alternatively, to the extent that market expansion does not generate competitive pressure, it

may lead to other types of organizational changes different from those that we can identify in our

data.




18
  Since the increase in the number of direct reports may come from senior officer positions as well as from lower
level managers, and since the presence of the Chief Operating Officer (COO) has decreased substantially over the
sample period, we also controlled for the presence of a COO and a Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) that may
report directly to the CEO. We found that the effect of the liberalization is slightly reduced suggesting that the
estimated increase in span also includes other senior officer positions as well as managers traditionally lower in the
hierarchy (unreported).


                                                                                                                  21
   For the remaining columns in both Tables 2 and 3, we explore the robustness of the main

results to the inclusion of a number of controls and to alternative explanations. Column 4

provides a test of the main specification, specifically the assumption that the shock was

unanticipated. We replace the Post 89 dummy in AvT*Post89 with a post 1988 dummy variable

and keep the same set of controls (this is a standard placebo test for differences in differences). If

the liberalization was anticipated, or if there was a pre-existing trend, then this new variable

would pick up what we argue is a discrete “shock” before it occurred. But, the coefficient is

statistically insignificant in both tables, lending credibility to the fact that the liberalization was

truly unanticipated and that firms only started to respond after 1989.

   In column 5 of both tables, we further analyze the timing of the effect by considering if there

was a lag in the firm’s response or if some of the change occurred around the time of the North

American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Since NAFTA did not alter trade agreements

between Canada and the U.S. (it was only an extension to Mexico), we expect it to have a

negligible effect. To test this, we include an interaction of the average tariff between 1990 and

1993 with a post-94 dummy variable (AvT94*Post94). This captures the differential effect of

NAFTA across firms operating in industries with different levels of protection after 1989, but

before 1994. We find statistically insignificant coefficients on both the interaction term

associated with the 1994 experiment and on the lagged term. These findings suggest that most of

the effect came from the 1989 agreement. The absence of an effect for the 1994 experiment is

also consistent with the fact that there were no radical changes in the tariff agreements of

NAFTA with respect to Canada. Furthermore, it suggests that we are not just capturing a

spurious time trend. If it was spurious, the 1994 experiment coefficient should be significant,

particularly since substantial flattening occurred during the late 1990s. We also allow for a




                                                                                                    22
lagged effect of the 1989 experiment and find that it is not significant suggesting that most of the

organizational change occurs within the first year. This is not particularly surprising given that

changes in the level of reporting don’t have large implementation costs.

   All the results above are based on average U.S. tariffs on Canadian imports in the firm’s

primary 4 digit SIC code (3 digit if reported at 3 digits) in which the firm operated before 1989.

We use the industry classification that is reported prior to the trade liberalization to isolate the

effect from endogenous changes in the main industry reported. Since our sample is comprised of

multidivisional firms that typically operate in different industries and may change industry focus

over time, we analyze the effect of the trade liberalization on a number of sub-samples to assess

the validity of the main results.

   For firms that operate in more than one industry, there may be considerable noise in the

industry tariff measure as a proxy for the change in competition that a firm faces. To address this

concern, instead of using industry tariffs of the firm’s primary SIC code, we construct a firm-

specific measure that recognizes the firm’s business mix. We use the weighted average of U.S.

tariffs for the industries in which the firm operates before the liberalization, where the weights

are the fraction of sales of each of the firm’s segments (as reported in 1988 from Compustat

segment data). The weights are kept constant over the sample period to avoid endogeneity in

choice of industry (for the same reason we kept the primary SIC constant). This comes at a cost

in that, if segment data are noisy, the weights will be as well and this could induce measurement

error. We report the results based on this firm-specific tariff measure in column 6 of both tables.

The estimated effect is approximately 14 to 20 % larger for depth and span respectively and still

statistically significant (although the standard errors are larger, and there is no statistical

difference from the main effect).




                                                                                                 23
     Relatedly, we might expect industry tariffs to be a more precise measure of competition for

firms that report their industry at a lower level of aggregation (i.e., 4 digit SIC codes instead of 3

or 2). When we restrict the sample to firms that report a 4 digit SIC, we find a larger and more

precisely estimated main effect (unreported). Finally, in column 7 in both tables, we restrict the

sample to firms that report the same SIC throughout the sample period. In these regressions,

since we exclude firms that may have endogenously changed their primary industry of

operations, we would expect tariff reductions to more closely approximate actual changes in

competition. This should lead to larger and more precisely estimated effects and this is exactly

what we find in column 7 in both tables.19

     Overall, we find convincing evidence that the effect of the trade liberalization on the

flattening of firms took place around the 1989 period, that the liberalization was unanticipated,

and that the effect was larger in industries where we have better measures of changes in

competition. To reiterate the main findings: we find systematic evidence that U.S. firms, in

response to trade liberalization with Canada, flattened the structure of their organizations. They

reduced division depth by moving division managers closer to the top of the hierarchy and they

increased the CEO span of control. 20 Next we consider two important alternative explanations

that could affect our main results.



19
   Further robustness checks of the main results are presented in Table S4 in the Supplemental Appendix (depth in
Panel A and span in Panel B). The results are similar if we restrict the sample to firms that are present in the sample
before 1989 (column 1), if we include all services firms in the estimation as a control group (with average tariff
AvT89 of zero, column 2) and when controlling for fluctuations in the exchange rate that may differentially affect
industries with different levels of import penetration (column 3). The magnitude of the effect is larger when we
restrict the sample to firms: (i) with no Canadian subsidiaries (column 4), and (ii) with a faster scheduled reduction
in tariffs (column 5).
20
   One could also wonder to what extent these effects are restricted to the FTA, or if they generalize to other
measures of competition. In fact, we also found evidence that division depth and CEO span significantly respond to
other standard measures of competitive pressure (Table A2). We found that higher competition as reflected in lower
trade costs (defined as tariffs plus transport costs, columns 1 and 4), a lower industry Lerner Index (columns 2 and
5) or higher import penetration (columns 3 and 6) significantly reduces depth and increases CEO span of control
(although for the latter, only the trade costs variable is significant). While these measures can be subject to many


                                                                                                                   24
    One frequent reason for why firms change their organizations is explained by changes in firm

leadership. Very often reorganizations come about when the CEO is replaced. In column 8 in

both tables, we address this question by including a dummy variable that controls for a change in

CEO. We find that depth decreases by 0.182 positions (division managers move closer to the

top) in the event of a change in the CEO, and that span increases by 0.446 positions. The effect is

highly statistically significant for both depth and span and contributes substantially to the R-

squared of both regressions. However, the point estimate of the coefficient on AvT89*Post89

hardly changes (from 3.5 to 3.3 for depth and no change for span) and is estimated with similar

precision, suggesting that the trade liberalization has an independent effect on organizational

change that is distinct from CEO turnover. We also checked whether the probability of a CEO

change increased with the liberalization, with positive but statistically insignificant results

(column 2 Table S3 in the Supplemental Appendix).

    Finally, we try to consider the relevance of IT as a driver of organizational change. The mere

availability of IT and falling IT prices should not be a problem for our identification since the

availability of IT was similar across industries and our experiment exploits the differential effect

across industries after 1989. However, to the extent that firms in different industries adopt IT in

similar ways, we control for two types of IT investment at the industry level: total IT in column

9 (includes hardware, software and communications) and communication technology (CT) in

column 10 of Table 2. These are defined as the investment in IT (CT) capital stock at the 2-digit

SIC industry level based on data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) (refer to Table

A3 for specifics). The data are very aggregated relative to what one would require for a




criticisms and are by no means exogenous –that is why we use the FTA as our core specification- they provide
evidence consistent with the main result in this paper: that flattening is a response to competitive pressure.


                                                                                                           25
conclusive analysis, however, they allow us to evaluate the robustness of our main results to

investments in information technology. We find that our coefficient of interest is unaffected.

      Regarding the coefficient on overall IT in column 9 in both tables, we find it is positive for

both depth and span suggesting that increases in IT are associated with deeper organizations and

wider spans of control. However, both coefficients are statistically insignificant. When we

exclusively focus on the communications component of IT (Table 2 column 10), we find a

positive and statistically significant coefficient in the depth regression (but, insignificant for span

(unreported)). This suggests that firms in industries that are investing in IT and, in particular CT,

are steeper (Garicano, 2000). Therefore the effect on delayering of more IT (CT) goes in the

opposite direction to the competition effect that we have shown in this study. While these results

are only suggestive, and while a more detailed analysis of IT and hierarchical change is needed,

it is unlikely that the effect we are capturing with the FTA is due to IT.

      Overall, we find systematic evidence that firms experiencing a larger shock following the

trade liberalization (those in more protected industries prior to 1989) reduced division depth and

increased CEO span of control more relative to firms less affected by the liberalization. This

effect is robust to a number of specifications and implies that, on average, the trade liberalization

led U.S. manufacturing firms to flatten.

4.2      Why Are Firms Flattening?

      The previous results show that the trade liberalization partially explains some of the

flattening of US firms—both the increased span of control of the CEO and the decreased depth

of division managers (or the delayering of levels in the hierarchy). Arguably, they represent

causal estimates of an exogenous shock to the product market that go beyond the simple

correlations of prior research. However, even though they capture a significant causal effect, they




                                                                                                    26
are silent on the reasons for why firms alter their organizational structure and what the flattening

actually means. While it is difficult to identify precise channels for the causal mechanism, in the

next three sub-sections we attempt to shed some light on this issue. We explore several possible

explanations including simple cost-cutting, changes in decision-making, and changes in firm

scope.

4.2.1    Division Manager (DM) Compensation and Incentives

     As shown earlier, following the trade liberalization, division managers are closer to the CEO

in the organizational hierarchy. One possible explanation is that this may reflect the increased

responsibility of division managers (DM) and potentially greater delegation of authority as an

optimal response to competition (consistent with Marin and Verdier, 2003). Strictly speaking,

our depth measure reflects “number of reporting levels” without any information on the actual

role of the DM or the decisions they make. However, by looking at DM compensation and the

importance of performance pay in their contracts, we can potentially infer a difference in job

scope. 21

     The first four columns in Table 4 show the effect of the liberalization on the level of pay and

on DM incentives based on division-level performance. The dependent variable is the logarithm

of division manager total compensation. Total pay for DMs is the sum of salary, bonus, and

long-term compensation.22 The regressions are again as in equation (2). Column 1 shows that



21
   One concern is that the notion of a division varies across firms and what we are picking up in our pay regressions
is either just differences in a firm’s definition of a division or differences in firm compensation policies. Since we
have division fixed effects, permanent cross-sectional differences in how firms define a division will not affect our
estimates. Moreover, the results are robust to controlling for division depth.
22
   The value of the long-term compensation includes restricted stock, stock options and other components of long-
term incentives and is determined by a modified version of Black-Scholes that is computed by Hewitt Associates
and therefore is consistent across firms and over time. Stock options are valued using a modified version of Black-
Scholes that takes into account vesting and termination provisions in addition to the standard variables of interest
rates, stock price volatility, and dividends. As is standard practice among compensation consulting firms, the other
components of long-term incentives (i.e. restricted stock, performance units and performance shares) are valued


                                                                                                                  27
higher competitive pressure leads to higher total pay within the division (it includes division

fixed effects). That is, the same DM position earns higher total pay after the competitive shock.

Division managers in industries with average tariffs pre-1989 received a 7.0% increase

(1.751*0.04) in total compensation after the trade liberalization relative to managers in industries

with no tariffs. But, while interesting in itself, this could be driven by firms replacing managers

with more skilled ones following the FTA. If firms are hiring more talented managers that

require higher pay, then our result is a mixture of more skilled hires combined with changes in

job scope. To address this, columns 2 through 4 include manager times division fixed effects (so

that the effect is identified out of changes in pay of an individual in a division).23 The results in

column 2 for the level of pay are similar to those in column 1 suggesting that firms respond to

increased competition, not by replacing existing managers with new, higher-skilled managers,

but instead by paying existing managers more. This result is robust to controlling for manager

specific linear trends in pay (column 3).24

    One way to interpret this increase in pay along with the simultaneous reduction in depth and

increase in span is that firms in more competitive environments are more likely to delegate

authority from the senior most positions to division managers. The CEO may face greater time

constraints as his span of control increases, thereby delegating more decision-making authority

to division managers. The increase in division manager pay may be commensurate with the

increase in responsibilities and job scope. However, in order to more convincingly make this



using an economic valuation similar to Black-Scholes that takes into account vesting, termination provisions, and
the probability of achieving performance goals.
23
   Even though we do not know the identity of the manager filling the position (the unit of observation in the data is
a position), for most divisions in our sample we can identify managerial turnover using changes in tenure for the
position over time. Therefore these estimates are net of individual unobserved ability and division (and firm)
permanent unobserved characteristics.
24
   These manager fixed effects also capture any other variables that determine wages and do not change over time
such as gender differences and education. The individual trends also account for linear age and tenure effects.


                                                                                                                  28
argument, it is important to look at changes in performance-based pay and not just to changes to

total pay.

    In conjunction with greater delegation of decision-making, firms may increase performance-

based pay to ensure that division managers make decisions that are optimal for the firm. It is

often argued that delegation and incentive provision are complementary (Prendergast, 2002): in

the absence of multi-tasking, delegating authority will be more productive for the firm the more

incentives the division manager has to take initiative, collect information, and make the right

decisions for the business unit.

    Column 4 of Table 4 assesses how the basic sensitivity of DM pay to division performance

(as measured by the natural log of division sales) changes with trade liberalization. The

estimated coefficient on division sales is the elasticity of pay to sales: we find that a 1 % increase

in division sales (controlling for division employment and firm size) leads to a 0.098 % increase

in pay. The coefficient of interest is on AvT*Post89*lnDiv Sales which reflects the effect of the

trade liberalization on the performance pay sensitivity of division managers. The results indicate

that the estimated performance pay sensitivity for DMs increased by more in industries with

greater increases in competition. In particular, the sensitivity increases by 0.02 for the division in

an industry with average tariffs (0.499*0.04) which reflects an increase in incentives. As

mentioned above, we know from theoretical work that delegation and incentive provision are

often complements. So, the fact that performance pay sensitivities are increasing as the DM

moves closer to the CEO suggests that the delayering is possibly accompanied by delegation.

    However, an important cost of excessive reliance on division level incentives is that DMs as

agents are motivated by the performance of their division and not of the firm as a whole. While

there are benefits of delegating decision-making, there are offsetting costs in the loss of




                                                                                                   29
coordination across divisions. Division manager decisions/actions may impact other divisions

(through internal capital market allocations, information sharing, or lack thereof, etc). In order to

reduce the cost of delegation, firms may tie a larger fraction of incentives to overall firm

performance and not just division-level performance. Of course, the power of firm level

incentives is relatively low (since the manager only gets a small fraction of his contribution to

firm level performance), but firms can use firm level incentives to induce coordination across

divisions.

       In columns 5 through 7 of Table 4, we further evaluate changes in incentive provision by

firms where now the dependent variable is the fraction of long-term incentives out of total pay

that division managers receive. The results show that the trade liberalization led to a higher

fraction of total pay in the form of long-term incentives for division managers. For the firm

facing average tariffs, the increase in the share of long-term incentives is 3.5 % (0.882*0.04)

relative to the average share of 28% for all division managers. Stronger links between pay and

firm performance should encourage DMs to consider the effect of their decisions on overall firm

performance and to coordinate their actions with other division managers.

       Finally, just as we can test for the sensitivity of DM pay to division performance, we can

estimate its sensitivity to firm performance. We do this in column 8 of Table 4 where we use the

log of total stock market value of the firm as our performance measure (includes dividends).25

Since the equation is in first differences, this estimates the change in log pay from increases in

log stock returns (including dividends). The positive coefficient on the interaction term




25
     We obtain similar results if we use log firm sales as the performance measure.


                                                                                                  30
(AvT89*Post89*lnFirm Perf.) suggests that the sensitivity of DM pay to firm performance

increased more in industries that faced greater competition after the liberalization.26

     Table 4 shows that competition from the FTA triggered changes in both the level and

performance sensitivity of pay for division managers: increased overall pay, increased sensitivity

to division performance, as well as an increased importance of firm level performance in total

compensation. This set of facts is consistent with the explanation that increased competition

leads to a greater need to quickly adapt to local conditions. Firms respond by delegating

authority to division managers. However, since delegation is costly because it exacerbates

agency and coordination problems, firms increase the performance sensitivity of division

manager pay, especially pay that is linked to firm performance.

     The results so far show that the trade liberalization had an effect on a number of different

organizational practices and strongly suggest that our organizational variables are highly

complementary within firms. In fact, we found a strong correlation between the different

practices in a regression framework, allowing for division fixed effects, division trends, and

controls for division and firm size (see discussion in Section 3 and Table S5 in the Supplemental

Appendix). Even though we do not observe returns to firm organizational choices, it seems that

firms adjust organizational elements in a coordinated manner and redesign their organizations

through a set of potentially complementary choices in response to changes in their

environment.27

4.2.2   Heterogeneous Effects in R&D and Advertising-Intensive Industries

26
   Although it is not the focus of the paper, we also analyzed the evolution of CEO pay following liberalization. We
found the changes in CEO pay to mirror those of division managers. Total CEO compensation and the fraction of
long-term incentives in total pay (columns 3 and 4 in Table S3 in the Supplemental Appendix) increased more in
highly affected industries after 1989.
27
   For example, changing one organizational design choice, such as moving the division manager closer to the top of
the hierarchy may be more effective in improving firm performance when it occurs in conjunction with other design
elements. Hence, when division managers are closer to the top of the hierarchy, firms may provide stronger firm-
level incentives to encourage division managers to make decisions that enhance firm value.


                                                                                                                31
   If the mechanism through which firms flatten their organizations is related to how decisions

are made—either through improved flow of information or delegated decision-making—we

might expect different responses to competition from firms operating in different industries. In

particular, if firms delegate authority to more effectively exploit the informational advantage of

the division manager relative to the CEO, we would expect more delegation to occur in

industries where information about local markets is harder to communicate, such as industries

characterized by high R&D and advertising intensity. In these industries, products are more

likely to be differentiated with firms competing along the quality dimension. In contrast, firms

offering homogeneous products generally compete on price where a low-cost position generates

a competitive advantage. To capture the importance of product or quality differentiation, we

characterize industries by the degree of spending on research and development (R&D) and

advertising. In these industries, we might expect the value of quick decisions or adaptations to

local markets to be greater relative to industries with homogeneous products. If so, then we

should see stronger organizational responses to trade liberalization in firms operating in R&D

and advertising-intensive industries.

   To evaluate this, we classify firms as having a high R&D and advertising to sales ratio (where

high refers to above median) using two different sources. From Compustat, we measure the

average R&D plus advertising expenses over sales of the 4 digit SIC industry between 1986 and

1988. We also used an alternative measure based on the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC)

1975 Line of Business Survey (Kugler and Verhoogen, 2008). We report the results in the first 4

columns of Table 5. In columns 1 and 3 with depth as the dependent variable, we find a negative

and significant coefficient on the three-way interaction term (AvT89*Post89*High R&D+ADV).

This implies that for a given tariff reduction, firms in a high R&D and advertising industry will




                                                                                               32
reduce depth by more. Turning to division manager pay (columns 2 and 4), we find a positive

coefficient on the interaction term, although the coefficient is statistically significant only when

using the Compustat measure. These results suggest that firms in response to trade liberalization

delayer their hierarchies by moving DMs closer to the CEO and increase their pay, particularly if

they operate in R&D and advertising-intensive industries. They also highlight the fact that firms

change different organizational practices together, in a coordinated way. We interpret this

finding to be consistent with firms changing the way in which they make decisions either

through improved transmission of information or delegation of authority.

4.2.3   Changes in Costs and Firm Scope

   In the two sub-sections above, we present evidence that is generally consistent with firms

restructuring their organizations to alter the way in which decisions are made—either through

increased delegation or improved transmission of information. Let us now explore other potential

mechanisms. A simple explanation often provided for why firms reorganize is to downsize or cut

costs. Under this line of reasoning, firms delayer and eliminate managerial positions (i.e.,

division managers move closer to the CEO) primarily to cut costs -- the reorganization has little

to do with changes in how decisions are made. To evaluate this, we consider our pay results in a

different light. If the reorganizations were simply about cost-cutting, we would expect the level

of division manager pay to decline with the trade liberalization. We find the opposite. However,

these pay increases might be specific to division manager positions, and the firm may be

eliminating other senior manager positions and/or reducing their pay. To evaluate this, we focus

on the intermediary position between the CEO and the division manager for which we have some




                                                                                                 33
information: the group manager. These managers have multiple profit center responsibility and

are typically positioned between the CEO and the division manager.28

     In column 5 of Table 5, we regress the number of group positions in the firm on our

competition measure and include firm fixed effects and trends and control for firm size. We find

that the trade liberalization reduces the number of group managers (although not statistically

significant). So, there is some (weak) evidence of downsizing: firms are reducing the number of

group managers in the face of greater competition. But, to really shed light on the downsizing

explanation, we need to ask: what is happening to the pay of these group managers? If firms are

cutting costs, we would expect pay to be declining. Again, we find the opposite. In column 6, the

dependent variable is the logarithm of the total wage bill for the group positions (i.e., the number

of group managers * total compensation per group manager). We find a positive and statistically

significant coefficient suggesting that, while firms may be reducing the number of group

positions, they are increasing their average pay faster in industries facing more competition. This

is also at odds with cost-cutting. But, firms may also be cutting pay of other senior executive

positions. To address this, in column 7 we define the dependent variable as the logarithm of total

pay for a group of senior executive positions (CEO, group managers, division managers, CFO,

General Counsel, Head of Human Resources, and Head of Strategic Planning). We find that

trade liberalization has a positive and significant effect on the pay of this larger group of

executives. Since we do not observe labor costs for all senior management positions, it still could

be that firms eliminate and reduce pay of other positions. Never-the-less, the documented



28
  In the paper, we do not focus on the group manager position for several reasons. First, not all firms report them:
they are more likely to appear in larger, more diversified firms. Second, since group managers are defined on the
basis of their position in the hierarchy (proximity to CEO and COO), it is harder to infer facts about depth or
responsibility from their position. By contrast, division managers are defined on the basis of their responsibility, and
hence we can infer more about hierarchies from where they are placed.


                                                                                                                    34
increases in senior management pay in response to the trade liberalization are inconsistent with

the simple explanation of cost-cutting.

       Another explanation for some of the changes that we observe is that firms broaden their

scope. For example, firms may diversify into more businesses as the result of the liberalization –

maybe to diversify risk- and as a result span of control increases as the additional business unit

managers report directly to the CEO. We use the Herfindahl index of sales across different 2

digit segments, as an inverse measure of firm diversification, and find evidence against the

diversification story: multidivisional firms tend to decrease scope and focus their business

operations (become less diversified) in the presence of increased competition. Column 8 in Table

5 shows this result.

       Since many of these firms have multinational operations, and some are likely to have

Canadian subsidiaries before 1989, we tried to test whether their choice of being located in

Canada changed with the liberalization. If U.S. firms created Canadian subsidiaries because of

trade barriers, we might expect the benefits of local presence in Canada to disappear with freer

trade. Column 9 presents the results where the dependent variable is the number of Canadian

subsidiaries of the firm. We only have information for 1988 and 1993, and therefore rely on the

change between the two years. Even though we find a negative sign (firms for whom the

reduction in tariffs was greatest reduced the number of subsidiaries), it is not significant,29 so it is

hard to ascribe the main effect we find on depth and span to this explanation.

       These results are suggestive of firms responding in a variety of ways to the trade

liberalization. These include focusing on their core businesses and rationalizing the location of

their operations. The findings on flattening that we establish in this paper are possibly part of the

implementation of this new corporate strategy.
29
     This is consistent with the results in Feinberg and Keane (2001).


                                                                                                     35
5.      Conclusion

     Conventional wisdom and recent empirical evidence suggest that firm hierarchies are

flattening— hierarchies have fewer levels and broader spans of control. What are the possible

explanations for the flattening of firms? Do hierarchies flatten because of the adoption of

information technology, changes in work practices or managerial skill, or new plans for firm

strategy and shifts in business mix?       Many have argued that increased competition from

globalization has driven firms to search for new organizational forms to replace traditional

hierarchical structures. In this paper, we focus on this explanation.

     The main contribution of the paper is to establish a causal effect between increased foreign

competition measured by the trade liberalization between Canada and the U.S. and the flattening

of firms. We use a unique panel-dataset of organizational practices that allows us to identify our

results from variation within divisions and firms over time, and not from cross-sectional

differences. Since the trade liberalization was bilateral, it also implied a reduction in Canadian

tariffs on U.S. exports potentially leading to market expansion opportunities for our U.S. firms.

But, our findings suggest that it is increased competition that causes firms to reorganize rather

than greater market expansion opportunities.

     We find that U.S. firms in manufacturing industries more exposed to the trade liberalization

reduce the number of hierarchical levels, broaden the span of control for the CEO, and radically

change the structure of compensation of division managers with more incentives based on

division performance as well as on firm performance. Thus, the firms in our sample appear to

change a number of practices simultaneously following a shock to their economic environment

which is consistent with theories of complementarities in organizational practices. It is the




                                                                                               36
simultaneous change of these complementary practices that allows us to provide an interpretation

for the reasons behind firms’ choices.

   Our evidence suggests that firms may be fundamentally altering how decisions are being

made. While we do not directly observe changes in decision-making, the greater importance of

performance-based pay for division managers in conjunction with closer proximity to the CEO is

consistent with this interpretation. Moreover, stronger organizational responses by firms in R&D

and advertising-intensive industries—where firms compete through product differentiation--is

also consistent with changes in decision-making. To the extent that competition increases the

value of quick and responsive decision-making, firms can eliminate layers to improve the quality

and speed of the transmission of information or increase the authority of division managers to

become more adaptive to local information. Delegation is then accompanied by an increase in

local (division-based) incentives since these tend to be complementary practices. However, since

delegation and local incentives come at the cost of less coordination across divisions, firms also

raise the power of global incentives (based on total firm performance). Furthermore, the

broadening in the CEO’s span of control possibly enabled more accurate transmission of

information and a more important coordinating role for the CEO. Our findings are generally

consistent with this account of the evolution of complementary choices as a response to an

external shock.

   We also explore a number of other explanations for our results, the simplest one being cost-

cutting by firms. However, we find that pay of division managers (and other senior management

positions) increases in more competitive environments which seems at odds with the simple cost-

cutting explanation.




                                                                                               37
   Finally, we only identify one channel for the flattening of firms, and there are possibly many

others, such as the increased availability of IT. Moreover, firms may be responding to the new

competitive environment along other dimensions, with the changes in organization being

complementary. We find some evidence that, in response to competition, firms “refocus” on core

competencies and become less diversified. Further investigation of how organizational structure

interacts with other corporate responses and the overall impact of these changes on firm

performance is left for future research.

Notes: Std. Errors in brackets, clustered by industry (SIC4). All regressions include year dummies and the interaction of Post89 with US industry skill intensity, capital intensity
and TFP growth pre-89 to account for tariff endogeneity. Div Depth is the number of managers between the DM and the CEO. AvT89 (AvT94) is the average US tariff rate on
Canadian imports in 86-88 (90-93), by industry. Column 3 also includes the Canadian tariff on US exports. Column 6 uses weighted averages of tariffs on Canadian imports by
firm where the weights are the 1988 fractions of sales in the firm’s different segments; Column 7 restricts the sample to firms that do not change primary SIC; Change CEO is a
dummy variable indicating a CEO change; see notes to Table 1 for definition of other variables.

Notes: Std. Errors in brackets, clustered by industry (SIC4). All regressions include year dummies. All regressions also
include the interaction of Post89 with US industry skill intensity, capital intensity and TFP growth pre-89 to account for
tariff endogeneity (except col. 2 because these are not available for services industries). Div Depth is the number of
managers between the DM and the CEO. AvT89 is the average US tariff rate on Canadian imports in 86-88, by
industry. Exch.Rate*OriginImp.Pen is the bilateral Canada U.S. dollar exchange rate multiplied by the level of import
penetration of the industry in 1988, Source: IMF-IFS and Bernard et al. (2006) .Column 1 restricts the sample to firms
present in the sample as of 1988; col. 2 also includes services firms in the estimation, with AvT89=0; col. 3 includes
the interaction of the Canada-US exchange rate and the level of import penetration in the industry before 1989; col. 4
restricts the sample to firms that report zero Canadian subsidiaries in 1988; col. 5 restricts the sample to firms in
industries that had experienced at least 60% tariff reductions from their original level by 1994.

3. Complementarities in Organizational Design

      In Table S5 (below), we correlate the different practices in a regression framework, allowing
for division fixed effects, division trends, and controls for division and firm size.
      We find strong correlations between these variables. For example, each additional layer
between the CEO and the division manager is associated with a decrease in division manager
pay: a 7.2% decline in the logarithm of total compensation (column 1) and a 1.2% decline in the
share of long-term incentives to total compensation (column 2). Depth and span are also strongly
negatively correlated (columns 3 and 4). As firms move division managers closer to the top, the
span of the CEO increases. And, this is not a purely “mechanical” result. In column 4, we find
that depth is related to the number of DM positions that report to the CEO excluding the own
division (thereby removing the purely mechanical part of the correlation) as well as to the
number of senior functional positions that report directly to the CEO (such as the CFO, General
Counsel, Chief Information Officer, Head of Human Resources, etc.).
      With regard to pay and span, the results are more subtle (columns 5 through 8). While
division manager pay and incentives are positively related to the number of other division
managers reporting directly to the CEO, they are negatively related to the number of functional
managers reporting directly to the CEO. This suggests that division positioning in the hierarchy
and managerial pay are complements, but interestingly, that senior staff positioning and division
manager pay are substitutes. One plausible explanation for this finding is that when senior staff
managers report directly to the CEO and certain functions are centralized, their increase in
authority comes at the expense of division manager authority and job scope.
      In sum, the strong correlations found between CEO span of control, division depth and the
design of division manager compensation are consistent with the view that these organizational
choices are indeed complements. Moreover, the trade liberalization, as an exogenous shock to
the    environment,    triggered   a   series   of   organizational   changes   that    illustrate   the
complementarities.
