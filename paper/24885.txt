                                          ABSTRACT

Research on the effects of prenatal care on birth outcomes has produced a patchwork of findings
that are not easily summarized. Studies have used varying definitions of prenatal care, leading to
estimates that are difficult to compare. The identification of causal effects is particularly
challenging in this literature because women enter pregnancy with varying states of health,
resources and the desire to have a child and it is not feasible to conduct randomized controlled
trials that deny care. The content and quality of prenatal care can vary, even across individuals
initiating care at the same point in their pregnancies and with similar medical and psychosocial
issues. In this chapter, we review the literature on the effects of prenatal care on birth outcomes,
highlighting studies with strong research designs and plausible effect sizes. We reconcile the
findings to the extent possible, summarize what is known to date, and point to potentially fruitful
research directions going forward.

Introduction

        Prenatal care is one of the most frequently used forms of health care in the United States

(Schappert 1997; Kogan et al. 1998). This type of care involves a series of encounters during the

gestational period, educates women about pregnancy, monitors existing medical conditions, tests for

gestational health conditions, and refers expectant mothers to services such as support groups and

social services (March of Dimes 2009). Owing largely to expansions of Medicaid for pregnant women in

the late 1980s and early 1990s, prenatal care has become quasi‐universal in the U.S., with over 98% of

mothers giving birth in 2016 receiving at least some prenatal care. However, there is variation in the

timing of initiation of that care; e.g., about 23% of births in that same year occurred to mothers who

initiated care after the first trimester of pregnancy, with 4.6% of mothers initiating during the third

trimester of pregnancy. Rates of inadequate care, defined as prenatal care beginning after the fourth

month of pregnancy or having fewer than 50% of the recommended number of visits, are higher among

mothers who are young, low‐educated, and members of minority groups (Osterman and Martin 2018).

Additionally, rates of late and no care are higher among poor and unmarried mothers than among their

non‐poor and married counterparts (Pagnini and Reichman 2000).

        It is the received wisdom that prenatal care improves birth outcomes. In a widely cited 1985

report, the Institute of Medicine estimated that for every dollar spent on more adequate prenatal care

for low‐income, low‐educated women, total expenditures for the medical care of their low birthweight

infants during the first year of life would be reduced by $3.38; the savings were attributed to a prenatal

care‐induced reduction in the rate of low birthweight (Institute of Medicine 1988). That report was

based on a relatively weak evidence base; subsequent studies, which have generally been more

methodologically rigorous, have produced a much cloudier picture.

        In this paper, we review and synthesize the economics literature on the effects of prenatal care

on birth outcomes. We focus on the economics literature because those studies have generally used


                                                                                                             2
quasi‐experimental econometric techniques in an attempt to identify causal effects. We do not

systematically review the broader literature, which would be unwieldy. We do, however, report on

relevant studies in the broader literature that were based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs); those

studies focused on specific aspects of prenatal care—e.g., home visiting and group prenatal care. We

acknowledge that there may be some studies in the broader literature that use quasi‐experimental

methods at least as strong as some studies in the economics literature. We do not expect that the

exclusion of such studies would substantively alter our conclusions.

        We focus on studies that built on Michael Grossman’s work on the demand for health and

health production (Grossman 1972), which spawned the economics literature on prenatal care and birth

outcomes beginning with a study by Rosenzweig and Schultz in 1983 (Rosenzweig and Schultz 1983). We

used the EconLit database to identify original published research articles from 1983 to date (the writing

of this chapter) that estimated effects of prenatal care on birth outcomes in developed countries. All of

the studies that turned up in this search focused on the U.S; studies based on the “infant health

production” framework in other developed countries have focused on other prenatal inputs, including

smoking, that are more policy relevant (than prenatal care) in those contexts. The articles we reviewed

in the economics literature are summarized in Table 1. We also conducted a Medline search with the

following key words and no date limitations: prenatal care, pregnancy outcome, and “randomized

controlled trials as topic.” This search yielded several meta‐analyses, which we broadly summarize after

the more detailed review and synthesis of the economics literature.

        In the subsequent sections of this chapter, we provide definitions and context vis‐à‐vis prenatal

care and birth outcomes in the U.S.; present a generalized “infant health production function” model,

the theoretical framework used by economists to study the effects of prenatal care on infant health;

provide a review of the empirical studies using the infant health production framework to investigate

effects of prenatal care on infant health, briefly discuss the body of work using RCTs to evaluate specific


                                                                                                            3
features of prenatal care, and draw inferences about effect sizes to the extent possible; and conclude

with a section on what we have learned from this research and what still needs to be known.

Definitions and context

        In this section, we review how prenatal care and birth outcomes have been measured in

research studies and present relevant context vis‐à‐vis birth outcomes and prenatal care in the US.

Measuring prenatal care and birth outcomes

        Because prenatal care is a heterogeneous good, with educational, medical, and social work

components and specific packages of features (beyond basic screeners , tests, and guidance) tailored to

individual clients’ needs (at least, ideally), characterizing its use for quantitative analysis is not

straightforward. As a result, the measures used in population‐based research studies tend to be quite

crude and capture quantity rather than quality. Most studies focus on the timing of prenatal care

initiation (e.g., first trimester versus later care, month of pregnancy in which prenatal care was

initiated). Other studies consider the number of visits, either directly or in indices that incorporate

timing of initiation and number of visits in an attempt to capture prenatal care adequacy. The number of

visits alone can be a problematic indicator of prenatal care use because it conflates preventive care use

with medical need. The indices of prenatal care adequacy that have been used in research studies are

based on somewhat different standards and assumptions, but all combine information on timing of

initiation and number of visits (see Alexander and Kotelchuck 1996 for a critical review of the various

indices). As indicated earlier, randomized controlled studies have focused on specific aspects of prenatal

care—e.g., group prenatal care, home visits—that are much more easily characterized.

        An important consideration with the various measures of prenatal care is what the relevant

margin should be. For example, many studies consider whether the mother obtained prenatal care in

the first trimester of pregnancy (roughly during the first three months). The alternative is initiating

prenatal care any time after first trimester or not at all, and the estimates thus conflate effects for


                                                                                                            4
women with slightly delayed care with those for women with no care, which would have different

implications for the targeting of programmatic interventions. Continuous measures of prenatal care

(including days/weeks/months of prenatal care delay or number of visits) yield constant average

marginal effects, so that a one month delay, for example, has the same estimated effect on the birth

outcome whether the woman goes from a three month to a two month delay or an eight month to a

seven month delay, which is not necessarily the case. Another consideration is the reliance on self‐

reports of prenatal care in most studies, which can bias the estimates.

        The most common birth outcomes in research studies of the effectiveness of prenatal care are

birthweight (in grams) and low birthweight (less than 2500 grams, or about 5.5 pounds). For birthweight

in grams, average effects should be considered in light of the overall distribution of this outcome; e.g.,

increases in birthweight from 2000 to 2100 grams and from 3400 to 3500 grams may not have same

consequences for infant health. Low birthweight is a widely used and much studied marker of infant

health; it is a leading risk factor for infant mortality, and infants who survive are at elevated risk for

many long‐term health conditions and developmental disabilities. Some studies consider very low

birthweight (less than 1500 grams, or about 3.3 pounds), an extreme birthweight‐related outcome that

is associated with particularly adverse health and developmental outcomes. Birthweight is well

measured, reliably recorded, and readily available from vital statistics files and many other data sets.

Some studies consider gestational age‐related outcomes, generally distinguishing between preterm (less

than 37 weeks) and term (37 weeks or more) births. Some consider small‐for‐gestational age (SGA) or

growth retardation as an outcome; SGA infants are typically those in less than the 10th percentile in sex‐

specific birthweight for gestational age. All low birthweight babies are preterm or growth‐retarded (they

can be both), and virtually all very low birthweight babies are preterm.

        Finally, although birthweight measures are accurately reported and low birthweight is

correlated with subsequent morbidity and mortality, many infants who are low birthweight end up


                                                                                                             5
experiencing no subsequent health problems and some infants who are of normal weight at birth

experience significant morbidities. In this spirit, some studies used measures of neonatal mortality,

abnormal infant health conditions, and newborn hospital costs as outcomes.

Birth outcomes and prenatal care use in the U.S. in context.

        Figures 1 and 2 present trends in first trimester and late (third trimester or no) prenatal care,

respectively, in the U.S. from 1970 through 2003. Rates of first trimester care increased substantially

over the three decades, particularly during the 1990s. In 1970, about two thirds of births were to

mothers who initiated care in the first trimester of pregnancy. By 2003, after which changes in the

reporting of prenatal care made it impossible to derive a consistent time series, almost 85% of births

were to women who received first trimester care. During the same period, rates of late or no prenatal

care declined from about 8% of births to 3.5% of births. A major determinant of these trends was a

series of dramatic expansions in Medicaid eligibility for poor pregnant women during the late 1980s and

1990s (Currie and Gruber 1996).

        Figure 3 shows the percent of infants born low birthweight (weighing less than 2,500 grams) in

the U.S. from 1970 through 2015. Rates of low birthweight varied little over the 45 years because

numerous (often opposing) forces were at play, including increases in maternal age and education,

increases in women’s labor force participation, advances in reproductive technology, increases in

multiple births, increases in obesity, decreases in cigarette smoking, decreases in fetal mortality, and

changing demographics of the U.S. The rate of low birthweight in the U.S. was slightly higher in 2015

than in 1970, but because of all of the concurrent changes, the higher rate should not necessarily be

interpreted as a worsening problem. The rate of low birthweight is higher in the U.S. than in most other

developed countries—e.g., 8.1% in the U.S. compared to 6.7% among European Union countries in 2015

(OECD Family Database 2018), although there are some reporting inconsistencies across countries that

can distort such comparisons.

Economic framework

           The economic framework upon which the reviewed studies are based is derived from the

seminal work of Grossman (1972) on the demand for health and health production and focuses

specifically on the production of infant health. A simplified version of this model can be expressed as a

three‐equation system, wherein parents’ utility can be expressed as a function of consumption goods

(C), infant health (Hi), parents’ health (Hp), tastes, and any other relevant arguments as follows:1

           (1)     U=U (C, Hi, Hp, tastes)

Infant health is a function of prenatal inputs (which can be favorable, such as prenatal care, or adverse,

such as smoking or drug use) as well as the health endowment of the mother (which reflects Hp and

may affect her reproductive efficiency), as shown in the infant health production function that follows:

           (2)     Hi = f (input1, input2, ….inputn, maternal health endowment)

The demand for each input can be expressed as follows:

           (3)     Inputi = gi (price and availability of inputi, prices and availability of substitute and

                   complementary inputs, income, maternal health endowment, tastes, wantedness)

           Infant health is an argument in the parent's utility function (Equation 1), and the parents’ utility

maximization is constrained by the process underlying the production of infant health (Equation 2).

Wantedness reflects the relative importance of infant health versus other factors (e.g., the mother’s

own health) in the parent's utility function and therefore impacts prenatal input use (Equation 3) and

other investments in infant health that may be unobserved. Maternal health endowment enters the

infant health production directly (through biological processes) and may also affect infant health

indirectly through the use of prenatal inputs (e.g., mothers with poor health endowments may attempt

to offset an expected unfavorable birth outcome by utilizing more healthy inputs). Maternal risk‐taking

and time preference (taste for risky behaviors) affect maternal engagement in risky prenatal behaviors

    The model description is borrowed from Reichman et al. (2009).

                                                                                                                  7
(such as smoking and drug use) and investments in own health, which in turn can impact infant health

production directly through the maternal health endowment (Equation 2) or indirectly through the

maternal health endowment or other inputs (Equation 3).

         In the review and synthesis that follows, we focus on studies that specifically investigate the role

of prenatal care in producing infant health using the above framework (specifically, Equation 2).2 In our

review, we highlight studies that took the literature in new directions by applying different methods,

considering new outcomes or measures of prenatal care, or considering heterogeneous effects

according to sociodemographic or health‐related characteristics. A key methodological challenge in this

literature (and many others), often referred to as “endogeneity,” is that direct estimation of Equation 2

may produce biased estimates because the demand for prenatal care and other inputs may be

correlated with unobserved inputs or maternal characteristics that are associated with the infant health

outcome. As we discuss below, methods for addressing this issue have evolved over time in the

economics literature on infant health production. Because randomized controlled trials are considered

the gold standard in this regard, we also discuss the relatively limited literature outside of economics

that has investigated the effects of prenatal care on birth outcomes using RCTs.

Broad overview of literature

         Table 1 summarizes the 25 studies from the economics literature to date that explicitly focused

on identifying effects of prenatal care on birth outcomes or allowed for inferences to be made in that

regard. For each article, we indicate the measures of prenatal care and birth outcome(s) used, the data

source and type of data (e.g., aggregate, individual‐level), the broad methodology, and the findings,

which include estimated effects of prenatal care, as well as those of prenatal cigarette smoking when




2
 We also include two studies that estimated reduced form models that substituted specific determinants of
Equation 3 (i.e., indicators of availability of prenatal care) into Equation 2 in lieu of a measure of prenatal care use,
and separately estimated a version of Equation 3 that included these same indicators, allowing for inferences
about the effects of prenatal care on birth outcomes (Currie and Gruber 1996; Gray 2001).

                                                                                                                        8
considered in the same study, on birth outcomes. The smoking results provide useful context, as

prenatal smoking is the leading known preventable risk factor for poor birth outcomes (Cnattingius

2004; WHO 2013) and has been studied frequently in the economics literature, with fairly consistent

estimates across studies. The most consistent metric for prenatal smoking is birthweight in grams

associated with any smoking during pregnancy, and the estimates have been in the “few hundred

grams” range (reductions in birthweight attributed to smoking) across four decades of research with

evolving methodological sophistication (Corman, Dave and Reichman forthcoming), including a clinical

trial of a smoking cessation program directed at pregnant women (Hamilton 2001).

         The literature summarized in Table 1 has evolved in a number of ways. First, studies have

attempted to address the potential endogeneity of prenatal care in increasingly sophisticated ways,

most recently by exploiting relevant policy changes or events as exogenous sources of changes in

prenatal care. Second, studies have considered a widening set of prenatal care and birth outcome

measures. Third, studies have used a growing number of data sources. Fourth, studies have increasingly

considered heterogeneous effects, with some of the early studies stratifying by race and more recent

studies modeling differential effects of prenatal care across the maternal or infant health distribution.

        The first paper to apply the infant health production framework to investigate the effects of

prenatal care on birth outcomes was Rosenzweig and Schultz (1983). In addition to being the first study

to investigate the role of prenatal care in an infant health production framework, this paper was also

one of the first in the health production literature more broadly (which was not limited to mothers and

their infants) to acknowledge and attempt to address the potential endogeneity of health inputs. Using

data from the National Natality Followback Survey (1967–69), the authors identified four potentially

endogenous inputs—prenatal care delay, smoking, parity, and maternal age—and implemented two‐

stage models that first estimated all four inputs using a set of individual‐level and state‐or local area‐

level instrumental variables, including availability of hospital beds, family planning services, physicians,


                                                                                                               9
and obstetricians/gynecologists; health expenditures; milk and cigarette prices; and economic

characteristics. They then estimated models of birth outcomes (birthweight and birthweight for

gestational age) using the predicted values of the endogenous inputs. Under the identifying assumption

that these factors impact birthweight only through their effects on the endogenous inputs, and are

therefore uncorrelated with the error term in the structural infant health production function (empirical

specification of Equation 2), the two‐stage estimation would identify a consistent causal impact of the

inputs on infant health. Certain specifications of the authors’ two‐stage models (which we henceforth

refer to more generally as instrumental variables (IV) models, given the use of identifying variables for

exclusion restrictions) suggest a roughly 50 gram reduction in birthweight, on average, for each month

of care delay; these estimates were much larger than the corresponding Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)

estimates, which the authors suggested reflects adverse selection into early prenatal care (i.e.,

unobserved factors were associated with both worse birth outcomes and early care). In other

specifications, the authors found smaller or statistically insignificant estimated effects of prenatal care.3

        Corman, Joyce and Grossman (1987) contributed to this young literature by focusing on

neonatal mortality—an extreme marker of poor infant health—as an outcome and modeling race‐

specific effects. Unlike the Rosenzweig and Schultz study, which used individual‐level data, the authors

used county‐level data, which is useful for studying rare events such as neonatal mortality. They

considered prenatal care, abortion availability, and neonatal intensive care use as endogenous inputs in

IV models, and also considered potential pathways by estimating the effects of prenatal care, which

they characterized as percent receiving first trimester (versus late or no) care, with and without

controlling for low birthweight. They identified all of the endogenous inputs with area‐level measures of

female poverty and education; availability of neonatal care services, family planning services, and




3
  Rosenzweig and Schultz (1988) replicated these results with data from a later cohort, and found a somewhat
larger effect size of 91 grams in a linear two‐stage specification with similar identifiers.

                                                                                                               10
community health centers; and Medicaid availability and generosity. Their IV estimates suggest that a 1

percentage point increase in women who received first trimester prenatal care reduced neonatal

mortality by 1% for both blacks and whites. The IV estimates were twice those of the corresponding OLS

estimates for whites and four times the corresponding OLS estimates for blacks, again suggesting

adverse selection into early prenatal care.

        Grossman and Joyce (1990) addressed the issue of self‐selection of pregnant women into live

births (versus terminating their pregnancies), which could potentially bias the estimated effects of

prenatal care on birth outcomes, even in IV models. Using individual‐level birth data from New York City,

the authors included other health‐related inputs into their models (i.e. tobacco, alcohol and narcotic

use), but modeled only prenatal care as an endogenous input in IV models, using availability of abortion

providers and family planning clinics, poverty rates, individual‐level Medicaid use, and individual‐level

spontaneous and induced abortions to identify the sample selection model, and using prenatal care

clinic and WIC clinic availability, poverty rates in the health area districts, individual‐level parity, and

health insurance status plus the sample selection parameter (inverse of the Mills ratio, lambda, from the

selection model) as identifiers for prenatal care use. This was the first study to focus on one specific

endogenous input in the infant health production function and rigorously model the effect of that one

input. They found that each month of prenatal care delay led to decreases in birthweight that were

quite modest (4 to 37 grams, depending on specification and race) and that these IV estimates were 3–6

times larger than the corresponding OLS estimates.

        The empirical issues and difficulties in identifying the causal effects of prenatal care (and other

maternal inputs) on infant health were well‐recognized from the start, as evidenced by these early

studies’ attempts to address potential bias from unobserved heterogeneity and selection. Andrew Jones

(1991) encapsulated some of these and other econometric concerns, including collinearity of multiple

inputs, appropriate functional form, omitted variables and other sources of endogeneity, heterogeneous


                                                                                                               11
effects, and the importance of specifying a behavioral model to distinguish exogenous vs. choice

variables, within a study of low birthweight using aggregate state‐level data. He found some beneficial

effects of early (first trimester) prenatal care on the prevalence of low birthweight, though the effect

was marginally significant only for whites and relatively small in magnitude (a 10 percentage point

increase in births among women receiving early prenatal care was associated with a 0.18 percentage

point reduction in the prevalence of low birthweight infants).

        Frank et al. (1992) used aggregate county‐level data to estimate fixed‐effects models of effects

of first trimester care on race‐specific rates of low birthweight. State and year fixed effects allowed the

authors to control for variations in potentially confounding factors that varied by state and year. Their

models included measures of first trimester care, smoking, abortion, first birth, and income as inputs in

the production function. The findings from this study suggest that a 1 percentage point increase in first

trimester care led to reductions in low birthweight of 0.007 percentage points for white women and

0.018 percentage points for black women.

        Joyce (1994) introduced a new measure of prenatal care into this literature—levels of adequate,

intermediate, or inadequate care, based on the modified Kessner index. Focusing on birthweight as the

outcome, Joyce used individual‐level data on births in New York City to estimate IV models with health

insurance type, poverty rates, and availability of prenatal care clinics, family planning clinics, WIC

centers, and abortion providers as identifiers for adequacy of prenatal care. As in Grossman and Joyce,

this study also focused exclusively on prenatal care as the endogenous input in the infant health

production function. In his preferred model specification (IV models that treated prenatal care, but no

other inputs, as endogenous), he found that adequate (vs. inadequate) care led to increases in

birthweight of 170 grams for blacks, 287 grams for whites, and 249 grams for Hispanics. These effect

sizes were about 3 times higher than the corresponding OLS estimates for blacks and Hispanics and

about 43% higher for whites, suggesting adverse selection into adequate prenatal care. The direction of


                                                                                                            12
the selection bias was consistent with the patterns found by Rosenzweig and Schultz and by Grossman

and Joyce.

        Currie and Gruber (1996), Gray (2001), and Sonchak (2015) further focused on prenatal care as

an input using variations in Medicaid policies, which are arguably more exogenous and directly relevant

sources of identification than many of the identifiers used in previous studies. Currie and Gruber

estimated the effects of Medicaid eligibility expansions for pregnant women on state‐level rates of low

birthweight and infant mortality using IV models with measures of Medicaid eligibility rules as identifiers

for Medicaid eligibility. Using a separate data set, they found that the Medicaid expansions increased

the use of first trimester prenatal care by up to 47%, allowing for inferences to be drawn about the

effects of prenatal care on birth outcomes in the presence of a strong treatment. The authors found that

the increase of eligible women due to the Medicaid expansions (an increase of about 30 percentage

points) led to a 1.9% reduction in low birthweight and an 8.5% reduction in infant mortality. However,

most of the reduction in infant mortality appeared to be due to postnatal interventions rather than

prenatal care. Thus, the Medicaid expansions, which led to large increases in prenatal care use, had

relatively modest effects on low birthweight.

        Gray (2001) and, much later, Sonchak (2015) investigated the effects of Medicaid

reimbursement rates on birth outcomes, allowing inferences to be drawn about effects of prenatal care

on birth outcomes. Gray used individual‐level data from the 1988 National Maternal and Infant Health

Survey to estimate difference‐in‐differences models that controlled for unobserved state‐level

characteristics that may have been associated with both Medicaid reimbursement rates (which could

affect not only quantity but also quality of care) and birth outcomes. The author found that a 10%

increase in relative Medicaid fees led to about a one percentage point (2.1%) increase in use of first

trimester prenatal care, a 0.1 percentage point decrease (4.5%) in very low birthweight, a 0.4

percentage point decrease (3.8%) in low birthweight, and no significant changes in preterm birth or


                                                                                                         13
infant death among women on Medicaid. By inference, a one percentage point increase in first trimester

care led to the 0.1 and 0.4 percentage point decreases in very low birthweight and low birthweight,

respectively.

        Based on Gray’s finding that Medicaid reimbursement rates increased the use of prenatal care

using a single year of data, Sonchak expanded the sample and investigated the effects of reimbursement

rates on a range of measures of prenatal care utilization (number of visits, first trimester care, no

prenatal care, and the Kessner index of prenatal care adequacy) and a range of birth outcomes

(birthweight, low birthweight, gestational age, and preterm birth) using individual level data from 2001–

2010 U.S. birth records within an IV framework. Using state reimbursement rates as identifiers for

prenatal care visits, Sonchak found that additional prenatal visits increased birthweight for white

women with less than a high school education (including teens), but not for black women with less than

a high school education (including teens); for the former, one additional prenatal visit increased

birthweight by between 21 and 25 grams but had no significant effects on low birthweight, gestational

age, or preterm birth. In the first‐stage equation, she found that a 10% increase in reimbursement rates

increased prenatal visits by 0.11 for low‐educated black mothers and about 0.07 for low‐educated white

mothers (about 1% relative to the respective means). Among high school dropouts, there was some

evidence that higher reimbursement rates significantly decreased the likelihood of no prenatal care for

white mothers (but not black mothers), but there were no associations between reimbursement rates

and first trimester care or the Kessner index. For less disadvantaged samples, there were statistically

significant positive associations between reimbursement rates and the Kessner index for white and

black mothers with a high school education and for black mothers with a college education, as well as a

negative association between reimbursement rates and no prenatal care for black mothers with some

college education.




                                                                                                          14
        Reichman and Florio (1996) and Joyce (1999) investigated the effects of enhanced prenatal care

programs for women on Medicaid that provided more intensive (higher quality) services compared to

standard Medicaid prenatal care. Reichman and Florio focused on New Jersey’s HealthStart program,

which included an increased number of prenatal visits, increased provider reimbursement, case

coordination, integrated health support services, case managers, and community outreach. They used

linked birth/death and hospital discharge records for Medicaid births in New Jersey in 1989 and 1990

and estimated OLS and IV models that used numbers of HealthStart providers in the woman's residence

city at least six months before she gave birth as identifiers for HealthStart participation.

        Econometric tests suggested that the OLS estimates were not biased. In their OLS models, the

authors found that enriched prenatal care (compared to standard Medicaid prenatal care) increased

birthweight by 55.7 grams, decreased low birthweight by 3.7 percentage points, decreased very low

birthweight by .9 percentage points, and decreased newborn hospitalization costs by 6.9% for black

women, but had no effects on any of these outcomes for white women. Of the 55.7 gram improvement

in birthweight, 5–15 grams could be explained by prenatal care delay and the rest was attributed to the

program itself, which could have involved the increased number of prenatal care visits or its other

features. In addition, because the program made other services (such as the Special Supplemental

Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children) more available than they would be through

standard Medicaid prenatal care (through intensive case management) , the favorable effects of

prenatal care found in this study could potentially reflect effects of services other than prenatal medical

care.

        Joyce studied the effects of the New York State Prenatal Care Assistance Program (PCAP), which

was similar to New Jersey HealthStart program, using linked Medicaid and birth records from New York

City for 1989–1991. He estimated both OLS and IV models, with the latter using proxies for the growth in

PCAP providers as a result of the state’s expansion in Medicaid eligibility (in January 1990) as identifiers


                                                                                                          15
for PCAP participation. In OLS models, PCAP (compared to standard Medicaid prenatal care) was found

to increase birthweight by 33–83 grams (depending on year and subsample), decrease low birthweight

by 1.5–3.7 percentage points, and decrease very low birthweight by 0.4 to 1.3 percentage points. The IV

estimates were insignificant and not robust, suggesting that the expansion in PCAP participation had

relatively little impact on birth outcomes. Notably, while Reichman and Florio found significant effects

only for black women in their study of enhanced care under New Jersey’s HealthStart program, Joyce did

not estimate race‐specific models in his study of the PCAP program in New York City.

        Abrevaya (2001), Conway and Deb (2005), and Abrevaya and Dahl (2008) looked beyond

average treatment effects and considered heterogeneity in the effects of prenatal care on birth

outcomes by the health of the mother during pregnancy (Conway and Deb) and along the birthweight

distribution (Abrevaya 2001, Abrevaya and Dahl 2008). Using U.S. birth records from 1992 and 1996 and

estimating quantile regressions, Abrevaya found that the impact of prenatal care varied substantially

across the distribution of birthweight, and that the average effect estimated by OLS masked this

considerable heterogeneity. Specifically, he found that no prenatal care (compared to first trimester

care) reduced birthweight by 389 grams for those in lowest decile of the birthweight distribution, with

monotonically declining effects at higher points in the distribution ranging in effect sizes from 100 to

200 grams; in comparison, the OLS estimate indicated a 194 gram reduction in birthweight. Other

trimesters of care (compared to first) had small and inconsistently‐signed effects on birthweight. While

Abrevaya did not account for the endogeneity of prenatal care, the results from this study underscore

that prenatal care may have very different effects depending on the course of the pregnancy and that

the most beneficial effects may be concentrated among births most at risk for adverse birth outcomes.

        Conway and Deb used data from the 1988 National Maternal and Infant Health Survey and

estimated finite mixture models to assess heterogeneity in the causal effect of prenatal care on

birthweight. Unlike Abrevaya, the authors addressed the endogeneity of prenatal care (measured as


                                                                                                           16
weeks of care delay), drawing on earlier studies and using cohabitation status, income, insurance status,

state‐level healthcare price index, and population density as identifiers. They drew attention to the

potential misspecification that arises under the standard assumption (implicit in much of the prior work)

that all births are drawn from the same distribution. Departing from this approach, Conway and Deb

employed a two‐class finite mixture model, wherein the observed birthweight distribution was

assumed to be a “mixture” of two latent classes, or separate distributions, consisting of

“normal” and “complicated” pregnancies. While the latent factors determining the two

distributions were unobserved, the classes were characterized ex post using observed

characteristics. The latent class of “normal” pregnancies included about 86–87% of all births

and had a mean birthweight of 3158 and 3360 grams (for black and white mothers,

respectively), while the latent class of “complicated” pregnancies included about 13–14% of all

births and had a mean birthweight in the very low birthweight range (1200 grams for white

mothers and 1079 grams for black mothers). The authors found that one week of prenatal care

delay led to a 30–35 gram reduction in birthweight for “normal” pregnancies (this finding was robust

across model specifications) and no effects of prenatal care on “complicated” pregnancies. These

findings underscore the importance of considering medical risk of mothers when assessing the effects of

prenatal care. That is, prenatal care may appear to be ineffective when a sample includes complicated

pregnancies that may be relatively unaffected by prenatal care. However, these findings are not

necessarily compatible with those of Abrevaya , who found larger effects for infants with lower

birthweights (which could reflect mothers’ higher medical risk). This apparent disparity in findings may

reflect the treatment of the endogeneity of prenatal care or the different approaches to modeling the

heterogeneity. While quantile regression methods identify heterogeneity specifically across the

outcome (in this case, birthweight) distribution, finite mixture models do not fully capture this source of



                                                                                                         17
heterogeneity (e.g., while the latent class denoted “normal pregnancies” had a mean birthweight of

3200–3400 grams, this class could have included some births that are low birthweight).

        Abrevaya and Dahl (2008) expanded this line of inquiry even further by not only allowing the

effect of prenatal care to vary depending on the point in the birthweight distribution, but also by

considering differential effects by trimester of care. Using birth records from Washington State and

Arizona between 1992 and 2002 and estimating quantile regressions, they found that no prenatal care

reduced birthweight by 323 grams at the 10th percentile of birthweight, had no significant effects at the

25th to 90th percentiles, and increased birthweight by 271 grams at the 90th percentile of birthweight.

Extending Abrevaya (2001), which had also applied quantile regression methods to assess differential

responses but with cross‐sectional data and not addressing unobserved selection, this study used linked

data on newborns and mothers to control for unobserved heterogeneity by embedding correlated

random effects (at the level of the mother) within the quantile regression framework. This study also

found a counter‐intuitive result that third trimester care (versus first trimester care) increased

birthweight by 62 to 72 grams at the 10th and 25th percentiles of birthweight (but had no effects at

higher percentiles).

        Evans and Lien (2005) exploited what economists often refer to as a “natural experiment” – a

random shock that, in this case, had the potential to limit prenatal care. Specifically, the authors used

birth records from Allegheny County, PA from 1990–1994 to investigate the effects of the number of

prenatal care visits on birthweight and gestational age by exploiting plausibly exogenous variation in

care as a result of a bus strike in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Based on reduced visits associated with the

strike, they inferred that the number of prenatal visits did not significantly affect birthweight for all

pregnant women. However, they found some suggestive evidence of an effect size of 57 grams for

women early in their pregnancies (i.e., one less prenatal care visit led to a 57 gram reduction in




                                                                                                            18
birthweight, suggesting that one more prenatal care visit increased birthweight by 57 grams in this

group).

          Reichman et al. (2009) used a unique and rich data source that allowed them to include many

typically unobserved but theoretically important variables that affect the demand for prenatal care in

OLS models of the production of infant health, including wantedness of the child and detailed measures

of the mothers’ prenatal physical and mental health. The data were from the Fragile Families and Child

Wellbeing (FFCWB) study of U.S. urban births in 1998–2000, from which individual‐level postpartum

survey records were linked to the mothers’ and infants’ medical records from the birth hospitalization.

The survey data included rich sociodemographic measures for both mothers and fathers, including

religious attendance, non‐marital cohabitation, and length of parents’ relationship, and the medical

record module included detailed information from the mother’s prenatal care records and the infants’

newborn records. The FFCWB study oversampled non‐marital births by design in order to study a policy‐

relevant population, whereas administrative birth records (which were used in many of the previously

discussed studies) are available for all births in the U.S. However, the sociodemographic information is

much more limited in birth records than in the FFCWB and the medical information in birth records has

low rates of accuracy (Reichman and Hade 2001). The authors found, using self‐reports of first trimester

care from the mother’s postpartum survey, that first trimester prenatal care (versus later than first

trimester care) increased birthweight by about 50 grams, reduced low birthweight by 2 percentage

points, and reduced abnormal infant health conditions (a composite measure coded by a professional

from the newborns’ medical charts) by 3 percentage points. However, they found no effects of first

trimester care on any of the birth outcomes using information on the timing of initiation of prenatal care

from the medical records, which represents the gold standard source of such information.

          Finally, we now consider the broader literature that has used RCTs in developed countries. We

focus on meta‐analyses, all of which focus on specific aspects of prenatal care. Withholding standard


                                                                                                         19
care would not be ethical, and there are therefore no published RCT studies focusing on timing of

prenatal care initiation. Blondel and Breart (1995) reviewed eight RCTs that evaluated the effects of

prenatal home visits and found no reductions in preterm birth. Carter et al. (2016) reviewed four studies

comparing group versus standard prenatal care, and found no differences in preterm birth or neonatal

intensive care admissions, while Lathrop (2013) reviewed three studies and found that group prenatal

care (versus standard prenatal care) increased gestational age. Dowswell et al. (2018) covered four

studies that investigated effects of a reduced‐visits regimen and did not find compelling evidence that

fewer visits increased the risk of preterm birth, small‐for‐gestational age, or low birthweight. Similarly,

Carroli et al (2001) reviewed seven studies and found no effects of reduced visits on low birthweight.

Finally, Fiscella (1995) reviewed eleven RCTs that evaluated the effects of enhanced (quantitatively and

qualitatively more intensive) prenatal care on gestational age, birthweight, preterm birth, low

birthweight, and small‐for‐gestational age, and found no statistically significant improvements in birth

outcomes with the receipt of enhanced care. However, many of the studies in the Fiscella review, which

covered a variety of years, settings, programs, and populations, were limited by a lack of statistical

power. Overall, the available evidence from RCTs indicates small effects of variations in prenatal care

visits and enhanced services on birth outcomes.

Effect magnitudes

        It is difficult to compare estimates of the effects of prenatal care on birth outcomes across

existing studies because they often used different measures of prenatal care and considered different

birth outcomes. Even studies that seemingly should produce similar estimates often produce widely

divergent findings. For example, two of the major studies used the same measures of prenatal care

(months of delay) and infant health (birthweight) and studied older cohorts produced different

estimates. Rosenzweig and Schultz (1988) found that each month of prenatal care delay reduced

birthweight by about 91 grams, while Grossman and Joyce (1990) found that each month of care delay


                                                                                                           20
reduced birthweight ‐37 grams (this was significant) for blacks and ‐23 grams (this was insignificant) for

whites. Effect magnitudes also often diverged even within the same study, depending on functional

form or estimation method (Rosenzweig and Schultz 1988). Both of these studies found evidence of

unobserved heterogeneity in prenatal care use.

        Below, we condense the literature in Table 1 to provide ranges of magnitudes of effects of

prenatal care on birth outcomes. We focus on input and outcome combinations for which there are at

least two studies and, when there are several estimates, exclude those that are clearly outliers. Of the

25 studies we reviewed, many also estimated the effects of prenatal smoking, the leading known

modifiable risk factor for adverse birth outcomes, and those findings are presented in Table 1. The

average effect of smoking (some measured as smoking at all, others estimating effects of smoking a

pack per day) across the studies that also focused on smoking was about 160 to 230 grams in

birthweight, which corresponds to a 5 to 7% decrease. Only one study (Reichman et al. 2009) estimated

effects of both prenatal care and smoking at the individual level, and that study found that smoking

during pregnancy reduced low birthweight by 5–7 percentage points, while first trimester care did not

increase birthweight using their preferred measure of first trimester care (from medical records) and by

2 percentage points using self‐reported first trimester care (which the authors argued was likely an

overestimate). The estimated effects of prenatal smoking on birthweight are less variable than those of

prenatal care on birthweight, and the average effect sizes are much larger—providing useful context for

interpreting the practical significance of the effect sizes for prenatal care on that outcome.

       First trimester care (versus not first trimester care) on low birthweight: Estimates varied from

        no effect to (perhaps) a 1 to 3.8% decrease.

       Prenatal care delay (months) on birthweight in grams: This was the combination with the

        greatest variability in estimates, which ranged from no effect to about 130 to 150 grams for




                                                                                                           21
        each month of delay; the more recent studies indicate a narrower range of 0 to about 40 grams

        for each month of delay. These estimates are generally trivial compared to those for smoking.

       Number of prenatal care visits on birthweight: Estimates range from no effect to 46 grams per

        visit. The recommended number of prenatal visits for an uncomplicated pregnancy is about 15

        (American Academy of Pediatrics/ American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists 2012).

        For a healthy pregnancy, a one‐month delay in the first 6 months of pregnancy would result in

        one fewer visit. Thus, the range of estimates here appears to be at odds with the bulk of the

        evidence on the effects of prenatal care delay on birthweight (synthesized above), with

        estimates of the effect of a one‐month delay on birthweight in the triple digits.

       Effects across the distribution of infant health outcomes: This literature is still in its infancy,

        and the results are too inconsistent to draw any conclusions.

       Effects of enriched prenatal care: The two studies that focused on Medicaid enhanced prenatal

        care programs compared to standard Medicaid prenatal care found modest increases in average

        birthweight and more sizable reductions in low birthweight (on the order of 1.5 to 3.7

        percentage points for some sub‐samples) and very low birthweight (0.4 to 1.3 percentage

        points). Reichman and Florio (1996) estimated that only a small fraction of the effects appeared

        to be due to decreased prenatal care delay and inferred that it was other aspects of the

        enhanced prenatal care program that explained the observed effects.

       Effects of first trimester care on neonatal mortality: Zero to about 1–2% reduction.

Discussion

        This review indicates that the effects of prenatal care on birth outcomes are modest. Existing

studies used a variety of different measures, techniques, and samples, producing estimates that are not

straightforward to compare. That said, studies in the 1990s and beyond generally found smaller effect

sizes than were found by Rosenzweig and Schultz for an earlier (pre‐Medicaid expansion) cohort. It is


                                                                                                              22
plausible that the effects of prenatal care on birth outcomes changed over time (i.e., as prenatal care

became more widely used as a result of the Medicaid eligibility expansions in the 1980s, the effects on

birth outcomes may have become smaller as women most likely to benefit gained access to care). Rous

et al. (2004) found some suggestive evidence of concavity and diminishing returns in the effects of

prenatal care visits on birthweight. Figure 1 showed that about 8% of infants born in the U.S. in 1970

(close to the Rosenzweig and Schultz cohort) had mothers who initiated prenatal care after the second

trimester of pregnancy, while the corresponding figure in 1999 was about 4%—representing a decrease

of 50 percent.

        Studies that included multiple endogenous inputs (e.g., Rosenzweig and Schultz 1983, Li and

Poirier 2003a&b) and that had more ambitious modeling strategies tended to produce estimates that

were the largest but not robust with respect to specification or alternative measures. For example, the

finding in the Rosenzweig and Schultz study of a 52 gram reduction in birthweight for each month of

prenatal care delay was based on a Cobb‐Douglas production function, while a translog functional form

indicated no significant effects. Li and Poirier (2003b), which estimated a simultaneous equations model

with seven endogenous variables, found that first trimester care increased birthweight by 505 grams,

which is enormous compared to all other estimates, and had less dramatic effects on gestational age.

Studies that exploited variations in policies or natural experiments (e.g. Medicaid expansions, variations

in Medicaid fees, a bus strike) tended to find smaller effects than earlier studies that relied on a host of

state‐level and/or individual‐level instrumental variables. This difference in effect magnitudes may

partly reflect differences in the populations studied, differences in the margins being affected, and how

well the two match up within studies. For example, with multiple state‐ and individual‐level instruments,

it is unclear who the compliers are that are identifying the effect, which “local average treatment effect”

or margin is being estimated, and how this margin compares with those being captured in studies that

exploit policy variation or natural experiments. In addition, the choice of IVs and exclusion restrictions in


                                                                                                           23
the early studies, as well as in later studies that considered multiple endogenous inputs, was often

questionable and possibly contributed to some of the inconsistencies across estimates.

        The issue of self‐reporting bias for prenatal care is very consequential for estimating the effects

of prenatal care but has been largely ignored in the literature. Validation studies have shown that

prenatal care use is over‐reported in birth records (e.g., Reichman and Hade 2001). Only three of the 25

non‐RCT studies we reviewed constructed measures of prenatal care from medical records, and

comparisons of estimates using self‐reported prenatal care versus prenatal care use from medical

records in these studies indicated significant and moderate “effects” of prenatal care on birth outcomes

only when using self‐reported prenatal care. That is, when using measures of prenatal care from medical

records, considered the “gold standard” source for prenatal care information, no significant effects of

prenatal care on birth outcomes were apparent.

        Heterogeneity of effects may be important, but such variations have not been sufficiently

explored to allow for generalized inferences. For example, several of the studies found differential

effects of prenatal care on birth outcomes by race and ethnicity, but patterns were inconsistent across

studies. In addition, average effects across the population of births may not always be meaningful—e.g.,

for birthweight as an outcome. For example, Sonchak (2015), which was based on millions of births,

found that an additional prenatal visit increased birthweight by about 23 grams, or 0.6%, which is trivial

compared to the estimates in the literature for prenatal smoking; however, that average effect may

mask substantively important effects at critical margins. In this vein, the few studies that investigated

effects of prenatal care on infant health across the (maternal or child) health distribution have produced

seemingly conflicting results. Abrevaya and Dahl (2008) found a large (323 gram) negative effect of no

prenatal care (compared to first trimester care) for infants in the lowest 10% of the birthweight

distribution, but that initiating care in the second or third trimester (versus first trimester) increased

birthweight by 27–63 grams. Conway and Deb (2005) found seemingly opposite results—that prenatal


                                                                                                             24
care improved birthweight for a latent class of “normal” pregnancies, which have a higher likelihood of

being full‐term and resulting in normal birthweight births, and the magnitude of their estimate suggests

that first trimester care increased birthweight by 390 to 455 grams. In contrast, and seemingly more

consistent with the findings of Abrevaya and Dahl, Mukhopadhyay and Wendel (2008) found that

prenatal visits had a favorable effects on infant health (proxied by newborn hospital costs) for women

with pre‐existing health conditions.

        Although the effects of prenatal care appear to be modest, it is important to consider the scope

of prenatal care more broadly. First, the quality of prenatal care may be more important than the

quantity. The Reichman and Florio (1996) study of augmented Medicaid prenatal care (versus standard

Medicaid prenatal care), which included an increased number of visits, increased provider

reimbursement, case coordination, integrated health support services, case managers, and community

outreach, found some evidence of improvements in birth outcomes above and beyond what could

plausibly be attributed to the timing of care initiation (although the effects could potentially reflect the

increased number of visits). The effects were concentrated among black mothers and may reflect the

integrated support, case coordination, and case management features of the program, which perhaps

reduced stress from dealing with discrimination in the healthcare system as described anecdotally in a

recent New York Times article on black infant mortality (Villarosa 2018). Additionally, prenatal care may

operate through indirect channels, wherein greater or more intensive contact between expectant

mothers and health care providers could lead to decreases (increases) in health‐compromising (health‐

promoting) behaviors such as smoking or better diet and nutrition. For example, it appears that some of

the favorable effect of enhanced prenatal care on birth outcomes in the Reichman and Florio study

reflected referrals to the WIC program (Reichman and Teitler 2003). Of note, if changes in health

behaviors are a mechanism through which prenatal care improves birth outcomes, then studies that




                                                                                                           25
control for prenatal behaviors may underestimate the effects of prenatal care on infant health

outcomes (depending on the timing of the measurement of the behaviors).

        Second, prenatal care may be “too little too late” to improve birth outcomes for some women,

who may enter pregnancy with a host of physical, mental, and psychosocial problems, the effects of

which cannot be addressed within the confines of a pregnancy. Women’s pre‐pregnancy mental and

physical health are important predictors of birth outcomes above and beyond pregnancy‐related health

(Almond, Currie, and Herrmann 2012; Reichman et al. 2009), suggesting that healthcare access and

quality for women of reproductive age (and even young girls) is a more promising strategy than prenatal

care for improving infant health. Furthermore, the availability of abortion services also appears to be an

important predictor of infant health (e.g., Corman, Joyce and Grossman 1988; Joyce and Grossman

1990, Walker and Wallace 1998), suggesting the importance of access to family planning services—

ideally as part of comprehensive and multifaceted health care. In other words, prenatal care should not

start at conception.

        Third, prenatal care may have beneficial effects not necessarily reflected in measures of

birthweight or gestational age. Most of the studies reviewed here focused on birthweight‐ or gestational

age‐related outcomes. Although birthweight is a widely used and well‐measured index of subsequent

morbidity, it is not a direct measure of infant health. That is, many low birthweight children have no

serious health problems (Reichman 2005) and not being low birthweight is no guarantee of favorable

health status at birth. Thus, it is possible that using birthweight or low birthweight to proxy infant health

can lead to incorrect inferences about the effects of prenatal care on infant health. Reichman et al.

(2009) complemented birthweight outcomes with a direct measure of infant morbidity and found

similar results vis‐à‐vis the effects of first trimester care (i.e., no effects using prenatal care from medical

records), which was validating. Additionally, as pointed out by Grossman (2017) and others, prenatal




                                                                                                             26
care could identify high‐risk deliveries and refer those women to deliver in hospitals with high‐level

neonatology, reducing neonatal deaths and morbidities.

        Fourth, prenatal care can have beneficial effects not necessarily reflected in infant health.

Reichman et al. (2010), using a multi‐pronged approach to address the potential endogeneity of the

timing of prenatal care, found that first trimester prenatal care led to decreased maternal postpartum

smoking, increased use of well‐baby care, and possibly increased breastfeeding, which can favorably

impact child health, and Teitler et al. (2012) found that late or inadequate prenatal care was associated

with short subsequent birth intervals, which are associated with adverse perinatal outcomes. That said,

Noonan et al. (2011), using rich linked survey and medical data, found no associations between prenatal

care and four markers of child health at age 5—maternal‐reported health status, asthma diagnosis,

overweight, and height. Conway and Kutinova (2006) found that receiving early and adequate prenatal

care led mothers to maintain a healthy postpartum weight and may have reduced lengthy maternal

birth hospitalizations. Finally, benefits of prenatal care may take generations to become apparent. For

example, Miller and Wherry (forthcoming) found that the expansions of Medicaid coverage for pregnant

women and infants led to lower rates of chronic conditions and fewer hospitalizations related to

diabetes and obesity among individuals who gained access to coverage in utero and during infancy.

        Overall, although we conclude that the estimated effects of prenatal care on birth outcomes are

modest at best, we argue that the question being asked may be too narrow. Implications that arise from

this review and synthesis are that more attention should be paid to the characterization of infant health,

characterization of the content and quality of prenatal care, potential heterogeneous effects, potential

indirect effects, potential long‐term effects, spillover effects (i.e., on mothers and their subsequent

children), effects of pre‐conceptional and lifetime care, and intergenerational effects.
