                                                ABSTRACT

This paper explores two broad questions on collaboration between individuals. First, we investigate
what personal characteristics affect people’s desire to work together. Second, given the influence
of these personal characteristics, we analyze whether this attraction enhances or detracts from performance.
Addressing these problems in the venture capital syndication setting, we show that venture capitalists
exhibit strong detrimental homophily in their co-investment decisions. We find that individual venture
capitalists choose to collaborate with other venture capitalists for both ability-based characteristics
(e.g., whether both individuals in a dyad obtained a degree from a top university) and affinity-based
characteristics (e.g., whether individuals in a pair share the same ethnic background, attended the same
school, or worked for the same employer previously). Moreover, frequent collaborators in syndication
are those venture capitalists who display a high level of mutual affinity. We find that while collaborating
for ability-based characteristics enhances investment performance, collaborating for affinity-based
characteristics dramatically reduces the probability of investment success. A variety of tests show
that the cost of affinity is not driven by selection into inferior deals; the effect is most likely attributable
to poor decision-making by high-affinity syndicates post investment. Taken together, our results suggest
that non-ability-based “birds-of-a-feather-flock-together” effects in collaboration can be costly.

                                          1. Introduction

        People collaborate with each other in different settings. Construction of the Panama

Canal and group hunting of mammoths are independent examples of mutually beneficial
cooperation. Collaboration enables groups to achieve what cannot be accomplished as a result

of a solely individual effort. Joint work can also increase the efficiency of individual production

as in the celebrated example of the multi-stage production of pins. The division of labor, which

such collaborations entail, drives economic progress and great productivity (Smith, 1776). In

spite of the tremendous importance of collaborations, we lack a complete understanding of how

people select their future working partners and whether there are any economic implications of

different selection strategies.

        In this paper, we explore two related questions on collaboration using the venture capital

industry as the laboratory. First, we ask what personal characteristics influence individuals’
desires to work together in venture capital syndication. Second, given the influence of these

personal characteristics, we ask whether this attraction enhances or detracts from investment

performance. We find that people are more likely to collaborate with those who share similar

characteristics with them.        Such similarities can be divided into two broad classes–those

characteristics related to ability (e.g., whether both individuals in a dyad obtained a degree

from a top university) and those characteristics related not to ability but, instead, to affinity
(e.g., whether individuals in a pair share the same ethnic background, attended the same school,

or worked for the same employer previously).          We find that individual venture capitalists

collaborate with other venture capitalists for both ability- and affinity-based characteristics.

We then show how ability-based and affinity-based similarities between members of a group

affect its performance.    In particular, collaborating for ability-based characteristics enhances

investment performance while collaborating for affinity-based characteristics dramatically

reduces investment returns.

        The tendency of individuals to associate, interact, and bond with others who possess

similar characteristics and backgrounds has long been viewed as the organizing basis of networks
(e.g., McPherson et al., 2001). The principle of homophily shapes group formation and social

connection in a wide variety of settings, such as school, work, marriage, and friendship, in which

                                                  1
similarity between dyad or group members is observed across a broad range of characteristics

including ethnicity, age, gender, class, education, social status, organizational role, etc.   For

example, positive assortative mating along observable inheritable traits (e.g., intelligence, race,

and height) discussed by Becker (1973) in the context of a marriage market can be viewed as

the micro foundation of homophily in which choosing a partner with similar characteristics

increases the certainty about the quality of one’s offspring.     Currarini et al. (2009) provide

theoretical foundations for the pattern of homophily in social networks using a search-based

model of friendship formation and conclude that biases towards same-types in both individual

preferences and the matching processes affect pairing outcomes.

       Despite growing evidence that people do indeed tend to partner with similar individuals,

the success implications of this bias remain unclear.         One conjecture is that the more

characteristics a pair of individuals has in common, the better performance the dyad is likely to

demonstrate.   This better performance may result from easier communication, the ability to

better convey tacit information, or the ability to make joint decisions in a timely and productive
manner (e.g., Ingram and Roberts, 2000; McPherson et al., 2001; Cohen et al., 2008; Gompers

and Xuan, 2010). Moreover, homophilic selection based on ability-related characteristics can

lead to the formation of high-ability pairs that demonstrate superior performance.

       On the other hand, however, homophily may induce social conformity and groupthink

that may lead to inefficient decision making (e.g., Asch, 1951; Janis, 1982; Ishii and Xuan, 2010).

Individuals in homophilic relationships often have an enhanced desire for unanimity and ignore,

or insufficiently consider, the disadvantages of the favored decision as well as the advice from

experts outside the group. Furthermore, individuals may lower the expected return hurdle and

due diligence standards on a project (consciously or unconsciously) for the opportunity to work

with similar others because they derive personal utility from the collaboration. Consequently,

under an alternative hypothesis, collaborations based on characteristics unrelated to ability

might suffer from a “cost of friendship” and induce a negative relationship between affinity-

based similarities and performance.

       We test these hypotheses in the venture capital syndication setting, analyzing individual

venture capitalists’ selection of co-investment partners in syndicated deals as well as the


                                                2
associated performance implications. Venture capital syndication is an important and common

mechanism for venture capital investors to diversify their portfolios, accumulate and share

resources and expertise, and reduce asymmetric information concerning portfolio companies (e.g.,

Lerner, 1994; Hochberg et al., 2011). Although extant studies on syndication largely focus on

the characteristics of the partnership at the venture capital firm level (e.g., firm reputation and

investment scope), investment in venture capital is typically individual-led.              The individual

venture capitalist pursuing and initiating an investment in a portfolio company (the founding

investor) normally identifies other individuals at different venture capital firms with whom he or
she may wish to collaborate on this particular deal. In other words, consistent with the idea of

venture capitalists competing with each other for investment opportunities (Gompers and

Lerner, 2000), it is natural to think of a follow-on investor as being chosen by the founding
investor from a pool of potential co-investors. Both the founding and follow-on investors usually

serve on the board of directors of the portfolio company, representing the interests of their

respective venture capital firms and seeking to maximize the return on their investment.

Depending on the performance of the portfolio companies and the market conditions, venture

capitalists may use a variety of exit strategies, ranging from initial public offerings (IPO) to the

sale of shares back to the entrepreneurs or strategic investors. Although there are examples of
successful exits by venture capitalists by means of mergers and acquisitions, the consensus in the

industry and academia is that an exit via IPO is the best indicator of investment success, in

which venture capitalists achieve not only the highest returns but also wide recognition for their
abilities.1 The individual-led nature of the venture capital investing and syndication process,

the availability of rich biographic information on individual venture capitalists, the existence of

frequent collaborations between these individuals aiming for the same goal and making decisions

the outcome of which have significant economic consequences for the decision-makers, and a

clear-cut measure of success together make venture capital syndication an ideal platform to

study the factors that influence individuals’ choices to work together and the accompanying

value implications.

1
  Prior research indicates that the return to venture investing is primarily driven by the small fraction of
investments that goes public (Venture Economics, 1988). Similarly, Gompers (1996) demonstrates that
venture capital firms are able to more easily raise new funds after exiting a portfolio company via an IPO.

                                                     3
       Using a novel dataset of 3,510 individual venture capitalists investing into 11,895

portfolio companies from 1975 to 2003, we first examine the selection of co-investment partners

on syndicated deals. In particular, we are interested in determining a set of pairwise personal

characteristics based on which people are attracted to work with each other. For each venture

capitalist, we hand-collect detailed biographic information including gender, ethnicity,

educational background, and employment history.          To assess how these various personal

characteristics affect the likelihood of collaborations between individual venture capitalists, for

each pair of actual venture capitalist partners in syndication, we construct a plausible set of

counterfactual pairs each consisting of the actual founding partner and a potential follow-on

partner that was available for syndication but who was not selected by the founding venture

capitalist that originated the deal. We find that individual venture capitalists are more likely to

collaborate with others who possess similar characteristics and backgrounds. For example, two

venture capitalists that both hold degrees from top universities (potentially indicating high

ability) are 8.5% more likely to co-invest together than individuals not similar in terms of being
graduates of top academic institutions. An even stronger effect is documented with respect to

non-ability-related, affinity-based characteristics. A pair of venture capitalists who graduated

from the same university are 20.5% more likely to partner on a deal, and even more strikingly,

the probability of collaboration between two individual venture capitalists increases by 22.8% if

they are part of the same ethnic minority group. Partnership is also more likely to happen if

the two venture capitalists worked at the same company earlier in their careers. These results

on syndication decision represent strong evidence of homophilic selection in collaboration.

       We then examine how ability-based and affinity-based similarities between members of a

venture capitalist dyad affect its performance by assessing the outcomes of the portfolio

companies in which the pair has co-invested. We find that the investment performance of a

venture capital dyad improves with the number of top school degree holders in the pair. The

first top degree holder in a pair increases the chance of its portfolio company going public by 9%;

the second top degree holder further increases the chance of success significantly by 11%.

Therefore, the decision of a top university graduate to syndicate with a venture capitalist who

also holds a degree from a top school does enhance investment returns.           To the contrary,


                                                4
similarities between venture capitalists based on affinity-related characteristics worsen the

performance of a syndication dyad. Specifically, the probability of a successful exit outcome

decreases by 18% if two venture capitalists who previously worked at the same company partner

up in the syndication. The likelihood of success drops by 22% if co-investors attended the same

undergraduate school.     The negative effect of affinity is even stronger when it relates to

ethnicity.   Collaboration with someone from the same ethnic minority group comes at the

expense of a 25% reduction in performance.

       We further explore the impact of similarities between collaborators on performance using

ability and affinity scores. We construct the simple-average ability score of a pair of venture

capitalists as the average of pairwise ability characteristics (measures indicating whether both

members of the pair hold top school degrees). The weighted-average ability score of a pair of

venture capitalists is the dot product of a vector of pairwise ability characteristics and a vector

of estimated coefficients on these characteristics in the syndication decision regression.      The

simple-average and weighted-average affinity scores are similarly constructed over the set of
pairwise affinity characteristics (measures indicating whether members of the pair are of the

same gender, in the same minority ethnic group, attended the same school, or previously worked

for the same employer).       The weighted-average ability and affinity scores are essentially

weighted measures of how alike the two venture capitalists in the dyad are in terms of ability

and affinity characteristics, respectively, with the weights representing how important each

similarity characteristic is in determining the collaboration decision.     When we examine the

relationship between these aggregate similarity scores and investment performance, we again

find that the more alike the partnering venture capitalists are in affinity-related characteristics,

the less likely their investment outcome is ultimately successful. We also find that the affinity

score of a pair of venture capitalists is significantly and positively related to the total number of

syndicated deals on which the pair collaborates. Therefore, affinity-based similarity not only

determines people’s attractions to work together for the first time, but also increases their

frequency of repeated collaborations.




                                                 5
       Finally, we account for the potentially endogenous determination of the syndicate’s level

of affinity depending on the underlying investment quality of a deal and confirm the robustness

of results using a variety of tests. Although high-affinity venture capitalists do indeed pursue

joint opportunities of lower investment appeal at the time financing, the analysis shows that the

contribution of this effect to the empirical biases documented in the paper is at most weak. The

most likely source of the cost of affinity is a treatment effect, in particular, poor decision-making

by venture capitalists post investment.

       To illustrate the effects of ability- and affinity-based similarities on the syndication

decision and investment performance, consider as an example from our data the co-investment

pattern of Mr. A through the lens of his background. Mr. A lived in Israel before moving to the

U.S. for school, and graduated from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).             He was

actively involved in the Jewish communities in the U.S.           During his career as a venture

capitalist at venture capital firm Z, Mr. A co-invested on fourteen deals from 1984 to 2001. An

MIT graduate, Mr. A co-invested on eleven deals with at least one other venture capitalist
having a degree from a top school. Out of these eleven deals, two deals also have syndication

teams characterized by the Jewish ethnicity commonality.            In the remaining three of the

fourteen co-investments, Mr. A’s syndication partners are characterized by similar ethnical

background only: they are all Jewish. Mr. A is a very successful venture capitalist: four of the

fourteen deals resulted in a portfolio company going public and are classified as successful in our

analysis; all of these four deals are syndications based on ability but not affinity.

       The fourteen deals are represented in a two-by-two matrix in Table 1, in which each

dimension stands for the type of syndication: ability-based or affinity-based.2 Consistent with
the homophily bias of founders selecting a working partner possessing similar characteristics, Mr.

A had no joint investments with venture capitalists that he is unlikely to associate himself with

either based on ability or affinity. Moreover, all successful deals feature a venture capital team

with only ability-related characteristics in common. There is not a single successful deal among

affinity-based co-investments.    The unconditional success ratio of Mr. A is 28.6% (4/14);

 A co-investment may be both ability- and affinity-based if a venture capitalist has both ability and
affinity similarities with the co-investment partners.

                                                  6
conditional on the co-investment being ability-based and not affinity-based, his success ratio

increases to 44.4% (4/9), whereas conditioned on affinity-based syndications, the success ratio

drops to 0% (0/5).       This illustrates the negative effect of affinity-based similarities within a

syndication dyad on its performance.

          The findings of this paper relate to several literatures.       First, we contribute to the

growing evidence that preferences for homophily strongly affect the composition of working

groups.     In the venture capital context, for example, Bengtsson and Hsu (2010) show that

startup founders are more likely to be matched with partners at VC firms similar in terms of

ethnicity and education.

          The second literature studies the success implications of social ties.        According to

Hochberg, Ljungqvist, and Lu (2007), better-networked VC firms demonstrate significantly

better performance.        However, the evidence on the connection between the success and

composition of venture capital working groups remains mixed.                  Data limitations leave

researchers with no choice but to measure the extent to which a syndicate is homogenous at a
firm level. The breadth of our data makes it possible to identify partners directly involved in

each particular deal arming us with a relevant and precise measure of syndicate-specific

homogeneity. This increases our ability to make inference about the relationship between team

composition and its success.

          Third, we make a methodological contribution with respect to distinguishing between

two drivers of venture capital returns: selecting better deals vs. adding value to a portfolio

company post-investment. Tian (2012) demonstrates superior performance of entrepreneurial

firms backed by a venture capital syndicate and uses the Heckman (1979) selection model and

an instrumental variable approach to control for the fact that syndication may not be exogenous.

Sorensen (2007) overcomes endogeneity problems in estimating the outcome equation by

developing a two-sided matching model which controls for the sorting between portfolio

companies and venture capitalists — more promising entrepreneurial firms get funding from

investors with higher relative rankings.3 We implement the instrumental variable approach, the
Heckman two-step procedure and design a novel method which involves assessing the quality of

3
    This method is analogous to the Heckman (1979) two-stage procedure.

                                                    7
the portfolio company at the time of investment using portfolio company characteristics and

examining the relationship between this ex ante quality measure and the affinity level in a

syndicate.

       Fourth, our paper relates to the literature on the venture capitalists' ability to add value.

We demonstrate that investment outcomes are explained by observable characteristics of co-

investment partners controlling for the selection bias. Since the composition of a VC syndicate

matters for the success of a portfolio company, we indirectly document the ability of venture

capitalists to add value. Brander, Amit, and Antweiler (2002) argue that if the key reason for

syndication were the enhanced ability to select better portfolio companies, we would have seen

the formation of most syndicates on projects with ambiguous investment prospects. This is not

what we observe in practice, since syndicated ventures return more than standalone investment

projects.    Tian (2012) demonstrates that VC syndication creates both product market value

(e.g., better operating performance and more patents) and financial market value (e.g., more

successful exits, lower IPO underpricing, and higher valuation) for entrepreneurial firms.4
       The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the data and the

construction of variables used in the analysis.       Empirical results are presented in Section 3.

Section 4 investigates whether the cost of affinity on investment performance is attributed to

selection or treatment effects. Section 5 concludes.

                                      2.1. Sources of Data

       The data used in this paper is derived from several different sources. We start with

VentureSource, a database that contains detailed information on venture capital investments.

For each portfolio company, VentureSource reports the identities of the venture capital firms

and individual venture capitalists that invested in the company as well as the date of each

investment.

       For each individual venture capitalist in the data, we hand-collect through web searches,

SEC filings, and news articles a broad range of biographic information including past career

track, education history, and gender. For prior job histories, we record companies at which an

individual had worked in the past.        The education array includes data on the academic

institutions at which individuals obtained their academic degrees as well as the types of degrees:

undergraduate, postgraduate non-business (Ph.D., M.S., J.D., and M.D.), or postgraduate

business (MBA).     To determine whether an individual holds a degree from a top academic

institution, we classify as top universities the Ivy League schools (Brown University, Columbia

University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, Harvard University, Princeton University,

University of Pennsylvania, and Yale University) as well as other top U.S. schools (Amherst

College, California Institute of Technology, Duke University, MIT, Northwestern University,

Stanford University, University of California, Berkeley, University of Chicago, and Williams

College).5

       Venture capitalists’ genders are determined based on their first names. In the cases of

unisex names, we determine gender by reading news articles and web pages mentioning or

containing pictures of the individual venture capitalists.6 As for ethnical background, we use

the name-matching algorithm developed by Kerr and Lincoln (2010) to determine the most

likely ethnicities of venture capitalists based on their last names. Individual venture capitalists

are classified into five non-overlapping ethnic groups: East Asians, Indian, Jewish, Middle

Eastern, and all others. Although the limitation of the name-matching algorithm does not allow

us to identify all possible ethnicities such as African American, the groups that the algorithm

has been shown to successfully identify capture the most active ethnic minority groups in the

venture capital industry, and all have a strong sense of cultural identity.7




5
  The results presented in the paper are robust to classifying only the Ivy League universities as top
schools as well as to adding top European universities (Cambridge University, INSEAD, London Business
School, London School of Economics, and Oxford University) to the list of top schools. See Appendix
Table 1 for more information.
6
  Despite our best effort, we cannot determine the gender of 27 venture capitalists in our sample.
7
  We use the information on the country/geographic region of a venture capitalist’s undergraduate
academic institution to determine ethnicity when the name-matching algorithm fails to do so.

                                                  9
        We determine the investment outcome using VentureSource and Thomson Financial’s

SDC database, supplemented by Thomson Financial’s VentureXpert database. Although there

are examples of successful investments which did not result in IPOs, public floatation of a

portfolio company is the cleanest signal of the venture’s success. 8 We therefore consider an

investment to be successful if and only if it results in the IPO of the portfolio company. Finally,
we use the Pratt’s Guide to Private Equity and Venture Capital Sources to manually code the

locations of venture capital firm offices at the Combined Statistical Area (CSA) level and the

Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) level where a CSA is not available.

                                            2.2. Variables
        The data are used to construct two sets of variables: individual and pairwise. Individual

variables include personal characteristics of a venture capitalist that are fixed over time such as
education, ethnicity, and gender dummy variables.             The education dummy variables Top

College, Top Business School, Top Graduate School, and Top School equal one if a venture
capitalist holds, respectively, an undergraduate, business, graduate, or any degree from a top

university and zero otherwise. Ethnic Minority takes the value of one if a venture capitalist is

East Asian, Indian, Jewish or Middle Eastern. Dummy variables East Asian, Indian, Jewish

and Middle Eastern pin down a venture capitalist’s ethnicity; the dummy variable Female
identifies an individual’s gender.

        Also included in the personal characteristics of a venture capitalist is a metric that

changes with each additional deal completed and measures his or her success up to the current

deal. The variable Performance measures the venture capitalist’s success ratio up to the current

deal, defined as the total number of successful investments made before the current investment

divided by the sum of the total number of investments.9 An investment is counted as successful
even if the portfolio company did not go public before the date at which the Performance

variable is evaluated. Venture capitalists may correctly predict the outcome of a successful deal


8
  For example, in our data, the ambiguity of an acquisition as an indicator of success is evidenced by the
40% of investments that exited via acquisition.
9
  For the first deal of a venture capitalist–when there is no investment track record by construction–the
Performance variable is set equal to 0. Our results are robust to dropping such observations from
specifications that rely on Performance as an explanatory variable.

                                                   10
long before the portfolio company sells its shares in a public offering. 10 In addition, the IPO

preparation itself normally takes at least six months, and the decision to conduct an IPO is
made even earlier. All results in the paper are robust to using an ex ante performance metric,

i.e., if we include in our calculation of Performance only deals which had gone public prior to

the date of the current deal.
        We then construct pairs of individual venture capital investors that co-invested on

syndicated deals. For each deal, we use the investment dates to determine founding venture

capitalists, who are defined as the earliest investors in the deal, and follow-on investors, who

participate in subsequent rounds.11 Consistent with the idea that founding investors initiate and

lead the deal and make decisions to bring follow-on investors on board, we focus on pairs of

venture capitalists in which at least one member of the dyad is a founding investor. We focus
on the first co-investment between two individual venture capitalists since the decision to

collaborate for the first time is not colored by confounding factors such as experience of past

collaborations and allows us to better isolate the impact of personal characteristics similarities in
driving partnership decisions.12

        For each pair of individual venture capital investors in the sample, two groups of

pairwise variables are constructed based on the individual variables. The first group uses the
qualifiers At Least One and Both. Values of such dummy variables depend on the number of

venture capitalists in a dyad that possess a given characteristic. For example, Top School: Both

takes the value of one if both venture capitalists in a pair hold degrees from top universities and

zero otherwise; Female: At Least One equals one if there is either one or two female venture

capitalists in a dyad and zero otherwise.

   The financial success of Facebook, for example, had enabled its early-stage investors (e.g., Accel and the
Founders Fund) to label it as a successful investment long before the company officially announced its
IPO plans in February 2012.
11
   We also consider venture capitalists who invested within a 100-day period after the first investment
date recorded founding investors to account for the possibility that the short interval between reported
dates may be due to different reporting practices at different venture capital firms even though they
invested in the same round. Our results are robust to considering only the venture capitalist with the
earliest investment date or to using a different window (e.g., 30 days) to determine the founding investor.
12
   Our results are robust to including all pairs (first-time and repeated syndications) in the sample. First-
time syndication pairs constitute about 93% of all pairs; the rest 7% are repeated collaboration pairs. We
analyze these repeated collaborations in Section 3.4.

                                                     11
       A separate group of pairwise variables are constructed using the qualifier Same. Same

School equals one if the pair of venture capitalists attended the same academic institution and
zero otherwise. Same College, Same Business School and Same Grad School are defined in a

similar way but impose a requirement on obtaining degrees of the same type. Same Ethnic

Minority equals one if both venture capitalists in a dyad are part of the same ethnic minority
group and zero otherwise. Same Previous Employer is a dummy variable equal to one if two

venture capitalists worked at the same company earlier in their careers and zero otherwise. We

also define a dummy variable Same Location that equals one if the venture capitalists’ firms are
located in the same CSA and zero otherwise.

       Our sample consists of 3,510 venture capitalists that invested into 11,895 different

portfolio companies from 1975 to 2003.       The distribution of their personal characteristics is

summarized in Table 2. 3,382 of these venture capitalists have co-invested at least once with

another venture capitalist in the sample. The pairwise data set contains 17,473 collaborations

between a pair of venture capitalists partnering for the first time.

                             2.3. Counterfactual Syndication Pairs
       In order to understand which factors lead to the establishment of collaborations between

people, we construct a plausible set of potential partners that were available for syndication at
the time when a founding venture capitalist partnered with a different co-investor. This set of

counterfactual partners allows us to construct counterfactual pairs, essentially, a control group,

which, when contrasted with the set of actual pairs, enables us to assess the significance of
various personal characteristics in determining the likelihood of collaborations between people.

Central to the construction of the set of counterfactual partners and pairs, therefore, are the

assumptions on what makes a partner “available for syndication at the time of co-investment

but not selected by the founding investor”, i.e., counterfactual.

       For each actual pair of venture capitalists syndicating on a deal, we generate all possible

counterfactual, or pseudo, pairs by letting the founding venture capitalist “choose” a
counterfactual partner that satisfies the following three criteria.     First, the counterfactual

partner and the founding investor must be from different venture capital firms. Second, the

counterfactual partner must have invested in the same industry within 30 days of the actual co-

                                                 12
investment between the founding venture capitalist and the actual follow-on partner.13 Third,

the counterfactual partner must not have ever co-invested with the founding venture capitalist.
The overall universe of counterfactual syndication pairs thus generated has roughly 2,000,000

pairs. We then draw a stratified random sample of 50,000 pairs controlling for the marginal

distribution of pairs by year and industry as our sample of counterfactual pairs. Our results are

robust to alternative methodologies for constructing the counterfactual syndication pairs,

including, for example, further requiring the counterfactual partner to come from the same firm

as the actual follow-on partner, or requiring four randomly chosen matched pseudo pairs for

each actual pair in the sample of counterfactual pairs. The condition for the counterfactual

partner to come from the same firm as the actual partner is a strong one and acknowledges that

the venture capital firm selected as a syndicate partner may have a special expertise relevant for
the deal.     The results being qualitatively and quantitatively similar under different

methodologies indicate that personal characteristics of a pair of individual venture capitalists are

of the first-order importance for predicting the likelihood of syndication as well as the

investment outcome.


                                     3. Empirical Results

       In this section we report empirical results of three major blocks of our analysis. First,
we are interested in determining the set of personal characteristics that affect the performance

of an individual venture capitalist.       Second, we examine interactions between personal

characteristics of two individuals and establish their impact on the likelihood of a pair working

together. Third, we study the performance implications of different kinds of similarities between

venture capitalists co-investing together. We use probit regressions to fit models with binary

dependent variables–whether an investment outcome is considered successful (in the first and
third blocks) and whether a pair of venture capitalists actually collaborate in syndication (in the

second block).    We cluster robust standard errors by portfolio company because different

individual venture capitalists and syndicates that invest into the same portfolio company share



13
  If there were no other deals in the same industry within a 30-day window, we expand the window to
180 days.

                                                13
the same realization of a random investment outcome as a dependent variable.               Portfolio

company’s industry and year of investment fixed effects are included in every specification to

capture differences in syndication patterns and in the investment success across different sectors

and over time.14 In addition, we analyze repeated collaborations between venture capitalists and

explore differences in pairwise characteristics between individuals that partner with each other
once and those who collaborate more frequently. Each of these analyses is discussed in turn.

                                     3.1. Individual Success
       The results of the analysis of individual success characteristics are presented in Table 3.

The unit of analysis is person-investment, where person is an individual venture capitalist. We

find that individual performance is persistent which is reflected in the positive and significant

effect of past investment success on the current deal’s success. Holding a degree from a top
academic institution also matters. For example, controlling for past performance, graduating

from a top college or getting an MBA from a top business school increases the likelihood of

investment success by 1.2 and 2.0 percentage points, respectively.       Given the overall sample
fraction of successful investments at 17.7%, these marginal effects are economically significant

and are equivalent to an increase of the probability of a favorable outcome by 6.8% and 11.3%,

respectively. Holding any degree from a top academic institution is a stronger and more precise
signal of individual ability than holding a particular kind of degree from a top university: the

point estimate of the Top School dummy variable is the largest among other ability parameters

and corresponds to a 14.1% boost of the probability of success.             Ethnicity and gender

characteristics do not consistently have any significant effect on individual performance. This

justifies the distinction between ability variables, which positively affect individual success, and

affinity variables, which are not ability-related and have no relationship with individual

performance.

                             3.2. Syndication Partnering Decision
       We then explore the determinants of collaboration between people. Regression results

are summarized in Table 4.      The unit of analysis is a pair of venture capitalists, actual or

14
  See Appendix Table 2 for a summary of the total number of deals and the number of successful deals
over time and across industries.

                                                14
counterfactual. If the syndication pair is counterfactual, the dependent variable takes the value

of zero; if venture capitalists in a dyad are actual collaborators on a syndicated deal, the

dependent variable takes the value of one.

        In specifications 1 to 6, we explore the explanatory power of three groups of pairwise

variables, school rank, same school, and same ethnicity, in isolation; fully specified models are

reported in columns 7 and 8.         We find strong support for the homophily-driven choice of

working partners.     Most ability- and affinity-based pairwise characteristics have positive and

significant point estimates. For example, two venture capitalists both holding degrees from top

universities are more likely to work together by 2.2 percentage points (Column 2), or by 8.5%

relative to the unconditional sample probability of collaboration.15 Finer classification of the

schools (Columns 1 and 7) suggests that syndication based on similar top ability characteristics

seems to be largely driven by top business school graduates.

        An even stronger effect is observed with respect to affinity-based characteristics.

Getting a degree from the same school increases the likelihood of two venture capitalists

working together by 20.5% (Column 4).             Adding a restriction on the shared educational

background to be of the same type further raises the chances of collaboration between a pair of

individuals with such commonalities. For example, venture capitalists who attended the same

undergraduate school are 42.5% more likely to co-invest (Column 3).                   Furthermore, the

likelihood of two individuals partnering is 22.8% higher if both belong to the same ethnic

minority group (Column 6).        The contributions of different ethnic groups are uneven.            For
example, East Asian venture capitalists display the greatest tendency to collaborate with

investors of the same ethnicity.      To be specific, a partnership between two randomly drawn

venture capitalists that are both East Asian is 74.5% more likely to happen. If both individuals

in a pair are either Indian or Jewish, the probability of them co-investing together increases by



15
  The unconditional sample probability of cooperation is approximately 25.9%. This can be calculated
from the number of actual syndication pairs and the number of counterfactual syndication pairs used in
the regression. The number of actual syndication pairs and the number of counterfactual syndication
pairs as inputs to the regressions are, respectively, 17,473 and 50,000. The number of observations in the
regressions reported in Table 4 is less than 67,473, because gender information on 27 individual venture
capitalists is missing. As a result, 153 actual and 432 counterfactual pairs have the variable Both Female
unidentified.

                                                   15
52.1% and 18.9%, respectively (Column 5).16 All these effects remain strong and significant in

the fully specified models in Columns 7 and 8.
        Venture capitalists also exhibit a strong preference to partner with individuals with

whom they share prior job histories. Having at least one common past employer increases the

probability of two people investing together by 64% (Column 7).               In addition, location also

matters.    Venture capitalists are much more likely to collaborate with each other if the

companies at which they work have offices in the same CSA.17

        Finally, gender is another characteristic based on which homophily may potentially come
into play. We do not find a significant effect on the Female: Both parameter, likely because

there is not a sufficient number of co-investments on which women work together to estimate

the coefficient more precisely.18
        Overall, our results on syndication partnering decisions show that individual venture

capitalists are more likely to collaborate with others who possess similar characteristics and

backgrounds, whether these characteristics are related to ability or not. The effects of these

similarities on collaboration likelihood are highly significant, both statistically and economically.

                        3.3. Investment Success: Pairwise Characteristics
        Having found strong evidence for homophily in the syndication patterns of venture
capitalists, we next explore whether there are success implications of these biases.               Table 5

presents the estimation results. The unit of analysis is an actual pair of venture capitalists that

partnered on a syndicated deal.          We regress the investment outcome (a dummy variable

indicating success) on a set of pairwise individual characteristics. Some pairwise characteristics

are represented by two dummy variables with qualifiers At Least One and Both. The purpose

of having two types of variables is to understand whether a characteristic has an additive



16
   Specifications do not include a dummy variable that captures the effect of two Middle Eastern investors
working on a deal together. There are 15 Middle Eastern venture capitalists in the data. The number of
deals on which they invest together is insufficient to estimate the effect of sharing the Middle Eastern
ethnicity on the syndication decision. Hence, we omit the variable Middle Eastern: Both in all
specifications.
17
   Chen et al. (2010) study implications of distance between entrepreneurs and venture capitalists.
18
   The vast majority of venture capitalists in the dataset are male. 219 female venture capitalists invested
in 1,314 different portfolio companies, resulting in only 81 actual pairs of both female investors.

                                                    16
impact on success or whether it only matters if both individuals in a pair share it. We establish

two main results.

       First, ability characteristics have a positive additive effect on the co-investment success.

Having an extra person with a degree from a top school in a pair of venture capitalists

consistently increases its chances of success on the investment. The unconditional success rate

of venture capital syndicates is 21.0%.      As reflected in columns 4 to 6, the first top degree

holder increases the probability of success by approximately 9%, while the second top degree

holder gives an additional 11% boost.        Similar to our results on individual success factors,

holding any degree from the top school–without considering college, business and graduate

school degrees separately–seems to more precisely indicate a person’s ability.            Our results

indicate that collaborating for ability-based characteristics improves investment performance.

       On the contrary, collaborating for affinity-based characteristics severely worsens the

performance of a syndication dyad. In particular, syndication between venture capitalists who

are part of the same ethnic minority group or who worked at the same company in the past
have lower chances of success. For example, former co-workers have an 18% lower probability

of investment success when they co-invest with each other. Attending the same undergraduate

school is even more detrimental. Syndicate partners with degrees from the same college exhibit

a 22% lower success rate. 19 The cost of affinity is even greater for venture capitalists with

similar ethnic backgrounds.       Being part of the same ethnic minority group reduces the

probability of success by 25%. The effect is not evenly distributed across underlying ethnicities.

East Asian investors collaborating with each other exhibit the largest cost of affinity, 63%.

When two Jewish venture capitalists partner on a deal, the probability of investment success

drops by 20%. It is important to note that none of the affinity variables with a qualifier At
Least One is significant.    It is not the presence of an ethnic minority investor that drives

underperformance. Indeed, Table 3 shows that individual’s ethnicity is not related to success.



19
  The insignificance of the estimated coefficient on Same School suggests that the cost of affinity is
amplified when two individuals have the highest likelihood of actually knowing each other and/or
associating with each other based on the educational experience of the same type (e.g., undergraduate).
The point estimate on Same College also displays the highest magnitude in the syndication partnering
decision model presented in Table 4.

                                                  17
Investment success is negatively affected when two investors being part of the same ethnic

minority group partner on a deal.
       We    have   thus   established   a   dichotomy   between    ability-   and   affinity-related

characteristics. On one hand, people display greater inclination to work with similar others.

Similarities may be in terms of ability (e.g., whether individuals hold degrees from top academic

institutions) or affinity (e.g., whether individuals share the same ethnic background). On the

other hand, these two sets of pairwise characteristics affect performance in opposite ways.

Teams with more able participants are more likely to result in a successful investment outcome.

On the contrary, investments are more likely to fail when groups are formed based upon

similarities between members along characteristics having nothing to do with ability.

       We bring the analysis one step further by introducing ability and affinity scores. We
construct the simple-average ability score of a pair of venture capitalists as the average of

pairwise ability characteristics (measures indicating whether both members of the pair hold top

school degrees). We construct the weighted-average ability score as the dot product of a vector

of pairwise ability characteristics and a vector of estimated coefficients on these characteristics

in the syndication decision regression, the marginal effects of which are reported in Table 4.

The simple-average and weighted-average affinity scores are similarly constructed over the set of
pairwise affinity characteristics (measures indicating whether members of the pair are of the

same gender, in the same minority ethnic group, attended the same school, or previously worked

for the same employer). The weighted-average ability and affinity scores of a pair of venture

capitalists are essentially weighted measures of how alike the two venture capitalists in the dyad

are in terms of ability and affinity characteristics, respectively, with the weights representing

how important each characteristic similarity is in determining the syndication partnering

decision.

       The ability and affinity scores thus constructed can be used as aggregate independent

variables to explain the investment success of the syndication dyad. Results of the analysis at
the syndication pair level are presented in Table 6. Using these aggregate scores to measure

similarities between members of a pair, we again find that the more alike the partnering venture




                                                18
capitalists are in affinity-related characteristics, the less likely their investment outcome is

successful.

                                  3.4. Repeated Collaborations
        Our analysis so far examines only first-time co-investments made by pairs of venture

capitalists. In this section we supplement the analysis by considering the total number of co-
investments a pair of venture capitalists makes together.        In particular, we explore whether

aggregate measures of ability- and affinity-based similarities between individuals–proxied by

the ability and affinity scores–can be used to predict the total number of collaborations in

which a pair of individuals engage.

        We run Poisson regressions of the total number of co-investments by a syndicate on the

ability and affinity scores. Estimation results are presented in Table 7, with Columns 1 and 2

using simple-average scores and Columns 3 and 4 using weighted-average scores.              Results in

Columns 1 and 3 are based on the analysis over both actual and counterfactual pairs, whereas

results in Columns 2 and 4 are derived solely from actual pairs.            Counterfactual pairs, by
definition, have zero collaboration together. Since the distinction–in terms of pairwise personal

characteristics–between counterfactual and actual pairs is sharper than the difference between

actual pairs with unequal number of collaborations, Columns 1 and 3 bear estimates of greater

magnitudes.     The number of co-investments–among actual and counterfactual pairs–is

positively and significantly related to affinity scores.    Any positive relationship between the

number of co-investments a pair of venture capitalists made together and their ability score,

however, seems to be entirely driven by the contrast between counterfactual pairs with zero

collaborated deals and those pairs collaborating at least once. Among actual pairs only, we find

positive relationship only between the affinity score and the number of co-investments. This

pattern is captured in Figure 1, which presents the average values of ability and affinity scores

for dyads of venture capitalists grouped by the number of co-investments they make together.20
Collaborating individuals have both greater ability and affinity scores than non-collaborating

individuals. Frequency of collaborations–among actual syndicates–does not seem to be related


20
 Figure 1 and tables that follow are based on the simple-average ability and affinity scores. Using the
weighted-average ability and affinity scores generates similar patterns.

                                                  19
to the ability score. It is, however, increasing in the affinity score. Therefore, affinity-based

similarity not only determines people’s attractions to work together for the first time, but also

increases their frequency of repeated collaborations.


                               4. Selection versus Treatment

       Inferior performance of investments undertaken by venture capitalists with a high level

of affinity between them may be attributed either to selection or treatment effects. On the one

hand, collaboration with similar others may have value in itself.        In this case, a venture

capitalist may derive personal utility from the collaboration and consciously reduce the hurdle

rate if making the investment involves future cooperation with a syndicate partner sharing

common features. As a result, syndications based on affinity will have lower probabilities of

success because of less stringent requirements on portfolio companies at the time of investment.
Alternatively, it is possible that affinity makes it easier for one venture capitalist to convince

another that the investment is worthwhile. Consequently, if the attractiveness of an investment

opportunity is questionable and hence it is hard for a founding venture capitalist to reach out to
a wide set of potential syndication partners, it is more likely that a future co-investor will

display a high level of affinity with the original investor. Finally, entrepreneurs may prefer to

work with a diverse group of venture capitalists in order to reduce the likelihood of investors
colluding and making decisions not in the interests of entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs of inferior

portfolio companies have considerably less bargaining power in terms of which venture

capitalists to bring aboard. Accordingly, the underperformance of deals on which high affinity

venture capitalists are among co-investors may also be explained by the inability of

entrepreneurs of low quality portfolio companies to push for a more diverse group of investors.

       On the other hand, the negative effect of affinity may be due to treatment effects after

the investment was made. The dark side of homophily can lead to poor decision-making by

inducing social conformity and groupthink.      In contrast, differences in knowledge, skills, and

perspectives among team members may enhance creativity and innovation and elicit a

multiplicity of views, adding dimensions to problem-solving and decision-making processes as

well as eventually improving performance (William and O’Reilly, 1998; Jehn, et al., 1999).


                                                20
Venture capital investors provide significant value-add to their portfolio companies beyond the

supply of capital. Post-investment, they make important decisions and offer invaluable advice

on a variety of issues: hiring and firing the CEO, the senior management team, and the board of

directors; identifying customers or partnering opportunities; and devising a viable overall

strategy, all of which are critical to moving the venture forward along the path to success.

Thus, any inefficient decision-making post investment induced by homophily among high-

affinity venture capitalists will negatively impact the success of the portfolio company they

oversee.   In other words, the lower likelihood of success of co-investments between venture

capitalists that share similar characteristics is triggered by their making inefficient decisions or

even mistakes that they would otherwise avoid with more diverse boards.

        Although similar in terms of empirical effects, the selection and treatment effects

explanations have different welfare implications. According to the selection story, the success of

a portfolio company is independent of the composition of the venture capital team once the

investment is made. As long as investors act rationally, i.e., all investments have nonnegative
ex ante expected returns, there is no efficiency loss post investment.         Potential losses are

incurred if some deals undertaken would not have been financed absent the affinity between co-

investors or if high-affinity deals crowd out better deals that should have been financed instead.

In the treatment story, however, the investment outcome is affected by whether syndication

partners exhibit high homophily or not.      To this end, there is scope for greater efficiency if

venture capitalists become more cautious in choosing to collaborate with investors possessing

similar traits.

        It is clearly possible that both mechanisms take place in practice, and it is not entirely

obvious which effect contributes more to the empirical biases that we document. In the tests

that follow, we try to disentangle selection versus treatment effects. First, we show that our

results are robust to controlling for quality-related characteristics of portfolio companies known

to venture capitalists at the time of financing. The treatment story should be identifiable using

the right set of ex ante quality observables, allowing us to estimate the causal effect of affinity

in the reduced form regressions. Second, we instrument for the level of pairwise affinity between

a syndicate of venture capitalists involved in a deal with the level of affinity among their


                                                21
respective colleagues not involved in the deal under consideration and refer to this measure as

the cross-firm affinity.   The structural form results support the treatment effect story.       The

direct analysis of the treatment effect would require us to study how decisions made by or the

amount of effort exerted by venture capitalists differ depending on the composition of the

investment team. This information is hard to document, let alone quantify, because of the tacit

nature of venture capitalists’ production function. The robustness of results to adding portfolio

company controls and to instrumenting for the affinity measure makes us confident that the

composition of the syndicate is an important causal driver of the ultimate investment success.

At the same time, the selection story cannot be ruled out; instead we also find evidence–both

indirect and direct–for its existence. The reduction in the magnitudes of point estimates on

the affinity score following the inclusion of portfolio company controls indicates that

approximately 17% of the negative effect of affinity stems from the fact that high affinity

syndicates choose to work on deals inferior at consummation, whereas the remaining 83% is due

to the detrimental nature of affinity post-investment. We confirm that venture capitalists that
display high levels of mutual affinity do indeed invest into portfolio companies of lower potential

investment success by constructing the measure of ex ante deal quality and showing that it is

negatively related to the affinity score. The economic effect of this bias, however, is small.

       We also use the Heckman (1979) two-stage procedure to address sample selectivity issues.

Model identification comes from the variation in the co-investment frequency between VC firms.

For every syndication between individual venture capitalists–actual and counterfactual–we

calculate the number of past syndications between their two respective venture capital firms.

These co-investments may include partnerships between one of the venture capitalists in the

pair under consideration and colleagues of the other VC in a given dyad or joint deals

undertaken by their colleagues without either of the investors in a pair being involved. Since we

are examining exclusively the first syndications between individual venture capitalists, their past

collaboration history is non-existent by construction. The co-investment frequency (e.g., over

the previous 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years) between two firms is a strong predictor of whether

individual investors from these firms choose to partner on a deal. It is not, however, related to




                                                 22
the investment outcome.21 The inclusion and exclusion restrictions hold, and hence, the variable

is a valid instrument to be used in the Heckman selection equation from which the inverse Mills
ratio is computed. Including the inverse Mills ratio computed from the selection equation as an

additional explanatory variable into the pairwise investment success model does not affect the

qualitative nature of results reported in Table 5. This suggests that the biases we document are

not driven by the sample selectivity.

        We present two sets of results in Table 8. First, we establish the economic significance

of ex ante characteristics of portfolio companies in predicting their ultimate performance

(Panel A). Second, we document that the cost of affinity is robust to accounting for portfolio

company controls in explaining the investment success of a syndicate (Panel B).

        Panel A of Table 8 reports marginal effects on the investment success probability of each
of the portfolio company characteristics measured at the time of financing. The dependent

variable is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the entrepreneurial firm eventually conducts an IPO.

The estimations are based on probit regressions with industry, year, and venture capital firm

fixed effects. In Column 1 of Panel A, we focus on whether the portfolio company was founded

by serial entrepreneurs by tracking the careers of founders and identifying those who had

already established a venture capital-backed business. An entrepreneur with a track record of
success is more likely to succeed that a first time entrepreneur (Gompers et al., 2010).              In

Columns 2 and 3, we examine the stage (e.g., Startup/Seed, Early Stage, Expansion, Later

Stage, and Buyout/Acquisition) at the time of fundraising and the financing round, respectively,

keeping in mind that earlier stages and rounds involve more risks and hence are less likely to

result in a successful outcome. Last, we account for the amount of attention that the media

paid to the portfolio company at the time of investment in Column 4. Deals that receive more

media presence prior to the first venture capital investment are ultimately more successful. We

use Dow Jones Factiva to identify portfolio companies which had news stories about them
released at the time of financing or just prior to it. Specifically, we search for publications with

the portfolio company name and the phrase “venture capital” in the time frame from six months

21
  Frequent syndications between two firms over a long period of time in the past (e.g., 3 years or more)
make it more likely that individual venture capitalists from these firms will be more successful. This is
consistent with the idea that long-term partnerships are likely to be backed by superior performance.

before the investment until one month after.22 We then separate the investments into three

groups, those with no media coverage, those with moderate media coverage, and those with high
media coverage, and include two dummy variables, Moderate Media Coverage and High Media

Coverage, as independent variables in Column 4.23 All these variables display statistical and

economic significance in predicting the future investment outcome, separately as well as jointly
(as indicated in Column 5 when all the factors are included at once).                 Having a serial

entrepreneur as a founder, for example, increases the likelihood of the portfolio company going

public by 3.8 percentage points from the unconditional IPO probability of 17.7%. Similarly,

compared with portfolio companies with no media coverage at the time of investment, portfolio

companies with moderate and high media coverage are significantly more likely to eventually be

successful. Overall, results in Panel A demonstrate that these characteristics are good indicators

of the ex ante quality of portfolio companies.

       Panel B of Table 8 shows that the detrimental effect of affinity is not driven by the

selection of high-affinity syndicates into inferior deals based on observable characteristics of
portfolio companies discussed in Panel A.        The point estimate on the affinity score remains

negative, highly statistically and economically significant across all specifications.             The

corresponding marginal effect’s absolute value goes down by 17% from 0.237 to 0.197 following

the inclusion of portfolio company controls. This suggests that the relative contribution of the

treatment effect and the selection effect to the cost of affinity is roughly 83/17. On one hand,

this observation may be interpreted as indirect evidence for the selection story–the bias has

been eliminated following the inclusion of additional controls correlated with the treatment. On

the other hand, and most importantly, the reduction in magnitude of the affinity’s marginal

effect by only 0.040 from 0.237 following the inclusion of objective fundamental controls–highly

significant in explaining the future investment outcome–indicates that the major portion of the

negative side of affinity stems from the post-investment actions of the syndicate as opposed to

the deal selection patterns. Naturally, real investment decisions are made based on a much

richer information set, which includes unobservable attributes of portfolio companies as well.

We use the instrumental variable approach to address endogeneity at this level.

       The instrumental variable used to account for the endogeneity between the level of

affinity in a syndicate and the underlying quality of a deal is the cross-firm affinity score. It can

be thought of as the degree to which employees of two firms–excluding people involved in a

deal under consideration–are similar to each other. The measure is constructed in three steps.

First, for every employee of one firm–not staffed on that deal–we compute affinity scores vis-

à-vis every employee of another firm–not staffed on that deal. Second, we take an average of

the scores by person, which gives us the extent to which a venture capitalist of one firm is

similar to a group of people working at another firm. Third and last, we average out these

individual similarity measures by firm and arrive at the cross-firm affinity score.24 Gompers et

al. (2012) show that new hires into venture capital firms tend to be very similar to VC partners

active at the time of their recruitment. This suggests that every employee should exhibit a high
level of affinity with other people working at a firm even if they are not involved in the same

deals. Since the cross-firm affinity score does not take into account people who participate in

the selection or execution of a deal under consideration, the measure cannot be directly related

to the ultimate performance of the portfolio company as well as to the ex ante quality of the

investment opportunity. These two facts hold in data and justify the use of this variable as an

instrument for the pairwise affinity measure.          The ability score is subject to the same

endogeneity concerns as the affinity score–high ability syndicates may choose to invest into

deals of superior quality at the time of financing.      We instrument for it with the cross-firm

ability score constructed in a similar way based on the above-mentioned procedure.
       Table 9 presents the estimates obtained using the two-stage least squares method.

Reported in Panel A, structural form equations show that controlling for the endogenous

determination of a syndicate’s affinity level does not change the conclusion that greater

similarity between co-investment partners is associated with lower success rates.          The TSLS


24
  Using the maximum operator instead of the average in computing the cross-firm affinity score leads to
results similar both qualitatively and quantitatively.

                                                  25
point estimates on the affinity score are negative and highly statistically significant across all

specifications. The increase in absolute values and standard errors of estimates on the affinity

coefficient compared to probit (Panel B of Table 8) and OLS (unreported) may be driven by the

noisiness of the instrument and heterogeneous effects. Interestingly, the opposite holds for the

ability score. Since the TSLS point estimate on the ability score is not statistically significant,

it might be the case that the positive reduced form relationship between the deal’s success and

the ability score is explained by the selection of high ability co-investment partners into

portfolio companies of ex ante superior quality.          Our confidence in the implemented IV

approach is supported by the first stage estimates reported in Panel B of Table 9.            Each

instrument displays significant statistical power in predicting the endogenous variable of interest;

the F-statistics on the excluded instruments are very large. The weakness of the selection story

is confirmed by the fact that none of the observable portfolio company characteristics prove to

be significant determinants of the syndicate’s level of affinity.

       Table 10 provides additional evidence in favor of the treatment story.           Using the
estimates from Panel A of Table 8, we construct the predicted probability of success for each

investment as the summary measure for the ex ante investment quality.             We interact the

affinity score with high (low) investment quality dummies–equal to one if the investment

quality is above (below) the median investment quality of all deals in that year–and show that

the cost of affinity is most pronounced on deals which did have a high level of investment

appeal at the time of financing. This strongly suggests that the post-investment developments

are more important to the detrimental nature of affinity than the selection story which argues

that high-affinity syndicates choose to pursue low-quality investment opportunities.

       Having documented direct evidence of the strong treatment effect, we cannot rule out

the selection story. The following tests show that venture capitalists with common traits do

indeed syndicate on deals with lower investment appeal. This effect, however, is by no means a

significant driver of the biases we document; the post-investment behavior of venture capitalists

with similar characteristics is the ultimate source of the cost of affinity.

       Results of the Heckman two-stage procedure are reported in Table 11. The selection

equation (1) uses the number of syndications between two venture capital firms within 6 months


                                                  26
prior to a given syndication between a pair of individual investors as an instrument. Recent

collaborations between two firms make it much more likely that venture capitalists from these

firms will decide to partner on a deal. The fraction of counterfactual pairs of VCs that work at

firms with joint syndications in the preceding 6 months is under 5%, whereas around 16% of

actual pairs come from firms that do have recent co-investment history.            The number of

syndications by two VC firms in the past 6 months is uninformative with respect to investment

success of joint deals. Adding the instrument as an explanatory variable into the syndication

success regressions does not produce a significant coefficient and does not change the

magnitudes or significance of other estimates (unreported specification). Finally, we add the

Inverse Mills Ratio generated from the selection equation as an independent variable into the

success regressions (4) and obtain a negative point estimate on it. This suggests that there is

negative correlation between the residuals in the selection and outcome equations; pairs of VCs

that are more likely to work together have lower success potential. This supports the selection

story. However, since none of the values of coefficients change, the slight sample selectivity
cannot be responsible for the biases we document.

       We also use an additional strategy to identify the selection effect.      According to the

selection story, venture capitalists with high affinity co-invest in portfolio companies that are of

low quality already at the time of financing.     A confirmation of this hypothesis in the data

would be a negative relationship between the syndicate’s affinity level and the ex ante quality of

investment. We do find evidence of mild selection by examining the relationship between the ex

ante quality of investment and the syndicate’s affinity level.      Regression results reported in

Table 12 demonstrate that the affinity score is indeed negatively related to the probability of

the portfolio company to go public assessed at the time of financing.            In spite of being

statistically significant, point estimates do not bear remarkable economic importance.          For

example, increasing the affinity score of a given syndicate by adding a weak social tie between

venture capitalists (i.e., allowing them to have gone to the same college, graduate school or

business school or have worked at the same company in the past or to belong to the same ethnic

minority group) reduces the ex ante quality of investment by less than 1 percentage point from

the average value of 18—20% depending on the specification. In contrast, as follows from Panel


                                                27
B of Table 8, controlling for the investment attractiveness of the portfolio company at the time

of financing, a one-step increase in the affinity score lowers the chances of a portfolio company

to eventually go public by 2.5 percentage points from the unconditional average of 21.0%. This

suggests that the selection effect, albeit present, is not an economically significant driver of the

cost of affinity compared to the treatment effect. This finding is consistent with the results of

the Heckman two-stage procedure.          In addition, we examine the deals that successfully

conducted IPOs within six months (or one year) of investment as another proxy for ex ante

quality and find no significant relationship between ex ante quality and affinity (unreported).

Furthermore, we examine syndicates in which both venture capitalists join at the same time

versus syndicates consisting of one founding investor and one follow-on investor and find no

evidence that the latter exhibit higher levels of affinity.

       We document the presence of both treatment and selection effects in the data. A variety

of tests discussed in this section–introducing a range of portfolio company controls, accounting

for the endogeneity using the instrumental variable approach, applying the Heckman two-stage
procedure to adjust the results for sample selectivity, and demonstrating that the affinity is

most detrimental on deals of highest quality at the time of financing–make us confident that

the contribution of the selection effect to the empirical biases documented in the paper is at

most weak. The treatment effect post-investment is the key channel through which the mutual

affinity of venture capitalists involved in a deal affects ultimate investment success.


                                           5. Conclusion

       Collaborative behavior between people is of great importance in different spheres of life.

We engage in brainstorming discussions with our colleagues at work to find an optimal solution

to a business problem. Companies we work at form partnerships with other firms to develop

creative products and enhance joint productivity. Our children form study groups with their

classmates to learn the material better.      Our countries collaborate with other nations upon

security and environmental issues. Living in a globalized world, we face great opportunities not

only in terms of what to work on, but also with whom to cooperate. The growth in the number

of projects that are being done in a team rather than individually makes it increasingly


                                                  28
important to understand the following questions. First, what personal characteristics are taken

into account when people select their working partners? Second, how does the influence of these

personal characteristics on the team composition affect performance?            We use the venture

capital syndication setting to answer these questions.

        Conducting the analysis at the individual venture capitalist level with a dataset most

comprehensive of its kind to date, we establish a distinction between personal characteristics

which affect individual performance and those which do not.            Ability-related characteristics

include ranks of academic institutions which an individual graduated from. Holders of degrees–

undergraduate, graduate, and MBA–from top universities are more likely to make successful

investments. Personal characteristics not related to success and ability–after controlling for

past performance–include ethnicity and gender.

        Consistent with the homophily literature, we conclude that investors who share similar

characteristics with each other are more likely to co-invest together. This finding applies to

both ability- and affinity-related pairwise characteristics. For example, top university degree
holders–highly able investors–are 8.5% more likely to work together at least once. Venture

capitalists exhibit an even stronger attraction to each other based on affinity-related

characteristics.   Graduates of the same university–not necessarily with the same type of

degree–are 20.5% more likely to co-invest with each other. Furthermore, being part of the

same ethnic minority group increases the probability of cooperation between two venture

capitalists by 22.8%.

        The real effects of these biases are not unidirectional. On one hand, syndication based

on top ability characteristics improves performance of a group. On the other hand, investment

teams that exhibit a high extent of similarity between members over characteristics not related

to ability are less likely to succeed. The adverse effect of affinity based on prior employment,

educational background or ethnicity is economically and statistically significant, in some cases

lowering the probability of investment success by 25%. A variety of tests show that the cost of

affinity is not driven by selection into inferior deals; the effect is most likely attributable to poor

decision-making by high-affinity syndicates post investment.            We also find that venture

capitalists who collaborate most frequently with each other are precisely those who have a lot of


                                                  29
affinity-related characteristics in common.        In such groups, people partner because they

associate with each other, they share a bond, and perhaps they are even friends.
        Our conclusion is that, to paraphrase Ralph Waldo Emerson, you cannot afford to be

stupid with old friends when you are venture capitalists co-investing together.25

This table reports marginal effects of probit regressions for the probability of success of an investment
made by a venture capitalist. The dependent variable is a dummy variable that takes the value of one if
the investment is successful and zero otherwise. Independent variables are success and personal
(education, ethnicity, and gender) characteristics of a venture capitalist. Performance is the venture
capitalist’s success ratio up to the current deal. Top College, Top Business School, Top Grad School and
Top School are dummy variables which take the value of one if a venture capitalist holds, respectively, an
undergraduate, business, graduate or any degree from a top university and zero otherwise. Ethnic

                                   Syndication Partnering Decision
This table reports marginal effects of probit regressions for the probability of a venture capitalist to
partner with another venture capitalist based on a set of observable characteristics. The dependent
variable is a dummy variable equal to one if the syndication between two investors takes place (actual
pairs) and zero otherwise (counterfactual). Independent variables are pairwise personal characteristics
(education, ethnicity, career and gender) of a dyad of venture capitalists. Both Top College, Both Top
Business School, Both Top Grad School and Both Top School are dummy variables which take the value
of one if both venture capitalists in a pair hold, respectively, undergraduate, business, graduate or any
degrees from a top university and zero otherwise. Same School equals one if venture capitalists attended
the same academic institution and zero otherwise. Same College, Same Business School and Same Grad
School are defined similarly with a restriction on the type of degree obtained. Same Ethnic Minority
equals one if venture capitalists are both part of the same ethnic minority and zero otherwise. Same
Previous Employer is a dummy variable equal to one if two venture capitalists worked at the same
company before entering the venture capital industry and zero otherwise. Same Location is a dummy
equal to one if venture capitalists’ firms have offices in the same Combined Statistical Area. Portfolio
company’s industry and year of co-investment fixed effects are included in all specifications. Robust
standard errors clustered at the portfolio company level are reported in brackets. Asterisks denote
statistical significance at the 1% (***), 5% (**), or 10% (*) level.

                             Investment Success: Pairwise Characteristics
This table reports marginal effects of probit regressions for the probability of investment success by a pair
of venture capitalists. The dependent variable equals one if the investment is successful and zero
otherwise. Independent variables are pairwise personal characteristics (education, ethnicity, career, and
gender) of a dyad of venture capitalists. Variables with the classifier at least one (both) take the value of
one if at least one (both) individual(s) in a pair has (have) a specific attribute and zero otherwise. Same
Previous Employer is a dummy variable which equals one if venture capitalists in a dyad worked at the
same company. Same Location takes a value of one if the two venture capitalists’ firms are located in the
same CSA. Portfolio company’s industry and year of co-investment fixed effects are included in all
specifications. Robust standard errors clustered at the portfolio company level are reported in brackets.
Asterisks denote statistical significance at the 1% (***), 5% (**), or 10% (*) level.

                        Ability and Affinity Scores: Repeated Collaborations
This table reports the results of Poisson regressions for the number of co-investments a pair of venture
capitalists made together. Columns 1 and 3 present the results of the analysis over both actual (positive
number of co-investments) and counterfactual (no co-investments) pairs; Columns 2 and 4 focuses
exclusively on actual pairs. The ability score is the simple average of pairwise ability characteristics
(Top College (Business School, Grad School, School): Both) in Columns 1 and 2 and the weighted average
of pairwise ability characteristics in Columns 3 and 4 where the weights are coefficients from the
syndication partnering decision model reported in Table 4. The affinity score is defined similarly over the

(Indian, Jewish): Both, Same Ethnic Minority, Female: Both, and Same Previous Employer), with simple
averages in Columns 1 and 2 and weighted averages in Columns 3 and 4. Ability and affinity scores are
computed based on specification 7 from Table 4 (results based on specification 8 from Table 4 are both
qualitatively and quantitatively similar). Portfolio company’s industry and year of co-investment fixed

This figure presents the average values of ability and affinity scores for pairs of venture capitalists
grouped by the number of co-investments they make together. Counterfactual pairs of venture capitalists
partnered on no investments by construction; actual pairs of venture capitalists participated on at least
one joint deal. The ability score is the simple average of pairwise ability characteristics (Top College
(Business School, Grad School, School): Both). The affinity score is defined similarly over the set of
pairwise affinity characteristics (Same College (Business School, Grad School, School), East Asian (Indian,
Jewish): Both, Same Ethnic Minority, Female: Both, and Same Previous Employer). Ability and affinity
scores are computed based on specification 7 from Table 4 (results based on specification 8 from Table 4
are both qualitatively and quantitatively similar).

Results presented in this table show that the detrimental effect of affinity on investment success is robust
to accounting for the characteristics of a portfolio company–measured at the time of investment–that
strongly predict future investment outcome. Each panel reports robust standard errors clustered at the
portfolio company level in brackets. Asterisks denote statistical significance at the 1% (***), 5% (**), or
10% (*) level.

Panel A. This panel reports OLS estimates for the probability of success of an investment made by an
individual venture capitalist. The dependent variable equals one if the portfolio company eventually goes
public and zero otherwise. Independent variables are characteristics of a portfolio company at the time of
investment. Serial entrepreneur is a dummy equal to one if the founder of a portfolio company had
previously founded another venture-backed company. Portfolio Company Stage is a variable with integer
values from 1 to 5 corresponding to start-up/seed, early stage, later stage, expansion, and
buyout/acquisition, respectively. Financing Round indicates the round at which the investment was
made into the portfolio company. Moderate (High) Media Coverage is a dummy variable that equals one
if the number of news articles covering the investment is greater than zero and is below (above) the
median number of news articles for investments covered by at least one news article in that year.
Industry, year of investment, and venture capital firm fixed effects are included in all specifications.

This table reports estimates of OLS regressions for the probability of investment success by a pair of
venture capitalists. Affinity Score is the simple average of pairwise affinity characteristics: Same
College/Business School/Grad School, East Asian/Indian/Jewish: Both, Female: Both, and Same
Previous Employer. Investment Quality is the investment appeal of a portfolio company at the time of
financing. It is defined as the probability of an IPO predicted by the corresponding model in Panel A of
Table 8 (specifications are matched column-to-column). High (Low) Investment Quality is a dummy
variable that equals one if the Investment Quality of a deal is above (below) the median investment
quality of all deals in that year. Portfolio company’s industry and year of co-investment fixed effects are
included in all specifications. Robust standard errors clustered at the portfolio company level are
reported in brackets. Asterisks denote statistical significance at the 1% (***), 5% (**), or 10% (*) level.

                                      Heckman Two-Stage Procedure
This table presents the results of the Heckman two-stage model. The dependent variable in the selection
equation (1) equals one if a pair of individual venture capitalists syndicate on a deal and zero otherwise.
The dependent variable in the syndication success regressions (2—7) is a dummy equal to one if a portfolio
company goes public. Number of Syndications between VC Firms is an instrument in the selection
equation; it is equal to the number of co-investments between two venture capital firms within 6 months
prior to a given syndication between a pair of individual VCs. The Inverse Mills Ratio is generated from
the selection equation. Portfolio company’s industry and year of co-investment fixed effects are included
in all specifications. Robust standard errors clustered at the portfolio company level are reported in
brackets. Asterisks denote statistical significance at the 1% (***), 5% (**), or 10% (*) level.

This table contrasts the investment performance of venture capitalists’ with a degree from a top academic
institution and those who did not attend a top university. We consider three different classifications of
top schools. Column 1 presents summary statistics for only the Ivy League schools–Brown University,
Columbia University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, Harvard University, Princeton University,
University of Pennsylvania, and Yale University–classified as top schools. Column 2 adds other Top U.S.
schools–Amherst College, California Institute of Technology, Duke University, Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, Northwestern University, Stanford University, University of California (Berkeley), University
of Chicago, and Williams College–in the classification. Top European schools–Cambridge University,
INSEAD, London Business School, London School of Economics, and Oxford University–are added to
the list in Column 3.
