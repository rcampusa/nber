The Polarization of Reality

                                         ABSTRACT

Americans are polarized not only in their views on policy issues and attitudes towards
government and society, but also in their perceptions of the same factual reality. We
conceptualize how to think about the "polarization of reality" and review recent papers that show
that Republicans and Democrats view the same reality through a different lens. Perhaps, as a
result, they hold different views about policies and what should be done to address economic and
social issues. We also show that providing information leads to different reassessments of reality
and different responses along the policy support margin, depending on one's political leaning.
